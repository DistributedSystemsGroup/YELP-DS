YELP-DS
=======

Semester project on the YELP dataset (https://www.yelp.com/dataset_challenge/dataset)

Basic set-up:
If you want to run this code, you need install scikit-learn (http://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html) library.

Tips: Building scikit-learn with pip (This is usually the fastest way to install or upgrade to the latest stable release):
    pip install --user --install-option="--prefix=" -U scikit-learn

Scikit-learn requires Numpy & Scipy, you must have both of them installed before installing scikit-learn. You can install these modules by:  
  $ sudo apt-get install python-numpy  
  $ sudo apt-get install python-scipy
