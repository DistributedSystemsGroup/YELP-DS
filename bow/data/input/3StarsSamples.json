Ate breakfast here today; overall a really good atmosphere and some tasty items on the menu.  I would recommend their Wiggies, a hodgepodge of hash browns, cheese, green peppers, diced ham, and mushrooms. I topped it off with a mimosa and
then my gf and I strolled out onto their dock and enjoyed some lakeside scene.Food: It's overall pretty good and probably one of the more reliable options for semi-authentic Chinese food in the Madison area.  To this Asian, there is definitely some catering to Western palates.  Definitely a step down if you're used to eating at, say, Chicago's Chinatown (both old and new sections), and there's no extra menu in Chinese with the more eclectic stuff.  Fresh seafood options very limited.

Service: Average.  Food comes in a reasonable time, though refiling the water sometimes is spotty.

Value: Reasonable overall.  Prices fit the portions. Most entrees $9-15 range.

Overall: Good for when you crave Chinese, but I'd still head to Chicago for the more authentic stuff.Had a reservation at 7:15pm but when we arrived we were told we needed to wait 15 mins. That was annoying because that defeats the purpose of making a reservation. After that they found us a tiny table next to two large tables. The atmosphere was loud and cramped. 

The food however was great. I had the Bouillabaisse which felt like something from Louisiana because it had a thick earthy and spicy base. The seafood was fresh and it came with homemade fettuccine.  

If the atmosphere had been better I would make myself a regular.Good food but totally overpriced.Again... not a fan of Copps, in general. This one seems a bit older and a bit more in need of a facelift, but it's not bad. Wide aisles, plenty of check outs, and decent produce. 

Prices are typically higher than Woodman's, but Copps allows the use of credit cards (or using your debit card as a credit card, which I do because my bank gives me 5% cashback when I do).

Bakery items are usually stellar - especially the chocolate donuts. ;-)It's old.  It's small.  The staff was attentive.  Food showed up quick and tasted like IHOP food.I like it here, but I don't love it. Nothing really stands out to me, although my friend swears by the meatloaf (I refuse to order meatloaf in a restaurant). I will continue to got back, but I won't go out of my way.I am a huge fan of spicy food and this stuff knocked my socks off. If you aren't as adventurous with your spices (or just don't want your tongue to die) simply ask them to make it mild. 

All in all super yummy, will def be back. Oh and you have to try the thai iced tea. Its mental how good it is.

I gave it 3 stars because I don't want to throw around stars and save them for those rare AWESOME moments when food knocks my socks off :D

Enjoy!Driving down Central the other day I got the munchies mid morning.  I got a croissant sandwich.  The palce was clean, the service was pleasant, and my sandwich was cooked fresh.Steer clear if you care about your body, enter if you are looking for a tasty way to shave precious years of your life.  What they have done is basically take a simple New York style Deli concept and made it appealing to the local Phoenix crowd.  The thing is, when I was living in NYC, I could afford to eat meals like this because without a car I walked an average of 3-5 miles per day.  There is simply no excuse for this type of excess in a driving city like Phoenix.  You'll spend 2 hours at the gym to burn off lunch here.  My prediction is that 50 years from now, when all the patrons of this place have died of heart attacks, the next generation will look back on this food the same way we look back on asbestos: it seemed like a good idea at the time, but boy was it a killer.Zoe's Kitchen is good, but that's all I can say about it. I would happily go back for another meal, but it is never my first choice. The food is tasty, but nothing extraordinary. I don't want my review to sound negative - because I've never had a bad experience at Zoe's; it just isn't worth more than 3 stars.This is a nice spot to go if you're in downtown, but I can't call it a destination. It offers several restaurant options, which I haven't tried (but some are on my to-do list) and some shopping. The majority of the shops are tourist-oriented, which makes sense considering the Sheraton, Hyatt and Convention Center are within a couple blocks. The theater is clean, and it's nice that it's less crowded than those in the suburban strip malls. It has nice landscaping and it's great to have green space downtown, considering Phoenix could use some open public space (plazas, parks, etc.) in this area. However, the park is a bit secluded within the Arizona Center, which makes it a bit less inviting, but there are waterfalls and shade that keep the outdoor temperatures cooler in that area. That being said, there isn't too much for local appeal and overall it's good as a stop if you're spending a lot of time downtown. 

If you want to save on parking and don't mind the walking distance, there is a free lot on Central/McKinley northwest of the Arizona Center (and just northeast of the Westward Ho Building) ...that is, for now. It isn't a tremendous walking distance, however.Food is okay but nothing amazing. We had the huge hot dog
Atmosphere and service are okay. So nothing special but hey it's Alice Cooper, my wife didnt even know him !Came here just for a HH drink.  We had all had lunch & weren't hungry.  I'll come back when I am.  Cute names on the menu for their food items.  I was tempted by a lot it.  The local IPA was perfect.  Santan I believe was the name.  Feel sorry for all the staff who have to paint the black marks under their eyes.I was sort of expecting more from this. The food is decidedly average sports bar food, not really anything special. Plus, the side dishes are weird. Mandarin Oranges and apple slices don't really belong next to a burger, in my opinion. Still, it was a good enough meal, the waitress was super friendly and I highly recommend the Michael Buble drink, just drink with caution, it's strong!Whipped in here today for a first visit to this Whataburger & second visit to ANY Whataburger, ever.  (They're not in California, where I'm from.)

I ordered the Green Chili Double Cheeseburger Combo that is currently being advertised on TV, upgrading from a soda to a chocolate malt.  Here's how it went...

THE GOOD:

*  Nice dining room with comfortable booths.

*  Awesome service from the friendly and attentive staff!

*  They have MALTS!  Yeah malts!     :-))

*  The fries were ok.

= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =

THE NOT-SO-GOOD:

*  It was COLD in the dining room!

*  The heralded Green Chili Double Cheeseburger was a disappointment.  The diced chilis were so mild as to be nearly tasteless, and the burger patties were blah too.  This burger was nowhere as good as a similarly priced one at either Smashburger or Five Guys, for example,or a Double Double at In-N-Out for much less.     :-O

*  The malt was ok, but not as good as the ones at Smashburger.

All in all?  3 Stars, barely.     :-|

Green Chili Double, Medium Fries, Small Chocolate Malt:  $8.14 + tax.Is it normal for "Thai-style chicken" to look like pineapple? 

Just got back from lunch with my co-worker.  It was nearby, had decent reviews and I wanted Chinese. My co-worker, whose Chinese, jumped at the opportunity to go to a new place for lunch nearby since she usually only goes to places her friends recommend.  Overall - it was ok-good. Staff was friendly - suggested what I try. Co-Worker (CW) was excited about the Thai menu. She'd been talking about Hot & Sour soup and hasn't found any in PHX she likes except one place in the far away land of Chandler (compared to West PHX). 

HOneslty, she seemed a little disappointed in the food. Hot & Sour soup (from the Chinese menu, not the Thai H&S) was sour, but not hot. She had me try, and I'm no hot & sour judge, but it had some funky (read: not good) taste to it. They brought a wonton and egg roll with her #7 Thai combo (can't remember what it was called). Both were overfried. She mentioned it's like it was fried then refried. HOWEVER, the insides of the egg roll were quite tasty. Wonton- not so much. Corn soup came with my #1 Pad Thai lunch special...it was broth with corn. Very simple. I suppose I expected a little more but it was exactly what they said, corn soup. I should have gotten a salad. 

Moving on to the actual lunch. Pad Thai, I've never had much Thai food and I enjoyed this quite a bit. Now I can't compare this to anything else so it's just my taste buds talking. Is it normal for the chicken to look like pineapple? That threw me off - it was cubed and had a yellow-ish tint. It was very soft too - gave me a weird I like/don't like feeling. But i continued to eat and overall, I liked it. 

My CW got the #7 Thai special that came in a bowl. Had lots of veggies, chicken in some creamy spicy sauce. She had me try the sauce and it was pretty good (I wish I had taken more to put on my meal from her bowl when she offered). I'm not so sure she enjoyed the place as much and I'm not surprised. At the end of our meal she mentioned she'd like to find a "really good" Chinese place to take us to and was going to talk to her friends. 

I wouldn't mind going back to try the Chinese menu - they have a huge selection and it's nearby, a great price for lunch, not busy and pretty friendly.items are nicely arranged but prices are too high!After hearing numerous things about MacAlpine's from friends and other Yelpers, my boyfriend and I decided to pop in.

We both ordered the Toasted Cheese Sandwich (grilled cheese w/ 3 types of cheese) and I was really disappointed with it. Mostly because I was expecting fries as a side and they don't serve them but also because the cheese was not the least bit melted. When I bit into my sandwich I expected strands of hot, gooey cheese to stretch in front of my face but instead I opened up my sandwich to find 3 slices of cheese barely stuck together and still in perfect squares. Buuuut I'm not really one to complain. I ate what I could and asked myself what I really expected. After all, it's only a grilled cheese. And that's not what MacAlpine's is known for...

They're known for their sodas. Which are everything they're made out to be. After much deliberation,  I ordered the Nutty Professor Ice Cream soda (Pistachio ice cream w/ Amaretto soda) and it was delicious! I'll definitely be back to try the Red Velvet Soda. And maybe the Parisian ice cream soda. Or maybe just the entire dessert menu.

Perhaps my favorite part of our visit was the thrift/antique store. They have an amazing selection of treasures. I spent $50 on old photos for my assemblage art and wished I had won the lottery so I could afford all the vintage cameras, shoes, toys, and lamps. Definitely a little pricey in some areas but justly so. The owner doesn't mess around when selecting pieces for the shop.My aunt and uncle were in town for my graduation and got into town looking for something to do so we went to Spiked at DBG. (http://www.dbg.org/index.php/plan/calendar/spikedspring)  

The event was a cool setup you pay to get in $25 a person.  Then you get all you can eat food and you can tour the gardens at night.  They have alcohol at the event and it is pay per drink.  The prices weren't too bad pretty typical drink prices for being out.  

The gardens at night offer a different experience then the daytime there are several cactus flowers that bloom at night.  Plus as the temperature rises it's nice to have events in the evening.Overall, the museum itself is great and my 3 year old loves it but the woman working there is always RUDE and the toys in the kids area are FILTHY. The place is usually pretty empty other than a few toddler/preschool age kids and maybe one or two adults roaming around. I definitely think the kids are keeping this place open so maybe they should take that into consideration at the front desk and when it comes to cleanliness. (Seriously, it's disgusting. I'm worried we're going to come home with hepatitis one of these days.)The inside is very Hispanic, the food not so much. Not to say that is not good. But not authentic. It has a good flavor, but is pretty generic Mexican food. Now the Margaritas are wonderful!!!! I usually don't drink more then one but at this place you just can't help yourself. I like fruity girlie drinks, where you don't taste the liquor you just feel the affect. This is exactly what I want. Uno Mas, the water is no longer needed!Considering it's not much more than a lunch room for the surrounding offices, it's really not bad. Most of the sandwiches I've had there have been ok experiences. The service is quick.  

I've noticed that they sometimes will spoil an otherwise really good dining experience by doing something like leaving pits in certain olives that appeared to be without pits. Or some of the cole slaw will be wilted. Or the shell in the clam chowder mentioned earlier. I don't consider these events fatal flaws, but y'know . . . come on. . . . a little more effort.

I don't like how the line is laid-out. The path from ordering and paying to picking up your food and drink is convoluted and annoying. They could improve their flow and ergonomics and make take away some of the anxiety I feel before going there--and thus I might go there more frequently.do not get their coffee. ive never tasted anything worse. otherwise, their tacos are great.24 hour fedex and copy location. Visited for a package delivery and cost $13 to ship a book and cd. If these items weren't personalized with a message to the recipient, I would have just shipped new items from amazon and it would have been the same or cheaper. Yes, that was the cheapest 7 day shipping possible :(

I can say that the items did arrive without any significant incidents or events.

They are also a Kinkos copy center to make copies of stuff and purchase office supplies. If you need this stuff late night, they're open and waiting for you.The Good Egg has reasonable food. It isn't amazing, but it's not bad. Prices are pretty reasonable, too.

This location has lots of parking since it's in a shopping strip. Inside, the decor is a little dated, but I think that's a common theme for breakfast restaurants. The manager is very friendly and attentive; I think some of the servers should take a cue from him and try to do the same.

French toast are big, loaded with cinnamon, and tasty. Bacon is nothing extraordinary. Veggie omelet is a reasonably good, healthy option. I like the breakfast potatoes, even if they are a bit plain.

This isn't my first choice for brunch, but it's a pretty good, simple backup.Katz Deli is indeed closed -- but the space will become a second Postino location.Its a cute atmosphere, food was alright, nothing spectacular.  I'm not a beer drinker, so I can't speak for the brews.

Parking leaves a bit to be desired, but for as full as the lot was, there were plenty of tables inside.

A nice brewhouse in central Phoenix if you aren't in the mood for driving out to one of the Four Peaks.Average beer... Great food.Eatable but nothing special . Pizza was ok .Earlier this month I was in Phoenix visiting my brother-in-law.  In trying to find a decent place for breakfast, he recommended 5 and Diner, saying it is as close to an old school diner out west.  While the food there, wasn't bad, it wasn't great either.  Adding to the mediocre food was the incredibly slow service.  All in all, it is an okay place for breakfast, but that is about it.The pros: 
- fresh ingredients
- attention to detail 
- variety of foods, snacks, goodies and drinks

The cons:
- expensive
- location / parking inconvenient

Brief review:
All in all, a good place to hang out and grab a drink with a friend when it's nice outside. Friendly, prompt service. Clean tables. Great atmosphere!  The only real problem is your wallet is going to be much, much lighter after you leave.  If you're going because you're hungry and you want value, this isn't your place.  If you're going to hang with friends to relax and enjoy the day, I think you'll enjoy the place.Big Lots is a Big Lots is a Big Lots.  Not sure why everyone was so disgusted by it, it wasn't terrible at all.  Same ol' same ol'I have a love/hate relationship with the Merc Bar.  I love the ambiance, I love the scotch menu, if I were single-I would love the ladies.. or I would love it as a date bar.  On the inverse side, Merc is a tad snooty.  Once, I was denied enterance purely because I was wearing a hat.  Now, this wasn't some meat-head sporty cap, nor was it a gangsta rag; no, it was simply one of those little military style caps with the short bill that you see all the hipsters wearing these days.  Comeon folks, you're in a freakin mall, LET ME WEAR MY CAP, I'M BALDING FOR GODS SAKE!!  ONLY 3 STARS FOR YOU!!!I have been to Miracle Mile before, just not this one. 
Probably not a fair review because I only got a grill cheese sandwich. It comes with a side, I got chips and a drink. You get to choose your bread and I chose the marble rye. The makings for a great sandwich. So what kind of cheese do they use? Not real cheese. You know the kind that is wrapped in plastic and will keep in the refrigerator for two years and still be eatable. 
On the better side my mother in law and father in law got a ruben and a turkey. Those sandwiches really looked good and they said so. 
The service was as good as you could ever expect at a cafeteria type of eatery. Everyone was friendly and the people that came by the tables cleaning and helping guests were fantastic. I was very impressed with they way they took care of everyone. 
Unless you are fond of imitation cheese pass on the grill cheese sandwich. Everything else looked good.They didn't really have anything vintage or retro. The store was clean and well organized but lacking some fun pieces.My husband and I used to frequent the Keegan's in Ahwatukee, but we have moved from that area and are slightly closer to this Camelback location. 
We ate breakfast at this location for the first time yesterday.

I found the service to be a bit slow, but our server was very polite and accomodating.

I ordered the cinnamon brioche french toast. I would go as far to say this is the best french toast I have ever eaten. It was so moist and tasty! 

I like the set up of the Ahwatukee location better. The bathrooms at this location are not as nicely kept as the 'tukee location.

I'll definitley be back for Sunday brunch again for some of that great french toast and hope to check it out for dinner some night. Keegan's usually has some good, home cooking dinner specials, so when I'm too lazy to cook my own meatloaf I'll head here on a Monday night.Pimp my Hotel will not be featured here.

This place is old.  It's tired.  It's in a neighborhood that's loaded with strip joints.  What's good about it, you ask?  It's close to alot and I talked the manager into giving me free Internet for the week because I didn't want to pay for it.   Hey, I brought a small team here to stay, so they got some good business out of me!

The good things are:  

1.  They really do a nice job with the free breakfasts.  Bless the woman's heart she is patient enough to listen to my attempts to eat healthy, "I'd like an egg white omelet, very little oil, spinach, mushrooms and some ham".  She turns to me, "Would you like to sneak a little cheese in that?"  I say, "Maybe just a sprinkle".  Damn she made a good one for me.
2.  Free managers happy hour (but only 2 choices of beer -- this is bad).
3.  Close to the stadium where the Diamondbacks play.
4.  Short drive away from the mall.
5.  There is a LA Fitness and a 24 Hour Fitness nearby.

Cons:

1.  No gym (just 2 treadmills).
2.  Rooms are old.  
3.  Shitty neighborhood (think ankle holsters and shoulder rigs).
4.  Not much within walking distance (although Carl's Jr. is right across the street!)

All in all, it's convenient to the airport, freeways, and there are free breakfasts here.  If you're not in the mood for omelets, there are other options such as cereal, yogurt, fresh fruit, toast, oatmeal, pastries, and pancakes.  You can't go wrong with that, sometimes.Its a pretty nondescript dive.  Its basically a hallway, which makes its kind of neat... and there is a big fish tank with weirdly cool fish to stare at.  Otherwise its your typical dive bar atmosphere.  They do have 'fish tank specials' which means that about 10 bottles are lined up in front of the fishies and they are marked pretty cheaply (naturally the price is written in Sharpie on the bottle).  

I wanted to try the 'chocolate vodka' so I basically got a really full glass of straight vodka for $2.50.  Odd drink but lots of alcohol quite inexpensively.  The bartender had to have been high on something.  No complaints though... she was hilarious just to watch.  

I would definitely go back on any dive bar crawl.  - also try Darwins just two doors down!Very friendly ladies. Only used them for dry cleaning. They did a good job, but seem a little pricey. $19.50 for 4 of my husbands shirts.I had surgery here a few years ago and it went well.  I had to stay overnight so I got to taste their food... It was not that bad for hospital food.  The nurses are friendly and took good care of me.  Admitting and check in went very smoothly without any hang ups.We used to go here years ago. Been going to ajo als and Arriba's since. They are just closer to where we live.
I ordered the pollo fundido, which is what I order at the other places. It was drier and not as tasty as I've gotten used to. Still a good dish but it'll probably be years before I go back again.
The service was awesome. The guy who brings the chips and salsa and refills the drinks- totally awesome. My drink was never below 1/2- I love that. We tipped him separate...Wings....eat the wings!! Be sure to ask for them grilled! It takes a little while longer to get them, but totally worth the wait. Aside from the wings, the Nachos are pretty tasty.

Other than that, it's a pretty standard sports bar. However, there are masses upon masses of TVs here, which makes it nice if you are wanting to watch a game. The downside: if the place gets busy, the servers are usually not equipped to handle it. Aside from the TVs, there is trivia, karaoke, and a pool table. Another major plus for us smokers: the outside patio, which includes MORE TVs. Weeeee! Sorry for the excitement, but TVs on the patio are hard to come by.

The food overall is average. A few things that are good. The burgers are solid, and you have the option of really customizing them (different meats, cheeses, buns, etc). The wraps are horrible! Old lettuce, dry and hard wrap. Icky.  Drinks are priced well.

I need a half star. YELP!!!! Yelp me! Listen to me! We need half stars!!!! This is a 3.5 star place.

Food: C
Prices: B
Ambiance: B+
Service: C
Overall: C+Some coworkers and I ended up here after the team trivia location we were going to go to ended up getting rescheduled (woops!). I have heard of Brigett's but this was my first time there. It is divey but I felt comfortable parking out front and heading in by myself. I found my group and had a seat, and the server was very nice and attentive throughout the night. It is a ways away from home so I can't say I'll be running back, but the crowd inside (on a Thurs night) was chill and I had a good time.good menudo on weekends, decent burritos, but they get a crazy 2 point deduction for having watered down hunt's tomato sauce in lieu of salsa. i've actually seen this at several other phoenix area restaurants, so it might be contagious. their location on mohave is pretty gangxta, so make sure to tell all your out of town friends about that hole in the wall in that colorful neighborhood you love so much.I just returned from Phoenix on a business trip.  Sky Harbor is a very busy airport.  Everything makes sense when you follow the signs posted.  The layout of the airport is pretty simple as well.  It has three levels in terminal 4 where I was.  One bizarre thing I did notice was that you take an escalator down from level 3 to level 1, but must take an elevator to get back up.  And the elevators are not right next to escalator.  They're close.  You just have to search.  The information booths were very helpful in helping me locate them.

The only bad experience I had was at baggage claim.  Some of the baggage staff were barking curses and behaving like gangsters.  It definitely reflected poorly on the airport.  At one point, I thought they were going to fight each other over a lunch break.  I also heard some older baggage claim staff complaining openly about how the passengers do not care at all about the way they operate.  They seemed very disgruntled.

Security was pretty tight.  In Orlando, I had to remove my shoes to go through security.  At Sky Harbor, everyone kept their shoes on.  I was randomly asked by a security guard to hold out my hands so they could pass a wand over them to look for signs of chemicals.  I've never experienced that before at any other airport.  It wasn't a bad experience.  I thought all airports had the same procedures for checking passengers, but I guess not.

Overall, it was a good experience.  It was A-OK.  I know they can make it better.  There was a lot of construction going on outside the airport.  Maybe those improvements will help with traffic and parking?  Next they might want to look at hiring some new staff or taking better care of the current staff at baggage claim.I was there for an hour, in between flights.  It has bathrooms, planes, overpriced food and gift stores, and is moderately clean and well tended.Clean comfortable, only downfall was the noise from the airplanes flying over and rattling the room. Love that they allowed my dog :-)Waffle House, I can't give you five stars for awesomeness, but you deserve at least a couple stars for being open 24 hours and feeding a hungry girl with a late night craving of waffles and eggs.  This place is the typical diner fare, but for a fraction of the price.  Don't expect haute cuisine.... but you'll be happy with the cheap eats and friendly service.Just happened here, on a business trip, between arriving at the airport and our afternoon meeting.  It was like we were in Sonoma, not Phoenix.

The pulled pork tacos were really nice and fresh, the tortilla soup a bit oily.  Someone else got some bread pudding and it was gooood.

Somehow, they ran out of running water, even in the bathrooms.  Strange, is that just part of this being a farm?Came back for lunch and sushi was very fishy. Prices are still good and happy to get free soup. They should also tweak their salad dressing because it's very pungent and not in a good way.My family and I love Macayos, we eat at the Tempe location all to time. We came her for a quick lunch and ended up staying much longer than anticipated. The food was delicious like usual, the fried ice cream is great! But the service was terrible. We waited forever to get our food, even though there were only a few people there. We will not be eating at this location again.Nice atmosphere and everything.  I think I have been there at least 6 or 7 times and the last 3 or 4, they were out of the wheat crust.  It's one of my favorite things and they are ALWAYS out of it.  You would think that if you are always running out, you would make more, right?  But in the end, the food is good.  Service is good enough.  Probably should be a 4 star rating, but the "out of wheat crust" thing really frustrates me and I will likely not go back.Booked an upgraded suite for spring break (believe me, location upgrade only) through AE and called before we departed to verify, only to find it was not granted. That's why you pay AE, so I called them and they demanded the upgrade (no biggie, but not a good start).  I checked in with 3 kids (obviously we need our requested 2 doubles), but I had a feeling things weren't going to be smooth.  Checked in and directed to the car by the uninterested and bothered front desk person where a bell hop said he will show me the way.  Pulled the car around and "he gone", but they were busy so I figured I would find it myself.   As I finally find a spot, I flag down another bell hop, we get to the room and open the door to our 5 day stay.  Ugh, dirty room with one bed.  My 10 year old walks in and literally pulls me to the side, and whispered, "no offense Dad, but this place is a dump".  And this is the supposed upgrade which overlooked the water park?  
No worries son, we cant stay here anyway.  Bellhop called the front and we were switched to another room w 2 beds, as we trekked to the next room my 8 year old tells me he saw the toilet was used and not flushed... verified by his brother. I'm not squeamish but at this point I have a case of heebie jeebies and want to leave.  Could this hotel be fairytale horrible? 
Actually I thought to myself we're just camping in style, lets deal.  
The next room was better, certainly not spotless by any means, but here for the kids and the weather/water park. Wow, management needs to crack the whip a little.  How about upgrading the mildew carpets or paint the walls once on awhile?
Ok bad start but the place ends up growing on us and we enjoy the small pools next to the rooms, room service, buffet breakfast, water park activities, and even the Rooste restaurant.  The gym is great with plenty of options.  Loved the hiking in back and most employees we meet are very friendly.  Took day trips to Sedona, and Scottsdale to break up the stay and had a great finish to our break.  
The water park gets annoying crowded and people save chairs like its Black Friday...lined up before the park opens to get the prime spots (I'm past the point of little non swimmers but note if you want to watch a toddler).  
Overall a solid C, but could be a B with some work on the rooms.  I thought the food was good to great.  Prices fairly high but not unexpected. 
I cant forget that on Easter I asked the concierge for Catholic mass times nearby. Picked the noon mass but it was started at 1230 and said in Latin.  Really?
Absolutely kids only hotel. A stay here without kids would be a hazard to your mental health.Well, as usual, I am writing this review to share my opinions and observations with other Yelpers. My family and I went to eat dinner here over the weekend along with an important out-of-town visitor that we were entertaining. We decided to try this restaurant since we are always looking for a good Northern Italian restaurant and have not really found one here in the valley, despite living here for over 25 years. So we gave it a shot. I have some good comments and some not-so-good comments to share: 

First the good. Although the menu is limited (by my standards, albeit they have a decent selection), the food was good. We ordered a wide variety of dishes from various appetizers, salads, an antipasti plate, pastas, veal dishes, lobster ravioli, and other entrees. Everyone said that the entrees and appetizers were very good, including me, who ordered the simplest dish because I love it -- Italian sausage and peppers over fettuccine. And the portions are large and the prices are very good. The service is decent and passable. 

Now for the not-so-good. First of all, there were only two parties eating dinner that night. A party of 8 and our party of six......that's all. I think the bad economy is hurting this restaurant as well as other better dining establishments. But the problem was even when I asked for a different seating area and finding more room for our table(s), we were told that we couldn't do that. WTF! With only two parties in a big restaurant? And they put our parties right next to each other! How freaking noisy and irritating was that? There was only one server too, and I think he might have been either the manager or the owner. I can understand the need to reduce staff if business is poor, but that was a little too much for me. Next, the wine list is poor -- with many of the wines "out of stock" and most of the labels are from unknown vineyards. The prices for the wines were really not bad for a retail restaurant -- I paid $85 and $89 for two bottles of maybe $35 wines, but is to be expected. I would have been willing to pay even more if the wines were better and from recognizable vineyards -- either from Napa or Italy. And although the food was good along with the prices, the salad was bad. It was like out of a supermarket bag -- "field greens". And the dressing was blase and boring. And lastly, my party had four dessert eaters, but the dessert options were boring and poor. Again, probably due to the poor business volume, they have to cut back on the dessert options and the more costly and sophisticated desserts. 

My suspicion is that this restaurant probably had better options and choices for everything in better times, but today, I would say it is so-so at best. My wife said she would not go back again. For me personally, I would go back just for a simple meal for myself and my wife and daughter, since the food is good and the prices right. 

So I am still searching for a good Northern Italian restaurant. Oh yeah, one more thing -- I will have to give them credit for being willing to make simple menu changes that we requested. I can understand that restaurants won't make things on the menu if the requests are too far afield from their standard items, but things like making the dish without alcohol in it should be accommodated. And for the seafood pasta dishes, my wife only wanted clams and not the mussels, shrimps, and fish, and they did that. My daughter wanted a cheese pasta dish but also wanted some "meat" so they added a grill chicken breast on top. Oh yeah, my wife wanted the lobster ravioli as an appetizer so they made a special appetizer size for her. When she shared some with the others, a couple of others changed their entrees to the lobster ravioli since it was very good.They ROYALLY messed up our order here. We actually were seated in the bar and expected to have to wait a bit for food, but I think the waiter forgot to put our order in. Everyone around us was served before we were. When we finally asked you could see the lightbulb go off and up comes the manager. "There was a mix up in the kitchen and your food will be right up, please order a desert on us". The reason I am giving this review 3 stars is simply because the food (eventhough it was probably prepared in a hurry with a cursing manager wagging her finger at the chef) was absolutely perfect. The butterfish is so great and the pineapple upside down cake was a pleasant but not over sweet dessert.It is my favorite vietnamese restaurant.
It's small but clean. Their soups are great. They serve fresh and tasty foods.
Portion is not big enough for me though.
I wish they serve bigger size meals.Let me start out by saying that I'm not a Trader Joe's fan, but after a recent debate about grocery stores where a friend really stood her ground about it having such great prices, I figured I would suck it up and give this location a try. It's located in a strip mall (surprise!!) with the worst parking lot ever, so I didn't really know what to expect. My only other TJ experiences have been in Center City Philadelphia (gross) and a stand-alone in a suburban Seattle neighborhood.

This store is really clean. I went on a Sunday afternoon so it was fairly crowded, but the shelves were stocked and it was pretty easy to maneuver around. If I had a cart it might be another story but I grabbed a basket and went up and down each aisle a couple times. The only messy area was the bathroom but I probably just caught it in between cleaning shifts. 

Not knowing what I was looking for, I picked up a couple items for dinner and snacks for the kids. Yogurt tubes - good price. English muffins - good price and probably the best I have ever had. Orange Chicken (frozen) - could have been spicier but the kids loved it. Meat dept - expensive...better prices at Sprouts. Frozen blueberries - cheapest around. All-in-all it was a good experience, I was pleasantly surprised, and I started drafting my "okay, you win" text to my friend who stood her ground and I headed to the register.

I stood in line and when I was my turn, I told my cashier that I had a bag. This is where they get docked 2 stars. For the amount of time it takes to ring up the 7 items that I had, my cashier made not one, not two, but five smart-ass comments about the fact that I had a Whole Foods bag. I know, I know, what a dumb thing to get bent over, but for me it has to do with service, and Roger (cashier), should just bite his tongue, keep his opinions to himself, and just be happy that I am contributing to his ability to receive a paycheck. I know the $22 I spent is just a teeny-tiny percentage of what the store brings in on a normal day, but because of that interaction, I won't go out of my way to shop there, even if it means saving a couple bucks.The food here is pretty standard just like Chili's and TGIF. I eat here more than other burger restaurants mainly because of their royalty rewards card. I've already received about 4 free entrees as well as free appetizers and a free birthday burger. Other than that its just another mediocre American food family restaurant.BBQ is one of my favorite past times. The food here is pretty good but nothing to write home about. Maybe the menu is just too big or they have spread themselves a little too thin.

Inside is decorated with all sorts of items from the Chicago area. The walls are covered with plenty to look at and they even have an old timey phone booth in the back section. Ring ring!

Been here a few times and usually get some of the Brisket and possible a Hot Link. The meat is always tender and not dry like other places. The BBQ sauce is just a little too sweet for this bad boy. Would like to see a sauce with less stickiness per square inch. Maybe there is just too much molasses or corn syrup in there.

They also offer a large variety of many of the Chicago favorites. Chicago Dogs, Italian Beefs, so forth and so on. Maybe I'll take the Dog for a walk around the block next time.

Service is always friendly. Maybe too friendly. I'm usually in a hurry and sometimes do not feel like chatting about life's particulars. You do have to give them credit for trying. Some places just give you the stink eye and expect you to be happy.

Going with an average score of A-OK on this puppy. Give them a try and see what you think. I'll probably be back again for one of their lunch specials. Maybe I'll bring my own sauce. WUZ UP!

3.25 STARSAll About Fun And Footcare!

Upon deciding to do something different a month ago, I proudly went there alone on a whim after a mani/pedi on a Friday. I neither knew what to expect nor know what the West Coast Swing was, and didn't care. 

After a briefing on what the dance pattens would look like, I took to it like a cat to a scratching post and was swinging in no time. I forgot the guy's name who walked me through it, but he was very personable and patient.  I like the way he held my hand. Simple, non-pretentious, made me very comfortable --he was a gentleman. : ).  I had a really good time dancing and conversing with others there. I left heavily perspired, but also refreshed, too...and slept like brick!

I woke up the next morning doing the 'east valley shuffle' out of bed, immediately went to urgent care and was diagnosed with plantar fascitis :( .  I didn't realize why that heel was a 'thorn in my side' for a month prior to the event; thought it would just go away on its own (bummer).

Pros: convenient location, ample parking (get there early), pleasant staff, friendly atmosphere and people, you can dance there pretty much all night long.

Con: try not to do any dances if you have either sciatica or that plantar thingy I got, take care of the weird aches and pains with a doc or chiro first before 'cuttin' the rug' or you'll only exacerbate it and be shufflin' along like me.

As soon as my issue passes you may see me there, but it'll be awhile.Your standard Goodwill, holding a selection of older appliances, electronics, housewares, as well as furniture. Need a turntable with missing needle? Ever wanted to try out one of those fad exercise machines that rock in unnatural ways? Or do you need a random bed sheet that is a print of all the islands of Hawaii? Well, look no further! There are also lots of racks of clothes here to browse through, ranging from casual to prom-dressy. I can never quite pinpoint what that "Goodwill" odor is when you are browsing through their stores. Is it the particular type of disinfectant they use?Love the sopapillas here! Nice local place!Went back and the food is good and the pricing is decent.  Oscar is a great cook and made up for the groupon incidentFriendly neighborhood sushi bar...think Cheers with raw fish and nicer decor.

Solid quality of fish with a nice selection of all the usual suspects.  Also good selection of cooked dishes for the non-raw eaters.I like this location because they have a drive-thru. Even though there is almost always a long line, they get you on your way fast. The staff is friendly and competent. Also, they rarely run out of anything (other locations seem to go through their entire inventory of breakfast sandwiches and scones by 9am).

If you are the type that does not drink your morning coffee inside a moving vehicle, they also have comfy chairs inside and decent patio seating.  The patio faces the parking lot and drive-thru but it does have shade umbrellas so it can be very pleasant in the morning.Chompies is great, i love the corned beef & pastrami sandwich..the food is very tastey..also if you want some amazing pancakes try the Wheat STUFFED GRANOLA ones they are out of this world.. on Shea The Chompies on Shea has one problem, its the service, now the servers are nice & all but they seem to maybe be understaffed, takes forever to get your order. Another thing that caused me to give it 3 stars is the price, chompies is pretty darn expensive, expect to pay about $15-$20 for a basic breakfast, i only order 2 eggs, potatos & dry toast & sometimes pancakes..when i go there for lunch & get the corned beef sandwish, fries, & a drink its about $25..but the portions are LARGE & u will definitley not leave there hungry!Massage was great, but only 3 stars because the common area is not seperate from the men.  We share a sauna, steam room, hot tub, etc.  I wasn't thrilled about having to wear my swimsuit and having men stare at me.I'm painting my living room and have no time to cook, I can't say this is reviewable its dominos... The delivery guys are really friendly and courteous.We stayed here over the weekend because we attended a wedding close by and didn't want to drive home. 

The room was really nice. Clean. Everything you expect of a Hilton property. The property is very nice, but a bit confusing, I got lost finding my room, with a map in hand! 

The bride and groom had the after party in the hotels lounge, the staff on hand looked very displeased to be there and were mumbling about the wedding party arriving. The bride and groom gave the hotel fair notice that this would happen so they could staff accordingly. I guess the lounge doesn't see much action and the staff didn't want to really work. Whatev. 

We went to eat breakfast at the restaurant the next morning and it was INSANELY over priced! $14 for a freaken waffle? You are nuts! 

All in all, its a nice place. Close to everything if you want to do the touristy Scottsdale stuff.This is a great place to eat "except" they are hit and miss with food quality and level of service. On occasion when my wife and I stop on for lunch, there always manages to be some issue with the food in one another's meal. Given there are 2 of us? That translates to them hitting the mark 50% of the time. The menu selection is awesome. The dark molasses indian bread with butter is worth the trip and if you can get a great service, try the appetiser salad of pecan, endive and blue cheese. The take out cheese cake cant be beat.So let's start with the the good stuff.  We went in for lunch on a Tuesday, we got greeted and sat down right away.  We decided what we wanted and ordered.  When the food got there it was pretty good.  I would go back for the food.  Now to what was not good.  Our service was not good. The guy who brought out our food was rather rude.  Our rice order was wrong, it wasn't a huge deal.  We ordered brown rice and got white rice.  I let the waitress know and she asked the guy who brought our food to get the brown rice.  Once again, he was really not friendly.  He gave us the impression he was pissed to have to be helping us at all. Our waitress was ok.  Just ok.  So since this was our first visit I will go back because I liked the food.  If the service isn't better there will not be a third time.I am from San Francisco on business in North Scottsdale, and I saw this restaurant on Groupon. I was able to purchase the groupon for $40 worth of food and drink for $20 and was very excited about it! When I got there at 7:30 on a Tuesday night, the place was pretty dead. There were about 5 tables filled out of 25 or so. An older couple came in and knew everyone, so were obvious "regulars", and they seemed to love the place. I ordered the White Bean Soup and the Ribeye steak with Gorgonzola sauce. The White Bean Soup was piping hot and delicious. The little bit of shredded Parmesan that melted into my spoon made the soup delectable. A waiter notified me shortly after I ordered that the ribeye was not available as the meat guy hadn't come. He substituted the porterhouse at no extra charge with the same Gorgonzola sauce that would have been on the ribeye. The steak was okay. The sauce was good, but the Gorgonzola overpowered the flavor of the steak. The steak was a little thin (hence why I'd rather have a thicker Ribeye than a thinner porterhouse). The roasted potatoes that came with the dish were delicious and the vegetables were tasty. I took 2 stars off for ambiance, not having the ribeye, and just overall satisfaction with the meal. I feel that if I had the ribeye, this might have been a 4 star.Stopped by today to get a few things and when I was walking through the garden section I saw a baby bunny!! The girl working there said they have a bunch of them living there and that the bunny's are happy as can be... 

Crazy, but pretty cool...The experience we had was just fine.  Food, service and wine list were all good - salad bar was good too.  I am not sure if I'd go out of my way to go back though.  There are a lot of trendy and fun places to dine in the Scottsdale area and this one seems to be like the "Grandfather of Scottsdale Dining" - older and almost antiquated.While Arriba Mexican Grill may be exclusive to Arizona, it's desire to be a major chain may be what keeps it average.  In an area that has an abundance of Mexican establishments (both on the low and high end), very little about Arriba stands out in the crowd.

The several odd things about the restaurant stick out like sore thumb.  What's with the New Mexico theme?  Having only driven through the state, I'm not sure if New Mexican has its own culinary style.  I always just assumed that like many other southwest states, New Mexico just fit into Tex-Mex.  The menu being exclusively pictures is a turn off.  Makes me feel like I'm at an Ihop or Denny's.  And having the descriptions in a small white text over a black background in a dim room made it very hard to read.  They also seated patrons near the bar, and left the main dining section fairly empty.  I don't know if they were short staffed, but I notice as I was leaving that there was a wait, even though I was able to see that the dining room had several empty tables.

The service was excellent.  The waiter was friendly and our drinks were constantly refilled.  The ambiance isn't bad.  We were seated next to an open sliding door which showed off an outdoor water fall/pond setup.  Chips and salsa were at the the table immediately.  The spicy was wonderful.  The mild was okay.  The bean dip was awful.  The food was also pretty good.  While it tries to be different, it doesn't seem to stand out.Food is very average.  Excellent beer but you can get it all over town these days!  Hit up the Tempe location for the authentic experience and nice scenery.  Don't be afraid to try something new from their selection of homemade beers - almost always way above average!Saw the Angels/Rangers game here on Tuesday.  A nice stadium, $5 to park, and reasonable lawn tickets at $6.  Don't waste your money on an expensive seat...chances are you can just go sit down low anyway.I'm on what feels like a never ending search for a groomer that can cut my dog's hair and feel like I've gotten close with Shelly's Pet Grooming. I took Baxter in with a jacked up (and grown out) hair cut he got from Bark N' Babies and asked that they just do whatever they could with him. I pretty much left it in the very nice groomer's hands and said go as short as you have to. The shop is clean and everyone else seemed to be pretty friendly, so I left him with fingers crossed! The groomer did a really good job and definitely went short, but I was completely okay with it! Sometimes you just have to start over. The pricing was decent and I walked away feeling pretty good about the experience - not to mention that my little guy smelled amazing! Since he has longer hair, I'd be interested to see what they're able to do when I don't want him to get a military cut! I definitely think Shelly's is worth another try!The regular food is, well... okay. But frankly, for the same money you can go to the store and get the salad fixings you like, and it will last you a week.

HOWEVER, you have to go in on Sunday mornings. Great breakfest buffet. I especially like this because I don't like cooking breakfast. I'm tired and I'm hungry - who wants to mix waffle batter half asleep?

But I am saying it's bad for kids so you leave them at home. I hate children, and I hate yours more. Buy them a cage before you go out to places I suggest!I have gotten take out from here twice now and think they are pretty good.  The service has been quick and the staff very nice. I am a soft bread kind of guy and think the super soft wheat bread is pretty terrific.  They have the all the standard sub toppings, nothing special. I have purchased hot and cold subs and have to give a higher rating to the cold ones since my steak and cheese was luke warm.

As other have mentioned the "Whole" sub is really, really large.There's a little something for everyone at this South Tempe dance club. Even my Mom likes to come here! Graham, as the regulars call it, features four rooms -- the South Beach room where a DJ spins hip-hop and techno music along with the country-heavy Rockin' Rodeo room, the retro Confetti's where a DJ spins '80s and '90s hits and Alley Cats, a karaoke bar. It tends to draw an older crowd and you'll see a lot of cowboys. But the beer is certainly cheap! There are drink specials galore every night.I love a good bagel and cream cheese, especially on a Saturday Morning.  Mind you, I have been here several times before, so its not my first time.

The benefits of Einsteins is that they make all their tasty bagels in site. Flavors are tasty, with Asiago cheese, onion, garlic, and a few other flavors as well.  Great selection of different flavors of bagels.  They also have a few different options in cream cheese flavors as well.

They also have a great selection of lunch sandwiches, which I like.  Great selection pastries, juices, etc.

Where they loose points with me, is I don't care for the service here.  I always always always have to stand in line and wait; not only to place my order, but to pay and recieve my food as well.  Some could argue that maybe I am being fussy.  Others could say that I need to be more patient at times.  I do not argue that point. BUT, nothing irks me more then waiting...and waiting....and more waiting.

I have never NOT had to step in line here, regardless of time of day.  Why is that? I don't understand.

Also, I feel that service here lacks.  I always see multiple staff members behind the counter.  If thats the case, why is it always the same 1 person taking orders, and one working the register?  I also sense that maybe other customers get frustrated with this experience as well.  I go here becuase they do have great bagels, and their stuff is tasty...but at the cost of waiting....and iffy service.

Plus, sometimes this place is NOT super clean.  Its not filthy or anything..but I just feel like maybe it could use a good cleaning at times.They took the Chicken con Broccoli off of the menu!  So bummed!  Luckily the all-you-can-eat soup, salad and breadsticks are still an option at lunch time.Our Indian cowkrs like eating here so that should be a good recommendation, which is why you see some long tables setup to handle group lunches (ie. going away party and there's Indian peers joining).  Don't worry, it's both meat and veg offerings.

Being no authority on Indian food, so I won't comment except to say my stomach seems to be thinking about the lunchtime buffet.  There's a slow burn in my stomach still a good hour afterwards from the spiciness of the dishes.Let me preface this by saying that I could eat Thai food every day until I die without a single complaint. Favorite. 

This place was...fine. I went at lunch and ordered the pad thai to go and the yellow curry chicken. The meals come with an egg roll, but I couldn't eat more than one bite. It was so heavily fried that it literally dripped oil. Not my style. I tasted the pad thai, and it, too, was very oily. The flavor was fine, but a little bland, and there was not much in the way of chicken or shrimp. The portion was, as others have mentioned, noticeably smaller than most thai places...but a reasonable serving size none the less. 

So, the curry. 
I just...I can't even...ugh. It was so good. Thick and creamy curry, al dente carrots and peppers, and perfectly tender potatoes along with sliced white meat chicken. Guys, It was so good. I hate that the portion was so small--I typically expect to have leftovers for at least another meal. It was only $6 though so I certainly can't knock it. 

The overall experience was fine, the place was clean and the food took a long time to come out but that's worth it for the fresh food. I'm torn, because the curry is worth going back for but I'm not so confident on the rest of the menu.This place is ok, we seem to stop by here every once and a while because their happy hour is decent, and the food is good, they only have their beer so its good to go for something different, their mug club is pretty cool, you get rewards depending on visits or pints bought, plus they put a $10 credit on it for my birthday. Haven't had the best service but it's a pretty chill place.I'm not a big mall fan, but this one is pretty nice.  Good selection of stores on two levels.  Food court with your usual faire.  Overall appears clean and safe.  Parking is a challenge, especially the limited handicapped parking.  Worth a trip to do some shopping if you want to get indoors.Great for a quick Blizzard fix. My son loves the burgers I haven't tried the food besides the blizzardI have to say it appears my idea of a great zoo differs greatly from my fellow yelpers.

This zoo does have some great features.  Fantastic variety of animals from all over the world.  And if you like tigers, this is the zoo for you.  The animals appear well-cared for and the grounds are reasonably clean.

However, it escapes me how this zoo can warrant a five-star rating given the number of "exhibits" that are merely large cages sitting side-by-side like little hotel rooms.  Don't get me wrong, some of the exhibits are great and well-designed.  But many others are terrible and seem to offer little to the animals except shelter.  Perhaps this zoo houses more animals than it can adequately support.

For $18 a ticket, I expect more.
IFor some reason, I was expecting a lot more. This is called the Wildlife WORLD Zoo and Aquarium, but I felt like there weren't as many types of animals as we had hoped. Every time I turned around, it was just another bird cage or another type of antelope. Birds are definitely the "filler" animal at this zoo.

My fiance and I came here using a Groupon, and were happy to get $10 off per ticket, as we would have felt ripped off spending $32 per ticket.Like the previous yelper said! Rating is the service. Usually the food all taste the same! That's why we keep on coming back!!! You will have issues on the service, what do you expect? Most of them are minimum wage kids! They are just starting life! So like any fast food franchise, you get what you paid for! So be patient!This Jamba juice is just okay.
The employees are kinda rude, well most of them.
I've asked to "customize my own smoothie" and this one girl didn't even know what kind of ingredients they had, it was really annoying. I said I didn't want anything orange in my smoothie, and it ended up having orange.

On top of that, it's always really loud, right when you walk in you get a "HELLLOOOO!" then another, "Hello!" "hello!" "hello!"
I found the workers to be really obnoxious.

I do love their smoothies though. If it wasn't for my work being not too far, I really don't think I'd go there.The buffet at this casino is pretty damn good! 

As for the slot machines and poker machines, they are so tight I think they squeak when I walk by! 

My aunt and uncle are Million Point members and have way too many points that they can ever think of using so we always end up eating here when visiting the family in town. 

The food is always hot and in constant rotation. I have yet to meet a dry piece of chicken. Their salad bar is really fresh and clean. I like the dessert bar the best as it has Caramel Creme Ice Cream. The hubby got a scoop and I almost had to knock him out to get another bite. It was that good! I really like that they have an "international" flair to theif buffet because then it doesn't get boring.

I am sure that I wil be back for a buffet next time I am in town as my aunt and uncle will not eat anywhere else.I've been going here on and off for years.  It's not the quickest place in town (they are often fairly busy), but they do a good job at a reasonable price.  Plus they have free wifi, which makes time go by a little quicker.

Look for their Living Social and Groupon deals and you'll save a little $.It is a suburban mall, what more do you want. It is not Walmart, so you can actually get clothes that are stylish in fabrics that do not feel like those brown paper towels, we were forced to use in Grade schoolCarne asada burrito was ok. Salsa bar was good!The service was stellar and the ambiance was impeccable. However; I must have ordered all the wrong things because from what I am reading, I completely missed out. I ordered the chicken, and it was tough, the breading was thick and over-fried. The center of my twice baked potato was cold, we had waited long enough for our order that I did not send it back. The asparagus was soft as though it had been forgotten in the steamer. 
Regardless, the service was excellent and I know we will eat there again, I will just order something different.No bad room. Ideal size for two people with king size bed.  Looking forward to show tonight. Clean with plenty of amenities.It was ok......got a pedi and my nail polish chipped two days later! not happy never coming back and waited a while and not so friendly.Used a GroupBuy coupon to engage my 1st purchase at Aurelio's. Some pizza places pride themselves on the cheese, some for the crust, but I believe this place depends on its sauce, and the sauce is good. The crust is like any other Chicago style pizza place, but the cheese was miniscule throughout the order. The soft bread sticks supposedly had Romano cheese, the jalapeno cheese ravioli was pretty hollow but the stuffed crust pizza was a little better. 
I'm a little harder to please because I have some experience in the kitchen.  While I would travel the 8 miles for another shot, I still have yet to find a pizza place that can impress me as I did myself while working at a Little Caesar's parlor and tweeking the ingredients. But for the money I spent, and the gross weight of the food I brought home was probably the one thing that impressed me the most. I find spending $15 anywhere else, I can lift the packaged products with my eyelashes. 
I will suggest to Aurelio's that they invest some belief in their own cuisine. Chicago-style is beast. For them to advertise thin-crust panders to the westerners, California specifically. Thin crust sucks.It's the most convenient AYCE sushi restaurant in the Henderson/Anthem area.  Overall, not a bad place and I'd come again.  But not my favorite in the city.  I'd rather go farther for better.  

The space is clean and spacious.  Authentic Japanese kimonos and artwork line the walls.  

It wasn't busy on the Mother's Day holiday that I went (~25% filled at any given time), but families did come so it was steady.  However, saying that, there should be no excuse as to why we didn't get better service.  We were missing utensils/straws/salad orders and when we reminded the server, he seemed annoyed.  They didn't clear our table as quickly as they brought the food so at one point, we ended up with a few empty dishes cluttering our table.  When we got the check, he had incorrectly charged us more tax than was required.  It's a lot of little things that could have been prevented if someone had been paying more attention.  

The food is delicious and that would be the only reason I'd come back.  My favorites were the Pacific Roll, Hello Kitty Roll, and the Bonzai Roll (if you like sweet + spicy sriracha).  The cucumber salad was disappointing and didn't taste as fresh and crisp as I'm used to.  Free refills for soda are a plus.  

Overall, not a bad experience.  The food balanced the mediocre service.  I'd come again but I'd be coming back more strict.Although the staff at Village East is very friendly, I wasn't 100% satisfied with the services. When my dress was ready to be picked up, I looked it over in the store and saw that it was still dirty at the bottom. I had pointed out specific areas when I dropped it off, so I thought they would be addressed. Denise was accommodating and suggested they re-clean it, which they did. They delivered the re-cleaned dress to my house (which I appreciated) and the dress looked much better.My friend recommended this place to me as a quick, small Sushi place.  I tried it for the first time the other day and it was pretty good. AYCE for about $23.95.

So far my favorite roll is the Sweetheart, shrimp tempura, crab meat and special sauce. When my friend ordered it I wasn't expecting it to be anything special, but I was definitely surprised. It's really good.

We didn't really get our money's worth on this trip as we only ordered about 2 rolls each, but I definitely plan on going back with a bigger appetite next time.Cool vibe for an after hours spot, but that place is filled with open use of drugs.  People were in the stalls doing coke and girls were puking on the floor in line for the ladies room.  We had fun but man was that a weird night.This place is cool, not only cause the name, but the hours. The food's pretty good, ordered pho and you can get extra broth for just $1. The service is alright, like any other mom and pop asian place. We had a problem with our check and the man was being very rude about it. I'm sure there are numerous large parties that come through the restaurant and want to split checks or pay partial cash, partial card. The man was just being very impatient and fussy and the funny part is they weren't even busy at the time, he was probably just having a bad day. The prices are reasonable too and the food is good. But this is the place to be after a long night of partying or to cure your hangover in the morning!I am not sure if this place has come under new ownership, but my last outing here proved very disappointing. Up until recently, this place was my go to after hours food spot in Vegas. However this past time, I found myself unimpressed by the pho, which is surprising since the pho in LA is subpar for the most part. the spring roll also seemed haphazzardly prepared and lack any real flavor. It didn't help that the service was also terrible. VERY IMPORTANT: Call a cab when your entree arrives as there likely won't be one waiting for you between 4- 7 am. if you go to vegas and stay in chinatown, this does not apply to you.Definitely better than it's been over the last few years.  I'm not sure if they waitress was over loaded, absent minded, or just bad at her job, but she kept forgetting stuff.  Another waitress kept picking up her slack, so that was good.The food was delicious and my kids loved it. I did not love the service, though.  The waitress was weird & rude. When she took my order she didn't even look at me... She just walked by, wrote what we wanted, and left with a face of ignorance.This is the first time I ate here in all my years here.  I am surprised I never tried it earlier.  There seems to be a few of these yakiniku spots in the Spring Mountain Chinatown area, although, this place is not bad.  I typically like it when I do not have to go picking my food from a salad bar full of raw meats to cook up...similar to Camelia's back in the islands for my Hawaiian folks.  This place is more like Million's, I take that back...only in the sense that you don't have to pick your own meats to cook and they serve it to you.  Might be scary for some that aren't used to cooking their own food and this style of restaurant, but it is a cultural experience.  Just remember not to make any other plans afterwards...you will be reeking like you just got done working an 8-hour shift in the kitchen.  I know some don't understand the concept of paying to cook your own food, but its a cultural thing again, so this place may not sit well with explorers that are not familiar with Asian culture.  Nothing pisses me off more than wannabe foodies that only blog about burgers and hot dogs and like to bad mouth other food genres.  So if you are not already used to this, try to keep an open mind.  But if you are very particular, do yourself a favor and pass.  Still, I have seen better, but you can surely get your fill for a decent price.I always order their Kimchi fried rice. The beef bowl isn't too bad either. I just wish their sushi roll portions were a bit bigger. They are good though. Oh and if you love sweet, order thier Honeytoast!Most of my visits here have been for lunch.  You need to ask for the lunch menu and it has some great deals.  I always get the lo mein.  The noodles are great and the dish is flavorful.  The fried rice is always good and i'm a sucker for old-school egg rolls.  I have had take out at night that hasn't been very good.They are called Island Style but once you see their menu, you will discover that they serve Hawaiin, Korean, and American dishes.

First off, if you are not actively looking for their sign, you are definitely gonna miss it. Even when I parked, I still had to look around for what door I had to go in. The door to their restaurant isnt labeled. So after sticking my head in there, I confirmed it. 

So I sit down and the nice lady hands me a menu. Just like that they put a small to go box of boiled peanuts on your table. I guess you can take it home if you dont finish? Nice. They also give you a glass of water by default. Also nice. But thats where I notice my good experience ends.

I ordered Beef Teriyaki. They bring it out accompanied with a sampler plate of kim chi which consisted of cabbage, bean sprouts, some kind of radish, and sliced hot dogs? As for the Teriyaki Beef, they actually give you a decent amount of beef and rice. (refer to my pic). 

I probably would of enjoyed my meal better if I got a refill or two on my water. As soon as I got my food, the next time I saw the server, she was bringing out my check. I asked nicely for a refill on my water. I decided to pay with cash for I had a feeling it was gonna take a while for her to come back with my refill thinking that charging my card will also take some time. I wasnt in any rush or anything but there were people waiting to sit down and eat. 

So overall, I wasnt really blown away. My bill was about 10 dollars. I tipped 2 bucks which was what I thought was more than generous considering my mediocre experience. I dont think I will be going out of my way just to eat here.Organized store but not good customer services!My friend and I swung in her last night around 10:30 after a show at the Smith Center. Both of us had missed dinner and were starving. The place was pretty dark and empty looking but once inside we found three or four other tables of late night eaters. As a whole this place is kind of a greasy spoon and a bit sticky but that really didn't bother us. I ordered the waffle breakfast with eggs and sausage and the portion was huge. My friend got the same thing only with pancakes instead. We both really liked what we had and seriously loved the butter they used. The service was fine nothing good or bad to say about that and the price was right at $24 for both of our meals and two coffees. Certainly be someplace when a late night breakfast craving hits.Wasn't impressed with their Honey Walnut Shrimp. But their deep fried King Crab was delicious! Garlic fried Tofu was tasteful.Tea Plan.. whoops "Tea Station" has been well established in Vegas for at least a bajillion years which makes it the OG for Asian beverages, or more appropriately the Triad of Asian beverages. 

Pro:

-It is open late as... I don't even know maybe 3am? 
-Offers extensive choices of beverages and limited entrees
-Board games and cards are present
-Orders usually come out pretty quick

Con: 

-$$$ (i.e. $5.75 for a large iced (insert flavor) tea that is 1/2 ice... ice cold man)
-Service is really inconsistent, sometimes its okay, and sometimes you'll probably hate them
- Parking here sucks. I recommend parking at the Chinatown plaza next door and walking over. 
- Skip the food, you'll thank me.
- Doesn't really promote social loitering. Must spend x amount per x length of stay

Side notes:
- Don't come here with intentions of studying, it won't happen.
- Possibility changed their policy on outside food? I ate my street tacos here last time.Updating my review because their service has umphed up an inch. I believe 3 stars are in order for the best boba in Vegas yet still the slowest service & employees that nudge you to leave. In addition, their rule for ALL customers at the table to purchase something is still preposterous (did I just use that word?).It was ok. Nothing to special the food was a hit or a miss .Husband and i went here on a Friday night.  Took the limo, still got charged $25 each.  That included 2 drinks, so not a bad deal. 

Being a couple, the girls are a little more reluctant to approach you.  We got 2 or 3 lap dances and ended up going VIP with one girl.  

VIP is expensive here!  $250 for the half hour, and that doesn't include the $200 bar tab. But it was well worth the money.  Those memories will last a long time...

In general, I think women tend to get better treatment in VIP, but my husband got plenty of attention as well. 

Overall a great experience, but the price will probably have us looking elsewhere next time.

P.S.  I was told if we did bottle service we wouldn't have had to pay cover.Achtung dieses Essen ist gut! 

Better food than the Hofbräuhaus Las Vegas, It has that HOME feel to it.. 
-TIME 
There was only one waitress but the place was not that busy at the time we arrived, she did take care of us (table of 5) in an expedient manner and kept checking on us from time to time. 
-TASTE 
It was nicely crafted food, not salty or bland we shared the the Farmer's Plate, The Schnitzel combo, Rinderrouladen and Cabbage rolls and they were all great with that home taste although the breaded pork was slightly dry due to overcooking I still ate it....I usually hate cabbage but here was excellent, I would go back and eat just that because its that good, the red cabbage was superb. 
I wont give you a review on each dish because I forgot what was called what.... but I do remember that their pasta was not interesting at all. everything else was great. 
-CLEANLINESS 
The place was clean as expected, the restaurant sits in an older building and it shows but overall I liked the quaint little hole in the wall place it sits in, request a booth because it seats in a more private area than on the front, the front tables feel like sitting at an old cafe/ truck stop type place. 

-THE RUNDOWN 
For the experienced and inexperienced palate, this place will bring you home, great service and great food...a bit pricey but worth it. Don't forget to try their many German Beers, they have a good selection.WAY OVERRATED. What the heck with these who rated 5 stars?  Their green curry used to be much better - it taste like flavored water now. Pad Thai Noodle is OK, but it's pretty closed to what you eat at a food court in your local shopping mall. Price is OK. Service is OK. But they don't deserve 5 stars, dude.Que Club is located in Commercial Center near Maryland and Sahara.  Commercial Center isn't the nicest area that you'll probably see, but it has gotten slightly better than what it used to be.  There's plenty of tables located inside Que Club.  A couple arcade games located near the front, and they have regulation tables, smaller tables and the extra large tables.  They also have a glow in the dark table for those who want that cosmic pool table feeling.  Prices are decent.  There's also plenty of asian food to eat around the area.We love hitting up restaurants that are way off-strip and WAY less expensive whenever we're in Vegas. 

We decided to go for some Japanese one night. Took us awhile to find this spot because of course our GPS got us lost. This restaurant is located in this dinky, scary-looking shopping center with the biggest parking lot ever and not enough stores opened. We knew we were in for some good food considering our lives were probably in danger once we parked here. (Hole-in-the-walls are awesome)

Walking into this restaurant I noticed how run-down and old the interior was. We were seated at this booth and the wallpaper was peeling and probably had some mold back there. Eeeeeep! Not the kind of hole-in-the-wall I was expecting!

I didn't feel like doing AYCE like the bf did but opted for their salmon teriyaki which came with a salad, soup, tempura and some rice. My food came out way later than the bf's order since he ordered off the AYCE menu. I'd have to say, I was still pretty hungry after my meal but definitely didn't wanna be stuffed and looking like a balloon later that night for our clubbing adventure. 

I feel like some of the fish they serve here isn't the freshest and the way they cut their sushi wasn't too generous either. 

I liked the K-Pop music videos they had playing while we were grubbing.

I also liked the fact that this place was almost completely empty when we walked in.

But then again...maybe there's a reason why it was empty (the food! bleh!)I'm not a fan of filipino fast food but when you really want filipino food and you are away from your mom, this is one of the few places you can go to and get it done right.  Really in love with their barbecue and palabok.  Sometimes I feel like the portion sizes are too big but then I rememeber I can just take it home and have it the next day as my BAON.  lolPretty good place! The girl in the front was really nice, and I suppose the whole staff too. I got the buffet to go and it was nice because you could get everything you want in the container for $8.75! The food is really basic though, like how a buffet should be. Just some food to get you full, although some of the entrees were a little dry. Overall it was good!The 3 stars are for Walmart stores, this location however gets 2 stars. It's not so much the location of the store but some of the customers it brings in....some very interesting characters which wouldn't surprise me to be found on peopleofwalmart.com.Paid for the yelp coupon to have someone tell me that I needed a new water softener.  Glad that didn't cost me the normal $80.  The service person was ok.  He was nice but like I said, it wasn't worth the cost.**Summary**

**Recommendations**
       - This is a great alternative to Quizno's and Subways. The price isn't too steep and the food's decent.This place was okay, portions were big.. I had the prime rib, baked potato and lobster bisque soup.  The soup had a big chunk of lobster in it which was a pleasant surprise but the actual bisque was a little on the salty side.  Had a good taste to it, creamier bisque, was good.  The baked potato was good, who could mess that up and the prime rib was cooked good, just wasn't as tender as I'm used to.. flavor was lacking, bland.  Waiter was real flamboyant, told us he was the waiter, cashier and I think he said even did some of the cooking.. he was attentive but a smart a$$..We ate here for the Friday night seafood buffet and the Sunday Brunch over Memorial day weekend.

Overall it was good. They had great variety of food. They had snow crab legs on Friday night. They only thing I didn't care for they were not already pre-split to where you could easily get the meat out. I felt as though I was wasting allot of meat. We usually have scissors we take with us and I wish we hadn't of forgot them. But again overall it was good. 

We then went for Sunday champagne brunch.  They had asian items, mexian, breakfast and roast beef along with may other sides. Just wished they would have had more fresh fruit selection.  Also considering it was champagne brunch we never once were offered any and didn't see any out for us to get. I seen only 3 people near us get champagne and they seemed to be locals the way they were greeted by the waitress and knew to ask for it.

Oh and don't thong about going to go get your own drink from the soda foutain. The waitress yelled at me as I picked up a glass and said that someone would be to my table to get my drink selection. 

But since we had a buy one get one half off coupon for brunch and got it for $5 a person we were happy.Food was good. Service was terrible. Our party of 6 had to ask for things multiple times, from several waiters. When he came to drop off the check, he asked if he could get us anything else. I asked for more water. He dropped off the check and never came back. The whole table, including myself, laughed in just disbelief.A friend is doing rehab here.  It's an OK place.  He had to get a bit demanding before they got his gluten free diet into their heads.  

Hallways and rooms are clean.  Some of the staff need a bit of customer service education, but there are several I've met who are quite pleasant and efficient.

It's hard reviewing a place you'd rather not be.It has been several years since I have visited this establishment and not much had changed in the many years since. I have always liked the open grill as you walk in. We had a cocktail as we waited for friends to arrive, unfortunately the draft beer was flat and somewhat stale. We then took our seats and were greeted promptly by the wait staff. The overall service was friendly and efficient.

We ordered our food which was delivered in an appropriate amount of time considering how busy the place was. One of our party ordered the porterhouse medium well, it came to us well done and charred on one side. I had the Smoked Prime Rib, it was very good and full of flavor. We as a group were not impressed with the cheesy potato's. They had an odd consistency, and flavor was not that appetizing given how they were raved about.

Over all a good experience, not sure how soon I would go back. Due to the drive not sure it was worth the travel time.I can agree with my fellow yelper.. they are sometimes very slow, not only at the pharm. but at the regular check out.

believe it or not I like Wal-Green for their selection on Toothpaste.
They are a bit pricey to, thier sale prices are what average cost is. I only buy sale items from wal-g

They will also refill your ink cartrigdes for cheap, I've done that a few times already.Pretty decent place to get a nice massage.  The prices are the bomb.  You get a very good massage at a reasonable price.  What they charge you in the casino is a major ripoff.  If you are looking for a "spa casino experience,"  (high prices & faux decor), this is not the place for you.  Think of it as more of a "massage clinic."

You go in, get a very good massage, and get out.  That's how I like it.  No fluff, no high prices.

This place is clean and the people giving you the massage are very attentive to your needs.  Since you are face down most of the time, does your massage feel better if you are in one of those pretty casino spas?  Heck no.

Reasonable price, best kept secret in town.  Come here and save your money for food & drink.  For those of you that rely on pictures of the SPA, all the pictures on their website are just decorations.

I believe in TRUTH IN ADVERTISING.  It's no shame to advertise that you are set up like a massage clinic.  They could get better ratings if they didn't use all those "fake" spa pictures on their website.  Don't be embarrassed.  You win on price, quality, and value.My bro swears by this place and every time they go to LV, they always make a pit-stop to KJ Kitchen. I never knew LV had a Chinatown. LV's Chinatown is different - it's actually CLEAN!

This is a pretty big restaurant and a lot of people frequent this establishment. I saw a lot of Chinese patrons eating here which is definitely a good sign.

Our party ordered the following:
-Shrimp with Lobster Sauce ($12)
-Sweet and Sour Pork ($8)
-Lo-Mein House Special ($9)
-Beef with Chinese Broccoli ($8)

The food was descent for the prices. I did find the food to be super greasy. I needed to drink a lot of water and green tea to coat the stomach. The portions were generous and we had leftovers, which we couldn't bring with us. 

Service was good and attentive, and by the time we left, there was a line out the door. 

This place was far from the strip. So if you feel like local Asian food, come to Chinatown.I was sent here to get x-rays done when I was in a car accident.  Nothing got screwed up, so I was happy with the job they did.  The guy that did my x-rays was pleasant to chat with while he worked.I would definitely stay here again. I wasn't expecting luxury by any means but I also wasn't expecting it to be as decent as it was. We needed a last minute place to stay and booked a room for that night for $50. You get what you pay for, and those that complain about how grungy it was should have known that when they booked it. It is pretty far off the strip, but not nearly as far as Hard Rock. They sell $1.50 Bud Lights at the bar inside which is always a plus. I joined the Owl Club to get the $200 free slot play. I didn't win anything but I didn't lose anything either. The people that worked the counter were friendly and accommodating. The room was clean and had a television, what more can you ask for? Like I said, I definitely would stay here again when I was looking for a cheap hotel option in Vegas.

Oh and just a warning, the walls are REALLY thin and you can hear pretty much everything going on in the room next to you. If you are going to Vegas for a quiet experience you are in the wrong place anyways.

Also, DO NOT go to the Hooters inside the hotel. Its absolutely awful. (see my other review)I give it 3.5 stars!

I'm a fan of Schlotzsky's, have been since I was a kid. 

For those who've never been, it's basically a sub shop. It's their bread more than anything that sets them apart. Their bread is sponge like, hard to explain but tasty.

I've known Schlotzsky's forever, and I noticed this place out of the corner of my eye driving through Vegas. So we stopped in. I ordered the Original, my gf ordered the smoked turkey and guacamole and our friend ordered the chicken chipotle. We all ordered the medium size, unless you're super starving or sharing, stick with the medium. The large is just huge. 

I was totally satisfied, and so was our traveling companion. My gf though, not so much. I think I know why. The smoked turkey they use is really smoking. I wasn't sure if it was turkey or johnny walker black label in the sandwich. I think if it was regular oven roasted turkey, she'd like it a lot more. 

I'd go back, and I wish we had them in LA.The store is very spacious and contains a McDonald's and other mini-stores inside.
There was a small spill in one of the isles and I was surprised how fast the janitor got there. 
I made my way toward the tech section and noticed that there were no employees to be found. There wasn't even a person manning the mobile section as there should be. 
The lines were a bit long , I spent a good 9 minutes in line.
Overall I had an OK experience and will be returning again.What can you say about Wal-Mart... It's Wal-Mart!

I think the thing I like is the super-store so I can get everything in one spot.  No need to shop around, overall they have the lowest prices and if you found lower, it wouldn't be worth the cost of gas to save a few cents.

I will buy pantry items but don't trust the meat and the produce is OK but kind of lower grade products.It's like every other walmart; it's busy on the weekends, friendly workers/customer service is hit or miss, there's usually some level of random items totally out of place (which is not the employees fault; in a store so big it's going to take a bit before someone notices a DVD in the cracker section). 

One thing I have noticed is that the outdoor area in the garden center is often very difficult to get a cart around in. Right after Christmas it was packed with boxes of clearance items and I made the mistake of trying to look and got my cart stuck. Went there again today and I was looking at the plants and there were bags of soil on the ground that blocked the path. I guess if you head toward that section, you better leave your cart behind if you want to get through.Grade: C

Think about it. Italian food in Verona, WI... Yeah. The bartendresses are the hottest in Dane County. This is worth the trip out to Verona.I couldn't give this place a better score because of the prices and the selection, but that's not really why anyone shops here. It's a good place for those to get a few last minute groceries for those who live downtown. I just finally went to Fresh Madison Market and might start going there from now on. This place is closer though, so who knows.The hotel is pretty nice and the staff are helpful.  two complaints: the wireless internet is very slow, and the housekeeping staff is very loud and woke everyone up in my room - they spoke very loudly and were throwing things around for about 45 minutes.  we called and complained.Great homemade noodles. Below average thai green curry. Average tofu. No air conditioning even on 80+ degree humid day.Like the other guy said - useful if another restaurant is packed (like the Old Fashioned on the night  I went there).  

Wouldn't be my first choice though since the scene is completely dead here.  There were a couple elderly couples there, but that's basically it.  Not exactly where you want to spend your sat night...

Pluses include good prices on specials here (greek/mediterranean mostly), and a very flamboyant, entertaining main waiter.Not sure who the other reviewer worked with, but I've never had a bad experience with Rubin's.  Some pieces are lackluster, but the store is generally reliable.  Alternative comp is Century House.Great bar!

But the food here stinks. Nothing I hate more than being severed cold fries.This place is crazy.  It has always been busy when I've stopped in, and it's clear why.  They have a helpful staff, huge selection, and reasonable prices.  The one thing that could make it better would be a larger parking lot.  If you're coming to pick something up on any weekend evening, I recommend coming by foot or bike because parking gets limited.  In the past I have had to wait 5-10 minutes in my idling car before a spot became available.Once you get in, it's fine ... the problem is that you may die waiting. 

Maybe I was spoiled with Columbia / St. Mary's hospitals in Milwaukee, but this location took nearly two hours during the early afternoon of a work day. I sat there with a potential blood clot; old SARS victims were hacking away and I could have sworn that an elderly person sat there with cob webs growing on her. Horrible. 

It gets a positive review overall because the care and patient care is considerate, kind and intelligent.I've been to Takara many times in the past, and ordered takeout recently only to be disappointed.  As far as I'm concerned, their entrees and cooked dishes are far better than their sushi.  The soba noodles are delicious, the sushi, not so much.  I ordered a Naruto and an Iso fantastic roll, both of which were gigantic.  I don't think you should have to cut a piece of sushi into pieces just to be able to eat it, but with the rolls at Takara, you do.  The fish seemed semi fresh, and the rice was well cooked, but both the rolls I ordered at least 3 inches in diameter and had an inch layer thick of rice, which made them hard to eat.  One positive thing I will say is that their house ginger dressing is amazing, and I'd recommend the house salad.  Overall, I really used to like this place, but my most recent experience was a bit sub par.  Skip the sushi and go for the entrees.Good Ritas, but the meal was a litte underwhelming. My rice and beans seemed to have that look of having been plated hours previously and the pork tacos had no real zing. My wife's rellano was nice but had one too many cheeses stuffed in it. Eat inside for more comfortable tables.Excellent food.  Horrible front-end service.Pretty tasty, but accepts no cards, and usually has a long wait. I can't say it stands above other pancake/breakfast places around the city but it's certainly not bad and very cheap!Generally pretty good.  As takeout Chinese places go, the food is decently seasoned, not oversalted or oversauced,  and reasonably fresh.  A few items on the menu lean towards the greasy - the chicken and blackbean hofun noodles, for example, are difficult enough to eat without being over-lubricated with cooking oil.  The soups are slightly bland - while the idea of a soup with dumplings and fish balls is a solid one, the broth is bit on the weak side.

However, there are a few less-standard menu items worth trying - the "lemongrass pork chop", while not strictly traditional, is moist and tender and full of good lemongrass flavor.  The weekend congee menu is also the real deal - it's homestyle enough that it attracts a large crowd of international students, and the congee is delicious (which is saying something for a rice porridge).  They don't skimp on the additions (I'm partial to the sliced pork and preserved egg), and the available special appetizers (spicy beef tripe, fried bread, chicken feet with black bean) are worth trying.  Their homemade chili-garlic sauce is a winner, too - spicy and garlicky, it's worth picking up a jar (which they sell at the counter).  It's oily, so is best used in small quantities, but is really quite delicious.

Service is primarily counter-based, and a bit on the charmingly grumpy side, although some may find it less charming than others.Pretty good - pricier than we were expecting!I have a love-hate relationship with Bluephie's.

Love: their food is delicious and rather inexpensive. I've been for brunch and lunch, and have never been disappointed.

Hate: they act like a fine dining restaurant, but serve diner food and have plastic menus. Make up your mind, Bluephie's!

Bluephie's also lists itself as a vodka bar, which I've never gotten to try, but sounds like it would be pretty legit.

Must try: blueberry muffin french toast. Seriously, you'll be upset if you don't order it, especially if someone else at the table does.Good sports bar atmosphere....go there for beer 'n' Badgers, but not the food.  The nachos were the worst I've ever had--seriously.  And what was that other horrendous concoction?  Oh yes. PIZZA QUESADILLAS.  if it had been up to me, I wouldn't have ordered it, because...C'MON, MAN!  Pizza. Quesadillas.  Two words that have no business being next to each other.  And as expected...Really. Truly. Disgusting.

But the Hopalicious was A-okay.This is my favorite place to come for fish fry (fish and chips to anyone outside of the Midwest).  There's not one thing I dislike about this dish here.  Perfectly battered cod with a crispy outside and moist flaky center, perfectly cooked and seasoned fries, and a great tarter sauce (so often overlooked).  It is all you can eat which includes both the fries and the cod.  There's no reason you should leave this place hungry.   One plate is usually enough anyways. 

If you like the Friday fish fry but want to avoid the crowd I would suggest visiting Quivey's on a Wednesday.  They offer the same all you can eat special for both lunch and dinner but without the hour and a half wait.  

So about the service.  The last few times I've been here the service has been great.   Unfortunately this hasn't always been the case, and I've known others that have had a similar experience.  I hope things have turned around.  I really enjoy dinning here and for a time the food was the only thing I found exceptional.It was okSufficient Vietnamese food for Madison. They serve alvacado smoothies. The woman owner is a little snooty and not great for take-out, therefore, they don't get 4 stars.Overall a decent chinese restaurant. Service is quick and always ready in 10-15 minutes. One caveat to all of this is: AVOID THE SWEET AND SOUR SAUCE. It is a total let down. As an alternative may I suggest the Hunan chicken (not as spicy as you'd think), the General Tso's (also not as spicy, but spicy enough for me), or the Crab Rangoon (don't even think about reheating them - they must be consumed in one sitting). 

One more thing to avoid - the low mein. It's a bit flavorless and limp. I keep trying it, hoping I just got a bad batch, but no such luck.Perhaps my disdain for Phoenix Sky Harbor is bleeding over into the big US Airways carrier there, but I'm hardly enthused about the joint.

Firstly, it always seems that they can't pull it together. Southwest suffers this same fate here, so perhaps it really is the curse of the airport, but my gates always change, things are always delayed, and that's a serious pain at PHX.

What I do like is that you've got plenty of options. As noted, they are indeed a big carrier at this 'port, so you've got a bunch of departures and arrivals to choose from, and you can link up to a lot of places across the US. 

Are they my favorite carrier? Hardly. Kinda chintzy. But they sometimes win the price/convenience war and they're not so bad that you won't take them up on saving a few bucks every so often in PHX.If you actually go by the term "A-OK" that goes along with 3 stars on the Yelp rating system, then Alterations... is just that.  I give them a fair amount of regular business for both dry cleaning and tailoring (hey, I'm a 23 year old, trying to look like a 23 year old, in a 12 year old's body).  The actual work done is good and very standardized.  For example: I wanted a shirt taken in; it was done, and done well, but when I showed up a few hours earlier than what was listed on my ticket, they turned me away...(?)

I would recommend interfacing with the men as opposed to the women (I just feel like their customer service is less rigid, more my stilo).It is always about service....and Saturday night, I think that service was lacking in so many ways.

I am going to start at the end of the night first.  There were 9 of us at the table, all of us talking and eating.  Slowly but surely, the server removed our plates.  When she removed the last plate...she plopped down the check...even after we told her that it was my friends birthday.  I asked my birthday friend if we were getting dessert and she asked why..."because here is the check"  So my friend asked her if we can see a dessert menu.  The server replied, "Oh I am sorry...since nobody said anything to me, I assumed that you were all finished."  Wow...what a way to upsell the tab...

i have to say that even with that exchange....the server had absolutely no personality.  The food was good.  (The wine pairings for $30 is what peaked our interest...but because one of our friends wasn't going to participate - - -her pregnancy may have had something to do with that - - - the table wasn't allowed to take part in the wine dinner.  BOO!!!)  The eggplant looked good, my burger was, well, a burger, and the desserts were amazing.  And one couldn't go wrong with 1/3 off bottles of wine.  Especially nice since I had an awesome Shiraz.  

I wouldn't outrule going here again.  I didn't get the "wine bar" feel of the place especially since the food wasn't the most wine appealing.  I just hope our next server has more PAZAZZ!!!!!!I never heard of this outfit until I moved over here from L.A. at the beginning of '09.  I see on their Website that they have stores all the way across the South & Southwest, but not in California.  Now, it has taken me all this year-and-a-half plus to try the place, a stone's throw from my house, but today I finally made it!

I found a clean, comfortable dining room here, an easy to follow menu, friendly service, & low prices.  That's certainly a start!  SO, I ordered a burger, fries, & a vanilla shake.  Creative, huh?    :-))

My "Whataburger" was a good husky burger with better taste than a Whopper or Jumbo Jack, I think.  The fries were hot & crispy & the shake good...  not as special as the ones at Jack in the Box or Carl's Jr., but also much less expensive.

Whataburger Combo w/shake upgrade:  $5.83

Everything was right about this place, & I like it!Stopped here on a Saturday early afternoon, because someone had recommended it to me. We split a meatball parm hero, and a slice of cheese pizza. Everything was fairly good. In fairness, I bet the pizza is better freshly made than reheated, so I do plan to go to try. I am really interested in trying some pasta dishes and definitely the lasagna. 
The place was completely dead when we were there, but it sounds like this place does most of its business with the office lunch crowd.  Plus we were there at a late lunch hour for a Saturday. So no big shock. We talked to Pino for a bit.  He is a very nice man. He is from south of Naples, and he has that European spirit to him. He speaks passionately about his ingredients, about Italy and so on. 
If I had just gotten this same food delivered, I am not sure if I would make a point to be back soon. But knowing more about the ingredients he uses, and his variety of dishes, I am looking forward to going back and trying other things including a freshly made pizza.Ya know, this place isn't half bad for a bowling alley. I came here last night with some friends of mine to do the cosmic bowling and we actually had a good time. From the outside it doesn't look like anything special, but the insides in pretty decent shape.

There's a bar inside, and you can get your drink and food on in here if you like, or take it with you to the lanes.  The bartender we had was sort of cranky and kept spewing all these rules about how it's one drink at a time and we had to get bracelets to prove we were of age if we wanted more drinks. I'm sorry, I thought prohibition ended a long time ago? I was unaware that beer should be rationed for adults. If I go to a bar, they can't seem to shove enough booze in my face, but here? ONE AT A TIME PLEASE!  I obliged since I didn't want the bartender punching me in the face for being sassy...just sayin.

Lanes were nice, but halfway through our game the scoring thing died so we had to switch lanes.  Kind of a pain in the butt, but hey, it's not like we're going to quit halfway through!  Staff was nice and friendly, overall not the typical dirty bowling alleys that I'm used too.After an exhaustive move on Friday, my friend Austin and I were completely exhausted.  I had been up since 4 AM, moved across town and was ready to eat my right arm if I didn't feed myself and Austin for helping me out.

I knew this place was close to me, but its literally less then a mile from my new place. Austin and I cruised in, starving, and took a seat.  I don't know what I was expecting with the decor here, but it was a bit divey for what I was expecting.  Not bad divey, just more then I had anticipated.  I was emaciated, so I could have cared less at that point, but it was "cute" none the less.

Anyways, there was a bunch of TV's over the bar with some hockey games on and other sports stuff.  A few old dudes were drinking beer and watching the game, and Austin and I sat and stared off into a coma while we waited for our server.

We both went with burgers, but I got the sweet potato fries, and Austin went with the regular fries.  My burger and fries were tasty, as was Austins (at least he said he liked it and it was quite tasty.)

Anyways, there's a few points as to why I deducted a star for this review.  First off, the booth we sat in was worthless. I literally SUNK into the booth seat and there was nothing there.  No cushioning, busted springs and it felt horrifically uncomfortable! Made me want to get up and leave!  I was so exhausted that I didn't have the strength, but I was miserable physically while I sat here. Felt like I was sitting on a piece of worthless wood with crappy vinyl over it.

Secondly, even though our service was fine overall, we waited FOREVER for our bill, and I mean FOREVER. We were hot, tired and physically wiped out, and we had to chase the girl down and beg her to get our bill.  She walked by our table at least a zillion times, and even though we had clearly been done eating for quite some time, she completely ignored us. I had tried to get her attention politely with eye contact, as did Austin, but nothing.  Finally, after quite a while, I hollered for her, and she brought us our bill like nothing was wrong.  Annoying!

Overall, I thought the place was okay.  I will probably go back, as it seems to be a fun place to hang out with some dart boards in the back and the food is pretty decent.Not as nice as other savers I've been too. Maybe I was just disappointed because I drove a half hour and didn't find anything.  Also, they don't have any 50% off colors on Fridays which was a bummer too.Finally made it out to Great Wall for dim sum. I've been hearing so much about this place but I am hardly ever in this area so it was sitting in my "to try" list for quite some time. Walking in, I thought, this is gonna be legit. The place was packed to the rim with asian people waiting to get their dim sum on. The decor and vibe reminded me a lot of dim sum restaurants in LA's chinatown circa 1990's (ABC seafood to be exact). 

We didn't have to wait long before we were seated. We tried their sui mai, shrimp rice noodle, deep fried shrimp and chives wrapped in bean curd, and honestly I forgot the rest because it was all nothing memorable and I usually have a great memory. The chives and shrimp bean curd roll was probably my favorite of the bunch but I'm a sucker for any dumpling, cake, roll with chives :) It was something I haven't seen at other dim sum restaurants before so I enjoyed that.

In summary, it was okay. It satisfied my dim sum craving but... would I come back? Probably not. I live in Chandler and I find my two go-to dim sum spots there (Phoenix Palace & China King) much tastier. && I only have to drive 5 minutes to get there. Actually, if I lived near Great Wall, I'd probably make the drive to Phoenix Palace. Yep.. I think it's that much better!Not Bad! Best Produce in the Valley!It often smells like portapotties outside but if you can withstand it the tacos inside are decent. You can call your order in ahead which is quite convenient since it seems everyone in line ahead of you takes forever to decide on their order. The salsas are good but there all out in the open :/I went to Oriental for lunch on a recent weekday with a family member who was in town.  I've been here 3-4 times previously, but it had been almost a year since my last visit.  There was a decent sized crowd when we ordered our takeout.  The wait based on the crowd size seemed a little bit long, but not horrible.

I ordered a side of crab rangoon (4 pieces) and a bowl of chicken fried rice.  The rangoon were great.  Nice and crispy, with a very flavorful filling on the inside...I'd say there was almost too much cream cheese filling...but how can that be a bad thing???  The chicken fried rice was ok.  Pretty sure that I've ordered this on previous visits.  One thing that I didn't remember (or maybe it has changed) was that there were bean sprouts in the meal.  Bleh.  I'm not a fan.  Luckily, they weren't too prevalent, but still, I did not like that.  

Will I go to Oriental Express again?  Oh probably.  At the very least, the rangoon are quite good, and I do remember having some good chicken teriyaki there.  If I get the fried rice again, I'll have to remember to order without sprouts.People love to rag on Desert Sky Mall, like it's an American Idol contestant or a homeless person. Like your criticism is essential to its existence.

"It's too small. They have nothing good. It's so cheap and dirty. It's a shit mall. You're better off going to Arizona Mills or Arrowhead."

Like the people who drive all the way out to Westgate and still manage to muster the inanity to complain of how it isn't Scottsdale, these same jibbajabberers clearly have no grasp on the area and its economic status. They don't live here (surprise), and make a point to mention EVERY TIME they visit the west side how much they hate it.

Yeah, fuck you too.

Sure, Desert Sky is ghetto. Because IT'S IN the ghetto.

There's a reason so many people take the bus to this mall. It's not because they're environmentally aware. 

To better illustrate the socio-economic climate of Desert Sky, I have prepared a neatly compiled bullet-point presentation. 

* At any given moment, one or more stores in DSM is going out of business. Some don't even make it over the 6 month hump. So if you see something in that smoke shop you really like, better get while you're there, because next year it'll be a perfumery. 

* They can't even afford decent food court food. Other malls have Orange Julius and Hot Dog on a Stick. They get Flaming Wok (who carries the exact same menu as Panda Express but still manages to somehow be less authentic) and a Subway counter staffed by seemingly invisible sandwich artists. 

* And you thought the "free samples" guy at your mall was annoying. DSM has the most aggressive kiosk workers in all of mall-hood. Their cell phone plan is such an affordable value that they're willing to barrel through other patrons and ambush you behind signs and walls to let you know how awesome their deals are. Sure, you didn't want that sugar-coated nut, but at least nobody was injured in the process. Except maybe the underpaid workers whose nut-harvesting skills were exploited by their cheapskate employer. 

* It's pretty common knowledge that one of the department stores (hint; shares it's name with an island and a type of blue-colored liqueur) will issue you a store credit card on the spot. No application process. No waiting period. No wonder everyone comes here packing heat. All these people in holey shirts and torn up jeans walking out of stores with brand new stereos and speakers, their faces shifty with looks of guilt and/or disbelief. 

* The "special attractions" here blow. Business is so bad the caricaturist is closed on weekends. ON WEEKENDS. I went to the mall yesterday and the Santa they brought in had ONE kid waiting in line to get their picture taken. One. People can't even afford to TELL Santa what they want for Christmas. Woe upon the world.

* The Steve and Barry's here is closing down. How FUBAR'd is the economy when not even the combined endorsements of Amanda Byrnes, Sarah Jessica Parker, and the WWE can sell your 9 dollar jeans?

* I have on more than one occasion been asked by fellow patrons not to eat my Pretzel Time in front of their kids, or they'll be forced to explain to them why they can't afford such snacks. I would have given them my pretzel, but being originally from Philadelphia I douse mine in yellow mustard, and 99 percent of the people I've come across find it repulsive.

* Did I mention that this is one of the only malls (if not the only) in the whole state that can only afford to have ONE story?

So please, before you pass judgment on this calamitous and downtrodden mall, please take into consideration the geography and economy of the area and its consequences on neighboring businesses.

Translation: STFU, n00b.Desert Sky did such a good job of reinventing itself as a big neighborhood mall for a largely Hispanic, working-class neighborhood that the Wall Street Journal did an article about it.

If you're not from the neighborhood, visiting is kind of an anthropological experience, and you need to be up for that more than for "quick! find what I need!" shopping. One former store is now Curacao, which is sort of the Latin American version of the old Service Merchandise, only with a focus on offering consumer credit to the underbanked. (Remember catalog showrooms? So 1980s!) 

The mall stores are a mix of familiar retail chains and local stores. The local ones do come and go; but in our chain-centric world, I think it's cool to see local entrepreneurial spirit. Apparently the locals do, too, as on a weekend afternoon, the place is packed.

Another entire former department store -- I think it's the old Mervyn's -- is now an indoor swap meet. So really, you will have the best time if you're in the mood for an indoor swap meet but also need to pick up a couple of things from a major chain store and also have a craving for some Mexican street food and maybe spiced nuts. Desert Sky can do that thing, and it can do it with mariachi performances in center court.My rating is mostly for the service, which was incredibly friendly :).  However the way the food is setup is like a buffet style but they dish it out for you is cheesy and cafeteria like.  And, as always with that style, you're never really sure how long that food has been sitting there.  We had the teriyaki chicken with white rice and it looked delicious but the sauce was so unbelievably plain that it was not good at all.  Egg rolls were average.  Maybe if they have something like General Tsao's (which I didn't see on the menu) I would try it.I love pizza but didnt like howthe edges of the deep dish were so hard :( next time will order thin crust, sauce is really good here:)Decent Mexican but far from Top Shelf.  

They are a bit overpriced for what you get as I got one taquito with beans and rice for $8.  

Salsa is a bit watery for my taste and not spicy enough.  

Rice and beans were good and that is more than a lot of Mexican places can say.  

Service was great I got a drink refill before I even asked for it and that means a lot to me.I thought Top Shelf was good! As good as Macayo's or Valle Luna.  Had the grilled fish tacos. Fish was good but was served as a typical taco with flour tortilla, tomato, lettuce and cheese. That was kind of a disappointment. Others in the party enjoyed their food and I really liked the rice and beans! Service was great!Not the only Fry's in this neighborhood, but definitely the better of the two. This location is a large Fry's (but not a Marketplace store), and it's starting to show its age. It's still clean, however, and despite the feeling it always gives me of being too full of products (mountains of them), it's not cluttered.

This location has a decent produce section, a deli and separate bakery, liquor aisles, a floral section, a bunch of freezer cases, and a full service pharmacy. Service at this location is good, and there always seem to be employees around if you need assistance.

The rest of the mall area is dying, with the next door Walmart having closed its doors in 2008. That's good news for Fry's shoppers, because it's now possible to get in and out of the parking lot without a near crash.I've had 4/6 of my tattoos done here. They do an incredible job and all of the artists are really professional and amazing at what they do. My reason for giving it less than 5 stars is that I often feel like their pricing is a bit wonky. 

For instance, my first visit there was inspired by two very small tattoos I was interested in getting. I learned the shop minimum was $50 and each tattoo was small enough that that is all they would cost. When I went to the front to pay, they charged me the shop minimum twice....since I had left with two tattoos. Now, if you had connected the two, they would not have equaled more than the shop minimum, and if they did, they were definitely not DOUBLE the price. This perturbed me, but I still came back in the future as they did an incredible job.

My most recent experience was even more infuriating as I paid in full for a piece that was going to take two sessions. At the end of my first session, I scheduled my follow-up and the receptionist wrote down PAID IN FULL next to my name. After the second session ended, I was then charged an additional $150 on top of what I had already spent and was told that I hadn't, in fact, paid in full the first time. 

Word to the wise, get everything they say IN WRITING! The receptionist wrote this comment in pencil and it easily could have been erased. Just a warning! But besides this fact, I do feel every piece I received there was done superbly, even with the additional charges tacked on. Just don't appreciate being told something and it changing in the future.I love this place's prices - and usually their wide variety - cannot be beat. But 2x now I've discovered ants in my home shortly after shopping there thanks to produce left on the counter.  And I HATE ants.  So I'm just going to be lazy and shop at Safeway :(Bavarian Point has very good German food, but is a heck of a drive to get to. I also made the pilgrimage for a friends Birthday. 

I stuck with what I know: Brats and Saurkraut. The Saurkraut was delicious. The Brats were pretty good, although I think that they gave me a sausage mixture. 

Different friends ordered different plates, so I got to see a little of everything that was ordered. 

Helpings are generous, Décor is dated, menu is solid German, and salad bar is questionable (is it German? or just a salad bar?)...Was In the area and found it on yelp ..liked the picture of the stuffed burger so ordered 2 to go  and went over the the butcher side and bought allot of wonderful stuff, pot pie and steaks, loved it..!! as i went through the bakery to pick up my burgers bought some sweets ...yum... Not so Impressed with the burgers ..Wanted to get back to the butcher so I took a friend for lunch and It was confirmed the restaurant sucks....:( sorry the rolls hard my friend "steak" awful they told us the NY strip was thicker ..??!?!? I cant see how It was soo thin...my Philly  had hard bun the meat was to thick and awful ..But I will continue to shop at the meat market  always looking for good quality meat and they do  ..Something goes very wrong with the meat on it way to the resturant ..!?!? Maybe a new COOK oh and the stringbeans with tomato side from a can disgusting ....SORRY ..!!!?!Extremely slow service, if you order pizza it is quick, otherwise slow.  Quality has really dropped.Its ok, but I got sick from the corn dog. The cherry limeaide is alwayse a winner though.The big Julio's is closed and transformed into a breakfast place but I am so happy that Julio's Too has survived. Good, cheap, Mexican food. Two people could easily split a combo for a super-cheap lunch. Their take out is fast or there is a small seating area inside the restaurant. Or, to pick up dinner on the way home you can call ahead and have it waiting for you. I love that they serve beer bottles to go!I used to enjoy this for lunch on occasion - Sorry to say it CLOSED a couple months ago... I think "Julio's Too" is still open.Went here on Friday because they were having a great deal on some skillets I have been looking at. I had gone to Sur la Table earlier in the day for another item and my experiences at these two places were quite different.

Everyone here was very nice and quickly asked if I needed any help as I was browsing which was great. However, whenever I asked a specific question they had little to no knowledge of a good answer. Anything from "I think this is priced wrong" to "Do you know the difference between this style pan and that?" each question was met with fumbling around for words or them needing to ask a manager... and I thought I was asking pretty simple questions.

The selection here is great for specialty items, but if you are going here for pots, pans or knives my experience with the three different people that I spoke with was that they knew very little about the products they sold and had zero hands on experience with them.

Very nice people... just wouldn't feel comfortable buying anything off their recommendations and will look elsewhere to buy my equipment.Oh Kona Grill, how you bring back memories.  

I first discovered Kona Grill's happy hour back in college, the lure of the $2.50 Ladies Margarita and the half price happy hour menu fit right in to my college budget!  Although the shopping after too many $2.50 Ladies Margarita's didn't, but that's a story for another day.

I went to Happy Hour at Kona yesterday for the first time in awhile, and oddly enough, it was with some of my old college buddies.  We were excited for cheap food and drinks, because even though we aren't in college anymore, we still love cheap eats!

It was a bit cold and rainy yesterday, so we were able to easily find a table on the patio (HH is only available on the patio and bar....so getting a seat sometimes turns into a stakeout!). We were a bit disappointed to see that the HH menu was a bit different than before; instead of just all the sushi and apps and pizzas being half price, they were bunched into groups by price.  Some of the prices were still half off, but others, like the Edamame ($4.00 regularly and $3.00 during HH) were not that great of a deal.  Being that it we were quite hungry, we ordered some sushi, edamame, calamari, chicken tacos, avocado egg rolls and the potstickers.  All of the food was much like we remembered, with the calamari being our overwhelming favorite, so crispy with the spicy sauce, yum!  We were a bit disappointed to see that the tacos no longer came with the yummy fried rice like they used to, but it wasn't the end of the world.  The sushi was good, but not the best I have ever had, but fresh nonetheless.  The biggest bummer about the sushi was that most of the rolls that we wanted weren't on the HH menu, especially since they were only $6.00 to begin with the HH sushi rolls were all $3.00....didn't make sense to us.

I know I will go back to Kona, but only during happy hour, I don't love it enough to pay full price!Good happy hour prices. Vegas roll here is delish and so is there pizza.Pet peeves of mine include expensive sushi that doesn't wow me, oh, and snobs. The customers who drive up in their super expensive cars and think this place is the s***? Hmm.. doesn't impress me. That's Scottsdale for ya.

I do have to admit that the Sweet Chili Glazed Salmon was pretty good (shrimp and pork fried rice, with veggies), but the California rolls were just meager and overpriced. Kris had the pad thai noodles, which he says was pretty tasty. Very white-washed, don't expect any type of authentic asian food. I believe I said this place is like a P.F. Chang's, but Japanese style.We hadn't been here in a while. After shopping, we decided to have an early dinner. I order the Pad Thai and my wife had the Maui Tacos. 
For me, since the Maui Tacos aren't on the menu, the way they were made looked much more different than when they were on the menu. The fried rice looked wet  and the tacos weren't wrapped as nice. But my wife still loved it.
My Pad Thai was filled with a lot of chicken and shrimp. The chicken meat was cut is large chunks. Overall, I would rate this entree a B.
Our lemonade was really watered down. I let mine set for about 10 minutes before drinking it. I should have asked for another one, but I was almost done with my meal and had been drinking water.
The server, Diane, was polite and knowledgeable. She made sure our glasses were filled with water.Nice patio and large enough for a crowd.  X-mas lights and the water fountain reminds me of the Friends opening credit - Yes, I'll be there for you!

Came here with my gang and it was buffet style but regardless I must rate the place. We had a nice baby green salad with some balsamic vinaigrette, but things went downhill from here fast. Let's start with the pork; Cough! Cough! (Pound the chest!).  Someone pass me some water cause as much as I chewed it didn't go down - It was so dry it soaked up my saliva! Atop of it were some chili flakes so that didn't help much. The stuffed chicken came with a nice creamy sauce, but I don't recall what it tasted like.  The pork overwhelmed me and to add insult to injury don't serve mashed potatoes to dry out my tongue more!

Regardless, a friend of mine made a great point; we are served what we did not order.  Saved!  Therefore, I shall return on another visit to give my full report so stay tuned!Always a fun time! A great time to meet up with friends and taste all the great beers & food around the Scottsdale.Great place to hang out and relax, especially during night time and on the weekend.  Good location, just a few miles south of Old Town Scottsdale.  This may even been the nicest location I've seen for years.Let me put it this way yelpers...I would not request to go to this place, but if my group wanted to go here I wouldn't have to be dragged kicking and screaming. 
Walking up, this place looks pretty cool. It reminds me of an upscale Gilligan's. The decor is awesome, with some of the comfy seats. The seating in this lounge makes it easy to talk with your group or even start a conversation with a new group. 
Unfortunately this is where it takes a turn for the worst. My experience was short lived at drift. The staff was a little snotty for my taste (People we are here to have a good time, put a smile on), and the drinks were pretty weak for what the price was. Not a good combo. My advice is get a little toasted at a cheap place before you go here. Their drinks aren't worth the money. 
I only stayed for one beverage at this place, not by any fault of drift I have to say. I had a creepy guy follow me around the whole night. It goes back to that great seating that makes it easy to make good friends...I guess it was a little too much of a good thing.Ordered fajitas-pretty good 
My sister go chilie relleno- even better

It's kinda cool here outside seating-although river feels a little cheesy/man made/disney like-I don't really get it? 

Seemed a little pricey $15 meals-They are huge though
For 3 women we barely ate half our meal so definitely we should have split 

3 meals with 5 drinks total (3 house wines & 2 beers) was $75 plus tip 
$90 total seemed stiff to me but I live in Gilbert with 3 little kids so maybe I am bad judge of eating out pricing ??? 

They should really give out free chips & salsa-If they start doing that then I would give them 4 starsCute place and good food, the green chile Mac was to die for. Would have definitely give this 4 stars but our service was just horrible. It was late night so it was empty, which would make it seem simple to serve us. But I got attitude on several occasions. When I asked about the free chips and salsa for checking in I got eyes rolled at me. And the same when I asked for to go boxes. I don't know maybe he was mad we weren't ordering alcohol? Either way the food was good and the hot sauce was bomb we took two bottles home with us. I would come back but hopefully get a better server!Had lunch yesterday here and experienced a bit of a hiccup but wanted to review to compliment the management. I ordered the shrimp tempura bento box, which comes with miso soup, rice, spring roll, a pork wonton, and a salad. I was kinda picking at the salad, and ended up finding a feather in it. Lord knows how it got there, but hey, random stuff happens. 
The waitress was visibly very grossed out, as she wouldn't even touch said feather with her hands. The manager came over, profusely apologized, and let me know that they had taken care of the meal. I hadn't expected that, just asked for a different salad from a new batch. I felt he dealt with the issue very professionally without making me feel like I had created a huge deal. 
We were too early for HH specials, but I have enjoyed them before. While this isn't my favorite sushi joint, I would go back for HH again despite my experience. I was overall impressed with how the manager dealt with what was obviously just an unfortunate mishap.Food was delicious! If you are unsure what "authentic" Mexican food is, double check with your server about he plate you are interested in before ordering. Great outdoor patio. Slow service. Great house margarita!I am totally listening to the 80's Wild Wild West song while writing this review and it is totally perfect.  Travis makes an mean drink and wears a handle bar mustache and derby bartender hat.  The have wine flights which is a big positive plus wine on tap which is interesting to try.  The place is a little strange b/c it is cowboy/ranchy but the food is very modern and VERY GOOD.  It is a weird vibe.  Service was good too.  Crowd a little strange.  I had a country style pate that was complex and tasty.  We started with a pasta dish on their menu as an appetizer and a pork cheek ravioli.  The pasta on the menu was much better.  My favorite part of the meal was dessert.  We tried three and all were tasty.  I would say these are some of the better desserts in Scottsdale. I would not take out-of-town guests here, but the chef is very meticulous so I would probably go for a quiet dinner with the husband.  I would probably give it a 3.5 overall.Pretty OK.  Visited several times.  
Been for lunch (roast beef really good).  
Bar scene is nice, rustic-type atmosphere.  Had office group & several plates of all the different appies to nosh on, was good.  
Martinis are 'ok', same goes for glasses of wine.  
Good for an after work sorta thing.This came highly recommended by locals, as well as friends who recently attended a conference at The Fairmont Resort near Charleston's.  I had the country fried steak and it was more quantity than quality.  I, for one, am worn out with seemingly every restaurant using "chipotle" in their dishes and this was the case with Charleston's country fried steak gravy, which has a little kick.  I had a cup of potato soup and it was excellent.

Friends with me had a cheeseburger and meat loaf.  My one friend raved about how delicious the meatloaf was and the other said his hamburger was perfectly cooked (hot pink in the middle).

I liked the dark wood atmosphere of the restaurant and it had customers ranging from families with kids to senior citizens, so it is clearly appealing to a mix of people.

Service was okay, though not memorable.Only cause time is money got an oil change and back brakes took over 3 hrs and you don't even get a complementary car. Also the service guy easily put 20 miles on my car what gives I also seen him driving it like it was stolen unsure if I will return. 1 last thing when you go in the know one who works here drives a Volvo mostly Honda's what's up with that.Not as good as I had hoped for. Not horrible, but I just moved over to this area from San Diego a week ago and was looking for a little mexican shop on par with everywhere in SD. Yes, I know I am not in SD anymore so I can't expect the same thing. If I were to have found this place there I would have rated it as a generous 2 stars.  But again overall I just had better expectations for a 4.0 rating with over 130 votes.The Salt Cellar has been a culinary landmark in the valley since I was just a kid, so I was aware of it's reputation.  I would definitely recommend it based on it's historical significance; however, if you're looking for great all-around seafood experience, you may want to consider some of the other notable seafood restaurants around the valley.

The atmosphere is cool - in that, the dining area is located underground, making it dimly lit, and the theme is old nautical.  (Although, I did feel slightly claustrophobic once we were seated and had to quickly down some wine to relax that panic.)  The wait staff was attentive and friendly, and we didn't really have to wait long to be served our drinks or meals.

We ordered the Monk Fish, Crab Cakes, Baked-Stuffed Lobster, and the Salmon.  Everything was tasty and fresh, but the flavors were definitely in line with traditional Seafood dishes.  Not that this is a bad thing - I guess I have just become more comfortable with seafood dishes that have something extra regarding flavor.

I'm glad that I had the experience - hopefully the Salt Cellar has another 30 years left in it, but if I have the taste for seafood again I probably won't go back.Food was great, beer is good and the service was good until the end when we asked to have the check split (between two couples - not something one would think is difficult.) Our waitress was visibly upset and snatched the receipt and stormed off. She came back with the split check (for which we thanked her), she huff'd and walked away. Not something that would cause me to tell people not to go, but be aware that check splitting may be frowned upon!I will only add to the many reviews saying that the service here is pretty terrible, but the food is pretty good.  But I will add that I went to the Pita Jungle location in Scottsdale and received better service.  Still not great, but better.

Their falafel plate is great, the honey pasta salad is good but easily made at home, and their hummus is reliable but again, I could make this at home and not be ignored by indifferent servers as I wait 20 minutes for my check.I'm sorry that I can't agree with others who have posted glowing reviews of this restaurant.  I simply wasn't that impressed.  This was my first time eating Ethopian food.  Seeing as Ethiopia is one of the poorest countries in the world where people are starving, it seemed weird that they would have a cuisine to call their own in the first place.  I had the vegetarian platter, which came with several different kinds of items, all placed on top of a tasteless, spongy bread.  None of the items were bad.  Everything was decent.  It just wasn't great.  The spices they use are very similar to what you'd find in Indian food.  Maybe if they used the spices a little more liberally, the food wouldn't have been so bland.  

The ambiance in the restaurant was also of a slightly lower standard than I would have wanted.  It's not very fancy.  I was there on a date, and this wasn't exactly the type of place where I would go again on a date.  I think this is more of a restaurant where I'd bring my family to eat.  But if you require a place that inspires romance on some level, this isn't the place for you.  

For all the unflattering things I've said about this place, one of the best things about it is that everything is very reasonably priced.  It's not like they're giving you less than what you paid for.  The prices are commensurate with the quality of food and type of restaurant this is.  I would eat here again.  I was just hoping for better on my first dining experience.Chaos. That pretty much describes the experience when at Goldfland. Be prepared for a thousand kids running around the entire property, amped up on pixie stix and Coke. Not trying to sound old here - it's just the clientele that they attract.

The Go-Karts have to the best part here. Not as fast as the like of Octane Raceway, but plenty fun for a few laps. The Golf is average and even felt a bit short of a course because the 18th hole comes up so quickly. 

Laser tag was closed when I went, so I can't talk about that. But keep in mind that they probably close it more often.

The staff looked more fatigued than the parents. Their facial expressions said nothing less than "Please let me go home!" They were unenthusiastic, unwelcoming and pretty much uncaring. Conversely, the staff at Dave & Busters is much more accommodating and helpful if you ask them a question.

Anyhow, I liked Golfland, but I would have to be very committed to the constant stream of chaos if I'm going again. Good to go once, good for a casual date, but definitely not a regular visit.Oh weeee, my friend and I ordered and shared the chicken spicy masala and a mild lamb vindaloo. Our good came in a timely manner and the restaurant was barely packed. That didn't mean the food wasn't good! It was delicious. We were served a really good appetiZer that I can't recall the name but it was made of mint and/or cilantro. It was free and it was oh soooo yummy. After a couple of minutes we received our order with garlic naan and basmati rice. I preferred the masala over the vindaloo but that's probably because it may have been more fatty and buttery. 

I would come again. Thank you! For a good experience of Indian food in tempe. Yumm3/17/10

I know it's been awhile since I was last here, although not quite as long as sixteen months!  I see that the decor has changed yet again-- last time major add I knew of was the painted poetry on the wall next to the restroom.  There are now car door cutouts-as-art lining two walls near the front of the resto, along w/ a couch, or two.  Eclectic, and a nice add to the vibe that Green already exudes.  

Tried the crab puffs again (it's been awhile since I last had them).  Wished I didn't.  Don't know if it's the ingredients in the vegan cream cheese (it contains corn/derivatives), or the fact that they're deep-fried (not all fried items make me queasy after), or both, but I'm not going to order these again.  I should've just thrown them away, but the crunchiness of the wonton (have I mentioned that I love crunchy-munchy foods?) and the cost of this app, $4 (or $1 a pop), made me plow on.  Never again.

The original "g" spicy po-boy made me forget my disappointment, however, as I crunched through the scrumptious mock chicken and its lovely and indeed spicy buffalo sauce!  Three battered buffalo mock chicken patties nestled between tomato slices, arugula, and Green's amazing vegan mayo on a toasted vegan hoagie roll, along w/ a side of thyme fries... Mmm... a must-try!

Seeing others enjoying their tsoynami sundaes made me want to get one myself, so after some deliberation, I decided on one of the daily specials- Death by Chocolate: vanilla soy ice cream w/ vegan brownie chunks, Newman's Own chocolate wafer crumbles, and vegan chocolate syrup.  Undeniably choco-licious, but something was amiss... I believe I was wishing for a colder sensation that regular ice cream offers and that soy ice cream cannot deliver.  It wasn't a warm day, and the tsoynami sundae that was delivered to me already had that sheen that regular ice cream develops when it's allowed to sit around and melt.  Don't get me wrong- it's the combination of cold/ solid and slightly melted and slippery that makes a frozen dessert a success for me, but tsoynamis generally make me wish I'd saved the calories and visit a gelateria, instead.  Which, as a non-vegan, I will.  Next time.  

While the app and dessert left me wishing I didn't indulge, the "g" spicy po-boy indubitably made my tastebuds sing.  I'll just have to stick w/ the artichoke gratine and say sayonara to tsoynami in the future.  Don't the photos look divine, though?I came with a friend because I've driven by a couple of times and it looks like a cute place.  It's got a quaint "authentic Italian" look to it--the owners actually hail from Sicily.  The food is pretty good, too.  Nothing to write home about, but good, decent Italian.  The one exception?  The calamari.  Fantastic.  Worth the somewhat high price (although you do get pretty large portions).

Here's the problem I have with this place, though: it tries too hard.  The waiters look like they just rented their tuxes from Al's Formal Wear.  The music playing in the background was what you would expect to play in the background of an Italian Restaurant in a bad movie.  Think "That's Amore" and "Mambo Italiano."  Is there some kind of XM radio station that only plays music for Italian Restaurants?  If I worked here I'd want to slit my wrists after listening to that stuff for a couple of days.

But again, decent food.  If you like the kitsch, the atmosphere is good too.  And there's a cute little patio with a great view of the bodega across the street.I LOVE Mr. Hunans, he delivers quickly and efficiently and the pricing is not too bad.  There are some website issues but i just call in the order and they are very responsive.  The drivers were nice but they had trouble finding my suite.  As far as quality goes its good and enough so to make it my consistent Chinese food spot.Has anyone seen the Undercover Bosses- Rally episode
It's a good one
I enjoy chowing at Rally's from time to time. It always seems like such a different experience compared to today's big corporations like Mcdonald's and BK
This is the only Rally's location I know of in Phoenix but I am pretty sure there are a couple more

The food is good here
The Burgers are nice and a good size
The fries have a nice texture
The milkshakes and sundaes are wonderful

The customer service is superb as well

If you haven't been to Rally's 
You're missing outI'm not going to lie, I was extremely nervous to go here, BUT it was actually okay.  
The service was kind of slow and the chick wasn't very attentive AND then the sushi chef went outside on a smoke break....  
Needless to say, I probably will not go out of my way to revisit, but whilst there it was fair....Want to get drunk? I mean falling over, possibly having sex in public...but you're not sure if that really happened drunk?

This is the place.

Described aptly as "7-11 on acid" the giant bank of alcoholic slurpee, er daiquiri, machines is a sight to behold! Try to catch a glimpse of the inner workings while waiting for the men's room (its fine to go into the locking one ladies) its kind of crazy in there! All sorts of whirring machines and people leaping around with gallon buckets of daiquiri mixes, or stirring 50 gallon vats of daiquiri mix that recently had an obscene amount of liquor dumped into it.

Wait a minute! They don't only have daiquiri drinks! They've got a full bar! They've got food too? WTF? Fats actually has a pretty good kitchen. If you come in for lunch, sit at the bar. The servers really aren't interested...honestly this is probably one of the worst places in the world to be a server. Go to the bartenders, they are happy.

Remember though, the whole point of this place is to get you drunk. They know their job well. They have levers to pull on a bank of machines that makes drunks, they hand you a glass of something that is generally over 150 proof (75% ABV). The most famous drink is the 190 Octane, it really is 190 proof (95% ABV) then you can get everclear soaked cherries as well...

I have never left this place sober.Barely 3 stars.

This is my 2nd try to this place. The first wasn't that great, so I took my time to come back and I'm disappointed again :(

We sat outside. What a bad idea. The table was next to untrimmed plants and flies were flying around during all the dinner.

I was craving pork belly and when I ordered, the waiter said that that was the only dish they didn't have. Great. I ordered cheese plate (which was the best of the night), baked potato soup (lame), fillet (with too much sauce and peppers, plus the spinach had no taste) and a side of caramelized onion risotto (which was a little more than ok).

In general good location, nice setting but just lame overpriced food.

Not sure if I'll be back.3 stars by the skin of their teeth.  Was there last Friday night and things were hopping...with the customers, that is, but service was painfully slow, both at the bar where we had drinks and appetizers and for dinner.  When we eventually did get our entrees the people at the table next to us  leaned over and said "i'll give you $30 for that - we've been waiting an hour!"   We had too, so we understood their desperation.  It was a wait to order, a wait for our food, a wait for the check, a wait for the receipt...ugh.  Now keep in mind that I love leisurely dining and hate being rushed.  So if service, especially at dinner, is slow by my definition, it is truly glacially paced.

So on to the food.  The bruschetta - simple and wonderful due to the fresh and flavorful small tomatoes.  The bread and dip trio (hummus, oil, pesto) is also pleasing.  I ordered the fish of the day, an atlantic sole in buerre blanc.  The fish was fantastic  Fresh, perfectly cooked, and with a perfect texture.  The buerre blanc was a useless bland sauce that did nothing but detract from the fish.  The salad greens in aioli dressing were a miss.  The weirdly bitter aioli drenched the greens, making them a soggy mass.  The table consensus was "interesting.  Not good"

My husband's fried chicken was oddly and unpleasingly  bland, and tasted devoid of seasoning or salt.  I only ate the coating because I am allergic to chicken, but isn't that supposed to be the best part?  The husband confirmed the meat was similarly bland.  My sister in law loved her annolotti.  We would have liked to try dessert but we'd been there so long by the time we were afraid we'd become permanently attached to the chair and decided to escape while possible.the food here is good for the price but just ok when you consider other thai places in the area like thai elephant.  Its an ASU favorite and their Curries are the way 2 go.  I recommend at least trying this place and forming your own opinion.Inexpensive and popular place, gets quite crowded at lunch.  We tried the Peanut Curry (Panang) with chicken, and the red curry with beef.  Service is good, and friendly.  Lunch specials come with a small egg roll, that is quite good, rice, and a light cup of soup.
Their scheme of spiciness is quite accurate in my opinion.  The Panang chicken was quite good, with more vegetables than I am accustomed to.  The red curry was tasty, but the beef was pretty chewy.  Guess I'm spoiled by the Thai in Los Angeles.After reading all the reviews and since I live close by, I decided to give Classic Italian Pizza a try.  When I arrived at around 6pm, I was the first person in the restaurant.  My first impression was -why is it so dark in here? My second impression was-why are they so expensive?  

With the exception of the Margherita, White Pizza, and two or three other pizzas, the majority of the pizzas were in the $15.00 to $17.75 range.  While I was going to get the Capriciossa pizza, it was the most expensive pizza on their menu and I was put off at the price. As others have noted, these pizzas can be shared but at 12 inches in diameter, they are primarily for one person. 

Contrary to what some other reviewer wrote, these pizzas do not come with complimentary bread.  The bread was listed under appetizers and if I recall correctly, it was listed at $7.00, which I think is absolutely ridiculous.  On their menu, they also had some salads and they only had 1 desert item-tiramisu-also at the very high price of $7.00.

As for the pizza itself, the Margherita pizza I had certainly was good.  The cheese was excellent, the sauce good and crust pretty good  as well although I think it could have been done just a bit more. Needless to say, while I liked the pizza, I did not find it incredibly fantastic.

At the end of the day, the pizza, while good, was just too pricey.  If you look at other notable pizza restaurants in Phoenix- Humble Pie, La Grande Orange, Cibo, and even Pizzeria Bianco, all of the prices for pizza at these restaurants are less money.  While $17.75 for a pizza might be considered acceptable in San Francisco or New York, I've been around and for Phoenix, this place is overpriced .Salsa was fantastic!  I had the chicken tacos....the chicken was very salty...they were okay.This place is decently priced compared to some of the other apartments around here, with out the ghetto feel. There are a lot of student who on occasion get loud and rowdy but that just depends on who you have as your neighbor. The kids that moved in upstairs last month for example enjoy partying and have puke over the railing twice and have not cleaned it up. So there it sits there still both piles continuously baking outside of my apartment door. You would think the grounds keepers would have cleaned it up but I guess its not a high priority. My only other complaint would be that I have lived here a year now and I had trouble with gold gym and had to change my bank info. I have never been even remotely late and have even paid months ahead. I mistakenly paid rent that same week with a check and went to tell the management about my mistake she told me I would never be able to pay with checks again and after almost begging at her own grace the manager told me she would not charge me late fees. 
Bottom line is if you can find a house its a better value for your money in this area. You can buy a house cheaper then you can rent an apartment here. If you must settle on an apartment I would still choose this one because its small and on occasion they do drawings and bbqs and things and they are the worst priced out there. Perfect middle of the road apartments.We sat out on the patio on a Saturday morning and it was so peaceful. I had the Atkins carb friendly breakfast so I'm gluten free. The turkey sausage was tasty but extra greasy. Pretty decent. My husband got bacon and eggs. Personally I thought his bacon was amazing because it wasn't burnt and it wasn't dripping. For a breakfast spot it wasn't too shabby and I probably would come here again.We usually road trip to San Diego several times a year and have always talked about stopping at Space Diner and today we finally did.  The employees were friendly, bathrooms very clean and the food was good!  We would stop again!its an ok place to go it is close to home.When it comes to pedicures, I'm no expert but I would give them top scores. They are super friendly, did a great job and feet looked fantastic. I don't understand why it adds $5 to work on your calluses but ok. It seemed like there was a lot of add-on pricing and they definitely pushed additional services but then again, it is a business.

For the manicure, I was super happy when I first got it and they seem to use top quality materials but my nails started lifting around the cuticles within a week. It was my first time getting nails in 10 years so I thought maybe it was me. They told me to wash my hands less and it took about 2 weeks to start lifting the second time. Maybe it is worth it to pay a little more elsewhere?Since the community grew quicker than the Diocese could keep up, SJN is still physically building the church.  With 2 weekly collections, the goal of SJN's campaign is closer each year.  The guidelines of SJN is located in the inside cover of the hard cover missal.  Since kneelers are not available, you stand throughout the liturgy of the Eucharist, unless you are physically unable just like some other neighborhood Catholic churches in Vegas.  The best part so far is the new children's choir during the 12 noon mass.  Another positive factor is the 5pm mass with usually less people and more parking available.I love Applebee's.  I use to take all the chicks to Applebee's for a NICE date. Now they take me here haha. Ignore me. The meds are kicking in.

Never come here for lunch. I've always heard about how bad it gets.  It gets crazy busy and yet they do not know how to handle it. Last time I was here with some of the guys from work, maybe 6 of us. Once again someone didn't get their food until the almost very end.  This time it was me. boo. it seems like almost every other time someone in our group gets screwed. SMH

But yet I still love Applebee's because for those who aren't adventurous with their food, as I am, they're usually satisfied with Applebee's.Shame on me for not reading reviews before eating at this Applebee's.  

Met some friends for lunch this week.  The wise choice for us was Applebee's (off Warm Springs) because it was one of the closest restaurants to my friends work.  What started as a wise choice, ended with an overall 3 star review.  If you read other reviews like I did not, you can probably guess what the issue was.  That's right, service here is amazingly slow.  My friend works in the buildings right next to this Applebees and one of our other friends works within 10 minutes.  The plan was for me to arrive and then let them know once I'm seating.  I just wish now that I ordered ahead of time, like 45 minutes ahead of time.  We ordered our food at 12 PM and by 12:35 PM, nothing.  The waitress was called over and we asked about our food.  Viola! Within 10 minutes we got our food after complaining.  This led to speed eating since both my friends had to get back to work.  Long story short, this place doesn't get packed for lunch, they are just slow for lunch.  This is also the same song and dance if you read the other reviews.  C'mon Applebee's...your customers are trying to tell you something. 

As for the food, I got their Bourbon Street Chicken and Shrimp.  I had an extra chicken breast added just for good measure.  The overall meal actually tasted pretty good, but that was just taste.  Texture wasn't so great. Both my chicken breast were a little dry. 

Overall, I think I'm being generous with 3 stars.  I am giving them 3 stars only because I finished my plate.  Service needs to get better, at least faster.

Bourbon Street Chicken & Shrimp:   http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=2ur8pXFTFraCZnKwSEV4BA&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ

Lovely Pair:  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=QHGjqvOeYqQEo01Gr6KlqQ&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQEasy airport to maneuver through and love that you can continue to gamble while you wait for your flight.  I noticed the flight agents at Southwest are pretty used to people getting on their flight late, due to not being able to pull away from the slot machines.  Believe me I've been there...good thing you aren't the only one trying to cash out quickly and run to the plane, otherwise it would be embarrassing.  :)3 stars. What more am I supposed to say aside from the fact that I love how they have slot machines inside... haha

Sin City baby!Fly in and out of Vegas here every time. Not that exciting of an airport, but it doesn't really need to be when you have one of the most exciting cities right outside your doors. 

The cab rides are super expensive, so that sucks.I love that they have slots right next to the gates....for the people who can't wait to get to the strip when they land, and the people who are trying to break even before they go home.  I've been lucky lately to not have to take the tram for anything.  Not a fan of the tram. Not sure why.  I'm not weird.A solid airport. Their security line moved quickly. The TSA people were very friendly and not demeaning when they tell you to "take your shoes and belt off!! do not be THAT person!" 

YIKES.. alright I won't be THAT person.. 

Looks like they were making some renovations when I was there last, so that should be nice. They have some nice dining options.. bathrooms were also placed throughout and they were clean.I don't hate this airport as much as LAX, but it's pretty confusing.  There's like 50 lines for southwest organized in no order what so ever.  Your rental shuttle takes you to one area, then you need to take another shuttle to your terminal.  Then find really confusing long lines for southwest indoors and outdoors! 

I had mixed bag with employees, 1 was really rude and mean, 2 were really nice.  

Tip - I think the outdoor lines are shorterThis airport was pretty empty when we got here on Saturday morning, kind of creepy but kind of cool so we wouldn't have to deal with crazy crowds. I found it interesting that they had slot machines by the baggage claim. I didn't see much of the stores around the terminal because I was ready to get picked up and get my drink on. But going outside to find the pick up spot was very confusing. Why so confusing! Ugh. Both my ride and us were confused on where we should get picked up. We eventually got picked up at T3, in a parking structure, 3 levels up... so weird. Anyways once we got picked up we went on our way to have some fun in the city of sin...The portion size is the same as the restaurant itself small. But the was okMy favorite lunch spot downtown. The place aint pretty but the food is good.usually when i head downtown i always start off my night here, Cheap drinks,  the bartenders are pretty generous, the staff are always pretty cool, 5 dollar gambling, the cafe inside serves up nice size portions, they upgraded the joint a few years ago so it is not as sketchy.  If you are downtown want to do it cheap check out the Gold Spike~I had only gone to Downtown Las Vegas once before which was a gaudy experience, so I am happy this time around it was different. New Years Day, 2am, finding my way to the jail to wait outside until 4am hoping my boys would get released. It was freezing, people everywhere, and just waiting. Happy friggin New Years.

This time around it was nice and warm, I went for my friend's wedding, and we stayed at the Fremont.

Have you been wanting to go to the Phillipines? 
Do you enjoy cheesy-ness?
Have you been craving some Dunkin Donuts?

Well you have found the right place! Come on down to Fremont. It was really cute. Walking around the casino, seeing all the Filipino lolas gambling and complaining in Tagalog to their hubbys. Reminded me of my BFF's family parties.

I don't ever recall going to DD's so that was cool to try it. 

We finally get to the hotel at like 1 or 2am, we pull up and it's valet only. It was a good thing and a bad thing. Good because we didn't have to drive round and round, park, and lug our luggage 5 miles like on the Strip. Bad because it piled up and sometimes we'd have to wait long but oh wellz.
We walk in and the lady at the Counter is as SWEET AS CAN BE. Very nice, helpful, and just plain sweet.

The room was okay. Not too bad, not too great, just meh. Right when I walk in my mama goes "there's a red dot on the ground and I don't know what it is!" LOL... Ummm okay? We just avoided it. Whatever. It looked like Cool Aid. 
The sink was tiny. Dude. What the F. Like seriously. 

We just got ready and slept so it wasn't a big deal at all. I've stayed everywhere. Doesn't matter to me.

One thing I liked is that it's a short walk downstairs, to the room, to the car, to the Fremont Street Experience, and just to about everywhere. One gripe is that it's so far from the Strip but it was nice to get to check out Old School LV ya know?I'm torn to give this place 3 stars. 

Good:
- REALLY nice service at the front desk. From the moment we checked in everyone was really nice, helpful and gave us advice to skip the tourist things. 
- decent location. I mean it's downtown. As many times as I've been to Vegas I've ever been downtown so the crowd was different but ok, more....homely?

Ok:
- It's an older hotel so the rooms are nothing close to the strip, but again, for the price you can't really get upset about it. 

Nothing to really complain about I guess other than the amenities. No pool which is kind of a bummer. Good thing I was only there for the weekend with family so we didn't stay in the room a lot.

If I had a choice and was paying, I wouldn't stay here.My review is for the casino only.  El Cortez is in a shady area of downtown.  It's nothing fancy and the clientele can be a bit sketchy.  It's pretty small - not a lot of tables or variety of slots.  But they offer free play like no other casinos!  They sent me a $100 gaming credit in the mail to get me in the door, then during my birthday month, sent me $50 more dollars in free play.  Their slots are pretty loose and let you play/win for awhile.  With the right incentives, it's a decent place to play.  :)Have never stayed the night in this hotel.  I have played the slots here a few time and like some of the other hotels around Freemont this one also could benefit from a good face lift.We stayed at the Golden Nugget in May of 2009.  We were getting married and excited.  The staff at the front desk was mattter of fact at best.  We were hoping for a possible upgrade as this was going to be our honeymoon, no such luck.  We never had another interaction with the staff, not one member of the staff went out of their way for anything.

The casino was nice and so was the pool, the cafe sucks and the gift shop had some really nice clothes.  The staff at the gift shop was friendly and attentive .

All in all I expected a little more personality from a hotel that at one time was top-notch.Good location. Clean store. Manager is very pushy with deals and sales info when I first walk in store. Let me come in and browse a second before you pounce.This is an odd Subway, gas station combo.  The two businesses run separately, which makes it confusing when you want to make purchases from both.  
The staff at the Subway counter is probably the friendliest and most attentive I've seen in any Subway (I'm a weekly customer to locations all over the country).  Food was spot on and as fresh as is expected from this brand.
I only wish that you could purchase convince store items with my Subway purchase.Walmart is Walmart, it's just the same as the others I've visited. So I'm not sure how I can rate this. I can say that I can get just about anything here from toys, electronics, clothing and now even produce. Weird to see it here but they do have e'm here now. This place is competition with Target IMO. But heck whatever is more closer and convenient, I'll go to, but you can get just about anything at Target than you can at Walmart.

Thank goodness for Walmart I can get my toilet paper at a cheap price. Bleh.Just got back from frozen fury. (F the av's).. Anywho, we stayed at the Rio all suites. The rooms are very spacious. It had a fridge and and other helpful hotel stuff. We had a view of the pool and the strip which was nice. The casino part is pretty small compared to all the major resorts out there. The pool area was big. They had sand beach's and little grotto's all around. They also have a topless pool however all I saw entering was old men :(  
  The cons would be we had a room that joined the one next to us. The door in between wasn't quite flush to the ground so it sounded like our neighbors were in our room! It didn't help that they were butt holes either. Also if you wanted coffee in your room you had to buy it from the vending machines. And if you have a room facing the pool in between 10am & 6pm They play bass thumping party music that we could hear all the way up on the 26th floor. If you have the inevitable Vegas hangover you will want to have a sniper riffle and pick off the DJ. 
  Besides that I'd recommend the Rio all suites. They always have deals on rooms. They have free shuttles to the strip. It's walking distance to the Palms. All the restaurants were pretty good. The roof top bar "Voodoo" has AMAZING views! And Penn & Teller perform there.Decent place, good margarita's and good service.  I would definitely go back.This place is better than the average run of the mill sushi buffet place, but why not save your pennies for a they-make-it-as-you go sushi joint?  The only great thing about this sushi place is that there is a lot of variety.  The fish doesn't taste bad, but quality is just not as great as it could be.

This location, specifically, could be cleaner.  But the wait staff is very good; it's almost like the drinks are refilling themselves automatically.Amazing view, good services, good food.This review is from a visit on 9/2013. We had the tasting menu and I cant remember much but the foie gras which is amazing. View is fabulous and service was great.This store seems a bit older, not near as nice as my regular Target (N 5th in NLV) but it works. The bathroom wasn't very clean and had a funky odor. Otherwise it was your standard Target and the only reason I went here is because I was at the Blick Art store across the parking lot.Best biscuits in the world. Can actually feel my heart slow down from all the fat. The rest of the food is just ok but the biscuits and coconut shrimp make me come back for more.Nice mall. Clean, cool shops, good choices in the food court. You know what would have been really helpful? A directory. Yeah. Directory would be good.The polo towers is a great place to sleep...and only sleep. I was staying in the studio bedroom, and it was clean, had a kitchenette and a view of the strip. The location of the hotel is nice, about a 15 minute walk from the Excalibur which has a tram to some of the other hotels. Housekeeping forgot to replace our towels, so I called and they were there in15 minutes and even called after to make sure that it was done. Not much to do at the actual hotel but I didn't mind. Perfectly good place to stay as long as you dont mind having to walk a lot.Let's say...you're on a budget, need a big room with two spacious beds, and love to roam the strip on foot: Excalibur is the best hotel for you. 

Price ($29 off season special to about $150 suites) is what set's Excalibur above the other nearby hotels. I have stayed here about 5 times before moving to Las Vegas and my overall feeling is MEH!!!

It's not bad at all, the motif of an adult disney land is old...but awesome. Regular rooms come with two queen beds and a flat screen TV. Suites are moderate in size as compared to the Paris' Red Room and Planet Hollywood Suites. The furnishings and styles inside are EXTREMELY dated but for the price....acceptable.

Entertainment options plentiful: Fantasy, Tournament of Kings, and that dude one (disclaimer: as a straight male, one shall not acknowledge the existence of said "banana fest" show). Also, Excalibur is at the bottom of the strip, perfect for early morning joggers, walkers, and excercise enthusiasts.

I totally recommend this place to all my cash strapped friends visiting from Hawaii. The adage goes, "you get what you pay for."I walked out and was awed. We're going to be staying at a castle?! Now I get to be the princess I always knew I was... and on my birthday!

I would have given them another star, but I think the person who cleaned our room threw away my Starbucks cup. It was the hard plastic kind that was insulated and not just some regular cup. What am I going to bring onto the strip now?!

We went the first weekend of January and the prices were outrageously...CHEAP! $70 for a whole weekend with 2 queen size beds?? How can you complain about that?! Overall the room was decent considering we just slept in it for the most part. My only complaint was that the air conditioner was super loud (for the day) and the blanket was too thin (for the night). Otherwise, this hotel is a little older than most and not the greatest ambiance wise, but if you were just going to sleep in it, it's very doable. It's at the end of the strip but most places are very walkable!My second time in Vegas; first time on the strip. Decided to stay here because we got a pretty good deal.

Positives:
-$20 food & beverage credit.
-Express monorail that ran between Excaliber, Mandalay Bay and the Luxor.
-Room was clean; Bed was comfortable.
-Staff was friendly and accommodating.
-Got free room upgrade.
-Food court and buffet available.
-Walkway to the Luxor.
-Safe in room.

Negatives:
-Casino and walk ways felt crowded at times.
-Hotel lobby and casino looks worn.
-Stayed on smoking floor. Smelled like weed quite a bit.
-Far end of strip. Have to walk or take taxi to other casinos.
-Food prices high.
-Absolutely no water pressure in shower.
-Time share people are highly annoying.

If you're wanting to stay on the strip but still stay within a budget, this may be the way to go. I would stay here again if the price is right. This isn't one of the high end hotels on the strip, but it's got all the essentials and will put you close to everything.Today was the first day that I had been able to go back to Firefly in over 2 and a half years. It would have been five stars easily, if it was based off of my prior experiences, but not so much anymore. Three stars seems too low for a place that use that used to hold a special place in my heart and stomach, so four stars seems about right.

The savory tapas are still delicious.

The standout dishes are:
Tortilla espanola- A potato omelet dish garnished with sriracha sauce and  parsley.
Crispy duck rolls- Fried duck egg roll served with a hoisin dressing.
Camarones a la diabla- A spicy and sweet shrimp dish. Get some extra bread and mop up the sauce.
Shrimp ceviche-  Large chunks of shrimp, avocado, diced onions and bell pepper tossed in lime juice and served with tortilla strips.
Stuffed dates- Dates stuffed with almonds, wrapped in bacon, fried crispy, garnished with goat cheese and parsley. 

If it was not 12:30pm... who am I kidding, if I wasn't driving, I would have been drinking. Remember kids, don't drink and drive. Make someone else be the DD. Their red and white sangrias are delicious. The best part of the drunken state comes from eating the fermented fruit floating around. After a few, it becomes a game to catch them all. Firefly's mojitos are amazing as well. My personal favorite are the mango or blood orange.  Even though it is a rum drink, that uses simple syrup, the fruit juices don't make it overbearingly sweet.

The real disappointment lies in the desserts. I use to love this place for their banana nutella sandwiches and the chocolate tres leches cake, but the former was lacking immensely today. For one, there was hardly any banana in the sandwiches and they were cooked so dry that I needed to ladle the nutella onto it. Don't get me wrong, I would drink nutella, but I want to have the choice to go without it and that was taken away from me. The tres leches cake was delicious, but did it get smaller? Since coming back to Vegas, this has been the first time I looked at a dish and said, "WTF, where is my food?".

I should have gone with my first instinct and gone to the Lunch Box for their waffle ice cream sandwich.Dinner here at the cafe was fine, but I left feeling slightly underwhelmed.

The appetizers were the best part (which seemed to be the theme of our weekend in Vegas!)--we ordered the pork potstickers, the burrata with prosciutto, and sliders. Everything was timely and on point.

For the main courses, I thought the shortribs were the winner at our table.  My rigatoni was oversalted and I thought the pasta/sauce portion was a little off. I also had a bite of the salmon pizza and really loved it for a bite, although I don't know if I'd necessarily want a whole pizza of salmon!

Service was great.The food was delicious!  I enjoyed the prosciutto and burrata.  The steak frites is a splurge, but worth it!  One of the best steaks I've ever eaten.  The lunch staff service needs improvement.  I came right when it opened.  I dined alone, and the hostess was annoyed when I chose a table over sitting at the bar.  The man that filled my water and took my dishes was the friendliest worker I encountered.The gelato and coconut sorbet were very good. The service was just OK.. they didn't pay you much attention just handed what you wanted and told you the price.  

The location is the best part of this place - you can get your gelato and sit in the promenade and catch one of the carnevale performances.Good for locals wanting to just get a way and be a part of the touristy crowd. When I u se to live in Vegas my fiance and I would always make a room reservation once a month just to get away from a daily boring lives living in las vegas.

What we Like:

Adventurdome: only $26
Midway : We can act like kids we love playing the games. This place seems so much BIGGER when I was little, so weird how small it got through adult eyes.
We got a room at the SKYRISE TOWER 22705 .. King bed, I think this is the upgraded ones because last one we stayed at was VERY OLD AND SMELLY LOOKING.
Cheapest rate on the Strip typically $26.00 a night

What we did not like:

We just had a room here 7/28 - they now have a RESORT FEE?????
$10.95???? Why what is the whole purpose???

ALL THE FOOD IN THIS HOTEL WAS NASTY!!!! 
Do yourself a favor and walk a few blocks down to Mcdonald's or any other restaurant on the strip. You have way too many choices to waste your money here.

We had a coupon here a 2 for 1 buffet - not even worth the half price! I got food poisoning!!!

This place just smelled OLD

They can upgrade the tvs.

Your lungs fill with smoke throughout your whole stay.Well I missed the $10 burger and a beer promo they have going on, but I didn't need that for lunch anyhow.

I don't understand why their tables are so high. I mean I'm 5'3" I get it--I'm not tall but when I sit in their booth the table is like at my chin.  I can't even imagine what little kids have to deal with. I almost asked for a booster chair if I would've thought my butt would've fit in it [should've tried anyhow]. Strike 1

When we originally sat down it kinda smelled like cat pee, so we asked for another booth by the window-it was THAT bad, that one smelt much better; however, I was still chin deep in table.  Not the most comfortable way to eat lunch. Strike 2

I asked if they had a calorie menu so that I could at least try to eat healthy, they did not. Strike 3 next batter.

Our waiter was a little behind so another guy came over to take our drink orders. By the time he was done our waiter came over and took our order but basically asked all the same questions twice. So that was kind of annoying but we made it happen.

What saved this place today [otherwise the stars would be much lower] was the food. I got the chicken tortilla soup [no tortilla strips-extra limes] and the fish tacos, ancho cream sauce on the side.  Both were delicious and actually pretty healthy [soup is like 300 calories 12 grams of fat, tacos 550 calories not sure how but 26 grams of fat? according to their website] minus the sodium which is super high in both.  I think next time I'll go with the plain old grilled fish.  My meal with drink was under $13.
whoohoo

When we left we inquired about their happy hour apparently it's 4-6 M-F but she couldn't tell us what nights or times the steel drum band guy played Strike 4.To my chagrin I went here for my wedding dinner. Ack!!!

Listen to the folks who say this doesn't hold a candle to real Italian food. This is, indeed, cafeteria food. Way overpriced cafeteria food. I wouldn't be so critical but the price warrants any and all criticism. Really, only a cheap or lazy establishment should post menus on walls.

The free wine is garbage... Though some folks (the folks drinking to get drunk) may not mind. If you buy your vino in a box disregard that last statement.

The only memorable thing was the mocha coffee dessert. It was good, but short lived.

They had a hack accordian player wandering the room for tips too. He was unabashedly terrible. My father, who lived in Naples for a few years, tipped him to play a song that the guy promised he knew how to play. The guy messed around for a minute but did NOT play the right song and DID take dads five bucks first. What a tool!

Leaving here we tried to call for a few cabs. One cab showed and one limo, who was stalking the parking lot. The limo disclosed, after taking us for a two minute ride around the corner, that it cost $40!!!!! This was not the restaurants fault, but had they listened when we asked them to call TWO cabs we would have saved $30.

RUUUNNNNN!!!We've been coming here for years.  The last time in 2009.  So here we are, January 28, 2013 and decided to try our old haunt.  It hasn't changed a bit.  Busy as ever and the accordion player is still there - though his sets are much shorter!  The food is so-so but there is lots of it.  My husband had spaghetti and meatballs and I had the lasagna.  Huge portions for two people but we managed.  The free wine isn't as good as I remembered - but I had a less discriminating palette back then.  Who's to complain?  It comes with the meal!The food was good but I would like more for the price I paid. Service was not that greatVegas, baby! I haven't been for a few years now and when my friend and I decided to book our stay we knew that we had to go with the Wynn. I had heard great things and was so excited at the thought of staying that I almost peed myself....which is why I'm left feeling a little disappointed with the end result. There were things that I loved about my stay here but to be honest, I was left a little disappointed on some levels. 

Things that impressed me: 

- The pool: it's huge, beautiful, new and has plenty of lounging spots. They offer pool side service but beware, if you're hoping for a speedy turn over you may want to adjust your expectations or risk severe frustration. 

- The room: Beautiful, modern with cool art, a huge flat screen tv and a small tv in the bathroom that you can watch while getting ready. The beds were out of this world comfy; there were times when I didn't want to get out of bed. The view (at least from the 37th floor) was awesome. 

-Gambling: I won about $200 on penny slots. Ha! 

-Clubs: Had such a blast at Tryst and XS; they are the hottest clubs in Vegas right now and you'd be a fool not to check them out. Thanks, Mac, for hooking us up! :) 

- The fantastic deal we found on Travelocity: $396 (each - 2 people) for 4 nights and airfare. That is just an unbelievable price. 

Things that did NOT impress me: 

- The jenky-ass room they first tried to put us in. It was on the 6th floor and overlooking the top of another building. We went up, took one look and said hell no and demanded another room. 

- There was just not enough places to eat inside the hotel. They had only ONE cheap option which was this little cafe that offered crap. The only other two options were the buffet for $30 a pop and the Terrace Grill which was sit down. 

- Along those lines, since the Wynn is so new, It didn't feel developed enough for me (e.g. no shopping, not enough food options, etc.) We had to go to Cesar's and The Venetian to really get some good diversity. 

- It's at the end of the strip so you're not central; I didn't mind this so much but it's definitely something to think about when you're considering a place to stay. Expect lots of walking or lots of $$ spent on cabs. 

- The last thing, which probably made me the most irritated out of everything, was that there was NO COFFEE MAKER in the room!!! What. The. F*CK. What kind of hotel room as nice as that one doesn't offer some free coffee. I physically had to call the front desk and ask if I was missing something. Devastatingly, they confirmed my suspicions and directed me to in-room dining. After all was said and done, we were billed $18 for 2 small cups of coffee. 

As you can see, my review is conflicted. I wouldn't deter somebody from coming here but I would make sure to point out all the negatives that I stated above. 

Now, time to get back to nursing my liver back to health.Good food, Great price. Downside long wait on weekends, Smells like smoke everywhere, bathrooms are across the casino floor, service is OK at best, and employees aren't amiable, openly curse in English and Spanish in the dining room. But,  I love the steak and egg special, and the corn beef hash reminds me of how my mom would make corn beef, spam, egg and rice for breakfast.Actually had a good time at this hotel.  The bed in the smoking room wasn't very comfortable though and we got booked into that room and we don't smoke.  But they switched us to a non smoking room and it much more comfortable in that room.  The bathroom was also smaller in the non-smoking room and they had one of those radiated widow heaters instead of controlled temperature like in the smoking room, but it worked pretty good.  Suggest getting a room with a view though as all we saw were pipes and the top of a roof.  The food from the sports bar was reasonably priced though and the staff was, for the most part courteous.Now they have an open bar outside with waiting service. Big change with last year, changes inside too with the seating. Good thing is it's 24/7. I remember it tasted better years ago. Now it's just like any other place. First time eating since 2008.Maybe because I've been to MM World in NY that I find this location unimpressive.  The MM statues are 1/2 the size of the ones in NY, and they have a rope around them, no cool photo op here.

We were in and out, went to all floors, in about 5 minutes.  It's cool that you can get exclusive color mms but be prepared to pay extra.  Everything else was also overpriced, as expected.UPDATE!!! DUE TO A SYSTEM / COMPUTER MALFUNCTION M&M'S WORLD HAS CHARGED MY CREDIT CARD A SECOND TIME!! I WAS THERE ON 5/27/11 AND WAS JUST RE-BILLED $120 BUCKS YESTERDAY 7/11/11!!! WTF??!!! 

I called to talk to a manager but one would not get on the phone. The receptionist put me on hold a couple times, obviously confirming with someone else in her office. She came back to the phone advising me of the system failure 5/27/11 - 5/29/11 many credit card and debit card charges have been billed again in JULY!! The M & M Corporate office is aware of the issue and claims to be working to resolve it... 

HMPH..Roadtrippin' to Vegas
But got there so late.
Please no long lines
For this we would hate.

0400, what's poppin'?
Someone shouted "Drai's!"
Found a shitload of people
Outside forming a maze.

All hope was lost
As we stood there dead last.
When an guy with a ticket
Scooted us past.

For a group of just girls
Vegas don't suck.
One dude in your crew
And you're shit out of luck.

:)I've never had the "pleasure" of staying at Casino Royale, so this review is solely for the casino, bars, and food offerings.

First and foremost there is nothing Royale about Casino Royale. This is as bare bones as you get for anything on the strip. Even O'Shea's is a step up from this joint.
But...Casino Royale can churn out the cheap drinks better than any other place on the strip. They have that convenient service bar on the side of the bar as you pass through, where surprisingly friendly bartenders expedite the $1 frozen margaritas (8 oz.) and Michelob bottles with rarely more than a few minutes wait even with a line.
(Keep in Mind it is a CASH bar only though.)

Bill's tops the same 8 oz rita with a float, and its a better overall deal, but I'm a bottle beer guy, and prefer the dollar beers at the Royale to the dollar drafts at other places, especially on busy nights if you are walking the strip, no place gets you in and out like Casino Royale.

The food court is simple, but good, with cheap hot dogs, ice cream, and other snacks. Although If I'm grabbing something on the go or a quick fast food bite I'm usually going to O'Shea's.

The gaming is good and I've yet to run into a surly dealer there, which is great when you are only playing to kill time or goof around. They understand the clientele and play to their preferences. Mostly $5 tables and penny slots.

***They do get a bonus though for having the cheapest ATM fee on the strip. (Although I haven't been in quite some time) It used to be .99c but I have heard they raised it to $1.99.

Not the best Dive on the strip but for a Grab N Go scenario it beats everything including the 7-11.I thought this was the 'City that Never Sleeps.'  Crap!  I guess that is actually New York, but what gives?  It's 12:30am and I want some damn dinner! This is the only place at the Mirage that we could find that was still slinging it.  In fact, I think it's only open from 11pm to 6am, and their service here knows they are the only game in town, well, in this casino anyway, so they don't particularly care that they're rather slow.  

Anyway, this is Vegas, and I am keeping some random hours, so I end up eating here twice.  Both times I had the strawberry Belgian waffles.  What can I say; it was pretty good and decently priced.  Their coffee was good too; kept me going anyway :)Italian food located inside the MIrage. Niiiice.
There were a ton of restaurants to choose from in the Mirage but we settled for expensive expensive Italian food. 

The front area of Onda consisted of a little wine lounge. Just a place to relax and do some wine tasting. The actual restaurant is in the back of this place. The bread they gave us was typical, but the dipping sauce they provided was amazing! It was a mixture of olive oil, vinagarette, diced tomatoes, and roasted garlic cloves. Mmm!!

Here's what we ordered

CALAMARI
I wouldn't recommend it. The calamari was lightly fried but it didn't have the crunch I like with calamari. The calamari was indeed soft and fresh though.

LASAGNA
HUGE hunk of lasagna but priced at $26? I guess I won't order this again. I could barely finish this but the veal and pork that it was stuffed with was delicious.

OSSO BUCCO
A huge huge shank served on top of cheesey risotto rice. Yum! They even give you a fork to dig out the bone marrow in this veal shank. Ewwww! 

All in all, I enjoyed our dinner. We opted out on wine because we were too tired already so for the calamari, lasagna, and osso bucco, it came up to about $75 total. Not bad for a fine dining restaurant like this in Vegas, but will I come back? Probably not. It's a one time deal place.This was the first PF Chang's I had ever been to way back in 96/97/98 I can't recall but this was the original in Vegas before the one on the blvd opened.  

Eating at P.F. Chang's is like taking an introductory class in Chinese food.  For those that don't know authentic Chinese or asian food, this place is a great start for new palates.  It doesn't try to be authentic so you shouldn't go in assuming to have true home cooked meals here.  

The focus for them is clean "up-scale" atmosphere and consistent dishes across all their restaurants so that people from the mid-west  (or where ever people live that have never tried Asian cuisine) can feel comfortable and get a great meal.   Then when a restaurant pops up in Cheyenne WY or Troy, Mich., you have instant success (just an example)... I've been to other PF's and this one still surpasses others in flavor, but for those of you that know authentic food, this still doesn't stack up.  

I give it three for those that are looking to dabble in new things Chinese and get a familiarity to some of the tastes and styles, then once their "feet are wet" start getting adventurous... in no time you'll be asking for sea cucumber and birds nest soup (well maybe not that adventurous ;)I don't think Wolfgang Puck has every did me wrong. He knows how to run a great restaurant even though he isn't there and this place is no exception. I had the gnocchi and also ordered the blue cheese with truffle potato chips to start and it was so salivatingly good. I'm beginning to think Vegas is the new best culinary showcase city.Nice decor and very clean. The servers need to take some training on etiquette, but they didn't mean bad. The chicken tikka masala was tasty for sure but a small portion for the money. Goat biryami was bad . Gulab jun was yummy.I haven't been to Todai's in about two years and after my return to this location on a recent trip, I really was left unimpressed. The sushi is better than the sushi buffets I had locally but if you really want to get your moneys worth, go some place else like at the Bellagio or Alladin buffets. Unless you are strictly only sushi then this place would be satisfying at least. They lack a wide selection of seafood items and they are claiming to have a good variety of it? The crab legs were small and all snapped up by the patrons in less than five minutes. Sushi was unimpressive with a lot of rice for one sushi roll. It was not as fresh and until the tray was completely empty, only then would they refill it with fresh sushi. The desserts are the only highlight for me with custom crepes, green tea cheesecake slices, and mango yogurt. I would only come here again if the prices were lower with an expanded selection and other menu items. You get what you pay for during lunch.I really was hopeful this place was going to be good. Sadly, my assessment of Chinese food in Las Vegas remains unwavering. Granted, I'm a native San Franciscan who grew up with Mandarin, Szechwan, and Cantonese restaurants all within a few blocks of each other. The Vegas Chinese food scene continues to bore and disappoint at any price point. Yawn. Like I said I really wanted to like this place. The owner is so nice and really trying hard to make a go of it. The prices are ridiculously low. I walked out with 7 pounds of food for $22. 3 large entrees and steamed rice. For value, you get a lot for a little $. I felt guilty paying so little so I tipped her well. 

Sweet and sour pork. Bleh. Obviously frozen pork, cheap voluminous breading and anemic peppers on the side. Pass.

Chicken fried rice. The clear winner. Inexpensive and would order again. 

Szechwan garlic chicken. Looked better than it tasted. Broccoli frozen prior to cooking, garlic non existent, and the sauce was more tasteless than Panda Express (the King of spewy Chinese food in my snobby opinion). 
No dim sum to be seen. 
Too bad. 
I'll just book my flight to SFO and head to the Richmond District or Chinatown the next time I have a hankering for good Chinese. :(Nice spot to meet up wit frenz & chill out...They got the upstairs 4 folks 2 get loud...Family area downstairs, if U got the kids...Amy & I went 2 this joint & thru down a few beers...DAMN!!!  Took us a memorable glass home 2...Food is aight...I-candy, 4 sho...Mimi's cafe is okay for me. its okay that it never made me crave for anything so i never came back... the service was good but the sandwiches we ordered was pretty dry. I can personally make a better tuna sandwich! the cappuccino i ordered was good though. Props to the cute decorations in the cafe though :)I've eaten at 3 or 4 Melting Pot locations around the country, and if I had been on yelp 7 years ago, I probably would have given this place 4 or even 5 stars.  The evening is fantastic, it takes about 2.5 hours or more, and it's a great pace.  You are never in a rush, and it's certainly a different way to dine.

So, when we went to Melting Pot last night, I was troubled to learn that the menu had changed.  The Big Night Out which we had shared so many times was gone, replaced with a more a la carte ordering system.  You order by the person now, still having to share the cheese and dessert courses with the table as a whole.  Already, I was annoyed by the change in the menu.  THEN, I open the wine list to find fewer than 10 wines by the glass in white, even fewer in red, and only a page of wines period.  This is much, much less than Melting Pot used to have. I pointed this out to our server, and she informed me I was correct, the wine list had been paired down significantly.  Apparently the decision was made to simplify things.  Of course, I imagine stocking pricier bottles was not paying off, and I certainly understand a restaurant needing to make changes based on the bottom line.  But, it certainly affected my meal and will affect my decision whether to come in the future.

The meal was a solid Melting Pot meal.  We had the Wisconsin trio, an excellent blend of cheeses.  We asked our server to go heavy on the blue cheese and garlic, and she obliged in spades.  Excellent flavor.  The cajun platter and lobster fusion were next, and while good, the meat course left a little to be desired.  I feel like the portions are smaller, but I can't prove this.  I will say the shrimp was the favorite meat, and that's saying something when we ordered a dish with steak and lobster.  A tip if you eat here, put the mushrooms and potatoes in IMMEDIATELY.  The potatoes still weren't completely cooked by the end of the meal.  That's always been an issue with Melting Pot.  I would think there is a way to fix it, but I haven't seen it yet.

The dessert was the star of the meal.  We had the white chocolate creme brulee.  White chocolate with caramelized sugar drizzled on top.  Excellent, very glad we tried the special dessert.  My favorite in meals past was always the main course, but today it was the desserts.  I'm not saying we won't come back to Melting Pot, but the chances are much slimmer than they were yesterday before our meal.I really wanted to give this place a higher score, but I wanna sleep at night.  I was excited to come here for two reasons I love pizza and of course all the buzz following this place.  Finally made it down and left pretty disappointed.  

Literally before I could sit down some one was hovering over me asking me what I wanted to drink.  Before I could look at the menu to see what they had, and they just stand there until you decide.  Being a swell guy and not wanting to feel uncomfortable and leave the kid standing there I just ordered a Coke. 

When the server arrived it was not the same person who took my drink order.  So I took a gander around the place and noticed they have the bus boys bun rushing the guests with drink orders before they sit.  My sister and I decided to try the hot and spicy fries for an appetizer.  When they came it looked like fries with a light sprinkle of pepper.  To be honest the fries had a odd smell and the flavor I was not a fan of at all.

Now the pie.  We went with the family favorite sausage and mushroom.  When it came out I was a bit surprised with the size.  But a good surprise of course.  Metro make a really good pizza.  If I would have just had the pizza itself I would given it a four star.  But the whole experience for me wasn't great hence the 3 star.  Maybe I was expecting too much from this place, but with all of there locations a bit far from where I live and having some other great places closer I don't know when I will be back.Selection seems decent.  I don't know why I don't like this store.  It scares me inside.  It seems all dark and crowded with people coming at me from every direction.  In short, it fires off my big-box-store-shopping-and-crowds panic attacks big-time.  The first time, I thought it was just because I'd had a very stressful week.  The second time, I decided that I just don't get along with this place and won't try a third.I was lucky enough to go to the Santa Monica Border Grill back in 1995 while I was visiting some friends in L.A., and was blown away by it. I was at a conference in Las Vegas this last week, and I was happy to see that there was an outpost of the Border Grill there as well - of course I had to try it.

I went during lunch one day, and had the guac to start, followed by the chicken chilaquiles. Whenever I am in Mexico, I try to eat chilaquiles for breakfast, so I was pleased to see them on the menu (even though it was lunch time). The chips were cooked well, but were RIDICULOUSLY salty. I though that maybe I had just received a bottom of the basket set (or something like that), so I asked for some new ones, but those were amazingly salty as well. Once I dusted a large amount of salt off the chips, though, they were good, as was the guacamole. The flavors were nicely blended, and they didn't skimp on the onion.

The chilaquiles were a disappointment, though. They were the "green" version (as opposed to red or, more rarely, mole chilaquiles), and the green salsa was very acidic. I like the flavor of tomatillos, but these almost tasted underripe, which made for a weird flavor mix with the queso fresco and the corn tortillas. The chicken in the dish came in big chunks of dry white meat, and didn't taste like it had been cooked with the rest of the chilaquiles ingredients at all.  It was very disappointing. For comparison, I was comped a free breakfast buffet at the Wynn, where they had what they called chilaquiles with eggs (really, it was more like a chilaquiles/migas hybrid) - the flavor profile of that dish was much more authentic than what I had at Border Grill. I know that people think highly of the Wynn buffet, but still, when the food at a restaurant that prides itself on authenticity is beaten by a buffet offering, that's a bad sign.

I'll hang on to my good memories of the Border Grill in Santa Monica, but I won't be going back to the Vegas one again.The good thing about this place is that it's somehow off the beaten path, despite being in the Mandalay Bay. And the food is solid. I had a steak salad and it was very flavorful, although they did dress the salad up a bit too much. If I have a salad the next time I go back (and I will), I'll be sure to ask for the dressing on the side. Also, the chips are yummy, chunky, made fresh in the back type chips, which is always a bonus.Once upon a time Chi-Chi's had the Seafood Enchilada, it had a creamy sherry sauce.  Well, when the better half and I stopped into Border Grill during a trip to MMS they had a Seafood Enchilada with a creamy sherry sauce.

I hoped against hope that it was the same thing.

Unfortunately it was 35 dollars. And it wasn't the same.

I grant you this is entirely my expectations vs. reality.  But because it wasn't what I wanted it to be, I didn't really care for it. So it felt like 35 dollars wasted.  The better half got the Quesadillas which WERE really good. So she was happy.

My other frustration is the Las Vegas Mexican restaurant trick of asking if you want "Fresh Guacamole". This is code for "Would you like to pay 9 more dollars?"  They rarely inform you it's an extra cost and they ask so nicely. Don't be fooled.  Fortunately I knew from a previous bad experience.

The chips and salsa were very good, and our waiter was excellent.  When I explained the Chi-Chis story he said "What's Chi-Chi's".  (Now I feel old!)

Overall, I can't say it was bad, and as long as you don't mind the somewhat high cost of the Mexican food. I would absolutely come back for the QuesadillasI enjoyed this place and think it's the closest thing to a Philly Cheese Steak in Las Vegas that your going to get.  Not on the Philly level but not too far off.Decent Italian food in a good setting.I like Buffalo Exchange.  Its hit or miss for me, as a plus sized gal, sometimes its hard to find clothes that fit in a second had shop.

They have a good sized selection though, and I've found some gems.Pros: singer was very good, waitresses were attentive, food was good

Cons: location away from strip but not that far by car at all,  dark area outside by parking area feels unsafe, 

Sample platter was deliciousWow is all I have to say about the reviews for this place. Just seriously.... REALLY??

This Vons may be in a slightly "ghetto" area of town, but the store is perfectly fine and the staff is incredibly nice. In fact, the only reason this Vons could be considered "ghetto" is because of the snippy college students frequenting it for their beer runs and mini-fridge stuffing.

Any time I have ever run into this store on the way home from work I have been asked if I needed help finding something and the cashiers are friendly too.

If you think this Vons is "ghetto" please go and visit the K-Mart on Bonanza and Nellis. PUH-LEASE! Get it together people. This store is remodeled, ya, it's kind of old, but at least it is clean. The alcohol section is glorious and maybe it doesn't have a bakery, but there IS a bakery located in the same exact shopping center as this Vons. Get yo bread on there.Yes, you end up bumping into some very well-known "meatheads" in the industry when you workout here but...

Is is the cleanest and most organized? Hell to the no.
Is there enough cardio machines? Umm, this is a meathead's paradise, not enough cardio equipment and more room for weights.
Is the exercise class room open at all times so you can go in and do some of your own cardio workout or at least some stretching? Nope! It was locked when I was there (around 8:15pm on a Friday night).
Is the staff helpful? They're not the friendliest, that's fo sho.


Few good things I noticed while working out here during the Olympia weekend this year:

1. I like how they have hanging signs of each muscle group for the equipment in the room.
2. There's a cool boxing ring in the back.
3. They're open 24 hours.
4. They're cool with you taking pics of yourself. We were there working out a bit with the Flag Nor Fail crew and all they were doing in between sets were takin snapshots of each other. Haha!

Would I come back here? Eh...if we were meeting up with other cool peeps in the fitness industry, then sure...but not my 1st choice.For me their really isn't a worse way to shill something then to have to use UPS. If you have a business account they offer great service, but for the everyday Joe they are a total rip. 

Every shippment through them is twice as expensive and gets to the location in double the time. WTF.... The only benefit of he UPS store is not having to wait in the ridiculous USPS line and deal with some over worked, over paid Postal worker.I will go back  here even though I gave it a 3.  I still recommend this to anyone.

1.  They never asked me the heat level of the curries I ordered. Perhaps because I was with kids, and started with a wonton soup instead of Tom Yam, they assumed I wanted no heat level in the spice.

2.  I had a very hard time to hear the waitress over the loud music. The musician was great, however, I wanted to talk to my guests and it was a bit harder to do with the music.

3.  Ordered Wonton Soup, Rad Na, Red Curry Chicken, Masaman Curry Beef, and this most awesome half chicken fried. Not really a Thai dish, but a delicious fried chicken delicate and flavorful.

4.  They have a lot of Chinese food here in case you have to be careful wifh some of your guest and this is awesome. Some of their chinese dishes are absolutely great. How many places do you know you can get steamed fish?? That is special.

5.  Service overall was nice. I may have had a younger or new waitress, but also a more senior waitress came by during key times and she was very efficient!

I love the decor and the location. Parking is easy and not very busy for a Saturday night.  I am coming back here, because I think I was tired, a bit full from lunch still, and was trying different stuff.  This place seems like it will be a 4-5 the next time I come back.

Check it out and try it, you will be pleased!I qualify this review on the basis that the only time one needs to be at a mortuary is to make arrangements for a loved one.  My father had passed at the end of the month and I went to Las Vegas immediately since I was the closest of the out of town family.  Palm Mortuary was recommended highly and I was with my brother and mother to make the preparations.

First and foremost, we were assisted by one of my father's brother in arms, a Knight of Columbus member (this is a Catholic group that assists with Church activities).  I commend him for his guidance and his help to make the process easier.  The conversation with one of the directors went smoothly enough.  You know that you get the usual condolences and discussion of the process.  We had not gotten to look at the costs beforehand but were thinking, this is the process and we will  be told what and when and how much.  All of this went smoothly within the context of costs for the service and extras that might cost accordingly.  Besides the standard items, caskets, urns and memorial items for the service, the basic cost of the service, and of course the visitation room and chapel.  Our director mentioned that most Pilipinos like bringing food for the visitation and that since the funeral home has a chapel, the casket will be in that room from 1-7 and for another $1000 dollars for a separate room where one can host (meet) with family with food and drink.  it is not normally custom to have food and drink in the area.  Based on the cost and of course knowing my family, I knew we would not be interested in the extra room.  Grief can be done in the chapel along with my father's body in the casket.  We decided to forgo this decision until we discussed it with the rest of my family along with my mother who is in not in the mood to discuss such subjects in front of others.

After making some decisions, we informed Palm of our decision to forgo the extra room and was happy to have my father in the chapel for the visitation for the entire period 1-7.  We informed the mortuary within 2 days so that the room that was reserved can be used by others if any since this is still is a business.  But here is where everything became an exercise in the fine print.  As I mentioned before, we discussed the chapel for 1-7 and an extra room for $1000.  We dropped the extra room so we assumed the chapel would be our only room from 1-7.  Fine print, the chapel will only be used for 1 hour for any type of service.   This was not mentioned verbally and this  was what got my brother and my craw.  

After conversations with both the director and the manager of the director, we were told that we would have the visitation room from 1-4 and the chapel from 4-7 for any service(the Knights of Columbus does a prayer service).  This was really not the experience we were seeking.  So the warning for others, make sure you have the details and everything in front of you before you make a decision.  We were not price shopping for a funeral home, we wanted the best service with no hassle.  I am afraid we didn't get it at Palm.

Everything else went smoothly from the visitation the transfer from visitation to chapel, the service at the chapel.  Although I would like to say that the whole event ended on a good note, I can say that as soon as the mass service (the next day)  was over and my father's casket was taken away. I felt a little bit exhausted.  When the flowers needed at the church needed to be taken care of, Palm was so quick out of the box that I was not able to ask them to take them away (no one wanted it).

Positives, the service went smoothly. Negatives, fine print does no favors for the grieving. Positive you can purchase things outside of the funeral home, casket at Costco, flowers from known floral shops, memorials online and other places. Negatives, if you are grieving and have no time to do all of the work to look for these items, you will be gouged with prices at the funeral home.  It is a business after all.

I know you might never use this place but if you do, just make sure that you have someone who can be calm and collected to help you through.
Thanks Don!Burger and pizza nights are def worth trying. Some of the better pizza I have had. Breakfast is decent, but nothing exciting. Typical bar breakfast. Haven't tried their pasta, but want to. Service is ok.Stopped by to pick up some office supplies.  It's a clean store with friendly employees.  They had some interesting items for Christmas, but nothing I was going to buy.  I just needed to get my supplies and head home.  Not much else to say about this store.

Will I return?  Sure.Well, my order was wrong...but what I received was pretty darn tasty, so I can't complain too much. Fries were hot, and so was my sandwich.  That's about all I can ask for in a BK.This isn't anything trendy but as a local it's good spot. I could walk here from my house. So i used to come down to the bar and drink or go to the cheap cafe when i was hungry. I don't gamble so i couldn't tell you muh on that. the lodge atmosphere is really nice expecially when you remember your in a desert. Also I've had many conversations with other locals here. It's just a casual hang out. Also parking is never bad. Um the drinks have been good and cheap. Not as happening as other casions but hey... Sometimes a switch of pace is a good thing.The lady who helped me over the phone was very nice, as I've been calling other hotels to check for low rates for a little vacation for me and bf.  She was the best so far, she didn't seem to rush me off the phone, and answered all my questions not sounding annoyed lol.

The price for the stay is very nice and within my budget.  
What makes me happy also is that the pool is also open to the public as we live close by.I didn't stay here during my vacation however my casino experience was average. They have allot of the older gaming machines and some table games as well. I ended up earning enough points for a free buffet and have to say this was the worst experience. All the food I tried seemed to be undercooked. I thought it was just me and asked my friends what they thought of theirs and the said the same. Maybe it was just a bad day for the cooks but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat there again.This is a very nice casino. Very classy for a local casino. I came here for a presentation event so I went to the second floor to one of the meeting rooms. I have to say once you leave the casino floor this place is not much nicer than a Hilton Garden Inn. 

I did look out over the pool and the pool looked really nice. I also checked the restaurant menus and they seemed a little pricey for a non-strip casino.I've dined here four times.....

The first time:
I ordered the turkey, swiss and pear wrap........WTF?  Flavor explosions with every bite.  So good, I knew that it could easily become a "go to" item when decisions had to be made on the fly.  Also, on the side, I order their famous bread in a pot.  If you LOVE fresh bread and carbs as much as I, you'll flip for this warm, doughy goodness!  (sigh)

The second time:
I ordered the Jamms breakfast sandwich; scrambled eggs, ham, cheese, Texas toast.............typical flavors for a typical breakfast sandwich.  Yet again, I ordered the bread in the pot and it melted in my mouth!  It is the business!!!

The third time:
I was craving good 'ole steak and eggs so I made my way to the closest breakfast joint.  No, I'm lying, I wanted the bread in the pot!!!  =)  I'm a medium-rare, over medium kinda girl, and when the steak came out chewy and well done and the eggs, over-hard, I was terribly disappointed.  The only thing that was eaten that meal were the hash browns (you can't mess up potatoes, can you?) and the POT OF BREAD (of course)!

On my most recent visit to Jamms, I decided to order my "GO TO" turkey, swiss and pear wrap........decision well made, THANK GOD!  As usual, I ordered the POT OF BREAD, and LOVED every moment of it!
=)

~The service is wish-y wash-y at best.  One time I'll have over the top exceptional attention, and other times I'll be flagging the server down because I've gone 20 minutes (literally) without any sort of look my way.
~The menu is large........nearly 20 omelets alone!
~The POT OF BREAD is what keeps me coming back!!!  I dream about that bread!  Every time I drive past Jamms (which is often) I think about that bread!  UGH...........I want some NOW just writing about it!!!   =)
~I'll continue to give this place a shot......they can thank the POT OF BREAD for that! 
=)In the past I've experienced such terrible customer service at this location I dislike coming here but today I didn't feel like driving all the way to another location. Wow they have changed! As soon as I walked in I was greeted and felt welcomed by Marcia? I'm not the best with names....As I looked around I was confused why the product I was looking for was missing and some was dirty but Kelly came over and she cleaned the product that was dirty for me, asked me what I was looking for, gave me advice for similar product, checked in later to make sure I was ok and when I got in line! She was simply amazing. I've never felt so cared about! My cashier was Heather and she was shy but didn't care that I needed two separate purchases due to my coupons and asked me how I wanted my gift to be wrapped! She thanked me at the end for coming in and asked if I wanted my receipt with me or in the bag and when I said in the bag she actually put it in the bag unlike past cashiers I've had!! Marcia was still there at the door and wished me a wonderful day and thanked me. As a previous employee of this company it was just nice to feel at home again and not be disappointed. I hate bragging but after providing great customer service you do technically expect to have it and today they surely did that for me :) but this location can't go up to 4/5 stars until the company provides them with more product!!Well, we were downtown last weekend and happened to be hungry at an odd hour due to a very late breakfast that morning and so immediately I thought "Hey, lets go to Pizzeria Bianco. They can't possibly have a wait for a table at 2:30 pm on a Friday." Well, turns out they did but fortunately we only had to stand out in the 100 degree sunshine for 15 minutes or so. We've actually attempted to eat here a few other times over the years but when the wait time was quoted as 2 - 3 hours we moved on to dine somewhere else. So, was this pizza worth the wait you ask? Yes, it was absolutely worth a 15 minute wait. But no meal is worth a 3 hour wait. I think it's really silly that they don't serve pizza out on the patio or next door in the wine bar or just take reservations... its sort of a power play that they make people wait around for so long like that. I just don't get it.

Anyway, I was surprised that the menu didn't have a whole lot of options. I really felt like a red sauce so that cut our choices down to three pizzas. I opted for the Margherita since that is a nice classic but of course hubby wanted some kind of meat so we added sausage. That was a very good decision since the sausage was absolutely delicious. We both loved the pizza and it was just the right amount of food for the two of us. Hubby didn't feel like it was worth the $18 but that is about what you would pay at other non-chain artisan pizza places that offer that neapolitan style pizza so I was fine with it. Our service was ok though a bit rushed. By the time we were done eating there were a few empty tables so I didn't really see why it was necessary to take our plates away immediately after my last bite (seriously, I was still chewing) and then bring the check immediately afterwards without asking if we wanted anything else. I guess that is just how they do things there.

I'm glad I went since it is such a Phoenix landmark but I don't really see any reason to return.Being in Durant's reminds me of being a bit actor in a movie remake of some 1950s cult classic.  Like oceans 11.

The original had Sinatra and Martin and Davis, Jr and Bishop.  

The remake had Clooney and Pitt and Damon and Garcia.

And although the 2001 version was pretty good, maybe even VERY good, something about it seems disingenuous.  

But when we talk about the cool-factor of the 1960s "11", there is no denying that the film makes you feel like you're walking around like your number one.

Well, translate that into this dusty steak joint, that has somehow passed its prime and now seems like a poor remake of its former (classic) self.  Their food has sadly nose-dived into average, while their prices have sharply risen like a Vegas hotel room on a holiday weekend.

I only feel marginally dapper drinking in here.  Sure the bartenders are cool and quite aware, but the setting is dank and I feel like I'm drinking in an 80s mob bar that is trying to thematically play homage to a 20s speakeasy.  

Where once THIS was the steakhouse that others (even chains -- heya Bucco di Beppo) tried to emulate, everything just seems to have spindled out of order.  Its trying hard to work, but it just doesn't.  I'm also aware that they are under new mgmt and have changed some staples on the menu.  We shall see if they will return.

For now, I'm just going to stick to drinking the occasional scotch at the bar before moving on to Capital Grille or City Hall.Really nice food however it is very overpriced. $10 for guacamole is outrageous, even if it is prepared tableside.  The pollo mole is spicey with just the right amount of chocolate.  Service was nothing great, noticed the table next to us who had a different waitress got a lot more attention than our waiter gave us.  Would I go back again yes, but would like it much better if someone else was paying.Ok.  Let me start by saying that even though I'm a pretty confident guy, I don't consider myself to be "cool" or "hip" in any way.  I wear far too much plaid for that to be the case.  I was looking for a place in the area for a nice chai latte before heading to rehearsals, and this place had the highest / most reviews, figured I had to give it a shot.  I actually went in three different businesses looking for this one, so right off the bat I feel like an idiot.  I ordered my chai, even though I wasn't sure they had it - because there really is no menu displaying what your options are (I'm certain this is in an effort to be cool).  The beverage was ok, nothing special, but ended up costing me almost six bucks.  I will give them this - the ambiance is pretty amazing.  There are many places to sit and chill, lots of nooks and funky chairs, including a pretty cool back patio.  Outside of that, I just felt out of place and uncomfortable - despite the great soundtrack and pretty people.  So - I'm sure if I were cooler, or younger, I'd dig this joint, but it's just not my cup o' tea.The appetizers here are very good - both the crab puffs and the potstickers were solid.  The entrees are less so - the garlic chicken was okay but not great, the moo shu was meh. Huge chunks of veggies in the moo shu made it hard to eat, actually.  I also had the sizzling rice soup, which was pretty good though the broth could use a little more richness.I recently stayed here for 5 nights (in town for a friends wedding).  The staff was extremely friendly and helpful.  The room - while basic - provided all the necessities (even had a flat screen!).  The floor I stayed on was apparently just remodeled.  The observation deck on top provided an incredible view of the strip at night.  Several economical dining options were also provided (in the mall area, as well as roxy's diner).  The only reason I give it three stars is that cigarette stench permeated the casino floor.  The smoke smell also seemed to travel through the walls into the room we were staying in.  Additionally, the hotel is located at the far end of the strip. This requires guests to either have to take a cab (cost prohibitive), rent a car (annoying), or take the deuce bus (painful).  All in all, I had a pleasant stay and recommend the Stratosphere for the budget traveler.As a lover of burgers, I have to say that I was pretty disappointed with the Keller burger (bison on ciabatta).  I ordered it medium rare, in case you're curious.  It was well cooked.  It just didn't taste all that great.  And the bun doesn't work.  I think it would fare better with a brioche or pretzel bun.   Others at my table ordered the more traditional burger, which I thought was a little better.  Maybe it was the level of expectation I had, but I was disappointed.  I've had much better offerings at 25 Degrees, The Counter, and Father's Office.  Thumbs up on the sweet potato fries, but a no-go on the onion rings and steak fries.  

Now about the good.  Excellent service.  The banana split with the caramelized banana - I can't complain about that!  Each booth has its own TV with ESPN.  Just wish the burgers were better!  Sorry chef Keller.  I liked you best on Top Chef Masters.Mickey's is...interesting. I dig all the different rooms, which make for nice places to get away and chat. The few times I've been there, the bar area is PACKED full, people are all elbows, and it takes forever to get a drink. 

I love the outdoor area, might be my favorite behind Jolly Bob's as far as that goes. 

Well, I guess that if you survive getting to and from the actual bar, it's a nice place.visited this spot on the spur of the moment because it's directly across from the capital where they do the concert on the square with a colleague and her dad from out of town. i love irish pubs. my staple is to immediately go for the fish and chips. i seem to judge a pub on this dish, aside from any ales they make on tap (if it's a micro brew). but my eyes scanned the menu and i got caught up with some very uncharacteristic choices. 

we ordered the sweet chili shrimp for starters. very nice skewer of large shrimp and who can resist sriracha sauce? for an entree i ordered the lemon pepper fettuccine in an olive oil with mushrooms, leeks and parmesan. you have a choice of chicken, steak or salmon, but because i was such a fan of the shrimp, i asked my server if i could order it with shrimp instead. she told me they didn't serve shrimp... huh? 

i reminded her that i just had shrimp for the app, and she goes, "oh! no, those are PRAWNS." i couldn't help but laugh at this. nonetheless, i asked her to check with the kitchen to see if that would be possible. when she returned, she said they couldn't do it. funny. how hard is it to sautee a few shrimp and toss them on some pasta. right about now i'm regretting not getting the fish and chips. but i simply order another shrimp app with the meal and tell her i'll put the shrimp in the pasta my damn self. sheesh. 

food is good though. a little heavy handed with the oil, but the texture of the noodles was good, the flavor was pretty nice and light, and of course the shrimp set it off. place was noisy like a pub which i liked and expected, happy people having a good time.  good beer choices as well. i'll be back for the fish and chips.Not a ton of vegetarian options, but what they do have is pretty okay. During busy times, it is *very* loud and unusually dark.Mediocre... Is the best way to describe my experience with los sombreros.  We have been anxious to try this place for a long time.  It had pretty good reviews and a friend of our recommended it for a late night happy hour.   
To begin our waiter was a snob, he acted like we were lucky to have him, and at one point he actually rolled his eyes at us... seriously.   The guacamole looked fantastic coming out of the kitchen, so we started with that.  It was good, but it and the chips needed salt and there was none on the table.   The menu was not vegetarian friendly unless I wanted to order an appetizer salad.  They had a special on the board called "Mushroom Quesadillas", so I asked the server what was in them... trying to make sure it had no meat.  He said basically mushrooms and cheese.  So I ordered those.  What I got was  essentially a mushroom and cheese tamale deep fried, No tortilla! It was okay, but I would never have ordered it if I knew what it was... which was why I asked.   Getting anything out of our server was like pulling teeth.  
The only reason I gave this place a 3 instead of a 2 was the chocolate cream pie dessert.  I think we may try it again for a reverse happy hour if someone invited us, but the prices were a little high for the food quality and service.We weren't given the room type we reserved, though our reservations were made weeks in advance. They did give us an "upgraded" room with newer finishes, but with two smaller beds, no coffee pot and no refrigerator to use.  The gym has minimal equipment.  From Vegas and having visited The Palms many times before, this is not the place that I remembered.Nice enought place.  Very busy place. Great for groups wanting to have fun in Vegas.Good hotel, good service, clean, but showing it's age compared w/ the competition. I would stay there again. It's proxemity to lv convention center can't be beat.This is a late review but here goes. Fiance and I stayed here last October. We've both been to Vegas before but this was our 1st trip together. Everything about the place is sort of average to just slightly above. It was clean and had a decent size room but the casino is very under-whelming. We were out and about so much that it served the purpose of a decent place to catch a few hours of sleep between activities. Did not eat at any of the dining establishments as none caught our eye. The location off strip is a bit hindering but it is on the mono-rail which remedies that quite a bit. I will say if you are a sports junkie then definitely spend some time in their sportsbook. It was a pleasant surprise. Wouldn't stay there again but after hearing that Hilton is pulling out we do plan on going back for drinks and the sportsbook for the nostalgia factor.Lodged here plenty of times when it was a Hilton property as part of the Honors program - Good times = Great memories.

Booked on a whim to spend a weekend with the fellas minus the old ladies 'cause we got a deal too good to pass up. 

Turns out it was subpar visit. Aside from the busted A/C to the crowded cloudy-watered swimming pool, the staff was nice and friendly so that earns the 1st Star. 

Buffet was above average for the cost & selection - 2nd Star

I'm giving them a 3rd Star because if it wasn't so boring and dull here, we would probably have spent less time venturing out around town and finding the trouble we were looking for in the first place. 

Overall the LVH feels more accomodating as a family place, just not the type of atmoshphere I'd prefer to be around in the City of Sin.Wasn't the nicest place I've stayed, but far from the worst.  Hated the restaurants.  Very overpriced, and staff didn't seem happy to be employed. The worst valet service in Vegas. Waited 25 minutes to leave my car, and another 40 to get it backJust checked out this morning!

We were in the red room and it was decent. Basic room, basic layout, basic bed, basic bathroom. Everything was typical hotel room. 

Pros: easy walk from check in to elevators. Close places to bring food back to room.

Cons: weak shower pressure. Bad tv reception. 

I guess after that horrible room at the MGM I was so glad to have a bigger room, and a door on my bathroom. 

Would not mind staying here again.Obviously, the sushi is good, but the atmosphere is blah.  You can get great sushi at many other places that are less expensive and with better vibes.  Here, you're paying for the name.Monte Carlo is starting to show it's age, but it's still a decent on strip bargain.
Tip- pay the extra few bucks for a room upgrade, the higher floors are in much better shape than the lower ones. Lower ones would get 1 1/2 stars from me- pretty bad.

Beds are comfortable, and the rooms are decent sized. They now give you two in room complimentary coffees (Keurig, not too bad)  to save you the hike down to the Starbucks at the food court. The CVS next door sells Keurig pods,  so you can stock up, if you are a heavy coffee drinker like myself.

Alarm clocks with phone docking station.

The resort fee (and extra $20 on top of the room rate) includes the coffee, WIRED in room internet, newspaper, and gym usage.

Pool is very good, but they have added too many cabanas, and now seating is pretty difficult, unless you show up around opening time. Pool closes at 7. They sell and rent floats for the lazy river ($10-20). Beers are about $8. DJ on the weekends.

Valets do a good job, so do the bellhops,  and the maids tend to do a much better job on the higher floors...a decent tip will certainly help in all these areas, and  is much appreciated.  Front desk service is good.

Skip the Buffet- go to Aria, Bellagio or Wynn. All good bets. The room service is fairly reasonable for Vegas.

All in all, you can certainly do worse, and the cheap rates and good pool keep me coming back. if you don't care about the pool however, I would keep looking. You can stay at a much nicer place for another $50 or so a night.My husband and I brought our two sons and three of their friends to Las Vegas as a birthday surprise for our younger son. We chose the Monte Carlo because we thought they would enjoy the pool area, and they really did.  If it weren't for the pools, we might have changed hotels. It wasn't awful, but we really wanted everything to be perfect for this trip. We travel a lot for business and are used to overlooking a lot. There are a lot of minor irritations with this stay that will lead us to stay elsewhere next time. 

The check in process took a half hour to get one of our three rooms. It was early, so we were okay that all the rooms weren't ready but taking that long when we wanted to get to the pool was a bummer. We were told that our reservation is only a request for a certain room type and they wouldn't guarantee an adjoining room for the guys or a king room for my husband and I. When we finally got our room, we were told it was a king but we got there and it wasn't. We ended up getting a king but had to give up the strip view we reserved. Not a big deal, but pretty disorganized. 

The rooms are okay - nice linens and the decor is fine but the bathrooms are pretty dated. The Internet is only available via a cable so no Internet for devices other than a laptop.  The room seemed clean but there was a towel in our bathroom with urine on it that I almost used on my hair. Thank god it fell on the floor with the pee side up or I wouldnt have noticed it.  I let the front desk know so they could let their staff know to watch for stuff like that. They apologized and ordered a full cleaning for our room.  For some reason half the lampshades in the rooms I was in looked like someone sat on them. Kinda weird. 

All in all the Monte Carlo is pretty decent but I will try a different place next time. I wanted to treat everyone to the Blue Man Group but the best discount the hotel offers still leaves tickets over $100 per person - pretty hefty for our group of seven. Stay here if you want a fun pool area, just don't expect too much out of the rest of the experience.The show was great, the performers were awesome but the crowd management was horrible. Customers entered at-will during the entire show and created a distraction by obscuring the view of the stage. They do a better job at a baseball game...

If you go see the show, sit in the front row.I had been looking forward to this show for about 3 years! For some reason, every time I've been to Vegas in the past 3 years (About 4 times), Zumanity was on hiatus (holiday weekends off, maybe?). Anyways, after all that hype, I was a little disappointed.

Highlight:
- Edie the drag queen host was effing hilarious and was great at improv with people in the crowd
- The Sex Therapist Couple: the woman was hilarious! Especially her "Scotch baggies" skit. I was laughing so hard!

Low Light:
- Racist black people dancing like animals with bongo music playing. Wtf? There were no other race-related/stereotypical dances that happened!
- If you don't sit at stage-level, you might as well not go. My husband and I sat on balcony level because we heard the cast brings people on stage and wanted to avoid that at all costs. However, we were penalized seeing only about 60% of the impromptu stuff with the crowd in the beginning and at random times during the show
- The show wasn't that sexy! It was definitely more of a scantily-clad circus than anything else

Unforgettable Moment:
- The bondage skit had everyone in the entire theater holding their breath. It was so sexually-charged! 

My recommendation:
Go see them with a comp ticket, travel deal, or with the savings they are offering with this being their 10th year anniversaryI was really expecting a lot more from the Venetian.

When we arrived at the hotel I was so excited.   It's such a huge place and seems really beautiful.  Upon closer inspection it's really plastic and fake.  Then you open the doors and are hit with the most nauseating, cloying perfume scent.  It's like the scent of concentrated cheap laundry detergent.  It is apparently pumped throughout the lobby and main areas of the hotel.  We then saw the winding line of weary looking travelers waiting to check-in.  I actually felt my heart sink.  Fortunately a hotel employee directed us to the elevator and told us to check-in on the 2nd floor.  I'm pretty sure this saved us half an hour or more.  

It took two elevators and about 5-10 minutes to get from the lobby to our room.  The hotel is MASSIVE being attached to the Palazzo.  Our room was spacious and nicely air-conditioned.  The whole room was sort of beige and not really as pretty as I would expect.  Our view was so-so.  Not much to see on the non-strip side.  The bedding was awful and scratchy.  I would have expected soft sheets and down or fluffy duvets for a hotel that calls itself 5 star.  Instead it was a somewhat stained and icky bedspread.  We didn't hear any noise at night which was nice.  The rooms are definitely showing their wear.  The worst part was opening the fridge to check out the goods and finding a styrofoam container of the previous occupants leftovers.  Some nasty looking buffalo wings or something that had clearly been there for days.  You would think they'd check the fridge!  

The printer in our room did not work and even after we got new ink cartridges it still didn't work.  We told the front desk when we checked out but she just scribbled something on a piece of paper that I'm sure is sitting in a recycle bin right now.  

The swimming pools and hot tubs are fantastic and completely enjoyable.  They were the best part of our trip.  They are packed to the brim with college-aged kids and 20-somethings working off their hangovers and perfecting their tans, which was kind of icky.  It mellows out during the week and at dinner time and becomes a great place to hang out.

Our reservation confirmation had Free Continental Breakfast in bold letters yet we didn't get any coupons for it.  We decided we'd try and get breakfast but were quickly denied at the door.  We went to talk to the front desk and were again denied.  Finally my girlfriend pulled up the actual confirmation email on her phone to show the guy and he handed us our passes.  Sill we were shorted a pass as there were three people staying in our room.  I felt like the whole thing was kind of cheap.  The breakfast was OK.  The pastries were grocery store quality, the coffee was pretty bad.  The bananas and apples were really brown and sad-looking.  The juice and oranges were edible.  

The restaurants inside The Venetian were all good.  We particularly enjoyed the Mexican place.  Prepare yourself to pay a lot for food.  I don't know if that's Vegas in general or just the restaurants of the Venetian/Palazzo.  We also really liked the Italian place - Dal Toro.  I felt like the cost of the food was equality to the quality and I'd go to them again even if I wasn't staying at The Venetian.

In general The Venetian is packed with the same types of people -"bargain" hotelers (us), 20-somethings straight out of the Jersey shore, and unknowing international travelers. It's not a place full of high rollers. 

I'm not sure if I would come back to The Venetian or not.  I suspect there are better hotels on the strip for more money, which is worth it to me.No wonder this hotel was featured in the movie "Vegas Vacation". Between the jungle feel of the casino, the mini-volcano out front and Siegfried and Roy (RIP), this hotel - the first of the Strip mega-resorts - has enough hokey Strip personality (now almost a cliche), to fill ten thousand coin buckets.  The last time I stayed here was five years ago, and I understand from others who've stayed more recently that it has deteriorated but the parent company, MGM Mirage, is planning major renovations.Disclaimer: I'm not a Vegas guy. Neither my wife and I dig the Vegas vibe but we (son included) wanted to see The Beatles Love show, so we chose The Mirage.

No complaints really. Pool/Strip view room was great and reasonable (Thurs-Fri). Staff was helpful, many eateries on site and the pool was a kick with waterfalls. Being there with an 11 year old we weren't interested in the clubs, and we're not gamblers, but the resort has plenty to offer in that capacity. Good In-Room dining.

One note for parents: The Beatles themed clubs aren't family friendly as some might think. Example - As we headed back to our room on Friday the Revolution Lounge had girls dancing in the letters...Not a big thing but for a Tween it might mean a lot of filtering/explaining away.

The Beatles Love show was excellent. Really imaginative, creative and inspired.Although I am a Vegas veteran and have been to MGM many times, I stayed here for the first time this Christmas. We stayed in the West Wing for 2 nights. 

I had originally booked the very basic room, but at check in I was upgraded for free to the West Wing. (FYI - you can check in at the airport. Look for the MGM desk behind baggage claim.) The West Wing rooms were modern but small, reminding me of rooms in cities like NY and SF. The bathroom was especially cramped - no tub, little vanity space, toilet and shower separated by an opaque glass divider. We couldn't find room for the trash can without blocking the door of either the shower or the toilet closet. The room also featured a scale. Note to MGM - I don't want to weigh myself in Vegas. 

But I will say the West Wing is conveniently located with good signage directing you to it throughout the casino. One concern I had with MGM is that it would be too, too big, and the West Wing took you away from the monstrosity of the main hotel tower. 

I think MGM has one of the best sports books in Vegas, and I like the Stage Deli that is immediately next to it. The buffet was yummy (my surprising favorite selection? brussel sprouts!) and the food court had a Nathan's Hot Dogs! The pedestrian bridge between MGM and NYNY is a handy way to get to the other side of the strip. 

I'm convinced the lions on display are drugged, but interestingly the motorized alligator at the Rainforest Cafe seemed to be a more popular attraction. 

As far as fine dining, the selection there is growing. I've eaten at Emeril's place there and enjoyed it, but it was ten years ago so I don't feel I'm qualified to give a thorough review. The resident Cirque show, KA, is excellent. 

In a nutshell - MGM is a solid, albeit nothing special, choice.Location is great, restaurants are great. The rooms are dated, and the remodeled ones are kind of weird. Lets just say there is no privacy when you go to the pooper, echos like a motha.This is probably a 3.5 star review, but I can't go up to 4.  We stayed at MGM during the first weekend of the NCAA tournament, so it was way crowded.  This is to be expected.  However, what was not expected was MGM doing work on the 24 hour coffee shop, which is typically the best (and at least most reliable) place to get breakfast in a casino.  It was poor planning to have this construction going on during one of the busiest Vegas weekends.  So, that was annoying.

The rooms are solid but not spectacular.  One thing that's nice about MGM Grand is there is a broad spectrum of things to eat, from a food court to Joel Robuchon.  Craftsteak is always a winner in my experience.  You have a good amount of dining options here.

I've been to several concerts at the Grand Garden Arena.  They do a great job of getting you in and out quickly.  

Front desk staff is very courteous, as is the MLife staff.  Dealers as well.  Very solid hotel all around.The rooms are dark. They should have more light in the room. Also there's no fridge or microwave. I understand not having an microwave. The LCD TV is small, I think it's a Phillips 32". The hot water is not hot enough when you take a shower or bath. The big negative is that here's a Resort Fee (about $20). They should just add this to grand total not try to hide it. 

I watched the Pirate show in front of the hotel which was okay. My room was in the back on the 8th floor and I was surprise that we can not hear the sound from the pirate show which is a plus.

The good part about Treasure Island is that the hotel is in the middle of the strip. Well, to me the hotels between Wynn and Paris Paris/Bellagio (maybe Planet Hollywood) are the central of attraction. Anything beyond it you're not missing much. You might want to visit Fremont Street also.it was good. but it was Vegas so it is what it is everything was kinda on the expensive side though for treasure island and there was not a fridge in the room and every time we called room service they would be like and hour wait so it was a little aggravating but nothing we couldn't deal with. plus the view from our room was to die for and made up for everything.Stayed here for 3 nights, only reason to stay here is the price, (older hotel) comes with a sunk-in bed. I realize its Vegas but the channel selection for TV not so great.  Average buffet, and decent gaming.  If you stay here you probably won't be spending much time at this place, with everything else that better offered on the strip.  Will definitely be staying at a newer hotel for my next stay.Definitely not the fanciest hotel in Vegas. But, it is centrally located, right in the heart of the strip.   And it is cheap.  Vegas is not the kind of town where you spend a lot of time in the room, you know?  Get one person to stay at the Bellagio so you can hang buy the pool on Saturday (get there early), then go to Rehab at the Hard Rock on Sunday.   Spend your money on doing fun things, not your room.ehhh......
a group of friends and I came here on our last morning before leaving Vegas.  I got the Gabi Chopped Salad with chicken and it really wasnt that good, especially for $15.  It sounded delish but ehh...  3 of my friends were in the mood for a really good crepe so they ordered the mushroom and chicken crepe.  They all hated it.  I took a bite and it was pretty nasty.  Someone else got the ham and cheese crepe and it was supposidly better than the mushroom crepe.  Another person got a burger but threw a fit because they didn't have American cheese.  The fit was stopped when he ordered a virgin pina colada and about died it was so good.  The last person ordered one of the steaks and frites and he really liked it.  They all said the frites were kind of weird though.

I would give this place 2 stars but the 3rd star is from the build-your-own bloody mary. mmm it was delicious!!  you could add celery, pepper, bell peppers, onions, carrots..i forget what else but the bloody mary was great.   the veggies were actually pretty wilted and not very fresh though, but whatever.Many people recommended Mon Ami Gabi to me for some time.  I decided to give this place a whirl and have dinner for my friend's birthday here.

I made reservations for our party of 4 for a Sunday night at 6:30pm on opentable.com.  Outdoor patio seating which has a view of the Bellagio water show is available but I believe it's on a first come, first serve basis.  We were lucky enough to get an inside table that had that view.  Note: they will not seat you until your entire party is present.  

The steaks were usually recommended to me.  I decided to order steak classique ($24.95).  I wanted a smaller piece of steak and our waitress made these steaks sound appealing saying that they were pounded down to about half an inch thick and would be extremely tender.  I ordered it medium rare, but it was more along the lines of medium well which had very little pinkness to it.  It was a bit tough and wasn't flavorful as I expected.  I had a bite of my friend's filet and that was delicious.  If I would've gotten that, Mon Ami would've received another star from me.  The accompanied fries were DELICIOUS.  The fries were cut thin and deep fried until crispy and very few soft pieces remained.

As an appetizer, we ordered the Escargot de Bourgogne ($10.95) which was yummy.  Six pieces of escargot was marinated in a garlic herb butter sauce which also made great dipping sauce for the bread.

Our waitress was nice but the servers were usually the ones that were more helpful.  I told the hostess that we were celebrating a birthday.  They brought him a small dessert with a candle (he didn't like us singing happy birthday lol).

Keep in mind, dinner is long and there is a lot of wait time between dishes.  I believe our dinner took more than two hours therefore don't dine here if you're crunched on time.

P.S. Think twice if you're ordering a drink. My friend ordered a Hennessy & 7up which he though was a bit watered down.  Turns out the drink was $21.There is a waiting line if u want to dine on the patio, you can wait at the bar and spend $11 for a Mimosa or spend your money gambling in the casino. Or just wait till the buzzer calls you, but then, why did you come to Vegas for? Great place to people watch and have an overpriced sliced tomato with some stinky cheese called salad. The quiche is good too, if you like quiches. You get a baguette and some butter to start with, but don't spend too much, just enjoy the good weather and the funny dressed tourists taking pictures of the Eiffel tower.I think this place used to be great.  Now, I feel like it's alright.  There's a lot of hype for big pieces of steak which I'm just not that into anymore. My food was undercooked and my mom's was waay to well done. Overall good atmosphere, although they try to maximize their customers and cram everyone into tight spots.For me, the Peppermill was just ok.  Maybe it was my choice in food, maybe it was the fact I was about to go get a tattoo, and that was on my mind, but either way, this place didn't WOW me.  Happened upon this joint based on a recommendation from a co-worker.  We went on Valentine's Day for lunch.  Loved the decor- the funky old school vibe was neat.

The coffee was big and excellent.  We shared the tomato soup which was surprisingly cheesy and very good.  In addition, we shared a chicken balsamic sandwich, which was fine, but nothing special.  The onion rings it came with were good, but nothing different than your typical onion ring.  The service was just so-so... had to ask a couple times for water, but it was super busy so that was understandable.

Basically, not sure if I will go back again- maybe to check out the fireside lounge, but for me it really didn't rock my world.The Flamingo is one of the old school Casino/Hotels in Las Vegas. Most of it's contemporaries have been torn down or are on their way down. Desert Inn, Stardust, etc. 

Hilton bought it quite a while ago to add it to their huge flagship Hilton on the north end of the strip near the convention center (well at the time it was huge, now it is being dwarfed by new projects). 

It has been remodeled and spruced up by Hilton, and now it really serves as a mid-level Casino/Hotel offering for Hilton in Vegas. Hilton has several large Condo/Timeshare properties now for non-casino vacationers, and the Hilton still serves as the flagship. But, a few years ago, Hilton sold this property to Harrah's Group. 

As such, the hotel is nothing special for Vegas goers, and in this town where the hottest thing is whatever is the latest and largest, the Flamingo dwarfs in comparison. 

Perhaps the best part of the hotel is the large tropical courtyard with its lush greenery. They do offer a lot of cheap room specials, so it isn't a bad choice for value travelers who still want some Vegas luxury, and don't want the riff raff in the next room that comes at the Circus Circus, Hooters, Stratosphere or Excalibur.Always fun in the casino, the history of this place is so special it's hard not to have funNot that bad! I was nervous to book it hotel after reading the reviews on here,it is not that bad. We have a room facing ceasars palce. Location and veiw was amazing! Huge bathroom great customer service.Pretty nice hotel. Use the kiosks to check in for sure. Service was actually really friendly here. Some parts of the hotel are kind of ghetto but even in that part the rooms were nice. We also had a great view. Location is great and price was too.This is our second time staying here.  The last time was a few years back for a wedding held at this hotel.  We thought it was nice enough for the price and location to stay there for this recent trip.

I would say it's a no frills kind of hotel.  The rooms are small and the bathrooms even smaller.  They have done some room upgrades since our last stay (some type of synthetic hard flooring, better than carpet).  This is not important to me , but I found it rather funny that part of the room decor was upgraded (bedding, flooring) and some were not (tables/dressers/bathroom).  If you don't care about staying in a trendy hip hotel, this is your place.  It's a decent place to rest your head, located halfway down the strip.

There is a new street (Link) located next to the Flamingo, so that's a bonus.  You don't have to wonder too far from your hotel to find a fun place to hang for the night.I can see where this place can go wrong. I had a decent experience. The entry level room is nothing to brag about but the pyramid hotel structure is really cool. Im interested in knowing how much theyre going to charge me for the missing hotel room glass. My bro on the other hand had the tampon in the hotel room toilet experience which matches up well with other reviews on yelp. I wont go back but wont badmouth this place either. The pool was real chill, good place for some r&rRooms are old and dingy. Stuff was broken in my room but they fixed it in a day. Crappy TV, no Wi-Fi - have to use a long lan cable. Casino is ok, some low limit tables which I like. Some decent clubs in the hotel. One of the decent cheaper hotels.Stayed here last night. First off, they charge a mandatory "resort fee" of $15/night ontop of the room charge. This fee is "for your convinience" and is not advertised until you show up to check in. It includes wifi, a newspaper, and a telephone in your room. A total rip off. People checking in were furious about this and the hotel will not budge. If you don't pay it they cancel your reservation. Well, the Wifi signal was weak, I never got a newspaper, and I have this thing called a cell phone so didn't need a room phone. I don't know how they can legally do this its a total scam.

The elevators were totally ghetto. Walls grafitiied, buttons smashed in, mirrors broken. Looked horrible.

The room was nice. The bathroom was clean and just remodeled. Huge shower. The carpets are worn and stained. Some electrical outlets were lose. No iron or safe in the room. The TV sets were small and at least 20 years old.

Would I stay here again... yes. For the price of $40 I can't complain.

I would say just remodel the place and give the common areas a good scrub down. The entire hotel is really showing it's age. Needs to be renovated.Dear Luxor,

I want to like you. I mean, come on, you're a giant pyramid. However the 45 minute check-in line on a week day (not exaggerating) and the ten minute check-in process that made the line make more sense (still serious) was painful. 

What's even more painful? Being on the same side of the hotel as the pool -- that means being forced to listen to a very loud and proud rendition of Bruno Mars and every other top 40's hit at 8 a.m.. Sometimes your guests want to sleep in. Sometimes they don't want to be barraged with bad pop music until 10 o'clock. 

That brings me to my next point... the pool and hot tub are only open till 8. (Everyone told me all things in Vegas are 24 hours, your pool doesn't even stay up as late as my grandparents.) And your work out room closes at 7?

I want to like you, Luxor, I really do. You can start right now by turning down the music and restarting it in an hour with something sexier like Portishead or Goldfrapp. Please and thank you.

Yours,

NaomiWe started our weekend at the Luxor with a major negative. After checking in, we lugged all our suitcases and bags all the way through the Luxor, up the elevator and then nearly all the way around the pyramid only to find out that our assigned room already belonged to someone. There were clothes strewn about the room and everything! Major fail!

However, upon learning about their error, the hotel staff upgraded us to a suite without further question. The suite was great. We had a jacuzzi tub in our room and an extra living room, which gave us the much needed space to spread out our stuff. The room was clean and comfortable and even had a mini fridge.

One downside we quickly found about staying at the Luxor is the elevator system. Elevators are located at each of the points of the pyramid base but only go to a specific group of floors, often leading to a lot of extra walking. The elevators are also shaky, not sure if this is caused by age of the angle that the elevators travel at as it climbs the side of the pyramid.

The location at the end of The Strip also makes it difficult to get around. Next time I'll prefer to stay somewhere more central. But at least now I can say that I've satisfied my 10-year-old curiosity of what it would be like to stay in the giant pyramid.We stayed here for a couple nights just to experience what it's like staying in a pyramid. 

The staff was friendly and check in was pretty fast because they have a lot of staff. We stayed on the 18th floor and the view was nice inside and out. The elevator ride up was interesting..didn't expect to move sideways..we were caught off balance.lol 

The only negative thing I would say is the walk from your car to your room is pretty far. We did valet when we had to check in and I'm glad we did because it would suck to have to carry all our luggage with us.

Which I just remembered about their valet. The service was bad..there was a line of cars the guy had me go to the side and pull up to the cone. We got out of the car and started taking out our stuff and then the guy moved the cone and told us that we need to move forward! Seriously?! So we put our stuff back in and moved the car all the way and then the guy didn't even call anyone for us to help us with our luggage, my gf had to go find someone. Luckily the guy that helped us with our luggage was awesome! I don't remember his name but he was super friendly!

The hotel is just ok of course you can find some place better for the price. It's just a hotel to stay for a couple nights to experience the pyramid.Get me outa here!

Can I say that as the beginning of my review?  I'll bet you guessed I don't like Vegas too much.  Only here for a conference, so this is survival we're talking about here...

ANyway, the conference center is at Mandalay Bay, and seemingly there isn't a slot machine in sight.  Nor a gambler... just lots of geeks doing geek stuff!

I'm sure I'll survive though, just have to make it until Thursday when I speak... 

I should say something about the conference center.  It's clean, and immense.  Last year they had more bean-bag chairs to sit on, but very few this year it seems.  Also there's no wifi, at least it's not turned on yet.  Soon I'm guessing...I'm going to keep this one short:

1 star for:
THE ELEVATORS - we had to wait in lines sometimes for 20 minutes or more before we could get on an elevator - especially during checkout on Sunday (we walked down 21 flights instead).

2 stars for:
Location - all the way at the south end of the strip. A little far from everything except the airport...
Restaurants, shops, hotel entertainment - very expensive. Example? $17 sunscreen and $6 bottles of water. WTH?

3 stars for:
The rooms - comfy and clean, but you can hear everything in the halls.
The wave pool - way too crowded and the pool was just kind of gross.
Lazy river - fun, but doesn't come with flotation devices so we just walked through it - tons of children there!

4 stars for:
Landshark Lagoon - peaceful fun (21+ only), great waitress service, cornhole/bags, hot tub and a nice shallow pool to wade through.

We spent most of our time at the pool or out and about in Vegas. I would rather stay at a more centrally located hotel next time.Nothing like an auto weapon in your hand and target before you.  A mere 25 rounds does not make for prime time shooting, but it beats a day shopping with a metro-male.
No reservations and a standing in line wait costs stars, but this place stays busy so weigh out your values.
The staff know what that they are doing and provide crowd control so some bubba is shooting you with an weapon on auto.  :-)We were in Vegas for 3 days and I wanted to try a really good steakhouse. I told my husband I wanted to go to Craftsteak for dinner and made reservations. We showed up 15mins early and was seated right on time of our reservation. The service was great and very helpful. The food was excellent and cooked perfectly! The only complaint is why do you have to be located in the MGM?? It's doesn't help when your trying to have a nice dinner when you have two guys and a girl next to us and one of the guys was passed out! Oh and on the way out I had to use the restroom and two girls were puking! Kinda spoiled my nice dinner! Next time I'll stick to Del Frisco's or stripsteak where it is more classier.Not bad Not bad. Our server was really fun and nice. We got SOOOOO MUCH food because we had our meal comp'd by a friend. 

I didnt like the shredded pork tacos much. Fish tacos were BOMB! Nachos were BOMB! I cant remember what else I ate cuz I downed a few beers but I remembered it was BOMB.COM!Great atmosphere!
The tortillas are fresh but extremely greasy. The Guac was average.Been here two times in the past year and both times have been completely different from one another, so I guess I'll break it down for you:

First Time -- 1/5 Stars (A few months ago) -- The waiter had NO CLUE what he was doing. I have a Rock Star card at the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino, so they were supposed give us this deal where you got 99 cent tacos and margaritas for Happy Hour. He said he'd take care of us and he'd be right back with our food. 15 Minutes later, he came back and said he couldn't offer us the deal for some reason, because it wasn't the right time, or something but because he messed up, he'd give us a few tacos for the 99 cent offer. The guy literally took 45 mins to get us our food and drinks!! Definitely a bad experience and I was not too pleased at all. 

Second time (2 Weeks Ago) -- It was awesome!! Waiter was real friendly and gave us good recommendations. The quesadillas and the enchilada platter were awesome! My only complaint was the margarita, while tasting great, was kinda small since it was like $12 and I finished it pretty quickly. Otherwise, the place had great food, a good selection of modern mexican food, and great service. 

Overall, if I had a great experience both times I was there, I would probably give the place a 4, possible 5!Good tacos but overpriced for what you get, chips n salsa are mediocre.I agree largely with the review by HollyT. We went to Bouchon for my rehearsal dinner, it was actually Holly's idea. The server was one of these East Coast fast talker types, quick with the one-liners and so forth. That part was entertaining, as everyone was just happy to be eating together and it fits the Vegas atmosphere, but I can see how some people would prefer more subdued service (especially considering the amount of dough being dropped).

The B.L.T. (sous vide) was the highlight for me. Not that it was remarkable but I appreciate the process of it being cooked and the presentation. The food overall was great, just not spectacular. I agree with Holly's assessment that the appetizers were not impressive. 

As Holly said the barstaff paid a lot of attention to proper wine glasses throughout the meal, but then they served an after dinner cognac in a little champagne flute type thing. I'm not an expert but I'm pretty sure you're just supposed to serve cognac in a brandy snifter so your hand warms up the alcohol as you drink it. 

The other deal breaker for me was that they served freakin' TAP WATER with the meal. Granted, they asked us before eating if we wanted Evian or mineral water, but when people are spending $1200 on a meal (including drinks) you should not even give them an option for "Las Vegas's Finest," as the waiter put it. The tap water didn't even have ice.

Anyway, we had a great time. As Holly noted, my wife was choking on some steak at one point. The restaurant made sure she was fine and treated us to some excellent desserts to help celebrate our occasion. When you're at a high-end place like this, though, the devil is in the details. You don't serve god-awful tap water, you put more care into the appetizer dishes, and you don't put cognac on the menu unless you have the proper glassware to serve it in. I give it also 3 1/2 stars, but I'll round down to 3 because the expectations are high for this restaurant.3.5  only because no chicken and waffle and the waitstaff hatin on all of dis!!!!

   This is for breakfest.......

So came in with the PIC  and boy I never been stared down so much in my dining life. Mostly by the patrons but there were these two waiters that killed me. One chick and one dude. They were only 6 feet from our table and she whispered something to him and he turned to look my way and they went back to talkin shit!!!!! Who does that. At least go in the back and talk your shit! Whatever I know him and I very opposite in looks but we ain't new he's my PIC GAWD DAMN IT! And it is what it is! 

 Ok so scale the menu and even look at the specials and I don't see the crack chicken and waffles I kept frakin reading about and seeing in pics!!!!!!! Didn't want to ask about it, I was just damn hungry! So scaled the menu and couldn't figure out if I wanted breakfast or lunch because both sound great!

 Our waitress was nice unlike those losers that tried talking shit on me.  We started off with some champagne cocktails. I think I ordered Strawberry fields and it was deeeeeeeeeelish! I loved that drink and I could drink more but I really don't like drinking when the suns still up!  Onto the food we ordered. I ordered this dish with some bomb toast, potato sphere lookin thing lol eggs and sausage. PIC ordered the french toast and the side of bacon.  Everything looked like basic breakie BUT it was tassssty and fresh. The side of bacon was a BIG side of bacon. Im telling you like 8 pieces of thick cut bacon. I love putting sugar on my bacon and that hit the spot! I had no complaints from this breakfast. Straight to the point brekie, not fancy schmancy. PIC didn't say much about his dish since hes no foodie like me!

I will comeback here but if I see those two shit talking waiters, Im dropping a drink on both of their bobbleheads!Went to bouchon with a group for dinner. I guess I'm only giving it three stars because at that price point I would go elsewhere and because it didn't quite meet expectations which were admittedly high expectations.

We started with some cocktails which were very well made, strong and with great flavor. They also served bread and some excellent spread - I believe it was a salmon spread which was absolutely superb. I would have bought multiple jars of it on the spot if I could. Honestly, for me, it was so good it may have just been the highlight of the meal.

For an appetizer I got a squash soup which was quite tasty, but I've had better squash soups at Michael Mina, Circo, Mastros, etc. which are roughly the same price range. Again, it was good though, the flavor was there and the consistency was very good.

My entree was the braised short rib. This was the other highlight of the meal. It was cooked to perfection - soft, tender, melt in your mouth good. And unlike many other nice places, they didn't skimp on the sauce they put around it which I was very pleased about. The rest of the plate left something to be desired though, it came with some greens and as I recall some mashed potatoes both of which were flavorless and seemed like total afterthoughts to the protein.

Desserts were entirely forgettable. As is the case with so many nice places and group meals they don't actually ask or provide desserts, but instead leave a sampler tray of their desserts in miniaturized form. This is always so disappointing because if there's something good, there's so little of it. But to be honest, there wasn't much good, plenty of little treats loaded with heavy creams.

For me, Bouchon is good, but I'd rather go to one of the Strip's many other top restaurants.The negative: I made a reservation weeks in advance and asked to be seated by the Fountains. Apparently, they don't take reservations for that even though they give you a box on their online reservation form for requests. Go figure! When we were shown to our seat the hostess was very rude when I asked if there was something by the fountains. I didn't like the setup of the tables inside. We had a table along the wall that had the bench seat on one side and chairs on the other. The bench cushions sunk in, which made eating sort of difficult and the table next to us was pretty close. I think that makes for a somewhat uncomfortable dinning experience. 

The positive: The food is wonderful! My steak was cooked to perfection. The wine list was great. The service was good too. Nelson, our server, was on top of everything. I always like a restaurant that keeps my water glass full and fresh.I had a blast here the first time around. Girl dancers in cages, trapeze artist hanging and moving all over the place, the lighting and decor, sound system and the tunes..the beautiful people....We had so much fun that we didn't mind the overpriced drinks and how hard it was to get them....

The second time around, I was so excited, until my soiree got duped into getting a table reservation. The host and I, after much haggling and mathematical computations, came to a deal: 1 bottle purchase (@ $350up) and 2  heads out of the 8 of us will have to pay cover at $50 dollars each. To make sure I heard right, I ask the host again and she said "Cost of bottle plus $100 cover...that's it."


Now, it doesn't take a genious to figure out why I agreed to this deal. Basically, it's $450 for a table for 8 with all the service that comes with the bottle purchase....as opposed to $40/head for cover  - that's $320 - but no place to seat when you get tired dancing and having to struggle getting drinks at $12 a pop. It was a steal considering other places would require 2 bottles minimum purchase for a party of 8.

To make the story short, we're now comfy at our table and they rang the bottle before opening it...and it ended up costing $600 dollars after gratuiities and all assortments of tax which the host forgot to tell us about, who, by the way, had the audacity to ask me for her own tip because she "..really helped". It's still cheap but that wasn't the point. We were gonna get duped into paying something that we didn't agree on.

Anyway, it ruined the mood for everyone. We stepped out of the club without the $100 cover charge.Came here with my girlfriends for breakfast and a late dinner (after the club) one weekend. The diner was packed when we came early for breakfast. There was about a 10 minute wait before my party of 7 was seated. I ordered the Classic Rock entree which is your typical breakfast food - eggs, toast, hashbrowns and your choice of sausage or bacon. Food came out hot and was pretty good, however I didn't find it to be anything spectacular. Some other entrees my friends had ordered were their country fried steak, omelette burrito, and the aloha - all that looked a lot more tasty than mine! The proportions were decent and the prices were moderate. 

Dinner on the other hand, not so great. We noticed on Yelp that they had a $9.99 prime rib special, but apparently it was only available on Sunday nights!! There was another special going on that evening (or should I say morning at 2am) which was their steak and shrimp special with a side of mashed potatoes and salad for $7.77! What a DEAL right?! Well, you really do get what you pay for! The steak I thought was super chewy and I took two bites of it and was not able to finish the rest. The mashed potatoes were salty as heck and I was NOT the only one who thought so!! The chef's taste bud was totally off that night. Of course we complained, but the waiter was rude and said there's nothing he can do about it and that's how the mashed potatoes are seasoned. Considering I was incoherent, I spooned him some mashed potatoes and told him to try it himself and tell me it's not salty!! He walked away careless of what he had to say with no sincere apologies what so ever! But moments later, the jerk waiter returned back with complimentary fries along with the remark of telling us he told the chef to add no salt to the fries because we don't like salt. (Okk...whatever!) 

Anywho, breakfast here is pretty good. The dinner here may also be great, but I would highly recommend you not to order any of their dinner specials! It comes with a side of rudeness topped with extra ATTITUDE if you don't like your meal!!!I went to Shibuya for dinner after reading some good reviews. I sat at the sushi bar and it was a bit cramped. Overall the decor is very modern and sophisticated. I liked the look of the place. 

My server came over and I was pleased to find they had Justin Cabernet on their list. It is one of my favorite wines. I ordered a glass which arrived promptly. I ordered the Rock Shrimp Tempura and an order of the fatty tuna to start. The food arrived expediently. Now, here is my issue- I love Nobu so this place was behind the eight ball. The rock shrimp were very tasty but the portion was so small. It was $21 for a bowl the size of a miso soup bowl, with these small little shrimp doused in spicy mayo. Nobu's tempura rock shrimp are much larger and actually come in a dinner sized portion. I would have thought Shibuya's tempura rock shrimp was an appetizer had I not been explicitly told it was an entree. And as an "entree" it comes with nothing else. 

The fatty tuna was delicious, don't get me wrong. I'm accustomed to paying $20-25/2 piece sashimi. I was told the market price was $40. I was craving it so I got it and it was fresh and awesome but it seemed a little steep. My waiter came back around and I was still hungry so I got the salmon and avocado roll. It was some of the best salmon I've ever had. However, my waiter was harried, being in charge of literally the entire bar and some tables behind us. It seemed that on a busy weekend night, there should have been more help. I had ordered another glass of wine but it never came. I asked for my check and I had to have it altered because they had charged me for the wine even though I never actually received it. All in all, it cost me $120 with tip. It was not much food and while it was tasty, I don't know if I would make it a habit to return.We went here last week with another couple. Most of the food was tasty but some weren't that great for me. It was loud and hard to hear the server, and the service was very slow.When I showed up in Vegas everyone had such a mixed review or thoughts about this place. It came down to the typical "its something you need to check out once and take it from there". Well thats about what happened as we headed out to Pure for a friends birthday.

First and foremost, we did have VIP passes and I was really disappointed at the cluster fuck of a "VIP" line. It was a straight up mess. Granted I do understand this is Vegas and this club is "one of the best" according to so many locals and people who've gone out around the town. However, it was a mess. 

Ladies: Don't bother to get in with VIP, they'll let you in for free in a separate line that actually is organized.

back to the VIP mode: 

As we waited for a good 45mins I notice the bouncers were pulling groups in on the VIP who agreed to buy a bottle. Ok, this is straight stupid. Granted you are on the VIP as it is but these dudes were basically hustling fools by saying "You'll get in faster if you buy a bottle". LOL fawk that. Fools were paying 300 plus for bottles of cheap Vodka, we are talking like Absolute. 

Well after watching a few people fall into the trap we actually were finally let in. It was about 12:30ish and this place was packed! We were trying to figure out the lay out of the club but to be honest we were  really dying for a drink. We made it up stairs where there is a nice outdoor roof top which over looks the strip. This is by far a super nice spot to chill and get away from all the cluster fuck, but to be honest, it was just as crowded if not more. We finally landed a drink after doing the Old School rave march, AKA running to the bar and being completely rude while doing it. It worked so fuck it.

Well all in all this place was just waaaaaay tooo packed but we did have a great time. 

Downsides:
Long Lines: (Both Bar and Entry)
Unable to hang out:  bouncers were constantly moving the crowd which got annoying when trying to just sit in one spot and chill
Handfuls of wanna be pimps
Handfuls of stuck up women

ok those last two are everywhere. LOL

Upsides:
Plenty of places to explore, if you are willing to fight the crowd.
Music; typical club wash (top 40's and old school hits)
Good Views outsides
Nice Decor
Good People


Overall it was not the "shit" like everyone was telling me. However it did also represent the whole "you have to go once!".

SO Average club with nice decor, decent music, and a sea of people. Yup that is pretty avg.PURE was okay. If you follow the secret insider tips then you'll have a better time than most others, so read carefully!

COVER: If you call the day of and ask to be put on the GUESTLIST, you don't have to pay cover. It's that simple. We were there on a Saturday night during the busy labor day weekend, and we all got on the guestlist, avoiding the huge charges!

LINES: Expect to wait 30 minutes to 2 hours... unless you're on the guestlist! We got in almost right away, and our guy to girl ratio was 3:2, which is why I was surprised that we got in.

DRINKS: The wait for drinks isn't too bad, especially because there are 3-4 bars in the 3-4 areas. Prices are slightly above standard. It was my friend's birthday, but they don't do any free drinks. 

I had a jagerbomb, lemon drop, buttery nipple, kamikaze, three wise men, liquid cocaine, and tried my friends' tokyo tea and washington apple. They were all stiff enough for my liking, and were made fairly quickly. Remember to tip!

CROWD: Hipsters, aged 25-33, with the occasional man or woman in their 40's or 50's. My friends and I were all 21 so we felt super young. It seems like all the youngins go to Tao when they come to Vegas. 

ROOMS: The rooms were all nice. Lots of lights and some Pussycat Dolls dancers. cooooool.

Overall a cool place if you're on the guest list.Pure was alot of fun, The line was extremely long, since it was myself and 3 other ladies, we pretty much skipped all of that and had been escorted right in. I was EXTREMELY excited to come here and maybe that's why this place did not meet all of my expectations.

The main room only played techno music, and that was really loud and annoying. It was extremely crowded and the crowd was all townies and strange.

I had been to Jet and Body English the 2 nights before, at which I had an amazing time and Pure was a bit annoying in comparison.

Hey, to each his own.Really don't know what the hype is about this place. I've seen much better all you can eat brunch places for similar or lesser price. 
Let me start with black caviar - it is not Beluga and as such it looks and tastes completely different and for those who never had black caviar before it would be an awful experience to try this caviar. Believe me I was born in Russia and know my black caviar :-).
Second most advertised thing for the buffet is lobster tails - well they were so dry that nor butter or lemon could bring them to life.
Hence, the two things I really wanted to attend this place for were awful. Without caviar and lobster tails this buffet should not cost more than $45 and we paid $90 for what the called "caviar" and supper dry lobster tails.I feel like this buffet is losing it's touch.

I can remember eating here a few years ago and I thought everything was so great!  The scrambled eggs were the best I'd ever tasted.  The milk, so fresh and cold!  Everything was so so so so good.

This time around, everything was still good.  But not the best.

I did enjoy that they put out salmon and tuna nigiri's for dinner time.Gorgeous eggs benedict, not best service((I am not as impressed as everyone else.  The sushi is my favorite here as I have yet to be disappointed with it.  I find the meats to be dry and any pasta rubbery.  Snow crabs legs are good and the king crab legs tasted too fishy.  It is really crowded so it is hard to see everything on the tables.  The desserts are merely ok and not delicious enough to be called desserts.  I got sick about 2 hours after eating here.  Wynn's buffet is better.This WAS the best buffet in Vegas many years back. The spacing is quite congested and not modern. Dinner price was $27.99 with a 10% discount if you're staying at Planet Hollywood. There were stations representing different ethnic areas, American, Asian, Middle Eastern, Mexican, Italian as well as a dessert and salad station. The good;  chicken curry, tandoori chicken, crab legs and fried chicken the mediocre; prime rib, desserts and the salads, the bad; minestrone soup, spring rolls and the fried shrimp. Pay a little more and go to Aria, Wynn, Bellaggio or Cosmopolitan.

WOULD I GO BACK? If I were staying at Planet Hollywood and too lazy to venture out.....yes.This place is just an average casino buffet that you can find everywhere. Nothing too bad and nothing too special.We had high expectations for this buffet because it was all our friends raved about. Although the selection was great, the food was mediocre (should that be expected in a buffet?)

The Buffet overall 
Our Rating (on a scale from 1-10; 10 being the best): 7

Ambiance/atmosphere: 6 - The atmosphere was okay. Lots of people and we sat in the corner, which was nice. However, it felt much like being in a cafeteria and that detracted a little from our experience.

Service: 5 - The waitress would come pick up our plates occassionally but with a large party they stacked up quickly. However, each time she came by, she was very friendly, as was the rest of the staff.

We havent been to many buffets in Vegas, but from what we've eaten this one was pretty good. 

Until next time!

-N & HTao...

I actually like this place for the dancing experience and the look of the place. It is impressive to look at and the music was really good. However one thing that got to me was the price of drinks seriously almost 30 bucks for two goose and tonics that are served in the tiniest glasses with way too much ice...Im sorry but for me that is a killer. 

I didn't wait in line long so I was happy and I tried to pay cover and the cashier just handed me back my cash so that was a win...the people here I reallly didnt pay much attention to, I could sense the douchebags and what not but came with awesome people to that is all that mattered. I had way more fun in the upper level that played house and dance music then i did in the RnB room...

In short its a nice looking club, good music, cool DJ's, Hot bartenders that rape your wallet and leave you sober though....Check it out if your a clubbin kinda person!I am giving this 3.5 stars and rounding down.

After Chef Bartolotta won the James Beard award for the Southwest I made a reservation here.

We started with some soft shell crabs and I was very disappointed.  I have had a lot of softshell crab recently because it is in season, but this one was not that good.  Not sure if it was the crab or the preparation but it was definitely not juicy like it should be and it was a little too crunchy.  

I ordered his "signature" ravioli and my companion ordered something like spaghetti with meat sauce (sorry I don't remember the name).  The ravioli was very, very rich. Too rich for me and I like rich foods.  The other pasta, however was excellent.  

Then the star of the meal and what they're famous for is the fish from the Mediterranean Sea which they bring in daily.  They offer a wide variety of fish, preparations, and sauces.  I went with the sea bream and thoroughly enjoyed it.  Perfectly executed and I really enjoyed the sauce with fresh tomatoes in it.  The tomatoes tasted like San Marzanos.

The service was pretty good.  Our main server was very helpful and knowledgeable but the other one who comes by to fill the water and other stuff was slow.  I was thirsty throughout the meal but couldn't figure out where she hid our water bottle.  

I can't remember if we got dessert.  Total bill for two was $250  (no alcohol).  I'll probably be going back - I wanna try more of their pasta.  Maybe I'll order it from the bar if that's allowed.I recently dined at Bartolotta during my stay at the Wynn this past weekend. We had scheduled a reservation well in advance and in spite of some of the reviews on the poor service I was very optimistic. 
It was beautifully decorated and the outside cabanas were gorgeous. We had a party of 8 and did not have to wait long for our table which was perfect. We were greeted right away by the somelier and presented with a 59 page binder of their wine list. The restaurant was extremely crowded and the entire dinner took more than 3 hours. There was such a long pause between the appetizer and main entree course that everyone was becomming wrestless and by the time the entree arrived everyone was just over it. My boyfriend and I ordered the Seafood Risotto and Ricotta Ravioli appetizers  which were fantastic! I then ordered an arugula salad with pancetta and balsamic vinegar. I thought it was so so and found the pancetta a bit tough.  Three of us decided to split the fish entree and had it served tableside with a lemon, olive oil and  garlic, marinade. Our waiter did a fabulous job deboning the fish and serving it to the three of us. This was probably one of the best points of our dinner.

I found this restaurant to be upscale Italian and not for everyone. I witnessed a party of 10 men come in, be seated, look at the menu and then get up to walk out. I did enjoy the food overall and had we not had such poor service I probably would have given it 4 or 5 stars.There is a lot of restaurants all over Vegas and I have seen this place tons of times and decided to give it a try.  The setting is nice, but the beer selection is so so.  I wanted a Stella or NewCastle and had to settle for a corona.  They have lunch specials, I had the Lobster Bisque, which was ok, I have had better.  The crab cakes on the other hand was really good.  It's worth a try, but don't think I'd try again.The chili rubbed double ribeye is probably one of the more popular dishes on the menu at SW Steakhouse. It's huge, feeds 3 people (possibly more), is cooked well and has good flavor. But I can't bring myself to give SW more than 3 stars because I would rather save $106 and pay a little more for a simpler steak! I prefer my steak to be simple so I can taste the beef. The chili rubbed ribeye has a lot of spice which I think takes away from really enjoying the meat.

The beat salad here is very tasty, if you like beets. My favorite side dish is the truffle creamed corn. Delicious! The scallops and risotto are also a good choice. Definitely save room for dessert too. Last time I was here, I had the funnel cake (which everyone orders) and the warm sticky toffee pudding. The pudding is really good!!

Service at SW is great and everyone is very attentive, which they should be if you're spending that much for your dinner. It's also nice to be able to sit by the Wynn waterfall and watch the show that takes place every half hour. If I come back, I think I'll try a different steak so I can write a better review.I've been to a number of steakhouses in Las Vegas and none of them stand out - for the food. This place stood out for two things. First, the water show. Second, the prices. I have no qualms with paying exorbitant prices for outstanding food. I have a slight problem paying exorbitant prices for marginal food. This is marginal food.

The steaks were about as good as you can find at any other steakhouse. Some of the sides, appetizers and salads were above average. I think when you're spending $100+ per plate on dinner, it ought to be off the hook good. Not so at SW Steakhouse.

Slightly upturned face.Yummy spot; worth checking out, especially if you don't want to spend a fortune for dinner. 

It's a little tricky to get to from the main entrance of the hotel (meaning it's a jaunt). The food is prepared well and the restaurant gives off a fun and trendy vibe. One major drawback, we were seated near a really noisy group of about 20 people (the amount of tequila consumed by this table may have added to their noise level). It made it really difficult to carry on a conversation with the others at our table. 

Highly recommend the guacamole prepared table side!On our second work trip to the MGM, this was a new experience for me. 

Once we were seated, we ordered three batches of the guacamole (mild, medium, and hot). The hot was super good and I probably could have just eaten that all night. The salsas left nothing to be desired, but I believe I only tried 2/3 that they brought out. I do wish they would have refilled them during our meal though, since some people wanted to use them on their main courses. 

I heard good things about the tacos so I had the chicken taco plate. What came out was not what I was expecting, a HUGE platter with cheese and lettuce in one section, chicken in another, beans in another, and rice in the last. Plus a container of tortillas. What would have put this over the edge was well seasoned chicken, but it was just okay. Everyone else's meals looked good, and really my meal was not bad, just wished it had a little more kick. I'd probably try them againI'm always teetering between good and bad here.  Some trips I get perfectly done crepes, other trips I get some funky ones that make you wonder what you're eating.  It's come to the point that I have to watch them make the crepe and observe each step to ensure I get what i want.

There are times when the crepes get too thick, sometimes too thin.  A lot of the workers there like many in the restaurant industry, believe that more is always better.  that rule does not hold true for savory crepes.  I don't need an overload of sodium to my diet, so you can keep the extra sauce off, and no need for extra seasoning either.  The same goes for sweet tooth's.  Piling on a mountain of whipped cream or berry sauce isn't going to make my taste buds jump w/ joy and I really don't want to frequent my orthodontist often.

When I do happen to get a good crepe, it's heavenly.  I'm not too big on savory crepes, but I'll grab a bite here and there off someone else's if they get it.  Call me a sweet guy, cuz it's always about the berries, or chocolate when it comes to these wonderful desserts.Can I copy someone else's review?  I completely agree with Vivian.  This place is all about the view.  In fact, it's really about 3 things...

1) The view
2) Being able to brag to friends "I've been to the Ghost Bar"
3) The ride up the elevator

Other than that...eh.  First of all, the place was filthy.  The gray-ish carpet had stains all over it.  I don't know why, but that shocked me.  I remember thinking as I walked in "this is IT?".  I was actually convinced we were at the wrong bar.  The tables and chairs looked cheap and, along with the carpet and bad lighting...I was completely underwhelmed.

So, I spent my time outside.  The view was great.  And, of course, you gotta stand on the glass floor.  The angle of the walls actually kinda of did some tricks with my head for a minute, so it takes a while to get your bearing (at least, it did for me.  Or...was that the vodka?)

Anyway, been there...done that...probably won't go back.I actually have seen this show twice. The first ime was when it first debuted in Vegas some years ago. That was before a host of new Cirque shows pop up in LV. The first time I thought it was awesome...because I have not seen anyhting like it before. 

Recently, we went to see it again...this time I found it less entertaining. Maybe its because I have had a chance to see the newer Cirque shows like Ka. I will rate Ka way ahead of O for the wow factor. 

If you choose to go see O stay away from the corner sections...better to sit further back center than upfront to the sides. And no rain coats are not needed even if you choose a wet seat. Enjoy!The good: the chicken on my spinach salad was real chicken, not that reprocessed chicken nonsense, and the pecans were freshly candied. The dried cranberries weren't plumped, but I'll give them a pass, because the rest of the salad was better than I was expecting from a diner.

The bad: the soup of the day was terrible. It was a mix of chopped and diced veggies in chicken stock. It tasted like they literally just tossed some veggies in with chicken stock, and some salt and pepper. That would have been bad enough, but, it wasn't even a proper dice; the chunks were all different sizes, so the small ones cooked faster and were soggy, and the large ones were undercooked.

The ugly: I live in such a food wasteland that I'll probably end up eating here again.The note I left myself when drafting this review was "Portions" and that had to do primarily with huge difference in size between my Halibut (appetizer-ish) and Sam's Cioppino (would have fed two). I felt cheated. My Ahi Duo appetizer was a great start - lots of complementary flavors. Sam's White Shrimp cocktail was fresh and flavorful but basic. This was our first meal in Las Vegas for this trip and while acceptable, wasn't particularly memorable - oh, and Sam reminds me, he never got to order the glass of wine he'd wanted with his main course.Clean. Selection is limited but the quality beats many other buffet of buffet colleagues. Desserts are very good.This restaurant is by the same people that did China Grill but it lacks the same flair. I like the sandwiches at the cafe section.. I have to admit... but everything else seems a little weird..We went here because the lines for the buffet was waaaay long on Saturday morning at 9:30 a.m. and we had to get to the Moorea Beach Club before 11 a.m. to grab out cabana reservation.

Seated pretty quickly - decent waiter service (constant refills of water & coffee - checking to make sure our food was okay).  The waiter told us right at the beginning that all eggs would only be served scrambled due to the salmonella outbreaks that have been occurring in the States.

I ordered a lobster cobb salad.  It was GIANORMOUS!  I know it was over $20 but it was so worth it!  Delicious!

Other people had corned beef hash, American breakfast w/ steak, breakfast croissant sandwich, chicken noodle soup (this person wasn't hung over - he just eats like a bird), scrambled eggs with salmon...Nova something or other.

We all liked our food - it was just REALLY pricey.  But so was the buffet.Am I missing something here? There're are three grand lux cafe's on yelp? They all seem to be the same place though. Anyway, the food here is average, expensive (18 dollars for a simple salad with a little ahi tuna?? Seriously??). But the waiter we had was fast and efficient and checked frequently to make sure everything was okay. 

The place would be better if they would drop their prices to something more reasonable.Like most people have described, it is like the cheesecake factory. I would also give the cheesecake factory 3 stars for these same reasons (to help you gauge my scale here). I place a lot of weight on the food quality and taste at a restaurant (go figure). Unless the server were to throw food on me and break the plate over my head I wouldn't take away more than a star for service. That being said, the service was good, food presentation was attractive, and the place was clean. No points given up there. It's just that the food tasted like chain restaurant food to me. Maybe some folks like that, but when I eat out I want fresh tasting ingredients and quality foods. It is very hard to find that these days though.

If you are out for a meal with huge portions and a good palatable dining experience, then this place will be fine. The price is right too. If you want a place that has ingredients that were never frozen and prefer a more natural and fresh taste, I think you will have to look elsewhere.***food review only***

i don't understand this place, i don't understand the menu, i don't understand the service, i don't understand why there isn't a daily special on sundays.

i always had the idea before i ever frequented it that the house of blues would be on par with hard rock cafe.  so naive.  it's not that the hard rock cafe is awful, it's that hob is a culinary trainwreck.  gordon ramsey would have a fit.

i think hob food can best be described as "down home southern cookin'" or something to that effect.  mac 'n cheese, jambalaya, rice and beans are all on the menu.  the menu is really extensive, and hob dabbles in a bit of everything apparently, but nothing on the menu looked good to me while i was here, and believe me that is saying something because i was STARVING and everything looks good to me when i'm starving.  i finally settled on the mixed field greens and a side of fries.  "unremarkable" is my verdict!  i had a few bites of my friend's mac 'n cheese...FAIL.  but that was to be expected, since emmy's spaghetti shack in san francisco has spoiled me for good in the mac 'n cheese department.One final update for their self proclaimed famous baby back Ribs. It was a good deal at $10.99 for happy Hour (3-7). You get a half-rack and some top-notch homemade coleslaw. Normally, the half rack is $15.99. Yes, the ribs do fall off the bone and if you put some of their excellent BBQ sauce (it comes unsauced and basically unseasoned) it turns into a three-star ribs. These were a bit fatty though and I'm not sure they were truly baby backs, but overall they were good, just nothing that would be worth ordering again. The bartenders are always friendly here and you get good service if it's not crowded and your not a regular. If it's crowded, forget it, unless you know one of these guys for years like most people do at Eli's.Good place to hang out and enjoy a bunch of drinks. There is Karaoke and a live band. Food is good not great - typical bar food. Service is friendly and quick.I am an overweight, middle-aged (39), light-drinking, middle-income generating male.  I fit right in here.   Need I say more?  

Ok, so maybe I do.  This place is full of middle-aged, overweight, boring looking folk.  This place needs a rope.  I probably wouldn't have made it in if there had been, without the slight advantage of arm candy or a wad of cash pressed firmly into the hand of the bouncer.  Anyways - drinks are $14 and a soda water cost us $5, I don't care, but some people do.  If you are one of them, you probably shouldn't be in here anyways.

The club scene in Las Vegas is under the gun at the moment and they let in just about anyone nowadays.  Gone are the days of exclusivity, style and class in lieu of the holy dollar.Dayum son, this place was literally a FIRE HAZARD!

Let me tell you how to get into a club first of all. http://wantickets.com/ 
Book mark that son! You don't need no stankin' promoter. Ladies you don't have to put out, fellas you don't have to dish out! Well let me rephrase that, you're going to need some type of debit/credit card for this site (my dude Alan Wong gave me that site, ladies he drives a Lexus!). We paid $30 and showed it to the people at Tryst. Didn't even have to wait! Anyway, go to that site, look for the venue (Tryst in this case), pre-pay that shit, charge it to the game (the game charges a lot in APR though), and vwallah! up in that bieeetch like VIP!

To start off, we went here on New Year's weekend, so I was expecting it to be packed, but no to the point where if someone fell in the club, they would get stomped to death (didn't happen, but could have!). AFROJACK was playing here so I guess everyone was all hyped and shit when they hear that PEW, PEW music. Come to think of it, it was more like AFROPACKED cuz no one could move. Shit son, the freakin' Samoan bouncer dude was blocking people from entering the dance floor at midnight or so! Little did he know his big ass was taking up 5 spaces himself! I shouldn't be taking it out on the Samoan one in particular cuz the Bouncers didn't do anything but take up space at all...

ON this night Tryst should have been called THIRST**, cuz there were some thirsty ass people here, men and women alike. I'm talkin' errybody's throats was hurtin' thirst. Ladies was lookin' right though. Everyone was real receptive this night. Matter of fact, I'll go as far as to say this place had an "STD" Rating of 5 out of 5. It was real +POSITIVE+ up in there. The mood and people alike. How do I know? Cuz when I was on the dance floor, and the hairs on my harm and neck stood up.

Let me talk about the club real quick. Right when you walk in, there's a GIGANTIC-ASS waterfall, makes it look all nice. Just don't go chasing waterfalls, TLC told me that. Drinks was hella expensive too. 3 AMF's cost like $55. That had me saying F8CK you Afrojack all night...

On some real shitttt, how come everytime they get some famous ass dude in a club, drink prices sky rocket!??? I didn't even get to see Afrojack, dude was performing at the end. I thought it was some young DJ the whole night that was Afrojack until they said, ya'll ready for Afrojack???? Then everybody (especially the white people) went crazy! Matter of fact, I Google Imaged Afrojack and I still don't know wtf he looks like...

someone help me!!! 

I do like this place though, just needed to be less crowded. To me it felt like they just let as many people in as they could.

**THIRST = REAL, REAL DESPERATEthey serve revolution roast from just coffee, which is fine by me. 50 cent refills, but bring cash (they dont take credit cards). i had a pumpkin and carrot muffin which was topped with delicious and satisfying crunchy pumpkin seeds. actually i split the muffin with compadre. we also split a cup of coffee. i have got to remember to get cash before i go there (the chase bank across the street charges a THREE DOLLAR service fee to use the ATM). anyway, i like the wooden booths, the tables are spread out nicely. certain members of the staff are a little on the foggy side.Nice atmosphere, but, for the price, the sushi is very average. The sashimi cuts are thick, cold, and chewy. The food presentation is beautiful, the staff attentive, and some of the rolls are tasty, but if I'm in Vegas and want good sushi, I just hold on until I can get back to LA.This restaurant specializes in both paella and tapas.  We started off with a salad of apples, almonds, manchego cheese over organic greens (4), baked goat cheese in a rich tomato sauce (3.5) and dates wrapped in bacon (1.5).  We were disappointed by the dates which were overcooked and chewy.  I questioned the waiter and he confirmed that this is the way the dish is prepared.  We also ordered paella; mine was mixed seafood with shrimp, scallops, mussels and green beans.  Ann ordered the evening's special seafood paella with monkfish, beans and squash.  Each was visually unappealing suffering from a heavy hand with the tomato sauce and an absence of saffron.  I used a $50 certificate purchased form a radio station.Omg, It was Last Thursday April 16,2009. The Hostess behind the booth got the Biggest BOOB JOB of all. My wife was next to me and she also saw her too. Lucky she wasnt mad about that. HAHAHA!!!!! Thats a reason why there was alot of guys there than ladies. 

The price is fair comparing to other hotels that charge more. Average price range about $15 including drinks. Food is ok but the guacamole is the only thing that taste good.3.5-4 stars

While waiting for the rest of our group to arrive in Vegas, the boy, my best friend and I decided to grab some dinner. At 9 p.m. the place was packed but we were seated after waiting a few minutes.

Our server was really nice but took awhile to take our drink and food orders. My friend was checking-in and I went with her to find her room and help her get settled. 15-20 minutes later and they still hadn't taken our order! They did give us chips and 3 different kinds of salsa - pico de gallo, tomatillo, and salsa verde. Anyway, here's what we ordered:

-Regular Mojito's
-Grilled Steak Quesadillas
-Tacos Baja
-Isla Rice & Refried Beans

The mojito's were okay - they were a little too sweet for my taste. They also came in a smaller glass so you couldn't really see all the fresh ingredients. I had the steak quesadillas and I thought they were okay, a little on the dry side but that was easily fixed with adding some of the salsa on top. I had a bite of the tacos baja, or fish tacos, and they were really good - I wish I had ordered those! The side of rice and beans was pretty basic but really good when paired with the tacos. 

This is another great option inside Treasure Island to grab some dinner. It's also really nice and dimly-lit inside so you kind of forget that you're in a casino.Who knew there would be more sushi restaurants in Phoenix than there are Starbucks in Seattle!  
Plates of pasta and carbo loading for races are totally passe.   The perfect balance of protein and starch was what we were all craving before the PF Chang Rock N Roll Half Marathon.  
Blue Wasabi was solid - the decor was  a little outdated and the drinks kinda fruity and corny, but the service was very friendly and the sushi was very good.  They had several intersting rolls, and the unagi was delicious (a good measure of the quality of a sushi joint, in my opinion)  
We left pleasantly full, but not stuffed, and perfectly satisfied.Man... what happened?

My wife and I felt pretty bad, after hyping Cibo up to friends for the past couple weeks, only to be treated fairly strangely and shabbily by our waiter. We were the only two in our group who had been there before, and luckily the only ones embarrassed when things did not go as smoothly as we would've hoped.

Our large party would agree that the food and the atmosphere are still top notch, as are the wines and that delicious homemade limoncello... But the service just fell off, due to one person in particular. Read Nader A's review for the full story, but the gist of it is there was a (rude) miscommunication on the waiter's part, and he was so steadfast (attitude) about not admitting his mistake that it cost him any additional tip he might have received. He also chose to do this at peak volume coinciding with the entertainer's break, so not only did everyone at our table get an earful, but so did the surrounding patrons. it was like a scene in a movie when a bunch of people who do not belong walk into the wrong bar and the needle scratches right off the record. To Nader A's credit, he remained cool, but the damage was done. Later on we found out that our waiter also dissuaded others at the table from customizing their pizzas because "they are perfect the way they are." I don't know if he had something else going on and decided to take it out on us, but to snap at us the way he did was truly unacceptable.

We were planning on having the table sample some of Cibo's delicious crepes for dessert, and I'm positive we would have certainly drank a bit more as well, but instead we chose to leave early and take our business elsewhere. Will we be back? Eventually, but in all honesty not anytime soon, and definitely not in that guy's section.

I in no way would dissuade anyone from trying out Cibo. They excel at what they do, and my experience was most likely out of the ordinary.I've been to Fez several times but it is more for convenience than great food. Their food leans towards Mediterranean but their menu does offer other items as well. One note - check out their late night happy hour. I think it starts at ten.The food was delicious and I would've given Seablue 4 stars however the kitchen forgot our side dishes and our server kept forgetting to refill out water glasses after she offered and we asked.  

A friend and I had the surf and turf special which was $60 per person for a porterhouse, half a lobster and king crab legs.  The lobster was a tad overcooked, but everything else was delicious.  I also had a lobster poptart, yum!  But anything with puff pastry is yum...The rest of the table had oysters, tuna carpaccio, the clam chowder fondue (which was too salty), onion rings (not worth $10), fish and chips and the burger.  We also ordered two sides of the truffled mac and cheese, but those never came out.  It was kind of good that we didn't get them because the surf and turf special was really filling.Crowded with lots of youngins, bartender seemed a but rude and full of himself, oh and there's a fog machine on the dance floor. It's very "club-y" not to say it isn't fun, I did have a good time here but it wouldn't be number 1 on my list.I didn't try the chocolates so my review is just for the paninis and macaron. 

I had the sweet basil chicken and chicken tandoori sandwiches. Both were good but the basil one was really good. Greasy though, as most paninis are. 

Macarons were good. 

Really pricey for what it all is, but I guess that's how it is in Vegas.Located just past the lobby and lines for Haze. We had visited the Bellagio location the night before and this location was faster, but the creeps were not as good. The strawberries were sour, the whip cream was completely without taste and the style of crepe building was different. The crepe was entirely folded before any garnishing was added. Very little Nutella or chocolate in comparison to the Bellagio location's crepes.  The crepe maker was also less than friendly. Go to the Bellagio location just past the Conservancy.For dinner, there is a wide selection with soups, salads, seafood ceviche, pizzas, italian dishes (ravioli, gnocchi, red sauce pasta, italian sausage), pasta bar, pork chops, carved turkey, lamb chops, prime rib, Asian station, sushi station, Indian station, cocktail shimp, kng crab legs, and dessert bar. I'm sure you'll find something you like. 

The prime rib was pretty bloody, it was done like rare to medium rare. The king crab legs were very SALTY and some legs had ice crystals in it still. They probably make it salty on purpose so you drink a bunch of water and get full. Hey, they still gotta run a business, right? Compared to the  Bellagio, Wynn dessert bar was disappointing. The selection was not a big, the homemade vanilla ice cream was flavorless, and worst of all, the crepe station SUCKED! The crepe was all doughy, the fillings selection sucks, and they don't even have nutella. Also, the only fresh fruits served were honey dew, cantalope, and watermelon. They had strawberries, pears, pineapple, and lychee, but all were soaked in syrups. 

For the price, I don't think I would come here again.This place is just alright. I mean for the 39.99 holiday meal it should have been better. Its was like you went in there and your like "that's it". Yeah some of the food I ate was great and I got seconds, but worth the 39.99 I don't think so. At the time though I had to tell myself it was worth it cos I was in denial. They do have some nice gimmicks though. Like the crepe station and the ice cream thing. Aladdin pre-Planet Hollywood had a better buffet than Wynn, no offense. When I got to the dessert area I was like WTF this is it. I don't even remeber if they had carrot cake which is one of my requirements for a good buffet. I think I ate it but I don't remeber cos I guess I couldn't get over the fact of the $39.99. Only place I can really compare it too is Bellagio which I think is much better on many different levels. Ok if they charge like $29.99 I would have given it an extra star. Haha and I thought the holiday $26.99 meal at the Mandalay was pricey. That doesn't even compare. Oh and you can't really compare the whole king crab leg thing anymore. Most hotels have the king crab legs. I wonder if going to Vegas on some presidents day is a holiday.After reading all the glowing reviews that said the Wynn has the best brunch in Vegas, we stopped in this past Sunday around noon.  The place was packed and the line to get in was long.  I took this all as a good sign.  However, when we saw the food, which was displayed beautifully, I was underwhelmed by the selection.  There were no crab legs, no lobster tails.  Really, the only seafood was shrimp cocktail--which was nothing special--and baked salmon (the citrus beurre blanc was nice) and red snapper.  I expected a lot more in the way of seafood options and was disappointed--especially since I don't eat red meat.  Pics I've seen online all showed the Wynn brunch with giant crab legs and lobster, but there was definitely none to be had on 1/27/13 when I was there.  The dessert options were also underwhelming.  The cream puffs were splendid, but the raspberry cheesecake shooters tasted like Jello no-bake and all the chocolate cakes were sugar-free.  Very disappointing.  So, five stars for presentation and service, but three stars for the food.I'm basing my three star review on the service and the variety of non-meat options on the menu.  The food itself only earns two stars, in my opinion.  We tried the chips and salsa as well as a variety of tacos and sides.  Apparently, the only way they know how to add flavor is to add more salt.  The chips, salsa and sweet potato fries were way, way too salty, but the tacos lacked any flavor.  The various taco fillings were dry and bland.  Compared to other Madison tex-mex restaurants (El Dorado or Pasqual's) T Tubb's is definitely last on my list.

Their menu has a lot of variety, but maybe they need to slim it down and perfect some of the basics.  Their service was outstanding though!  Our waiter was pleasant and efficient.Well, I was here for traffic school, so I wasn't exactly excited to arrive at 7:45 AM on a Saturday morning. There were signs up and it was easy to find the conference room. The room is plain as are the chairs. Basic, minimal set-up. No frills.  It was a little chilly in the room, but that is better than being hot and stuffy.  The bathrooms were close and clean.  You can tell the hotel has been around for a while, but from what I can tell, they make the best of what they have.  With that being said, I would like to remind you (the reader) that I have not seen the inside of one of the Grace Inn's hotel rooms in over 5 years.My family and I have been coming to this restaurant for over three years now and we still love the food...I wish I could say the same about the service.  More and more frequently we have experienced absolutely horrible service.  Ranging anywhere from inattentive service to incorrect orders being served and more often less than hot.  The thing that has prompted me to finally write this though was my family's most recent visit.  Some twenty plus minutes after we ordered, I had to alert the waitress to the fact that we still not been served any of our meals (even my son's salad), while the table behind us who had arrived 5-10 minutes after that had already received there second helping of all you can eat wings.  There didn't seem to be any real reason for this since the restaurant was fairly empty (it was before 6:00pm),  We soon got our food (my son getting about a minute for his salad before our entrees came), but there was no explanation of what happened or even an apology for what happened and the food was lukewarm to boot (even though the waitress cautioned my son about how "hot' his plate was). 

I know not all the staff is so inattentive, but honestly it seems to be getting worse and worse over time.  If we could get the menu items elsewhere we likely would never return to this location...And yes, I plan on completing the 'survey' on their receipt with this same narrative!Our 1st trip to Vegas, with fine dining key on our list, we made a res at Michael Mina.  Was a disappointment, food was good but not excellent, and service was well below average.  When asked if we had somewhere to be next, we said no, but felt highly rushed nonetheless.  

Dishes came out so quickly, but couldn't get our waiter's attention for cocktails.  The fluke crudo was good, lobster pot pie was good (tho guessing execution could vary).  Have to say, if you're MP is always $85 for the lobster pot pie, just put the price on the menu.  

Felt like this place is trying to play in a league it's not able to deliver in.  Good meal, but not at that price point.  Mediocre atmosphere, nothing special.Cute cafe for quick bite. Don't set expectations high. Quality of food is similar to microwaveable and/or vending machine food. Prices are average being located at Wynn. Bagel with cream cheese and a toasted-microwaved breakfast bagel (pre-made) 2 small coffees and a half cup of fruit $25. Stop by if drunk and hungry no where else to go during late hours.The place is awesome in that it's the only nice place around open 24/7 and very conveniently located next to the elevator. The bad, SO overpriced! The food was good, but not amazing nor worth the price. But hey when you're tired/drunk, it'll do wonderfully! Staff isn't very attentive either...So my new boss and friend invited me out here for an event. I missed the limo ride unfortunately boo, so no red carpet for me. He did a "Garden of Eden" photo shoot here and I basically just observed the whole process. It was so SIIIIK they even brought in a snake for some of the pics. It was the coolest thing ever. Bathing suits and hot chiks for a shoot nuff said!!

 So I guess there is no cover here?? That's cool since its a pretty small place and from what I heard it wasn't even as packed in as usual. Drinks are the normal Scottsdale price. There are 3 stalls for the bathroom and only 2 of them worked last night. Oh all the Princess' need to learn how to wash their hands.....gross! Cochinas!!

I wouldn't mind doing VIP here again.I love the Maggiano's in my home town, so I thought why not in vegas!? It's right across from my hotel and I know the food is awesome.

Everything was great until we walked back to our hotel and took a nap. We all woke up feeling super sick. 

But lemme talk about the actual experience in the restaurant. It was a super long wait for 5pm but we got hooked up and passed the line. We were seated and everything was brought in a timely manner. The food was the same as always and it wasn't better or worse than any other Maggiano's I've been to except for the part where we all got sick. 

Oh well.Wow. Buffet style dining is not normally my favorite thing to do, but Wow.  A champagne brunch will cost you $25 dollars a person, but our hungry, hungover group of 6 packed away WAY more than that per person. I'm amazed at the amount of food that they had, and even more surprised that it tasted pretty good.  I think the problem with buffets is that they often use poor quality ingredients to make food en mass, but this stuff was quite decent.  They had all sorts of food, dim sum, Mexican, a carving station, breakfast station, salad station, dessert station, sushi and more!  I didn't have any, but I heard the crab legs and smoked salmon were delectable.  The highlight for me was the dim sum, great shrimp dumplings and egg rolls. We all had mimosas, but they're made with cheap champagne.  The service was also kind of slow.  We got there around 12:30 and didn't have to wait long to be seated, but as we were leaving the lines had grown VERY long.  Bring your appetite and you won't be disappointed.  We finished up around 2pm and didn't eat the rest of the day from being so stuffed. :)i was once again clicking over whether or not to give this buffet 3 or 4 stars...am i really a fan?  or was it just a-ok?  so the deciding factor?  well, sad...really...the best buffet on the strip is actually inside the rio...but it happens to be the village seafood buffet...not the carnival world buffet.  

honestly, we were trying to save a few bucks because of a week's worth of buffet/fine dining venturing in vegas...i made a big mistake!  i should've spent the extra 10 bucks to walk across the casino to the other buffet.  oh well...no regrets right?  haha.  don't get me wrong...this buffet wasn't too shabby.  but if the best item here happens to be their pizza...then yes, that's probably not worth my money.  there wasn't a big ole seafood selection...the carved meats were typical...the dessert bar was plentiful...but nothing was really mind boggling.  yes, the quality was much higher than most of the buffets on the strip...but just didn't have that wow factor.  i wasn't too disappointed though...oh the joys of having that 24 hour buffet pass...

oh wow!  that just triggered a thought...the person at the register was such a #*%$#@&((*+@(!  we waited in line for a good half hour in order to purchase our 24 hour buffet pass...when we got there, she asked for my harrah's card...wth...i didn't have my harrah's card on me.  and i wasn't about to leave and stand in line again.  i asked her if i could put that bracelet on for now and have it exchanged after i retrieved my card.  she said no.  just flat out plain simple no.  and then she went on to say that if i tried to slip it on or off they will know and they won't accept it.  *yeah right!!!*  oh, and there's even more stink to this story...she failed to tell me that it costs 5 bucks more without a card...stupid bees knees.  anyhoo, i got it exchanged when i went to planet hollywood...so i'm flat out saying that she lied!

ok i'm done venting...so if you want a great buffet...don't be cheap and eat at the seafood buffet...and if you feel like having the best buffet in vegas...go to the m resort off the strip!!!Is it worth the money? If you eat a lot of crab legs :) Everything else? A-OK for quantity, but MEH for quality.I just want to preface this review by saying I ate at this buffet prior to reading about the cockroach problem outlined by a previous poster. LOL. 
This knocked my 4 star rating down to 3 stars. 

I actually had a great experience at this place and loved the food selections and variety. My husband and I purchased bracelets as part of the "Buffet of Buffets" tour. Of all the buffets on the tour, this one was the best. Really I should say it was the best of the worst. LOL. 

One thing I don't understand is the cold crab legs. I am from the East Coast (Maine) and we only serve crab legs steaming hot. Every place I went in Vegas was serving them cold. This must be an East coast/West coast thing. I suppose at a buffet type of place might run the risk of overcooking the legs and making them tough. 

Personally I prefer my crab legs warm as the crab flavors are much more enhanced when heated. Honestry I was a little hesitant to try crab at any of the buffets we went to in Vegas because many of the crab stations did not appear to be heated or cooled properly. The Rio appeared to be an exception to this.A little more noisy than I would prefer.  The gazpacho/watermelon soup was wonderful, the brussel sprout salad was sub par.  Good service.  They seem to be flourishing.Overrated, overrated, overrated.

The food was OK, the service sucked, they don't have ranch dressing, and they don't  have any restrooms on site... which is unacceptable in my opinion.

After waiting over an hour and listening to all the people raving about how good the food was outside, I had high hopes. My over easy eggs were soupy, more like under easy, nasty, and the guy next to me complained hes eggs were soupy as well. Something as simple as eggs should be cooked to perfection if this place was so good. The bacon and ham were pretty good, but nothing extra ordinary. The hash browns were soaked in butter and cooked with some short of pepper mix that tasted like crap. The pancakes were just pancakes with maple syrup, tasted exactly like pancakes from crackle barrel, whatever. The only thing at this place I can honestly say was the best I've ever had was the whole wheat toast. 

The food was ok. If their wasn't a wait it would be worth eating at, but other then that, places like Chompies and The Breakfast Club are far superior.Every girl I know that lives in Phoenix ranks this place as one of her Top Five lunch spots around, but I'm still not sold on it. Sure, now and again I'll want to have a lighter, healthier lunch (something other than a burrito - I like to mix it up) and Sauce is good for that. But I feel like it tries to be upscale without actually being upscale, and casual without actually being casual either. It's in that strange netherworld where you're not sure if you're overdressed or overly caj, overfed or underserved, overpaying or overexpecting. 

The thin crust pizzas are actually really good, but light, so if you have a serious appetite don't be surprised if it don't need a box to take home extra slices. The house pizzas have interesting topping blends like artichoke hearts and sundried tomatoes (err . . . maybe that's not that interesting. What can I say? I like heavy things with meat on them that you can empty entire jars of parmesan cheese onto. Any deviation from dense cheese and meat is "interesting" to me). 

They bring your food to your table (Pei Wei style) with one piece of packaged bread. This also slightly irks me. The bread is really good but they can't spring for baskets? If you're looking for New York style pizza that drips with cheese and thick pepperoni pieces, Sauce isn't your spot. For a light afternoon lunch or snack and a glass of wine, it gets the job done.Le Reve was an okay show, but the decor itself is breathtaking from beginning to end.  I agree with Misti Y--I think there are those will love Cirque shows and not this show, but that's a whole other talk post.

Breathtaking scenery but a story line that isn't that entertaining is what this show is made of, in my opinion.  The stage actually had malfunctions the night I went, so it wasn't easy to stay into the show when things broke down all night long.  Although the idea is beautiful, it didn't carry over into real life well.

Despite it's lack of true flair that it strives to steal from the Cirque shows, it's a nice try and something you may want to see just to see the beautiful theater, otherwise you may want to use that money toward another show.Sat in the front row, Got wet and watched a pretty cool show. Its all mostly in water which felt kinda repetitive but still kept me interested throughout. Worth the watch but definately not for the money. Seen better for less.I will give this show the benefit of the doubt because I wasn't really feeling well when I saw it (Think 2.5 days of drinking in the Vegas sun) but I may have dozed off a number of times watching it. 

Best show in Vegas? Nah. I've seen plenty of Cirque shows in NY that were 10x better. The visuals were great at frst  but  how many times can I watch people dive into a pool? Boring. There was no storyline. 

Sure the seating arrangements were great(Not a bad seat in the house) and I've never seen a submerged stage before but it got boring after the first half hour. 

Should've seen The Beatles show instead.Just an FYI everyone.  There is no "new owner" of Lisa G's.  There is a new restaurateur that bought the equipment and inventory at that location.  What is the difference?  He did not pay for the name, menu or assume debt.  This includes her gift certificates.  To ask a new business owner to honor them at a 100% loss is a little much.  This is one of the toughest industries at one of the toughest times.  I am not affiliated with either just wanted to put in an impartial word.  Thanks for reading :)I loved the old menu, but the changes gave me a change of heart. They had the best sandwiches & it was always quiet from 5 until 8 so you could sit & eat. The new menu is okay & we liked what we got, but we would've left if it wasn't happy hour. Even though the servings are big(maybe too big) the prices are retarded now. The buffalo chicken tenders were pretty good, but perhaps too spicy in the wrong way. I used to go & send people all the time, but without those yummy sandwiches & with the higher prices, we prolly won't make it back again. The servers usually are slow & fairly unattentive, but the menu was bringing us back.   :(    sad to see it change that way.Had a late lunch here last week with family during ASU graduation week.  We started with the boneless chicken wings in both "hot" and "bbq", and both were really tasty...obviously not really "wings" since they were meaty chunks and big...probably breasts. Which is awesome since I haet picking the tiny bits of meat of most places wings.  (They do offer wings with bones as well).  The Baja chicken sandwiches were a hit, and you can also get them as a wrap.  The nachos were average.The grilled cheese was the only thing that wasn't acceptable - bread too thick, not enough cheese. This is definitely a college town bar and grill, with prices appropriate for students, and pitchers of fun concoctions - many with flavored vodka and red bull. the staff is friendly and the environment is definitely casual and young.  I like the roll-up front "garage"-style door so you can eat/drink outside, and be art of the scene that is walking by.  really open and airy, and they keep the air-conditioning on so it's not stifling hot. If I were still in my 20's, this would probably be on my regular stomping ground list.I usually get comp rooms at the Venetian/Palazzo so I typically gamble long hours at these 2 places. I have eaten at Noodles Asia a few times due to it being a chinese restaurant and also getting comped food from the pit boss. 

First time I asked for a comp for 2, pit boss told me that I had $86 to blow at Noodles Asia. I was floored! I never eaten here before and was wondering how 2 people can spend $86 in a chinese restaurant, when we did not plan on ordering Shark's Fin, Abalone, Bird's Nest, Buddha Jumps Over the Wall, Sea Cucumber, you know the drill. 

But Yes We Can, at Noodles Asia apparently. The food isn't great, heck, I would go to Ping Pang Pong over at Gold Coast over this place anyday. But I absolutely adore the fact that they have Chicken Mushroom Ginger Soup. Oh this is the reason why I go there. The rest are just for formality. Dim dum mediocre, Fried Rice Oily, Noodles not asian enough. 

In fact, last Saturday, I got drunk playing Baccarat at MGM HL room and got back to the Venetian and decided to have one bowl of soup. Sure it costs $10.95, sure it's still not that good, but it is to me the best item on this menu, and that is good enough reason for me to keep coming back.

For better dim sum and chinese food in general, head over to Bellagio's Noodles if you want a casino setting, or Ping Pang Pong at Gold Coast. Otherwise head over to ChinatownI had comps from Sahara so I gave their buffet a try.  Overall it is a reasonable value for the money but with a big warning.

The Sunday brunch has prime rib, cold crab and shrimp and decent variety for additional dishes such as potatoes, rice, string beans, etc.  The prime rib was more rare than is typical at buffets which usually serve medium done prime rib.  It was pretty good quality.

The carving station also had turkey and ham.  The ham was very good as well but I didn't try the turkey.  The crab was a bit on the small side as were the shrimp.  I couldn't find hot butter and the cocktail sauce was alright.

A major weakness was the lack of desserts.  They only had about 8 or so choices.  Nothing looked very good.  Almost every other buffet in Vegas has choices of pies and cakes and often ice cream or gelato.  Not here.

Some of the lesser dishes were duplicated in identical lines to better serve a big crowd but it wasn't extremely busy.  I would have preferred more unique dishes but if it does get crowded an identical line would speed things up.  They were set up for an additional serving line but it wasn't be used this past Sunday morning.

The major caveat here is that it is very dimly lit and looks dirty.  Not from the plates which are face down as they should be or the serving stations but the decor.  I'm not sure how old it is but I wouldn't be surprised if it has never been remodeled.  This detracts from the buffet more than one would think.

One of the reasons why the buffet is cheaper than typical is beause there is much less service.  You get your own drinks and bussers don'[t come around that often--perhaps because there so few of them.

The cost including tax was $13.24 and it includes the cold seafood and champagne from a cart operated at the left of the buffet.  A beer is $3.00 extra.  The champagne was semi-secco and probably pretty cheap but I couldn't see the labels.  It was served in a plastic clear cup.

Overall, it is okay for the money but probably just if you are in the casino.  I wouldn't go out of the way for it and if I didn't have a $10 comp, I would not have eaten there in the first place.I have a streak of white trash in me that's a mile wide. That's my only explanation for being so curious about the various Prime Rib specials that you would see on the marquees on the more downscale casino halls on and off the Strip. I've always wondered if I had the potential to become a boozy, loud-mouthed gambler who would think nothing of eating a $4.99 plate of rare meat at 3AM. 

Well, I had to settle for eating here for lunch before boarding my plane back home to San Francisco. The price at a reasonable dining hour is $14.95 - since I assume the owners think you're too sober to judge the price too strictly. Bill's is meant to look like a Barbary Coast gambling hall, so the Victorian Room couldn't be anything but red naugahyde booths and faux-walnut walls. I think it's a stitch that half the menu is meat and potatoes and the other half is a Chinese buffet selection. 

Naturally I went for a slab of their prime rib, which was blood-rare, no questions asked. It came with a bowl of fluffed-up butter, a bowl of au jus sauce, and a small baked potato dwarfed by two containers of sour cream. Oh but first were the house salad, iceberg lettuce and croutons covered liberally with a ranch dressing, and a roll with a couple of pats of frozen butter. Yeah I ate it all. I ain't proud I did, but hell, it's Vegas. What I eat in Vegas stays in Vegas, right? 

FOOD - 3 stars...finally tried a prime rib special...and I guess quality does matter 
AMBIANCE - 2.5 stars...the golden days of San Francisco reinvented in formica and naugahyde 
SERVICE - 2.5 stars...they served us, yes that's true 
TOTAL - 3 stars...a culinary outlet for my white trash needsWe had a coupon here so hit it up for breakfast.

Nothing super fancy, and like all things in Sin City-there was a bit of a wait to get in.

We just went with breakfast basics like pancakes and omlettes, but they were filling and just the kind of greasy spoon fare that we needed after a late night out in Vegas.

Not necessarily a place I will deliberately seek out on future visits, but a place I will certainly hit up if it is convenient to where we're staying...I would give a 2 stars because " meh. ive experienced better." was what I was thinking! but... I think I will settle for a 3 star since the man said it should be a 4 star. ..obviously he is a fan of the graveyard special 4.99 for a whole mess of yumminess! haha but anyway.. this place works I guess... not going to urge anyone to try it.. not going to turn anyone away either... Denny's is the best I can compare this place... except Denny's employees actually know how to work a cash register.. the older hostess had some problems....I recommend the Thai soup and congee.  The yellow noodle with duck and wonton soup were pretty bland. I had to mix in soy sauce and hot sauce to give it more flavor. Service can be very rude here sometimes. I recommend phoning your order, picking up your order to avoid the line, and eating in your room.Perhaps I ordered the wrong items?

We started with the "shabu-shabu" and what we got was a small bowl with one piece of shrimp, some veggies, and a tiny bundle of noodles. The broth was then poured into the bowl, tableside. Such false advertising to advertise this as shabu-shabu..it was more like a bowl of noodles. The flavor was bland and I truly think this dish should be taken off the menu.

My boyfriend ordered the Fleur Burger and I ordered the Short Ribs. The short ribs was a bit hard to pull apart/cut and the quality of the meat fell short of my expectations. I probably ate about half of it before throwing in the towel. I was excited to taste the Fleur Burger after hearing so many good things about it..but I just wasn't blown away.

The whole meal was so average..everything from the service to the food. My experience at Fleur has pushed Hubert Keller's other restaurants way down on my list of restaurants to try.our hotel (ballys)  recommended it..

 the restaurant is 'fancy,' has a romantic mood: dim lighting & candles, and also a nice little view.  the waiters were more than willing to serve us, they were so friendly (maybe TOO friendly, they were like flirting with us, it was sometimes uncomfortable).  they all seemed to be "italian."  but my friends and i are pretty sure that some of them were faking the italian accent. (haha)

 we all ordered different pasta dishes.  i ordered from their "specials for the night" : mushroom and black truffle ravioli..which i couldn't finish, not because there was too much on my plate but because the black truffle was "how do you say," too rich.
also my dish cost $50.00.

overall, the food was OKAY, the service was more than great, because they gave us free shots of GRAPPA and LEMON CELLO!!

atmosphere is for couples.  we all had a good time at Il Mulino because the waiters were entertaining us, but other than that.. i don't think I would go back there or recommend it.I have THREE words for you: spam & eggs. 

Yup, they serve that here. For those of you who know what's up...THAT'S what's up. It's damn expensive, but hey, you are in Vegas after all. And that whore will take you for all you're worth. 

But at least you can still have your comfort foods or alcohol absorbing delicacies 'round the clock!I wish this had more walking space. I hate feeling crowded and moving for everyone walking by. The stores are decent. I only really checked out NIKE and new balance(which sucks for selection)

I'd say worth the trip if you like other stores, theres other places to shop in vegas.Parking is a nightmare here...good luck!My man and I went to Padre's for dins and I had a groupon. I showed it to the guy who seated us who I assumed to be the manager(?) and he made a comment that sounded to the two of us like "great (not thrilled), another groupon(smirk)". This started us discussing why they would even offer a groupon if they weren't thrilled about people using them!?!? 
Whatevs- Chico was our server and I really liked him. We ordered chips and salsa and a lobster quesadilla to start since I had $50 to spend! CnS? Fine, not amazing, not bad. Lobster 'dilla- weird. I didn't really like the mango-lobster combo and I found a couple pieces of shell which felt really great on my chompers.
For dinner I had the stuffed chicken "house specialty" and JD got the salmon spinach enchilada's. Mine was good, not great and a little bit tough but nothing like JD's. I am a salmon lover through and through but once that enchilada entered my mouth I wanted it out ASAP. Blech! Boo! Yick! I actually wiped my tongue with my napkin (so ladylike, i know). It  really was repulsive. He ate most of it though, but didn't feel so good later. I don't think it was spoiled or anything- just REALLLY fishy in a bad bad way. 
So a couple of things left a bad tasted in my mouth (literally and figuratively). But I can't say enough good things about Chico. He made the experience good just by being a nice guy and a stealth server. 
The jury is out on whether I'd go back. I'm always in that area but not much impressed me food-wise. Might be fun to drink and hang out though.Here is one of my shorter reviews!  (For those of you who may feel that my reviews just simply keeps going and going and going.....) I do apologize for being so lengthy but I guess I just yelp too much...

Raffles Cafe... located in Mandalay Bay, was the spot that we decided to catch a late one after missing out on dinner buffets.... by the time we were hungry enough to eat, it's already 9:45pm so we had to settle for cafe instead.

Our party ordered 2 dishes since we were too hungry (had a nice buffet at lunch!)  

1) Fried Chicken with Veggies 
2) Strawberry Pancake

The serving was decent... Had 4 pieces of fried chicken (which were fried to perfection with lots of crunch and resistance to it...) Then steam veggies because we were trying to healthy!  LOL!  

Strawberry pancakes were ok, had some (not a lot) of fresh strawberries but not enough for the portion served. 

The theme was suppose to be a replacement of Roscoe's chicken & waffles, but instead, it's Henry's Chicken and strawberry pancakes.  With a combination of pancake, lightly covered butter spread, cruncy chicken on top it's actually pretty good!  

The cost came out to be  around $40 with Tax and Tip.... pretty steep for 2 dishes at a cafe in Vegas!  Oh well, it's Vegas right?  Let's hope those slots will help me out in the near future!

Service was decent.... not the greatest but ok..... The atmosphere was real nice though.

Parting note... the next day we had the Bayside buffet and realized that they served the same chicken...... hmmmm.... hope they were leftovers from the buffet because it's around their closing time.... the chicken sure came out pretty quick being so crunchy and all.......

I think I'll pass in the future and give the good old Bellagio cafe a go instead in the future since it cost about the same......I would give the food one star, but I have to up it to 3 stars purely for comedic reasons.  

So, we came here at like 2am one night this last weekend and proceeded to order some odd items.  

Little did we know that they would take our odd orders and come right back and make it a millions times odder!  I don't think I've laughed this much during a meal in a LONG time. 

I LIKE!

So, I had just eaten "dinner" a couple hours earlier, so I went for something light.  Cereal seemed like a safe choice.  They had some terrible choices (Cheerios, Cornflakes, Frosted Flakes, Raisin Bran, not good options!), and I figured cornflakes was probably the least offending out of all of those choices.  My other friends ordered toast and blintzes.  

So, already it's like, yeah, that's some terrible and odd food choices we made right there.

Anyway.  We order, and then begins the oddness.

First up, the pickles.  We're sitting there, being silly animals as usual, and then the waitress comes by with 6 large pickles and just plops them on our table.  

. . .

I like pickles too, but something about seeing nothing on the table but pickles made the situation really funny.  We started laughing.

And then it never stopped because here comes more:

Our food comes.  They give me my cereal on a PLATE with the milk in some sort of large half-and-half pitcher.  

Um. . .

I flag down the waitress and ask her for a deeper bowl.  She says they don't have any bowls.  (WTF?!?!)  Er....so I'm supposed to eat my cereal off a plate??  She says she can give me another plate, and I'm like, um okay I'll take it because they gave me way too much cereal on that first plate.  I figured I could scoop some onto another plate for easier eating.  So, yes.  A giant plate with overflowing cereal, and milk sitting in the middle of all that cereal in a half-and-half pitcher.  With a side of pickles.

WEIRD!

Oh, and then we turn around and see that the guy behind us had this HUGE pastrami-looking sandwich that looked about a foot-tall.  We had to go and take pictures of that thing because it was truly monstrous.  He was a grown man, and he looked scared of it too.  My friend noted that "even when he was finished with the sandwich, it was still 3896 feet tall!"  

AWESOME.

We went through our meal, laughing and shaking our heads.  By the end, the pickles were untouched, so I decided to give it a try.  I learned that pickles, dipped in apple sauce and sour cream (from the blintzes), are quite delicious!  Odd combination, but better than straightup sour!

All in all, one of the strangest meals I've never had, yet also one of the most fun and satisfying of my life too!  

Thank you, Mirage, for your odd eateries.  I approve!I'm only reporting on the breakfast, it was A OK, nothing special.  You would do better at the buffet across the casinoWhat's the difference between this Carnegie Deli and the other reviews page?

I didn't get to try this place in NYC but here in Vegas, you can get any kind of food imaginable from anywhere. Anyways we were stuffed from lunch so we picked up something to go later in the night. One sandwich could easily fill the bellies of two. But since we weren't that hungry, we ended up with some leftovers. Luckily our hotel had a mini fridge and we were able to save some for the next day. We ended up with a pastrami sandwich. I was eyeing their most famous corned beef and pastrami combo sandwich but just thinking of the size of that and at $20, I just couldn't do it. Although the plain pastrami was already $17. Sandwich was fixed up pretty quickly and we were on our way. Oh and we got a choice of breads but  stuck with the typical rye. Man the 'wich was huge. No way could the height of it fit in my mouth.  But wow, really flavorful without being too salty. And moist too. Some fat in the meat too which is bad for my health but makes it takes oh so yummy. A lot of deli's have either really salty pastrami or dry, no flavor meat. This was a good balance. It also came with the necessary (two) pickles and the pickle really helps with a different texture and taste to break up all that meat you're devouring. Wow, not sure I could part with almost 20 bucks for a sandwich all the time but this hit the spot this one time. And you should splurge every once in a while, especially on vacation.Ok let it be said loud and clear..THERE ARE NO COUPONS THAT GET MEN IN FOR FREE AT ANY LAS VEGAS CLUB!!! AND WOMAN YOU ARE ALWAYS FREE B4 12 AND GET ALL YOU CAN DRINK WRISTBANDS!! Of course the "free" booze is limited to certain drinks, you get your standard vodka cranberry, beer, and some shots. We were handed some bogus coupon from a street vendor stating guys in for free but later found out they weren't, but the club promoter decided to let my hubby and friends in for $20 a person instead of $30. The club itself was just ok. The music was great and the layout is ok. There was a strange mixture of ppl here, some were older some younger, my girlfriend and I dressed up in hot cocktail dresses only to find woman wearing jeans and tank tops? The best bet here is to get table service, but at a 2 bottle minimum w/ bottles starting at $475 i'll PASS! Next time it's Marquee for us! Too many ppl w/ hardly any space for ppl if you don't have a table. You're either on the small dance floor w/ creepy ppl or shoved up top at a crowded bar.This place was picked by my sister . It was cool . I dnt think I would want to go back . Dance floor was crazy packed but the set up of the club was nice .Went here with a group of 8 on a Friday evening. We were seated right away although they did not have a record of our reservation.   All entrées were served in hearty portions. I had the Tomahawk steak.  Good size.  Asked for it to be cooked to medium...closer to medium rare.pretty good bar, i like the interior atmosphere and decor. It's like a private lounge. You can smoke on the patio. We met the guy who did the nice metal work outside the bar. My lemon drop martini was made with fresh squeezed lemon juice. Wasn't very strong though, oh well.The ratio of customers to waitress/dim sum carter-ers was too little. I kept looking around for the next cart and only til the last cart did I get the shrimp har gao that I was craving.

Their noodles were greasy and DELICIOUS =) Just what I wanted!

And it's not as good (quality of food and quickness of carts) as Chang's but, not hating. I was craving dim sum and I got it at 9pm on Christmas Day!
It did what it needed to do: satisfy me!This was the first and only all dim sum place I've been to in Vegas and have been really lazy to venture out into something else. It's opened 24 hours and parking isn't horrible, but can sometimes get packed during weekend afternoons. Sometimes guests are turned off by the aggressive nature of the people handling the carts, but I completely get it, it's their job. I just smile and say "no thank you".  The dining room is huge, so even if there is a long wait, the wait isn't so bad. My favorite items are the BBQ pork buns, custard buns for dessert and the fried shrimp dim sum that you can completely engulf in the yummy mayo sauce they have. They do have a regular menu you can order off of too, if dim sum isn't your thing. If anyone has any other good dim sum recommendations in the Vegas area, please let me know :DThe area is old, but still functioning well. There are quite a few rides you can enjoy, even with its limitation of being an indoor amusement park. Really, you have nothing to lose, because the place charges $ per ride, unless you opt for the all-day pass. Just take a look around, and let your kids pick and choose. I guarantee that they are going to have fun - adults and teenagers, not so sure.decent aquarium to go to if you have an hour you want to kill, especially if you have young children.

pros:
- beautifully built, especially the main aquarium  with all the sharks
- pretty decent sized sting ray touch pool
- decent collection of freshwater fish/wildlife. the aquariums were all built so lushly with dense vegetation. it really felt like you stumbled upon a lake in the wild.

cons:
- price! but, i suppose nothing in vegas is cheap unless you win at the craps table. it was about $17/adult! for that much money id expect to at least see two hours worth of stuff

tip:
- try to get there early! we got there around 1030 (the aquarium opens at 10) and waiting about 15 mins before going in. it was packed. by the time we left at 1130ish, the line was LONG just to get in. 

would i come again? probably not unless i had my niece with me again.Sitting alone with a pyramid of creamers (27 of em, I counted), without a crowd, without a buffet line-up, I experienced fair prices in peace, with lovely and attentive service.

Toast is served in a basket, a glass of water large enough and fit for a King; and good, strong coffee (priced too high, a flippin $3.50 - I could so lose that kind of dinero in a slot machine!).

The menu has a nice amount of selections, and a great alternative to the buffet.This is your typical cafe/diner.  They serve breakfast food, burgers, and other things.  I ordered the skillet, which contained hash browns, cheese, eggs, and bacon.  The food took awhile to come.  They were not too busy, so I do not know why service was slow.  When it finally came, I was a little surprised because the skillet was so tiny.  It was about the size of my fist!  Regardless of its size, the skillet was actually pretty good.  The hash browns were crispy, and the cheese was nicely melted.  The bacon bits were mixed in really well.  

A little bit pricey for what I ordered, but all in all, I would recommend this place to people staying at the Luxor.  It is a shame that this place closes right after lunch.My third time in Vegas and we decided a roller coaster on the strip was necessary.  And considering the NY NY coaster's first hill climb was literally outside our window, we opted for this one.

$14, no wait as long as you don't want the front seat.  They took pictures even before you took off!  And you're off.  We waved to our room as we climbed up and up!  And then the pain begins.  Don't get me wrong, it was fun but OWW! And it bent one of my earrings.  Loops, cork screws and what felt like a bit over a minute later we were back inside the casino!  It went by I didn't have time to look out over the strip.  

I'm glad I finally did one.  I can say I did it.  But I probably would rather use that $14 on an overpriced drink instead next time!I'm ready for brunch now. :) The banana nut muffin was amazing though. Especially with butter. mmm...I would give it 3.5 stars.  

The Main Lobster Pot Pie is overhyped.  There.  I said it (*ducking*).

If the lobster pot pie cost half of the current market price ($85 this past weekend), then it would taste a whole lot better.  But I split a pie with my friend and it was just sad to see spread out in front of me 3 small chunks of lobster and a lobster tail and know that I was paying 40+ for my portion of that.  The lobster had some truffle cream sauce around it, but it wasn't exactly swimming in it as I had expected.  The lobster chunks tasted fresh, and the truffle cream sauce was good.  But the crust - the beautifully golden crust looked so promising when the pie was rolled out on the serving cart.  Unfortunately, the crust was so flavorless and dry that once I ran out of the truffle cream sauce to dip it in (and that didn't take long because there was not much to begin with), I had to gulp down water in order to wash down the crust.  I'm not saying don't order the lobster pot pie  - just don't go in like I did expecting it to rock your palate.

If you plan to split lobster pot pie, you will probably need appetizers to fill you up. These appetizers are not to be missed: Chilled Cucumber Soup, Seared Foie Gras, Tomato Fondue (especially the latter!).  

The Braised Beef Short Rib was decent - the best part being the peas and carrots and not the short rib.  My friend got the Hawaiian Big Eye Tuna and said that was one of the least appetizing tuna dishes he's ever ordered at a restaurant.  

Service was excellent, except the kitchen forgot one of our orders (so we just cancelled it).  My friends really enjoyed the wine.Note to self: Find a better 24 hour place when you're in Las Vegas.  OK, so we just arrived in Sin City so my friends and I decided to get some food.  One of the staff members recommended this place and we were hungry (flying on an empty stomach does me no good), so we went here because it was across the street from our hotel.  I ordered spinach/artichoke dip and a lettuce wrap.  My friends ordered different variations of fried chicken.  Some random guys from Portland sitting behind us recommended NOT ordering the steak.  All of these items seemed a bit sub par.

The dip had a weird skin on it.  My lettuce seemed wilted and pretty bland.  Maybe it was an off night but I don't think I'll be going back here again next time I'm in the LV.  Even for a starving person, this food didn't really do much for me.  Prices were OK by Vegas standards.This is the MGM's version of the standard casino cafe.  It's one of the best among its type.  I've eaten here several times and the food has always been fine - basic, but fine.  I don't think I've ever had a dinner entree, but mostly stayed with breakfast, sandwiches, wraps, etc.  Yeah there are much better choices in the MGM, but it serves its purpose - a fairly large cafe menu with enough options for everyone in your group in their casual attire, open most hours of the day.Eh... That about sums it upA really slick loungey-type place that was a bit underwhelming.  Been there a couple of times - once for dinner on a weeknight, and once for drinks on a weekend night.   Drinks and bar snacks are a better experience.  They have some corn crusted waffle fries that blow Chick-fil-A away.  

The dinner however left a bit to be desired.  I mean, they used tortilla chips from Safeway, and couldn't substitute their pinto beans for black beans.  What kind of Latin restaurant is this??  

Also, the chicken torta was extremely greasy and gave me the burps the rest of the night.  And I'm not one with a sensitive stomach so it caught me by surprise.  

The vibe, drinks and service were great, but don't go for the food.  The "Latin inspired"  food is disappointing for Phoenix.  Our bartendress was superb.  If anything, go for the service, the drinks and the digs!I'm giving five stars for the awesome food and the Sangria. If you go during happy hour you can get some great nachos or calamari. $12 pitchers of Sangria on Sunday are awesome, but prepared to get your ass kicked if you kill too many pitchers. The bar area and patio are really nice as well. Where this place loses points is the attitude of some of their bartenders. Some are nice but some have their noses so high in the air it's amazing that there's air to breathe at that altitude.OK, so here goes the review for Ticoz.  I am glad to see that the restaurant was busy yesterday...I mean it looked really packed, which is great for the owners because they are real nice people!  The main issue we had was the server.  I think she could have been a little overwhelmed because it was so busy at the time.  She was at least friendly which really made up for it!  My bf ordered the chicken sandwhich and I ordered the beef torta.  The food took a while to come out but when it did at least it was hot.  My bf enjoyed his sandwhich and fries.  I would give my torta an E for effort!  The beef was a little fatty and it had a lot of grease coming out of it.  We also ordered the churros for dessert.  The ice cream was good, the churros were good but could have been a little warmer!

We will go back because the food is good and the people are friendly.  I think it will take some time for the servers to get use to the flood of people...nothing that cant be fixed!Ordered some cupcakes for the superbowl here.  The cupcakes were pretty good imo, not the best i've ever had.  The decorations were super cute, and everyone at the party we went to loved them.  They were super expensive though for a dozen cupcakes.  I haven't tried many cupcake places in the valley, but this one is alright.Burgers are actually very good. Prices are .. well.. airport prices. 
Boring but passable beer menu. 

Bartender and waiter/waitresess work their tails off.Insalata carrabba Caesar with shrimp had too much dressing:( should hv asked for it on the side
Tag pic pac pasta was ok home made pasta tasted good but it stack together do it was not easy to move. 
Service was good and fast but unlike our other visits to the Carabba's in Henderson the food was not the best this time.Food is good and I like the variety to choose from. Haven't been disappointed yet.  I don't really like this restaurant at this location. It's the atmosphere and it just feels over crowded.Well after reading all of these lukewarm reviews,  I guess I'm very lucky. I've never had a bad meal here. I usually order the crispy teriyaki chicken & it's always excellent.  Even if there's only two bites left I want to wrap it & take it home! My son always gets mac n cheese & chicken tenders and they're so good I always have to eat one of them. My only complaint is with the service.  My waitresses always seem to act as though they're waiting on me just to hurry & get it over with. On one visit the young waitress took my plate away when there was food still on it....I wanted to take my leftovers home!! I was pissed!! My most recent visit my waitress rushed away after we each ordered an entree. I wanted to order an extra order of chicken fingers for my son as his appetite has grown to adult size. My friend had to call the waitress back (Katrina) where she abruptly asked "you don't think he'll have enough chicken in his kids meal?" Umm....No...that's why I'm ordering more!!! Don't worry, I'll pay for it!! I love the food here but the service leaves me to believe that everyone hates their job in there.I came here after a so-so night at Body English. Ditched my drunk friends back at the hotel, and met up with another group of peeps who had a table out on the balcony.  

Pretty much walked right in the door, and sat down. The music was Latin that night, which was pretty awesome (for me, cause I dig it)  the dancing was fun.

This I could see not being a cool club, if you were with just 1 or 2 people, but with a table, and the view, and the amenities we had, we had a great time.  I'd totally do it again.  Also, company plays a lot into it, and my company that night was 5 stars.It's yummy but VERY rich food, it makes me sick usually and I am usually full after just a cup of clam chowder.We stumbled upon this place last minute while searching for a late night snack. 

Very slow service and a our server was hard to understand as he didn5 understand us asking him to speak up and he had a very thick accent.

Now the food...
I had the onion soup. It came with this thick layer of cheese and a soggy crustini inside. Now for most soups I thought it came with a crustini on top.

My husband had the turkey club which was exactly that a plain dry turkey club.

My friends had dessert. One the creme brule the other had the frozen tiramisu.

Creme brule was average.
Tiramisu was served in oversized coffe cup with whip cream and chocolate chips on top. It was ok, I wont go back for it. Chocolate chips were definitely not needed.Great menu for restaurant week last month, but honestly not the least bit exciting in the food department (I had a boring salmon dish, my wife had a boring overcooked and over-seasoned steak with mashed potatoes).  I felt that we got a decent enough value for our price, paying more for the classic tiki ambiance than anything else, but I don't think I'd return ever again to order off of the regular menu.  *Note on value: awesome half-off wine list.

That said, the after dinner coffee cocktail I tried was a solid standout from the bar (and this place is primarily known for its bar), and the coconut desert thing they served was pretty tasty as well.  *Note about dessert: had it cost anything extra, I wouldn't have ordered it -- I never get dessert when I go out -- so at least I got the chance to try something different and enjoy it, I suppose.

But the service.....  Thankfully our server was totally cool.  When I first called the restaurant with a question prior to arrival, the guy who answered was a total jerk and so he got jerkiness in return.  I was in a much better mood upon meeting up with my wife and a couple of good friends when I got there, though, so I let it go.

Then, throughout our dinner, we kept hearing the sound of crashing plates and glasses from the bussers (pretty sure this was a record for broken dishes outside of a Greek celebration or a fight) -- not too disruptive, but also kind of uninspiring albeit slightly comical.

And for the grand finale, as we were about to leave, the chef came out to meekly say hello to his tables.  This did not seem like the kind of chef who likes to be out in front of the public, which is fine by me, but it's probably required by corporate.  So it seemed awkward -- I felt bad for the guy.

All in all, it was a pretty good night, but I wouldn't particularly blame Trader Vic's for it.  They were just good enough.Big Bang is a pretty sweet thing when you consider how many cool spots there are in the Valley.  Residing under a bar where the women dress as slutty librarians which is under a Hooters, there are a lot of expectations for a place like this.  Unfortunately, it really doesn't do much right.  

The music is fine but there are a lot of places where you can't see the piano.  It is just one of the limitations of the building.  The place is spread out over about 5 different levels which can either be hazardous or entertaining, depending on if you are the drunk trying to navigate back to your seat.  There is a bar at each end of the place but the lower/smaller one is the only one open during Happy Hour.  If you want to avoid college kids wearing $200 jeans, this is not a place for you.

The positives are pretty awesome though.  $3 everything except Red Bull during Happy Hour is a pretty wicked deal.  It is close to the LRT stop on Mill Ave so it makes drunken bar hopping easy.  The booze selection is pretty good and the entertainment gets better as the night goes on.

It's not a bad place.  Shout House is a bit better but is way out in Glendale and doesn't have LRT access.  If you want to go to a Piano Bar, this is a pretty good place.Yee haawwww Talk about racial tension. So Gilley's is a cowboy bar where they do play country music. They do have a killer cowpen to do some rootin tootin line dancing. From the Tush Push, two step, electric slide....just don't tell my heart. My achey breaky heart......So didn't try the food. I had my twins apply here - (former students of mine) and they got a job so I saw them a couple time fer some free beers. Yee ha. Unfortunately - I'm not a big country music fan. Plus I don't really like nascar. Dont drink Coors....so not my favorite place. For what it is....Bikini bull riding and mud wrestling. As long as they're not cousins....Nuff said...I came here for the Tour de Cure pep rally dinner (which was great).  The food: mini chimibagas good, taquitos: ok, and yummy salsa, chips, and guac. Not too big a fan of the beans but I never really am. Kinda greasy but a great help to pack on the calories for 100 mile riders. Good places for an outdoor bar hangout and stage area.  Worse case scenario, get trashed on the happy hour cheap drinks and you won't remember the negatives!A very expensive place to eat for what they offer!  I will give them the fact that their food is filling...a lot of starchy foods!

I think the reason they have high prices is due to the fact that they put out a lot of coupons.  Check a local Las Vegas magazine (i.e. at the airport, in a Subway restaurant, etc.), there is a 50% off your entire order coupon.  I used one and got 50% off 3 items and the price was still $15!

The food is descent...nothing to write home about.Have stayed here for a couple bachelor parties and was pleasantly surprised. I enjoyed the fact that they have kitchen and also a washer and dryer which is helpful in las vegas.This is a pretty good buffet for seafood lovers.

Depending on the time you come, there may be a line that you have to wait in until you get seated. It appears that they have a lot of tables, but they do not open all the tables until the line is long enough.

My suggestion is to come early (4pm-5pm) to beat the crowd.

My recommendations:
- Prime rib: The meat was so delicious. I can compare this to prime rib restaurants.
- King crab legs: I believe this is a big hit for all the buffet goers. Although I don't like it as much as other people, and I did go a bit overboard with dipping the crab into the butter, I can see why people might like it.
- Tilapia: This fish was so delicious with the tomato sauce they served this in.

I like how this buffet has a variety of different regions of the world. I did skip out on the Chinese section though because the food didn't look as good. Plus, I can eat this type of food on a regular basis!

They have such a variety of desserts that I couldn't help but want to try them all!

Overall, I did have a good meal here, but I felt there were a lot of food that wasn't too memorable for me. I think I'd like to try other buffets in Vegas first before I return.It's not Starbucks is the best thing I can say about the place. I used to live nearby and would make this a regular stop on Sunday mornings. Pick up a bagel at Chompies and a latte at 3 Roots sitting on the lovely patio furniture enjoying the unusual quiet that can only be found at that time of day on a Sunday in downtown Tempe. Enjoy those fleeting fragile moments. 

The coffee is good enough, I always liked it. My previous issue was only ever that at the time I live in the neighborhood, there was only one size for an iced drink and it was served in stryo cup. Hopefully, that's changed in the last couple of years. 

The furniture is cheap and strangely "made over" to look eclectic and hip. Whatever. I've enjoyed a first date or two on a couch or bench in that room, but it seems like its always hot. From reading other reviews, seems many would agree.

If you go, learn the way to the back parking lot through the alley. It's way easier to get in and out of that way. You can't make a left(north) turn from the front lot, so the alley provides you a north bound option. Plus, you can feel like you're at least 20% cool as the staff by knowing how to navigate the alleys of old Tempe. 

Personally, though the hipster vibe was alive and well, I never had anyone be a dick to me so it was fine. I doubt seriously they recognized me as one of their own, but who knows, maybe I looked enough like a resident to pass. Well, I was, so who knows.

Overall, I like 3 Roots but I don't make a point of it when I'm in the old hood.One of my wife's favorite restaurant.  She loves to eat the salsa and the Guacamole Live (table side) is her favorite.  Made to order with just the right ingredients to taste.

I'm partial to the heart-attack Chili Con Caso, not that it is spicy, but high levels of things that are bad for you.

I usually get the burritos, not much else appeals to me.  The fajitas are so-so, and the other dishes are okay for some variety.  The beef triple sauce burrito is one of my picks.The long islands are strong, and a great deal during happy hour. This place is just your typical sports bar with typical pub food. It's a little fancier, I'd say, compared to other sports places, but still casual. Waitresses in tiny outfits serve you beer and food, and pics of sexy bodies (women) in sports gear or holding a football let you know this is a great place for dudes! I'm just not that into sports so this place is just average and predictable. But honestly, if you love watching a game, good beer and drink specials, and want to nibble on some buffalo chicken dip this is your place.Jack of all trades, master of none.  I have to commend The Cheesecake Factory for offering up meals that will appeal to anyone, but aren't really outstanding.  I had a vegetarian pasta that, while very tasty, made me feel like it expanded to about twice its' normal size in my belly about a half hour later.  Not a good feeling . . .

The avocado egg rolls were very welcome to two Californians on vacation but needing their avocado fix, but they were a little salty.

So, if you're in a diverse group that's hard to please, it might be worth the stop, or if you want a meal with a cheesecake dessert, then obviously this is a great choice, but for true culinary satisfaction, keep on' truckin . . .Standard CCF operation with super over whelming menu.  I get a huge headache after looking at everything.  Do i want one of their 20 salads, 20 burgers, 20 sandwiches, 50 apps?  You get the point.  There are hundreds of items on the menu.

I guess it's a "safe" option to take someone b/c you can find something for everyone.  The service was pretty slow on a Thurs late night.  Overall this location is what you would expect from Cheesecake.  The desserts are obv awesome and I like the firecracker salmon app.Hash House A Go Go...Famous cuz it was on Man vs Food.
I've only gone to this location but apparently the original one is in San Diego and they recently opened one in Imperial Palace.
Imperial Palace of all places!?!!?  GROSS!!!!

If you are hungry this is the place to go.
Portions are just HUMONGOUS, GIGANTIC, OUT OF THE ORDINARY!
If you want to get a coronary after eating this is the place to go as well.

Don't get me wrong though...The dishes are Damn good...
But if you feel like eating what is normally an appetizer as a meal (The Crab Cake made dish)...ugh...
I personally got the Sage Chicken Benedict....Now that was good stuff!  I got it with Egg Whites only...like that would really help me remove some fat and calories.

Definitely a place to try but I think a bit expensive...Their dishes are HUGE, and I mean freakin' huge! Probably enough to feed half of your family! Try their Kiwi Watermelon Lemonade, it's to die for. Went their for breakfast and dinner and they didn't disappoint.Everytime I go there's a huge line so I know it's always packed especially Fri-Sun when there are tourists as well. I asked the waitress for whatever she recommends. It came, I ate just a bit and it wasn't all that. It's a cool environment but it's greasy as hell. It's like a kfc but nicer place with cooler attire and ofcourse a bit pricier. It's nothing to go out of your way. I would say try it but don't make it a habbit. Wasn't too fond of the greasiness factor.I went a few months back for the first time after years of hearing the hype. I had my mind set up before I went that I was going to try the bacon bloody mary and the eggs benedict. While the bloody mary was on point, the eggs benedict was a miss for me. For starters, it is a massive amount of food, which is ok, but since I truly missed that traditional hollandaise sauce taste, I left a lot un eaten. Also had a giant sprig of rosemary on the dish that I didn't care to have on there. Service was good, but won't be running back any time soon.Great view, nice people, take grandma if she has never been out of Roundup, MT or Raymond, WA. Restaurants like this have their place and I wouldn't knock them as simple done well is better than complicated done poorly. If you like interesting dining however, take a pass and go get a nice bowl of pho or hit the Indian buffet. Either would surpass this place but getting granny in the door of the Indian buffet might be a harder sell.I'd have rather give 2 1/2 stars. That being said the food was OK. The problem with most BBQ joints in Vegas is that none of them do enough business to ensure high quality. I got the three meat with 1/4 rack baby backs, 1/4 chicken, and thenpork links with mac and cheese and coleslaw.  The ribs did fall off the bone but felt like they had been microwaved to heat them up. The chicken was dry and overcooked. You know how when chicken sits too long it gets a little translucent?  The pot sausage was VERY salty, but it was tasty. The mac and cheese was good once I put salt on it. Maybe they can take the pork links and mix them into the mac and cheese?  The coleslaw wasn't that good. Not much flavor and it looks like it may have started to freeze. The top layer of the cabbage was translucent as well. Not to mention it took nearly 25 min to get my food once it was ordered and I wasn't the only one that was waiting. There was a party of 10 that seemed to be getting a lot of attention from the staff at the detriment of everyone else. I wish these guys luck, but the most consistent places in town to get ribs are Lucilles, Roma's, and Applebees, in that order.Eh.  I walked in to Tao drunk.  Way too drunk and I think sushi was a bad move, but I was hungry and craving spicy tuna.  The waiter was good looking, the ambiance was typical and the food was nothing memorable.  I did try the lobster dumplings to start and those were very good, but the sushi was just okay.  The drinks, not that I had needed anymore were very, very good.I did my bachelorette party here it was nice and convenient to be able to stumble from one bar to another. I guess I never noticed the slutty teens that someone else mentioned because I was there after they are allowed out. I can't say much for the shopping because I really never did much of it at this place. I just know that I had fun drunk, and I think its better then the Arizona Center.My first visit was so-so. Our server took forever to come to our table and the service in general wasn't so great. 

The food was decent, but I expected a little better. We had the steak for our main course and weren't too impressed with it. I will say though that I really enjoyed the Blue Crab Artichoke Dip that we had as an appetizer. Our dessert on the other hand was not good at all and we had to send it back. Stay away from the Strawberry Cheesecake. 

The place itself seems like a fun place to go for dinner and I enjoyed the atmosphere. I think I would try it again, but I am hoping to find some better service and better food all around on my next visit.How can you complain when you can get a steak and crab legs, salad, and baked potato for $14 in Las Vegas and leave super full? Its not the best quality food but, if you are looking for a filling meal..this is where its at. Shout out to Mono....your girls from VA are coming to see you soon!Ya, I join the cult.  I have all their products.  And here is another chain in the Vegas area, this time in Mandalay Place.  Compared to a Gillete Foamy, you will pay much higher for the cost of shaving products.  But then again, you get a much higher quality product.  Once you go there, you will realize that they are worth it.  So, join the cult.Hmm, hmm, hmm I love this bar.

Actually I didn't love it but it was OK.  Here's the thing about these theme bars, it attracts a lot of the fans.  A lot of country music fans are toothless hill jacks.  Where some of them are normal people like myself the majority tend to be the flea market grifter types.  So that's kind of what you get here.  It's a mix of normal folks, like you and me I am sure, and those who have a skoal ring on the back of their jeans...and I am talking about the ladies.  The back pocket comb is still in style here and the beers on tap match that vibe; Coors Lite and Miller Lite if I am not mistaken.     

The menu?  A whole bunch of really unhealthy bar food.  They have drinks called things like Toadsuck Pond and the Who's Your Daddy Margarita.  Pretty much all the sandwiches will run you around $14.  It's Vegas, I understand that but that's still a bit pricey for a burger.  But what is that I see on the menu?  The "World Famous" Fried Bologna Sandwich?  Fried Bologna outside the comforts of my Lazy Boy reclining chair?  Hoooo Doggy!  Hold the phone!  It's on.  

This grease laden, artery cloggin' monster sandwich was chock full of processed meat goodness.  Thick sliced bologna, grilled onions and God Bless a-freaking-merican cheese.  Well hot dam the only thing that could make that any better would be to slap that sumbitch on thick buttered Texas Toast.  And the lord said let it be so, and it was good.  

Service?  Well I can't cotton to that none.  It was slow as molasses in January but hotter than Georgia asphalt in July if you know what I mean.  Nice girl, but about as sharp as a sack of wet mice.  The overall vibe?  If NASCAR was held at the Kentucky Derby or something this is what you would get.  It was too clean to be country.  Too organized to feel down home kick up your feet and sit a spell.  It's Vegas though they like their shit not to stink even when it's supposed to a little bit.  So while it wasn't horrible if it wasn't for the Bologna I probably would never come back.There are really only two reasons to come to this spot. 1) People watching. 2) To laugh at the shrine Toby Keith created to himself.

The music (when there is a live band) is actually pretty good. But the people watching is what brings me back again and again. The clientele here is so mixed. All the cowboys in town find their way here, but so do the bachelorette parties, woo girls, frat boys, football fans, old couples, etc. 

It gets quite packed at peak times. Bar and table service can be exceptionally slow. The food ain't much to write home about. The drinks are overpriced and kinda sucky. But you don't come here for the eating and drinking. You come here to walk around, shake your head, and repeatedly say to yourself "just who the hell does Toby Keith think he is?!" - and to just watch all the crazy people having a crazy time.Actually stayed at a local casino as I had some friends in town from the bay area and so we all stayed at the MGM Signature Hotel.

1.  Parking -  5 star - If you are local, they all have their own valet and parking. I did not find self parking, however, the valet was fine. Sometime it took a little bit of time to get the car, yet much faster than casino valet.  The valet jockeys were all nice. 

2,  Bell Desk - 5 star - When you arrive, they assist you with your luggage. I noticed they were very busy yet the team was always there when you needed them.  We had rolling luggage, so we did not need them in the end, yet they were very helpful and attentive. 

3.  Check In - 1 star - We checked in at about 3:30 pm on Friday.  Fridays on a summer month are still busy in Vegas.  My question is, why would they have a staff of two checking everyone in, allow a line of 10 to be created when they have check in computers for at least 6-7 staff?  Did not make sense.  One person in front of us had to be given water by the security as he looked like he was gonna pass out... This is Vegas.  It is Friday.  The impression of the hotel with only 12 people in line watching 2 people handle check in inefficiently is not a positive customer service event.

4.  Suites - 5 star - Absolutely fantastic.  Clean, luxurious, big, sophisticated.  This is not the Four Seasons, or Venetian or Bellagio, however, it is awesome in its own right.  Perhaps a simpler sophistication.

5.  Amenities - 3 star- Small Gift show for food and stuff. - Convenient  Starbucks - Not sure why they don't have more staff from 7 - 9:00 am when 30 people are in line. All of the towers in the MGM Grand go to the same starbucks, or attempt to.  So, line management for a resort should be considered. Not much else.

6.  Walk to facilities - 2 star - To get to the MGM Grand with all things a casino has to offer, dining, gambling, entertainment, you have to walk about 8 minutes.  While it is actually a decently quick walk inside tunnels and all, it is simply not good.  Late at night, it is limited as cleaning crews are cleaning. revelers are being boisterous and if your lady friends are in heels, well, that will not be fun at all.  Very convenient and inconvenient!

I like this place and can recommend it. I would just warn many people the it is a great deal, just that it is not as convenient and properly managed like you would expect.Good Quality, Good Service, Affordable Prices, Great Selection for American Comfort Food.  Not bad prime rib either.

more later...Not bad for airport food... especially Phoenix airport food. If stuck right at that exact location, I'd eat there over the alternatives.They get three stars now. They changed chefs. I used to brag about this place and anytime family or friends visit I made sure I took them to the bar. I went about a week ago and there was a new cook. The gumbo was still good but ....not as good.Mama Mi Casa! For one of the most visually stunning restaurants I can think of, the subpar service speaks volumes.
I've been here multiple times, and usually eat at the bar but have eaten in the dining room. The menu has a nice vairiety, and prices are reasonable. The chips and salsa is very good, and one of my faves at any Mexican restaurant. I recommend the steak & shrimp,the avocado fries and the desserts. 
Be prepared to wait, to get drinks, and usually to order.I should start off by saying that I am not a Jerry Seinfeld super fan. Probably not even a regular fan. To be honest, I didn't even know what to expect from him. Sure I have seen a couple of episodes of his show but not more than that. 

What can you expect? Clean and adult family styles jokes. He talks about marriage, kids, things adults love & more. 

For me the funniest segment was the marriage skit. However, within my group I must have sat in between the biggest Seinfeld fans because these guys could not stop laughing. I mean really, based on how much they were laughing I feel bad for giving three stars. But this review is based on my experience right?

Overall, I had a good time. The venue is nice, Jerry has a good grasp on his audience and can tell a good clean joke and still make us laugh.We have eaten at several Claim Jumper locations. This one is average. 

Service was ok, another waiter kept helping us because our waitress, Amanda, was busy in the back... Break?? 

So when the waiter, still not Amanda, brought out our food he marveled at how excessively large our portions were, compared to the normally excessively large portions, tonight's portion seemed obscenely excessively large, and truly worthy of pointing out. 

HOWEVER, the portions were not really obscenely excessively large... We ordered the Country Fried Steak as we always do. In reality these were thinnest steaks I have ever seen served as a steak. These could've been on a steak sandwich they were so thin. In fact if you added together the top an bottom breading, the breading was thicker than the meat inside. 

The portion of the potatoes was not as large as they normally are. 

All in all we would go back to Claim Jumper. But we were disappointed with this meal.Not bad. I probably won't go back anytime soon but it is a cool place to take in the view. It was expensive, the wait staff has a way of recommending things that all add up. Our check was over $200 for balsamic steak, chicken Marsala, a side of risotto and gnocchi, and a glass of wine each.For a 'mid range' restaurant, it was really expensive - total tab for 2 came out to $120, which included a really bad bottle of white.  Oh well, I guess it is Vegas after all, where you can't expect to pay less than $50 per person for 'mediocre' food.I was in the mood for pizza--not crappy, junk pizza, but a nice pie that I could sit down with and eat with a knife and fork if I wanted to.  After dropping off my wife and daughter at the movies (it was a mommy-daughter movie night), I began searching. . . 

VinciTorio's, right here next to the movie theatre.  Okay, let's try this.

Good service, check
Outdoor seating with those big gas heater thingies on chilly nights, check
Nice ambiance, check
Good pizza, check

Keep in mind that's just a check, and not a star for the pizza.  There was little or no sauce on this pizza, which kept me from enjoying it as much as I would have liked to.  Not a bad taste, and maybe you will like it better than I did, but I like saucy pizzas, and they don't have them here, I guess, unless you ask for them.

Everything was fresh and the pizza was well-made, with a nice crust.  No issues there.  The three stars is from the pizza snob in me who wants that burst of spiced tomato taste along with the pepperoni and sausage.  Nonetheless, I ate until I was stuffed.  I'll come back some time to see how the pasta is.This place was great for the price and concept. We came here with a big group for Father's Day and we sat in the side area. 
They had happy hour wine ($6 a glass) till 6 and we took full advantage of it. They brought out hot fresh garlic bread and kept it flowing throughout dinner. 

I had the Chicken Scarpara which was chicken sautéed with garlic, lemon, mushrooms and pepperocinis in a white wine reduction. The wine reduction was a bit runny but the flavor overall was pretty good. 

The wine list was extensive and our server was great, she was quick to refill drinks and take orders (and with a group as big as our that is impressive). 

This is a great place for a big group and easy on the wallet. A-OK!Stopped here unexpectedly last night (Friday) and was seated at a four-top even though it was pretty busy indoors.  I don't recall the name of my server, but he was oh so very patient w/ me as he tried to answer my food allergy concerns with everything from beer to specialties and the fish and chips (turns out his ex-girlfriend had food allergies, too). 

I asked him for a beer recommendation since I've only started to appreciate beers; I've always liked fruity cocktails and sweet wines.  I've NEVER liked the taste of beers, although I did enjoy the sips of San Miguel light beer mixed with Sprite or Seven-Up that relatives would let slip for us kiddies to try.  However, with micro-breweries and seasonal brews a-plenty, I find that beer-tasting (and seeing which ones match well with food) can be as much fun as wine-tasting.  (Sounds like I've done a lot of beer-tasting, huh?  I can count the times I had a couple sips of beers on one hand!)  But I digress...  My server suggested a Blue Moon, which I almost didn't get to try since it looked like I was allergic to every dish I selected (he'd go to the back to double-check).  I think he could see I was about to bolt, bec. he suddenly appeared with a cold glass of Blue Moon, w/c came w/ an orange slice.

Since I didn't want to leave with an open bar ticket unpaid, I decided to throw caution to the wind and ordered the Fish and chips platter, even though the kitchen couldn't confirm that the batter was *-free.  Am I glad I did!  The platter took about 20 minutes to arrive, but when it did I was happily munching away on crispy, fresh-tasting beer-battered haddock, w/c I sprinkled with fresh lemon juice and occasionally dipped in tartar sauce.  Yessir, I was really living on the edge now!  *-allergy be damned!  I even sampled the itsy-bitsy side of coleslaw, w/c I'm pretty sure had * in the dressing.  Oh, and the beer tasted fine.  So much so, I almost bought a six-pack from Sunflower a couple of days later.

I'll be back to try other specialties and their burgers, of which Mac's is famous for.Very good food but a little overpriced for the amount of food you get so the price is the only reason I am giving it a 3 star instead of a 4 star.  Cost about $11.50 for a small sandwich side salad and an ice tea.  All the food seems to be of the organic nature so definitely taste is higher quality.

I have been there 3 times and each time left still hungry; however, did feel that I had a healthier lunch than other options in the area.

If you are in the mood for a high quality / healthy light lunch and okay with paying $10-12 per person definitely give Essence Bakery a shot.I went here expecting to get this "blow your mind" egg salad sandwich I read about in an article on Feb. 22, 2013 only to discover they do not have egg salad sandwiches.  I even mentioned the article and the girl behind the counter just looked at me like I had no idea what I was talking about.  I was disappointed to say the least, since I was craving egg salad.
However, with that said, I did try the lemon basil chicken salad on brioche and it was pretty good.  The brioche definitely was a plus!  The potato salad side was not for me, my personal opinion was that is had way too much mustard in it.
I also tried the most heavenly macaroon I have had in a long time!  It was so light and airy and the taste was spot on!
If I go back, it would be for the macaroons.Solid little breakfast joint. 

I have been here 3 times and my experiences have been pleasant. Food is good but nothing to go crazy over. Service is above average. I believe they have unlimited coffee refills too. 

Pros
- Good food
- Fast service

Cons
- Smaller portions
- Boring menuThe prime rib here is excellent- would definitely go back just for that. I liked how the food was organized by "Latin", "Chinese", "Raw", "Italian", etc, made it very easy to decide where to go. The sushi however looked terrible, and was confirmed by my friend to not be good at all. I would have loved to see more options in the raw section and also in the "noodles" section there weren't any noodles, just rice? All in all, I don't know if I would come screaming back to eat here but it wasn't an unpleasant experience either.Buffet  $30 -packed as usual.  Nothing outstanding but something for everyone to hit the spot.  Crab legs were cold and just OK, prime rib was chewy but OK, the Chinese items were acceptable.  Sushi available, pasta available, salads, all the usual.  Had expected slightly better quality.  All the dessert we tried were delicious, and there was a sugar free choc dessert which was yum!
Mai tai was weak.
Server left my debit card on the table when we were getting our buffet!I was recently notified by a management member that he was truly sorry about the first mishap, nice to see someone is keeping tabs on their business first hand especially in this economic climate when bad critisizm can cost you lots of business. Ill give it another whirl and see what becomes of it.We decided on Rao's because we were on a deadline and Mesa Grill was way too packed to wait for a table. The pasta was cooked perfectly, the salmon was good, the meatballs were pretty good. But that's all it was, just good, nothing spectacular. Definitely not worth the price either. I will say though, that they have the most amazing bread basket evar. You have your long ones, your regular ones, your flat ones, your crispy ones, oh so much fun!

We sat at the bar because we didn't wanna wait 30 minutes or so for a table and I kept getting these weird vibes from our bartender/waiter. Like he'd pause and stare at us after each request, like we had just asked for something unreasonable. Probably because we didn't order any drinks. Lame, let me enjoy my dinner in peace without your condescending looks, old man! Anyway, I wouldn't come back here, as there are far superior places to eat in Vegas.The mixed drink were to lemony all three of them I tried, order wine safer bet.  Food was ahhhmazing!!  Service terrible we had to flag down our waiter to even order. Flag for a second drink twice. Flag down again for pepper and knives for our salads since they them  with appetizer plates, etc.etc.New ownership....couple misses tonight: salad needs to be colder, caramelized onions on our pizza were only sauteed. Wines were really good.... Sangiovese and Pinot Noir.3 stars for this place but that's because it's in Vegas and there are so many opulent restaurants with amazing food in Vegas, I must hold Vegas restaurants to a slightly higher standard.

As far as steakhouses go, this wasn't bad but it wasn't anything special.  I would definitely eat at the Cut or CRAFT (actually numerous places) steak before eating here again and I haven't tried steve wynns steakhouse, but could only imagine it being better as well.

I ordered the 24oz Ribeye which was good.  Turns out it was bone-in which wasn't mentioned on the menu or by the waiter.  The steak was cooked just as I ordered it and was charred nicely.  I believe the steak lacked a little salt but it was still very good.

Ordered the garlic green bean side.  It was good, cant really mess up green beans.  

We had a nice bottle of Tor malbec which I highly recommend.

Overall, if you aren't staying at palms then don't go out of your way to eat here.  Even if you are staying at palms, go to Venetian and eat at the Cut or Delmonicos or head to the Wynn and eat at steve Wynn steakhouse.I like doing tastings, so the tasting of the strange Coke products is fun for me.  Some are delish some...uh, not so much.  But, it's something to do and then you can shop your heart out at the GIANT Coca Cola store.  I don't even need any branded crap, but there is so much there that even I want to buy something.  Crazy.

Go here, taste some Colas, then take pictures with the bear.  You know you want to.I love the 75 mins Vegas hot75x, , not too short and not too long just perfect !!! But I wish they can do something about controlling the numbers in each classes, more than 50 people in one room just way too many .... I went to the class today and I barely could stretch my arms and legs because the class was too full!!! I still like the instructor and the class only if it's not too many people!!!!When this place first opened - I don't want to think about how many years ago - it was a relatively "upscale" place to go for lunch.  We went there for lunch, and occasionally dinner.  The food was always great.  

Within a few years the food was... fine.  So we stopped going.  Every now and then we'd go to the bar - it was in the neighborhood and all.  And the dance floor could be fun, and if the DJ was ok that night, you could have a good time.  

I hadn't been there in at least 6 years, but the other night I was back on that side of town and was in a crowd of folks who "still wanted to do something" but they weren't willing to really drive more than 5 minutes.  (They considered this totally reasonable by the way.  How in the world did I ever get out???)  So once folks started talking about where the nearest Denny's was, or how there was a NEW Village Inn they could try - I volunteered Lagerfields.  It took a few minutes - but they were convinced.  

Good things about Lagerfields - 1) Full menu until 10pm.  After 10 you can still get deserts and most of their appetizers.  In this part of town that's big.  2) Because they are a restaurant during the day, it's never hard to find a table.  Well, that and because the crowds just aren't packing it in over there... 3) It wasn't a bad time.  There was a decent cover band the night we went.  Between sets they played some muzak that was pretty cool for the crowd - we sang along to a few good 80's tunes together.  

So, is this your destination location?  Heck no.  But, if you're ever in the area, and you have a group of friends that you just want to sit and talk with while in a bar setting, it's not the worse option in the area.  

And it beats the heck out of Village Inn.The four of us ordered the full tasting menu, with bread, wine, and cheese at the end. Service was good and friendly, about on par with what I expect at a restaurant of such caliber (and price). Creative breads were a nice touch, and many of the dishes were thoroughly enjoyable, but I honestly can't remember a single dish that really drove me crazy. This meal took place about 2 months ago.

I don't have any particular complaints, but I was overall unimpressed with the dishes in comparison to my expectations. Among all the tasting menus I have had at Michelin-starred restaurants (6 or 7), this was the least memorable.

The bottom line is that there is better value to be had in Las Vegas, but if there are some particular dishes at Guy Savoy that excite you, I would recommend it.We had a group of 8 stay here for a Vegas trip and it was a nice room and quite comfortable.  We got a good deal on the room, and it isn't that far off the strip.  Although we did mainly use our car, it is not unreasonable to walk to the strip from here, but it could take some time.  We had a good room which slept 8 comfortably.  Only complaints were that the staff seemed really confused when we were checking in - it took us like 30 minutes to get everything settled - and they could have provided us with more toiletries like soap and shampoo.  We didn't get a chance to enjoy the rest of the amenities on the trip.  Parking wasn't too bad, although it did get kind of crowded at times.So....shall we start off with some positives?

Ok. The beer selection here is good and the happy hour drink specials are not bad. AND there is a plethera of flat screen TVs that surround you. It's definitely hard to decide whether to stare at the TV or the big tata's attached to the servers. I managed to find a happy medium.

The menu is has great variety, but the food itself was only ok. I ordered the Sloppy Jane, the other half ordered a Salad. The sandwich was huge and messy, just how I like it. The first three bites were devine, and then it started tasting soggier and soggier. The salad was bleh.

As to be expected, the place is definitely a sausage fest...BUT a good place to go to, to catch a game or have a quick drink. I don't think I would linger long enough to watch the masses get wasted though...Walking into this place is like shopping at an international market.  There are some very unique items and its fun to wonder around and check out items like chop sticks set, saimin bowls, and bangles from India.  

I like coming in when they have put out their Christmas stuff.  The ornaments are very different and are so cute.  They have every kind of them you good think of and some one of kind items.  I came last year for my secret Santa gift and they loved it!

They have a small amount of food items, tea and coffees from around the world.  And they usually have some samples waiting to be tried.  If you are looking for some unique decorative items for the house, some quaint English biscuit, or a nice bar stool, this is your place. Be sure to look into their membership card, for general savings and coupons!Came here for lunch with a few friends and loved it!  It was a nice change of pace from the Las Vegas Strip Hotel foods.  They had a lunch special for $11.00 which included your choice of meat for shabu along with all the veggies.  i was happy to see that they included asparagus as one of there veggies and they had the most amazing dipping sauces!  If you are in the area definitely give it a try.  It's not that far off the strip and it wont break the bank.  Next time I plan on trying the sukiyaki, heard that was yummy too.   :)The pizza here tasted really, really good.
The bad? It gave me a mild case of food poisoning. Totally gross.

So... three stars to Sirrico's for letting me enjoy a nice, gooey slice of pizza while making me feel skinny the next day.I am a HUGE fan of Top Chef and Tom Colicchio and I was looking forward to trying out his restaurant.  Unfortunately since I cannot afford Craftsteak at my budget, my friend and I decide to try his sandwich place instead.  I ordered the grilled mozzarella sandwich and a small salad with lemon vinaigrette.  I was a bit disappointed by my sandwich.  The first few bite was good, but after a while it just got very bland tasting.  The salad on the other had was very refreshing.  

My friend's breakfast sandwich looked and tasted a lot better than my grilled cheese sandwich.  Should have gotten that instead.I was expecting great things from this sandwich shop but was disappointed to find basically a glorified lunch counter. The ingredients just didn't seem to be very high quality. The steak melt didn't have enough steak in it. The sandos sound good but the execution didn't seem to be there. For the inflated price tag I want a great sandwich. This wasn't.I'm giving it 3 stars for nostalgic reasons only as I used to come here in high school (90s) and remember it being awesome... but if I had not come here in my youth I'd probably only give it 1 star.  I took my family here recently. Service was great and fast, but the food was just ok for being so pricey. I will not go back again :PI was pretty pleased with the buffet here, though admittedly I really only went there for breakfast.  At $14, I felt breakfast was reasonably priced especially considering it's vegas!  They also have an all day all you can eat pass for $30.

I'm a big fan of breakfast food, so was pleasantly surprised to find they served breakfast till at least noon. They had fried plaintains for breakfast...super bomb, perfectly ripe a surprising inclusion. Their french toast is delicious, but pass on the waffles; they look like great, plump, belgian waffles but are too spongy to enjoy. If you want breakfast get there early because the line to that part of the buffet gets long.Very cool. They have Fernet. However again downtown right off Fremont. I suppose they tried to keep the riffraff out by making the door appear secret however once inside it's pretty cool.

Open a location on the other side of town in Henderson!I ate here over the weekend while attending Comicon.  I was actually pretty hungover at the time and desperately needed to plug my gut.  It was between this and a deli I saw a little bit down the way but pizza always, always sounds good so I made my decision.  In my mind, in a fight between a pizza and a sandwich, the pizza would always win because it has the power of molten-hot cheese and pepperoni shields.

Yay:  It was like $6 bucks for a big slice of pizza and a salad and a drink.  That's a really, really good deal.  The salad that I got wasn't like an amazing salad but it had onions on it and croutons and had a strong flavor.  It wasn't bad.  If I were a teacher and my class assignment was, "Throw a salad together super quick and cheap," and I got that salad, I'd give it a B.

Nay:  The pizza was not so good.  But, you know, it was pizza and pizza is hard to fuck up so it was salvageable.  The big problem was that it was so greasy.  I mean the pizza sweat grease like a fat man's back.  If I were a teacher and my class assignment was, "Make me a cheap ass piece of pizza that tastes good," I'd give this slice of pizza like a C.  I choked that shit down though and washed it down with salad and raspberry iced tea.

So, you know, the pizza wasn't great, but after I got done eating I felt a lot better.  I had the strength and energy to check out Comicon for the rest of the day.  I geeked out good.I had been wanting to try this place for a really long time and finally we decided to give it a try before seeing a move at Harkins.  I was impressed with the decor and the fast pace of the place.   We  were seated promptly and the waitress was there with a smile on her face within minutes to take our order.   Tried the wood grilled filet mignon chopped salad and it was quite good, however after the first encounter with the waitress the service went all down hill.  Our waters were never refilled nor did we ever see the waitress again..we had to go look for who in order to pay the bill. the food was good thus the tree stars, but I think that they need to work on the service end of it to make it a complete dining experience.  Will give it another try though...My husband and I were craving pizza so this seemed like the ideal spot to have dinner. Once we arrived and were seated, it took 10 minutes for our waitress to even come to our table. Once she arrived she didn't even apologize for the wait or ask how out evening was. If the costumer service was better, we would have enjoyed our dinner a lot better. FYI the bus boys were awesome, and food was good!I appreciate the way the Red Rock looks on the inside and outside, it was a journey to get here from the strip (wish I woulda known about the free shuttle) but the place is amazing with a great bar area, BINGO! and bowling of course! I even got in a game of darts. It was a good time we had here and if I went to Vegas again mind you, I would rent a car to get here, I might be back! :) The only thing is, they have an extensive set of rules so I dont know why they wont let an adult hold a 8 pounder, hmph, ah well.I thought it seemed a little unreasonable that I should have to pay a $27 Resort fee for facilities that I was unable to enjoy. For example, I wished to use the pool, but it was closed. Instead, I was offered the clothing-optional Cherry Pool which is not quite the same thing, especially when I was visiting with my boyfriend. The pool area was small and quiet and not set up for swimming, really. No notification of the pool closure was included on the web site, and with the high that day at a balmy 85 degrees it seemed unreasonable to not be offered a pool experience. Worst of all, when I called  the operator on two separate occasions to try to locate the Cherry Pool on the hotel map, they were of NO assistance. I spent over ten minutes on the phone to finally be told that the pool was "somewhere near the Cherry Club, outside." Thanks.

Additionally, the in-room wifi was completely inaccessible from our room on the 18th floor. Also, the doorknob was falling off on the bathroom door. The beds were very uncomfortable and it seemed very difficult to get the temperature in the room right. When we left in the morning at about 7 am to go hike Red Rock, we were approached by a housekeeping staff member who asked us if we would be checking out soon, so she could clean out our room. Wow.

To be frank, although the property is enormously beautiful, it is unlikely I will stay here again unless I plan on hiking in Red Rock in the future. Even then, I'm a lot more likely to stay at my favorite Vegas property, THEhotel, and just drive out to Red Rock instead.

I immensely enjoyed the Feast Buffet, though, with $2 drink specials on margaritas and such. I also enjoyed the in-house movie theater, where I saw Taken, which was brilliant. The bowling alley wasn't offering any specials on Wednesday night that were to my liking, so I decided to pass, knowing that South Point and The Orleans offer $1 bowling after midnight on weeknights. I attempted to play Bingo, but it was going to end up pretty costly for two people-- starting at around $50. Instead, I joined the players club and sat down and lost a little money at the slot machines.

There's a shopping center across the street with a Terrible's, a Borders, a Best Buy, and a Coffee Bean. Overall, I stayed here solely because I was planning on hiking Red Rock and they offered a package which included two free buffets and two free movie tickets, but I would be unlikely to stay here again.Great place especially if you enjoy bohemian women with hairy armpits, bottled beers, and live music any night of the week. Two hairy bushes way way up!!!Don't want to cook, kids have a last minute sleep over, impromptu game night, treat friends who helped your in-laws move...these are all the reasons we order from Rosati's.
I would rather order Rosati's over Domino's or Pizza Hut or Papa Johns.
Let's start with the way they cut their pizza...into small squares...brilliant! I don't always want to eat a whole slice and their portions make it easy not to gorge.
I love the thin crispy crust that stays dry & crunchy. Their toppings are generous and overall good delivery pizza. Enough ratio of cheese to toppings to crust.
If you save your pizza box stubs, you get a discount off your next order. Be sure to ask about their specials when you call.I'm usually in downtown Scottsdale on the weekends unless I'm at my favorite Tempe bar, but when I'm looking for a fun night out with the girls away from the Scottsdale scene, we come to Cherry Lounge & Pit. The bartenders are hot. The drinks are cheap. And there's two rooms where you can dance and chic VIP areas with stipper (er dancing) poles.People stand in the hot AZ in line outside of these Oregano's and I just don't get it. But then again they do the same at Olive Garden. They have OK food and respectable service, even though one of the servers whisked away 2 out of 3 salad bowls while there was clearly over half of one of their large salads quite visible. Then even though we said WHOA the over zealous server (who had his thumb in the eating area of the bowl) tried to put them back down. We insisted he bring new bowls and he couldn't understand why.

My sandwich was decent, the pizza I felt very over priced. It's one of those places I'll go back to if friends insist but I will do my best to steer the party to a better restaurant.I ate there with my husband on a Saturday and watched some college football.  It is a dive, but it has some nice tvs to watch multiple games on.  Standard sports bar atmosphere.  Our booth wasn't very clean, and the restaurant smelled kind of smokey.  Burgers were ordered medium and were well done, not even a little pink.  Food was ok.  It seems popular with a 50 something single crowd.  I probably would't go again personally.Jimmy John's is one of my favorite places around UNLV to grab some food.  They rank on the top of my "fast food sandwich" category, way above Subway, Quizno's, Togo's, or any other mediocre sandwich place.  Their sandwiches are around $5 for an 8" sandwich, which is a great price for a good sandwich.  The service is extremely fast, and the service is friendly, which always makes it easier to come back.  

The sandwiches are what really bring me back, though.  My favorite sandwich is The Vito.  The Vito is a classic Italian grinder, and is one of the most popular things at Jimmy Johns.  I always get the hot peppers, too, which makes the sandwich that much better.  I also really like the BLT, and the Roast Beef and Provolone.  I can't remember what these are called, but the menu's not too confusing to figure out.  

The sandwiches are all made to order, and come out VERY fast.  Usually your sandwich is done by the time you finish getting your fountain drink.  Which brings up another great thing about Jimmy Johns, their fountain drinks.  I usually don't mention fountain drinks as being great, but they have Cherry Coke.  I always like to give props to any restaurant that has Cherry Coke, as it is a rarity, yet is one of the best sodas on the market.  

Definitely go to Jimmy Johns if you love sandwiches, you will love it!Food wasn't too bad here, but next time I'll try something else. I ordered the Bibimbap. It was ok, but I've definitely had better. My family had the Kalbi - a little overpriced I think. It was $35 a plate, but the portion was worth maybe $25. My sister also didn't think the quality was so great (I don't eat meat so can't give my personal opinion). 

However, the staff was pretty friendly and the place was clean enough (from what I could see). I just wouldn't go out of my way to go here. If you're starving and it's on the way to where you are going sure. But if you can wait, I would hold out till you come across something great.I only give this place 3 stars because of the awful service I first received. We went in and say at the far bar. We sat there for 10 minutes being completely ignored by "Oz" while he served everyone around us. He never once acknowledged us but immediately walked up to the two guys who sat down next to us before they were even fully seated. Being in the industry, I am a god tipper and have to say that this "Oz" character missed out on a good tip. If I were the manager of this pub I would be embarrassed to have him as an employee. We finally moved to another section and had good service and some good drinks.I was eager to have a good beer somewhere and had the perfect opportunity after I picked up tickets to Blue Man Group. My wife doesn't drink beer so I stopped by during the day. The bartender was very friendly and knowledgeable about IPAs and gave me a sample of local tap that was very good. I had a pint of Ballast Point Sculpin and chatted with the bartender about baseball. He left my tab open with the check in a pouch right next to me if I wanted to go. I appreciated this as I only had the beer, signed my bill and left without needing him. Decor and vibe was high-end sportsbar which I like when it is quieter in the daytime. I'd go back next time and try the food which looked good. I'll update my review when I do.Strawberry mojitos and taquitos were great!! Wings are gross, but who orders wings at a mexican place? Chips and dip are great :)I absolutely love the atmosphere and decor. Dice dark lighting, red and black colors, chandeliers, good Sinatra type music, very old Vegas feel.

However... Im sorry to say that I did not enjoy the vegetarian options. 
We ordered the caprese salad and the eggplant parmigiana.
The caprese salad was ok.... but it was drenched in an overpowering pesto. Pricey! $15!!!

The eggplant parm ($21!!!) came out soggy and oily. Way too much cheese! The best thing about the dish was it came with a side of grilled asparagus. All 3 of us at the table agreed that the plain asparagus was the most appetizing.

My friend ordered the vodka pasta and the other just plain marinara pasta. They were not impressed either.

Too bad... Too expensive. Im sad I wont be back since I really liked the vibe of the place.We had the chateaubriand with foie gras mushroom sauce and fingerling potatoes with beans and carrots ($92). We ordered an additional side of creamed spinach ($10) which was really good. The meat was decent, but the end was too crisp for my liking. Our server was ok but it seemed like the busser did most of the work, he was great. Our drinks were always filled :). We had the trio creme brulee - vanilla, pistaccio and cinnamon apple. It was pretty good, especially to share ($10).One of the more spacious and industrial Paradise Bakery locations, and another one that does not provide Equal Sweetener.  Not nearly as loud as other spots, particularly during the weekend morning rush, but unfortunately the noise comes in the form of Country Western music.  :-(Who knew Zappos actually had a physical outlet?! We discovered it by accident driving on the freeway in Vegas! We were pretty excited, but when we got there, it was a bit of a letdown. I thought for sure I'd leave with a few pairs in hand, but nada! I didn't find much I liked in the warehouse, and some of the stuff was probably 2-3 seasons or more, old. Oh, well...I'll stick to their site. They seem to have better product on the site. I'm not completely knocking the brick and mortar site because I'm sure this place is probably a haven for shoe fanatics. Just that it wasn't for me that day.The service was great (almost five stars!) Theproperty itself is a bit tired.  Granted I am a 5 star spa  girl, but with the economy......the place needs a face lift, wood rot, ant problem & mildew...Not in the suites. Overall I would give it another chance. Comfy bed, ok food don't expect much if you are a cook.  The best, due to the economy the staff falls all over you. Had a pool, suana and hot tub to myself on a friday.  So sad for them because the people are sweet..    Hopefully things will pick up and they will do some deffered clean up.  I can see how a family would like this place.Took the family here for a couple night seeking some sunshine and warm temperature.  For the price..it's just OK and next time would go elsewhere.  Considering the Ritz is within $50 per night think there are better options.

Pro's:
-enough activity to entertain the kids (9 &12) with multiple pools, lazy river, mini golf, 
-good location, especially if you are heading on to Grand Canyon
-resort fee is reasonable considering the long list of activities you get
-overall cleanliness of hotel

Con's:
-front desk staff was rough
-hotel overall is dated and needs a remodel
-plenty of staff around and on duty...if  you want a service you need to ask (i.e. drinks at the pool).  Usually get better service at Hampton Inn's at half the room rate.
-crowdedWe arrived at 5:00 pm for the buffet dinner off of the living social deal with a party of 7.  I was caught off guard with the 18% gratuity charge.  It ended up being an extra $73 because of it.  I don't recall being charged gratuity at other places. 

The food was nothing special.  I felt the selection was small compared to the other buffets on the strip.  The only reason this isn't two stars is because of the unlimited beer and wine that came with the deal. 

Not worth the extra taxi cab ride to get to this buffet off the strip. You can spend the same amount for better quality on the strip.This bar has a new name. It is no longer Boston's. No more Pizza. 
 Look for my review under the new name - "The Corner Office"

UPDATE: It's Back, but still very empty on most nights. Onj Sunday, they have $2.50 rum drinks and a $10 1 -topping pizza. Quality of pizza is average and probably falls just above the $5 Pizza joints. Blame the conveyor belt cooking.We had a gift card, which was the main motivation in going.  My son LOVES shrimp, so we went for his birthday.  I think the problem was that we were seated in the "bar" area.  Our server was the bartender.  The food was good for Red Lobster.  It took a while to get food, while to get drinking refills, and TOO long for check.  I still tipped my normal 15%, but not impressed.Up-scale environment and wonderful services. The food is good but not spectacular.The is the only churascaria that I know of that has a surf and turf options.  Other places just have the turf like Fogo and Texas de Brazil.  So I was looking forward to it.  Anywho, some of the meats were really good, like their house special and their filet.  They had a prosciutto wrapped scallop which I really liked as well.  But everything else is average compared to the competitors.  If they are going to charge the same prices as the other Brazilian steakhouses, they gotta kick it up a notch.  Everyone loves the cheese bread from Brazilian steakhouses, but this place's, like a lot of the other items, are just nothing to write home about!mmmmmmmmm meh. caesar's is alright. we got a free upgrade so we stayed in the palace towers. it was alright... bigger than the roman towers..and a little nicer. after staying at the palazzo, this is definitely a downgrade. its still a nice hotel. casino's alright...actually i didnt gamble much here.  wish they had $10 blackjack tables. their min is $15. so we went elsewhere. its nice that its connected to the forum shops......bbbuuuuutt, i think i'll stay somewhere else next time. this place didn't impress me too much. but its cheap .. so it'll do if you're tryin to save $.Had a four night stay in the old roman tower.  Newer rooms and except for the old tv room was nicely and newly furnished. Really soft pillows.  There was NO door on the bathroom   Room was clearly designed for couples but if you are shy about showering or going to the bathroom be warned. Toilet is in a corner but not private

Service ok.  One bad thing there were two small old probably blood stains on the carpet.  Food comes out. This had not. More gross the anything. E mailed and called hotel. Still no response three days after we left

Great pool

Decent food but pricey and except for Mesa grill pretty standard fair.  Coffee shop good but horrendously slow.  20 minutes to get a bill.  If clearly caters to large parties and known customers. 

A fun old time place with a history and some flaws.  Really 3 and a half starsFood was just ok. Nothing special about it. Service was ok. Server forgot to bring my water out for almost ten minutes, until I reminded him. Also waited a while for the check. Would have been 2 stars, but he made up for it at the end by trying to hold a conversation with us.DO NOT CONFUSE THIS PLACE with the Oyster Bar at Palace Station- completely different. Somehow GPS led us here instead of the other one we really wanted to go to- I mean it wasn't bad- but when you were expecting a pan roast with creamy sauce and instead you get a jambalaya looking thing you are a little bummed. Their version of pan roast is completely different and it wasn't until the food came out that I realized we were at the wrong place! No wonder there was no line! However, I must admit I really liked how they sliced the lobster pieces in half so it was easy to eat. :)I held a very mini UYE to try out a new place. 

I got the dolsot bibimbap ($9.95) since it's a favorite dish. Theirs here was decent and the stone pot stays hot. Somehow though it lost its crispness compared to the last dolsot I got. The veggies were fresh and the meat 

The banchan is good here and fresh. We had stewed mushrooms, daikon radish kimchee, napa cabbage kimchee, zuchinni, korean spinach with sesame. Definitely some of the better banchans I've had. Taste more like homemade. 

I heard about the good service here, they were friendly but there really wasn't much service. We ordered, got served and then that was it. No banchan or water refills. We were sitting around and talking and it wasn't til like an hour later asked if people wanted water. I was drinking a Sprite which was empty and I wasn't given water... We walked up and paid. It would have been 4 stars if it wasn't for the non service. 

I would like to come back and try the "star"- the soon tofu and hopefully there will be better service.This place is ok. I got the beef tofu soup and felt like it was pretty plain. Wasn't too salty and doesn't seem like enough tofu. The egg is tossed in for you so be aware of that. The side dishes weren't many compared to some of the other Korean tofu places I've been to. I probably wouldn't come back again. The server was really friendly though and seems like a lot of people know one another here.A group of 4 of us came to Ventano's based upon the reviews on yelp and they were pretty much right on.

The view of the strip in the distance is BY FAR the best attribute of the restaurant.  In fact, they have a patio that would have been nice to have dined on but it was still too cold and windy to do so.  We look forward to coming back and having a glass of wine out there.

However, I'm not sure we will be ordering much food on our next trip as it was just ok.  A bit pricy for what you get too.  Should a 4 inch by 4 inch piece of lasagna served a la carte worth $18.50? The food was good, but a bit bland.  But certainly not like Olive Garden as some have stated.  Much better than that!!!

Like other reviewers stated, the service was good.  And it was quite busy for a Tuesday night as well.

I look forward to coming back to the patio, but just to order wine, appetizers and to enjoy the fantastic view.Good foodFun club, tons of guys, strong drinks. 
Oh yeah, and a great view! 

It's fun to see the old Playboy bunny costumes out. It's very old school glamour and great to see back in Vegas.I came here when Markus Schultz and Ferry Cortsen DJ'd and fuuuuuuh, it was HELLA crowded. The bouncers were not happy that day either. The place is SOOO small, WAY too small to have 2 big DJ's spin. The "dance floor (?)" was PACKED and it had to be 90-100 degrees that day. They should've had those giant misty fans blowing at us or some tents for shade because it was HOT and there were so many people. The pool was mirky, but my best friend was insistant that we go in because it looked "fun." Me, not being too much of a germaphobe and an admirer of fun got in with her and it was not fun. Every time the beat dropped half the people would SPLASH water like mad, they splashed wayyy too much. I suppose it looked fun, but when you're actually in the pool and they're doing that it got quite annoying. I felt like I was drowning from all the splashing because I literally couldn't breath for the 20-30 seconds the splashing went on. Other than that, I would've probably enjoyed this place if it wasn't for so many people crammed into such a small area.The mood for some gourmet pizza led me here on my lunch..

And a couple good with bad happened. You can't just buy a pizza by the slice, they all come 12"- which has a crispy and airy crust, but lacks in amount of ingredients. Could have used more toppings and tomato sauce. Particularly on my pepperoni and sausage pizza- $11.

My Vegetable salad was scrumptious though, plenty of dark greens, corn, cucumbers, and vinaigrette- $7. Juicy, and moderately proportioned. Only took them 10 minutes to get all the food out though. The cafeteria setting is not too appealing, considering the prices.. bill for just myself was $18.

Good- but overpriced! : /Every time we go to the Apple store my kid returns the favor of dragging him along by dragging me to get him a pretzel here.  It is a bit pricey and they always have a very slow moving line, but the product is generally fresh and tasty.Jared:  "Welcome to Subway!  Have you seen my commercial with Michael Strahan?"

Me: "Uh...yes?"

Jared:  "Can I interest you in a sub made with our new rosemary sea salt bread?"

Me: "Sure, that sounds pretty good, actually.  What's Michael Strahan like?"

Jared: "Oh, he's cool.  We're making Subway commercials, you know?  It's not like we were hanging out or anything."

Me:  "Right.  I'll have the meatball marinara with provolone."

"Might I recommend the pepper jack as an alternative?"

"No, I'll stick with the provolone for the meatball sub.  Pepper jack works with the tuna.  They should ease up on the mayo in the tuna, though."

"I'll let them know.  Would you like it toasted?"

"Yes.  So you'll let them know?  Them?  The...Subway people?"

"Yeah.  We've been through some tough times together.  They'll take it to heart coming from me."

"So you're saying they won't take it to heart coming from me?  And what tough times are you talking about?"

"Well you're a customer.  I'm a lifer."

"A lifer?  Was this Subway gig a sentence then?"

"No, I mean a long term commitment sort of lifer."

"So you're like...married to, uh, the Subway people?  What do you call them in private?  Do you make sexual jokes about subs?  Do you?  Cause' that would be wrong."

"No, it's not like that at all.  What toppings would you like?"

"Black olive, tomato, onion and spinach.  Are you ashamed of this relationship?  Is that what it is, cause' it's kind of out there now.  I mean the commercials and everything.  But let's get back to the tough times.  What were those exactly?"

"No, I'm not ashamed.  Look, I lost weight, I did a commercial, then another...you know how these things go."

"Yeah...no I don't know how these things go.  I'm still, uh, waiting for my first spokesperson opportunity...I guess.  How do they go?  Is it like an addiction?  Did you get dumped and hit the subs hard?  Was Subway second best for you?  Have you ever heard the saying "You can get what's second best but it's hard to get enough", is that how this whole thing went down?"

"No!  Whatever man, do you want any mayo or dressings on your freakin' sub?"

"My freakin' sub?"

"Sorry.  I'm really sorry about that.  Do you?"

"No.  And the hard times?  Hmm?"

"Do you want to combo that?"

"No.  Wait, does the combo include a little story about Jared and Subway's troubles?"

"No.  Look, we used to only give like one strand.  Of onion.  Or pepper.  And like one little slice of tomato.  We were really kind of stingy with toppings I guess you could say.  It's not a time we reflect on proudly."

"Yeah, I remember those times.  I would order a veggie sub and sandwich dude would gently lay one strand of green pepper and one thin strand of onion along my sub.  I would be like "more" and he would bust out...another strand.  And I would be like "MORE."  And he would look at me with a strained expression and then he would bust out like two or three strands.  Yeah, those were messed up times."

"Right.  Thanks for coming to Subway!"

"Sure.  Let the, um, Subway people know that things have improved, ok?  I mean the bread is better, there are more and better toppings and you're working on that stingy thing still right?"

"Yeah, I'll pass it along."

"You do that.  And can I get two napkins with this sandwich please?  Thanks."Well, it's Walmart. This one beats the one in El Mirage because the city sales tax is a bit lower so we make the drive here for some shopping.  It has a conveniently located Desert Schools Federal Credit Union if you bank with them. 

One quick tip I can think of is that you can park at the back of the store in their "auto" department area.  Handy when you only have an item or two to pick up...and lets you avoid the zoo that is Walmart.So my friend and I came here to try out a different salon from the one we generally go to located across the street. I kinda felt claustrophobic when I walked in. The place is very narrow and not that big. The salon is well lit and there is a center aisle that takes you from the front all the way to the back of the salon where there is a bathroom and private waxing room. They have ten angled pedicure chairs that are spread out making it not so convenient to talk to your friend. They chairs are angled so you can see a TV (that wasn't even on when we were there) and there are plenty of magazines to choose from at each chair. There are eight nail stations. 

There are not a lot of colors to choose from and I didn't see any Shellac, OPI, or any other gel nail polish brand that is really in right now. Staff was friendly, but of course still talked to each other in their language leaving you insecure and wondering if they are talking about you (because remember you can't really talk to your friend). The place seemed clean, but you really never know with these salons. They don't use liners in their pedicure chairs and the water was obviously dyed blue. 

On the plus, Tom did my pedicure and is amazing at massages and meticulous at color! Five stars for him!I love the food and love the great prices. I love samwhiches as well as the cheese curds they have there that is made locally. What i don't love is the customer service at the Sprouts kitchen, they are always angry, seems like they hate their job and freak out if their are more than 3 orders to make, (imagine if they worked at subway), I go in there multiple times a week only to arrive feeling guilty to put in an order. After waiting a good 10min - 15min i was told they were backed up, which was fine, but the snarky "have you even filled anything out or what" is what definitely turned me off. Its not the sandwich's fault for the service nor is there any other sprouts around, so i suppose I will still have to anger those lovable and courteous ladies in the Kitchen:)Nice place to go for a quick sit-down lunch.  The lunch special (changes daily) is always a good deal and will be extremely filling.  For example, two enchiladas (LARGE ones), rice and beans can be $4.95 with a soda bringing you to $6 and change after tax.  Not bad if you aren't in the mood for drive through or a longer meal at Tia Rosa's.  They'll usually give you chips and salsa too while the owner/cook is at work.  

Standard fare of tacos, enchiladas, burritos throwing it some fajitas and chile rellono too.   The chorizo wasn't too greasy either so thats always a plus in my book.

Not bad for an extremely filling lunch break.  They've started serving beers too with a $2 Corona, Tecate, etc. Happy Hour.We've been going here for the  last three years. It took several visits to find a couple of doctors that were a good fit for us.  They've been great especially since we had an emergency and had to go to ER. They were quick to respond on a Saturday.

Unfortunately, it seems the wait time has been getting worse. The front desk is slow to check in patients.  I was checked in 13 minutes after arriving and 10 minutes after my appointment time. We then had to wait 40 minutes for the doctor. 

Additionally, when making my appointment the phone line was down. I couldn't make it online either. I'm glad it wasn't urgent since there was no way to get hold of them during office hours. 

I left a message for the office manager to address my concerns and haven't heard back.  The doctors are great but with poor office management I might look for a new office.Very small selection. I am used to seeing a larger inventory of fine dresses and only found one that was nice! I also felt like I was maneuvering through an obstacle course with all the people in there and the poor arrangement; this is a messy and busy store.Pros: My best friend was here for a visit from VA, where they don't have this fast food restaurant. She has actual cravings for their tacos. She loved them. I haven't eaten here in over 5 years. Ordered the sourdough jack and split it with my sister. Decent. Fast service. 

Cons: Greasy fast food. I prefer McDonald's fries.I sometimes stop at this Safeway because it is convenient. The reviews I have seen are correct, they need more staff (or) to staff at the appropriate times when it's busy. The lines are always super long and their customer service does lack. I do feel bad saying it lacks as the checker's are normally just as frustrated as the customers due to the never ending lines. 

I did also have a small incident with Pom Pomegranate Seeds (Pom is the brand.) I normally check all my expiration dates on anything that is perishable because there is nothing worse than pulling something from the fridge to eat it and it's gone bad. Anyway, I was in a rush and didn't look when I bought these and of course they had expired the week before. I will give it to the customer service desk, I took both tubs in that i bought the evening before and she promptly gave me my money back. Moral of this story: ALWAYS check your expiration dates. I was pleased with how she handled the return though, she did not give me any push-back which was a nice surprise. 

If the management team can figure out the right number of checkers during certain hours this would definitely help their rating and my frequency for shopping here. 

Sometimes a girl just don't have time to wait in long lines.I tried this place out the first time yesterday - i ordered the chicken enchilada combo with red sauce to go. It was pretty good- I think I will try the steak tacos next time -they look delicious on the sign. I was a little disappointed that they had all of sides in metal containers in the front.. But the rice was fresh so it was ok. Will try them again in the future.I used to be a frequent visitor here when this venue first opened somewhere around 2005, and Shirley was the cook/manager.  She initially started this Filipino eggroll (lumpia) catering business with a partner who decided to move on and leave Shirley to her own devices.  She expanded her business to include a few popular items she'd freshly prepare, rather than serve it buffet-style.  This ensured that the food was low in fat, but high in flavor!  I remember buying fresh pan de sal and baked chicken empanadas.  How I do miss Shirley and her way of doing business.

The new owners (as of 2006), a husband and wife team, do serve tasty dishes.  At least they used to.  It's been over a year since I've last eaten there.  Do go as early in the day as possible to be sure to get the freshest meals.  If you are looking for bargains, do visit before they close, but keep in mind that many items may already be overcooked from sitting under heating lamps/over heating elements.  The meals here are very greasy, but that's pretty much standard about meals served buffet-style (the fat keeps the food from burning).  I used to enjoy the afritada, menudo, and Bicol express.  The lumpia is pretty good, but only if very fresh (that may be more of a personal choice, since I have encountered many people who do not mind eating horrible, soggy pathetic excuses of lumpia).    

One can also find desserts, such as halo-halo, biko, and turon.I've only been here once so far and I thought it was a decent place.

I wasn't sure what to make of the sizes when I looked at the menu, but the burger I ended up ordering was humongous and probably the largest burger I can remember eating. I thought it was pretty good, although I'm not ready to call it a favorite just yet.I'm not a big fan of Gallagher's overall, but that's primarily because of what it is - a sports bar - which I tend not to frequent, for a couple of reasons: 1. I don't like sports, and 2. they aren't usually very veggie friendly, unless you like salad, which I don't. Gallagher's though, serves up a pretty good veggie burger. You've got a couple of options when ordering - you can either build your own Gallaburger (B.Y.O.G.), or order one of the other burger options and just substitute the veggie patty. There are quite a few to choose from, some better than others, some actually pretty fucking good, like the Baja Burger with jalapeño jack cheese, sliced avocado and fresh salsa (I think this one comes with bacon by default, but from my experience, they're very receptive to mixing and matching, which is nice). Or the Maui Burger with swiss cheese, teriyaki sauce and pineapple salsa.OK.  Not as good as Cold Stone or Sweet Republic.= = = = = =  WEEKDAY LUNCH BUFFET!  = = = = = =

Armed with a free "All-you-can-eat for $4.49" Buffet coupon, I whipped into this big Peter Piper for lunch today.  This is still the largest Buffet chain in the Valley, even though they have dropped down from around 65 local locations to 30 now, due to the economic times.  This one was roaring busy today & doesn't look like it's going away!

I started with some of each of their 3 tossed salads...  Garden Ranch, Classic Caesar, & Mandarin Cranberry Vinegarette.  The last one was special, with it's Mandarin Orange sections, cranberries, & sunflower seeds!  Then it was on to tasty hot bread sticks with dipping sauce.

There up to 10 kinds of pizza out at a time & with them coming & going in seconds, everything was fresh & hot.  

Their featured pizza today was called "Extreme Pepperoni", & it was really good!  In fact, it seems that maybe when they raised the price 50 cents recently, they put the money into using better recipes for the pizzas now!  Ok, this is still no BoomBozz, but everything was right about the place, my BOOTH was comfortable (Yeah booths!) & I enjoyed the use of their free open WiFi.  This fun lunch actually nipped at 4 Stars considering all!     :-))

Lunch Buffet $5.49 or $4.49 with coupons that come in the weekly shopper tabloids.So this review is written by a Kansan jaded in Phoenix by a lack of Barbecue.  I was on the hunt for a flavorful smoke explosion in my mouth and found myself here.

Firstly the staff:  This one is always a biggie for me.  I opened the door.  The girl at the front counter was very nice, and I asked her what was the best thing on the menu.  Of course, being a place with ribs on it's name, she suggested the ribs.  I did warn her I was a barbecue snob from Kansas.
Definite points for the kindness and helpfulness of the staff.

Secondly the decor: Typical Barbecue, the place was decorated in all the raw wood and other goods one might expect of a place like this.  The place was very clean, and coming from an ex food service person, I take cleanliness very importantly.  The decor brought it to a homy perspective.

So thirdly, and arguably the most important:  The food.  So let be be plain, when I order barbecue I expect it to shine above the sides.  It should have a rich smoky flavor, that is complimented by whatever seasonings and injections they put in the meat.
I ordered their ribs, and as it comes with two sides, ordered the fried okra and cole slaw as well.  It was suggested that the ribs were delicious.
I took it to go, and on getting home, the food was still hot and the okra still crisp.  (The okra was delicious, the breading really did it wonders!)
I cut off a couple ribs and bit into them.  Instantly I felt like I was biting into a bit of pork medallion which had been baked in an oven, then slathered with a bit of sauce.  The lack of smoke ring and flavor made it evident how these ribs were made.  I would be shocked if these ribs ever saw the inside of a smoker.  The meat was not bad, despite being a bit bland, but it definitely was not aces.

And thus this barbecue warrior will continue to search.  It may be convenient, but for my dollar, I expect more of a barbecue joint.I had never been to an Arizona Blimpie, so I dropped in here this morning a little after 11 to see wuzup.

This is a good-sized place, seating about 60.  There weren't any booths, but the table seating & the dining room overall were comfortable & pleasant, with the place getting rather busy by 11:20.

I ordered a 12" Hot Pastrami on Whole Wheat ($8.09).  It came with slices of Swiss Cheese onboard & the open face may have been dipped just quickly, at least on one side.

This place is no Capriotti's, but my sub and the service were both "A-OK".     :-)

Open Monday through Friday.This is a fun place to go and have a little competitive fun. My boyfriend and I enjoy going here for some mid-day adult time without the kids. It is a little pricy but still fun just the same. I like that they give you a printout at the end of every race so you can see your lap times compared to the other racers. Every once in a while you get some jack a** who slams you into the walls but ehhh what can you do, there're everywhere!!Alison B. sums up all the great things about this unique store - and I would return if I was looking for a unique gift for any female friends of mine.

However, when I went in on a Sunday I was 1 of 4 women in the store.  The man working was chatting it up with the 3 other women who turned out to be together, and once they left he had a seat and didn't say a word to me as I browsed.  I walked out after several minutes of silence.First time I played bingo at in Arizona. I like how the smoking and non smoking rooms are separated, they have a casino shuttle, and there is a Radisson hotel next door. The bad part of the casino are the location is very far out in no where, and the food service and food for the bingo players is okay.I have not had other Chinese or Asian cuisine in the Phoenix area so the review is in comparison to the Bay Area and the reality that there is a relatively small Asian population in the area. The waitress (most likely owner) was really sweet. She recommended a stir fry with bok choi, beef, chicken, shrimp, tofu, and shitake mushrooms. Basically the kitchen sink. We also ordered gai lan sauteed with garlic and salty/peppery deep fried chicken. The stir fry and veggies were a bland version of traditional chinese home cooking. The fried chicken which is normally very salty was a mixture of sweet and savory. The cold milk tea was decent. 

As previous posts have mentioned before, the decor is nonexistent. It looks like a Subway with the booth seating except the color palate is pink.The tapioca balls were soft but the iced coffee drink felt like I was slurping Straight SUGAR. Way toooo sweet. :( 

The location is right next to a Chinese supermarket. They have a lot of different flavors (iced tea, slushes, smoothies) but overall nothing that special.

Most of the staff workers looked like high school students.Some of their milk teas are REALLY sweet, I usually end up going home and adding more milk to make it taste better. And I wish they had some specialty teas like other boba joints, everything here is really just the drink with nothing in it, no jelly or fruits at all. Other places usually have some drinks that already have some. I do like their calamari rings, and the workers are friendly.This was my first time experiencing a Dave & Busters. Am I sheltered? Maybe. But mostly, I've avoided them because I simply don't like kids, so when I think of an arcade, potentially with screaming children running around, I break out in hives. 

Recently a buddy of mine told me that they have a good happy hour and also a game special on Wednesdays so I figured I'd give them a shot. 

We spent our time upstairs. This is where the arcade and billiards room is located. You'll know this before even reaching the top of the stairway. There are the deafening sounds of BEEP! BOOP! BEEP BEEP! BOOP! Then as you reach the top... all the flashing lights.

It reminded me of a casino without smoke and with slightly less despair. Any despair that existed, however came from the employees, not so much the patrons. There was about a 50/50 ratio of employees that seemed to completely hate their job, and wanted nothing more than to set the place ablaze. Then the other half who at least attempted to be pleasant. So I would say the quality of hospitality you receive will be a coin flip. 

Back to the Wednesday Special... it's pretty good. The games and even billiards are 1/2 price all day. And I'll give them props on the billiards room, it was nice. 

The Happy Hour was from 4:30-7pm and included  1/2 priced cocktails. I'm more of a beer guy but their beer selection is mediocre at best. Instead I opted for a Key Lime Coconut Margarita. Yeah... I said it. Should I be ashamed? Maybe a little. But it was delicious and honestly an adorable cocktail... I wish I took a pic. I'll take a pic next time. 

For dinner I got the Philly Cheesesteak. I didn't hate it. The entrée also included a $10 game card which was cool. There are actually a list of different $16.99 entrees that include the $10 game card. It's a pretty good deal.

I want to add that our server Leah was one of the cool employees. If a manager reads this... she's a keeper. She was on top of her game all night. 

The final verdict is that D&B is what it is. I like it. I don't love it, but a good time can certainly be had. I'll probably be back for some more Happy Hour Key Lime Coconut Margs... no shame. Ok... Maybe a little.My brother placed a delivery order from here last night. He ordered the kung pao chicken, beef with broccoli, some shrimp thing, fried rice, egg rolls, and crab ragoons. I believe they said the delivery time would be about 40 minutes but they delivered it was quicker than that. I tried a little bit of everything except for the eggrolls and it was pretty bland. It wasn't terrible tasting but it didn't make my taste buds dance either. The kung pao chicken wasn't spicy at all which saddened me. My fortune from my cookie read "How dark is dark?" That made me giggle a bit. I gave three stars instead of two for how friendly and fast they were.I've never been a fan of AMC's New York-like prices (matinees aside), but I can't argue with 24 screens smack in the middle of my neighborhood. I'm really surprised this place hasn't been flooded with ASU Downtown students, but hey, I'm not complaining. It's quiet (I've never been to a sold out screening here), it's convenient and parking is validated. 

So, what's the complaint? Well, maybe it's TOO quiet. Sometimes it's just downright creepy, especially when walking in from 3rd Street through the Arizona Center when no one is there. I'm also not satisfied with the service at times, especially during the week when no one is there. I generally feel the place is overstaffed, but I've witnessed a ton of goofing off and some dirty theatresUpside lots of theatres, downside, the staff are as dumb as a box of rocks.  Went to the new Sherlock Holmes film yesterday afternoon.  20 people in line, one staffer, one staffer.  Normally I would use the automated box to buy my ticket, but I had a gold pass.  Don't feel like gold using it though!  This theatre is closest to me, but it drives me nuts when they ask if I want to join their pay for rewards program.  Why would I want to pay for rewards to be your customer-shish.  By the way if you eat at a restaurant and have parked in the garage, validate at the theatre.  They validate longer.  I made the mistake of using validation once from my big Fat Greek and saved a whole dollar.  I repeat one whole dollar.Very tasty and portions were large enough that we took enough leftovers home for lunch the next day for 3 people.  We have found very few non-chain restaurants even worth eating at in this area, so the 3 star rating  is well-earned.  Hard to give it four stars since I would still consider it in the "cheap Chinese food" category and other aspects of the restaurant experience kind of lacking.  We had the lettuce wrap appetizer (was good and almost spoiled the rest of my dinner eating it), Generals Tsao's chicken, kung pao chicken, and chicken chow mein (crunchy not noodle).   We would get any of them again anytime in the mood for casual Chinese food that we could count on for being enjoyable.Shopping for groceries. This is our closest Bashas, so I thought I would add it and review it.

Over all the store is nice, clean and staff is friendly.

The bakery is smaller and seems cluttered next to the Deli area, but bread does seem to be fresh. Deli is good, but be careful sometimes the food sits longer than I would prefer. 

I love there seafood area.

Cold is separated in 2 ares, which is tough if you need cheese and milk, since they are at opposite ends of the store :/This walmart is right next door to me, so I treat it like my walk in closet.  I usually go here for most of the stuff I need.  The staff is helpful and nice.  The store is clean.  They usually process the lines very quickly and have 8 self check out stands.Average mexican. Kind of cute little strip mall and a little above average ambience. It's good food, but not necessarily great food. I would say that it is fairly priced though.

I've been here twice and both times there were some strange smells going down.  Anyone know what that's about? Also - what's the deal with mateo's? is it open? isn't it? what's going on there? i don't understand. Input always welcome!3.5 stars actually.
I've been here before a few years ago and said to myself that I'd like to return and I finally made it back last week.
Sylvia's really does a good job with their chips and salsa-and after all, that's what sort of sets the pace for the meal.  You know the My Nana's tortilla chips you buy at the grocery store?  Same people!
I had the beef tacos lunch plate and they were good, nothing mind blowing, but good.  The rice and beans were not a complete afterthought like some places.  
I'm certain there are better Mexican restaurants but if I'm in the area I would go to Sylvia's again no problem.I dig it. The food was tasty but didn't blow me away. I had the beef and broccoli and the crispy noodles. The service was prompt and the food came out impressively fast even when the dining room was fairly full. It was pretty loud in there and I wish the music was turned down a few notches.Overall: The food is good, not great. For the price the food is better than most at the same cost so I will continue to go here when I'm in the area.

Food Quality: 8/10
 - I did find some frozen peas & carrots in a curry tonight... really!? The other dishes had fresh and they were good. Why skimp on the curry?

Food Flavor: 7/10
 - the Tom soups are very good, some of the best I've had anywhere. The Garlic Shrimp was very good also. The curry dishes and other standard entrees are average.

Service: 8/10
-  Not overly attentive but I've been happy and never had a problem. The people are very nice.

Decor: 6/10
- nothing special but you don't go here for the decor anyway.I had a coupon for "the works" carwash.  They did a fine job, especially considering I got a big discount.  I liked the job they did on the interior.  It's probably the cleanest the inside of my car could be without getting a full detail.  The exterior really isn't any better than any gas station or drive thru carwash.  Still some schmutz all over the font.  I couldn't have hit all those bugs on just the ride home.3.5 Stars

I've been going to Freed's for over a year now. They have vast assortment of cookies, pastries, cakes, cupcakes etc. I think they are probably known for their cookies and cakes, so if you're looking for a cupcake head up a block to The Cupcakery.

The cookies are fabulous. They have all sorts of cookies, and they are truly wonderful - Minus the standard chocolate chip. They are a bit over-baked in my opinion. They are a quite expensive! It's around $18 for a dozen of cookies. 

I haven't had a cake slice or cupcake from them since my first trip, and honestly I can't remember how it was. That to me usually means it not worth trying again. I don't remember them being bad, just forgettable so probably something similar to the bakery at Smith's.

Try it out!I am not sure how to explain my experience at Freemont.  

I'll be brief.  99 cent fried twinkies and fried oreos gave this place 2 stars.  The TV's in the sky gave it 1 star.

That's why this place got 3 stars.  Nothing much else going on here.The Freemont Street Experience is just that, an experience.  Definitely a must see.  I am only giving it three stars because it is Old Town and it is pretty dicey.  Avoid the Glitter Gulch and will be fine!  Also always ask for the extra shot in your 13 dollar margarita, it is well worth it!I love Bahn Mi sandwiches and so I try them where ever I travel, this place has great French bread that they use for their sandwiches and also they are visually appealing in presentation. When you pull into this strip mall do yourself a favor and go to the very last entrance furthest from that way you will end up on the 2nd level the same as the restaurant otherwise you will be climbing the stairs to get your bahn mi.  The overall taste is of the #19 Charbroiled Pork Bahn Mi Was good but not awesome, I don't know what they are missing but I have not found a sandwich yet that touches Ba Le in Chicago......The place smelled fishy when we first walked it.  Curious about why this was the busiest restaurant in the strip mall we decided to eat here and ignore the smell. It took a ridiculously long time for our waitress to bring us water and take our order. 
We ordered the house special appetizer, one seafood soup and some fun chow noodle with pork. The appetizer came 40 minutes later when we were about to leave. It looked really good, but we had cancelled and send it back. I don't know if it really takes 40 minutes to make or if they were just making excuses for it being so late. If it does take 40 minutes to make then it shouldn't be an appetizer and it shouldn't be on the menu. The soup I had was good but I wish our waitresses asked me the type of noodles I wanted because I would have preferred the egg noodles. The chow fan noodles with pork  was really good. They have so many dishes to choose from it is a bit overwhelming. I would go back and give them another try. I think we just caught them on a super busy night. The waitstaff was friendly.At least once a month this summer, my brother and I make it out to the Premium Outlets - North. For what reason? Before the Las Vegas Outlets - South had it, BR was one of the main justifications for our northbound journey. 

Now, walking into Banana Republic is like a hot mess, a trainwreck at best. Hectic, poorly recovered, yet what makes it so endearing? Those sales - they're better signed than its southern counterpart. Also, it seems like they have sales that the South outlet store just either doesn't have or doesn't advertise.

I'll brave the crowds and the digging when it comes to fashion. BR holds witness to this...multiple times.I also lived in Italy, but I was a bit disappointed in the gelato.  This was our first trip out to Lake Las Vegas.  It was not that good and it was too pricy for the lack of quality.  The three of us, my husband, our three year old and I, got strawberry and hazelnut.  Cosi cosi, me dispiaca.Its fast food, chicken is ok, burritos are better.If you don't care about staying at a hotel with a casino, this is a nice, budget friendly HGI that is close enough to where you want to be in and around Vegas.

Pros:
free parking, shuttle to airport, malls and Mandalay, decent breakfast (I say decent because my eggs weren't poached correctly but it seems that this is hard for hotels, so whatever), standard HGI rooms.

Cons:
If you drive in late at night, you may have to park on the street or in the sketchy back parking lot. Shuttles do not run very late, so if you're partying on the Strip, expect to cab it back to the hotel.Knocked down to 3.5 stars. The crabcakes aren't the same- it's changed now, it's mostly filler- how disappointing! Very little crab- didn't even finish it. The potatoes were still very good. We won't be ordering the crabcakes here anymore. The maple loaf was very good- that didn't change. From what I've read here, according to other yelpers, the monte cristo is supposed to be really good. The server was very nice, although she was new (a few days on the job) and wasn't sure about our meal coming with the maple loaf. Still an Entertainment coupon participant (already got our new book last month).Relaxed vibe with a classic feel. We were here for a birthday dinner - just the 6 of us girlies. I think that spells trouble because it seemed like we were the loudest ones in the restaurant. Just having a good time out together. 
The service was great and I was confused as to who was our server. It seemed at one point that someone else took over and it was fine. All were very courteous and nice. 
I had the pork tenderloin with some white beans that were a bit on the salty side and some mashed potatoes. The pork was prepared perfectly, but I don't think it was the absolute best I've ever had. We shared the sides...carrots, lemon infused asparagus, potatoes...all were average, nothing really moved me. 
Charlie Palmer's is worth trying. I think for what you pay for, the food should be phenomenal. I just don't think it was. Oh and a couple of the girls had the filet and were not raving about it. I'd really be back for the service, but not so much for the food.They recently remodeled this place and it looks awesome! The only concern I have is, the seating area. I came here for breakfast a few times and stand around for somewhere to sit down.....So I haven't been to a $.99 store in a while.  And I forgot about all the great deals they do have.  Times are tight for just about everyone and a good bargain is sometimes hard to find if you don't look in the right place.  So if you haven't already started looking here every once in a while you might want to start!  They have just about everything here, from plates and dishware to canned food. There is usually one thing you will find even if you aren't really looking.  So the next time you get a chance you might want to take a stroll through and see what you find.I didn't get a chance to walk through the entire mall due to a migraine, but I did check out the Paul Frank store and Zara.  As for what I did see, I was kind of disappointed with the array of stores inside...either the store was located in Texas and I could gladly just shop there at home if I wanted, or the store was way too pricey and there wasn't any point of me going inside just to drool at things I couldn't buy.  The Paul Frank store was much smaller than I expected, and their selection was terrible.

The mall is in a weird location and took forever to walk to, even from my hotel, Harrah's, which isn't that incredibly far away from this location.

I did, however, enjoy sitting on a bench in the air conditioning and drinking a diet Pepsi.Nice indoor mall to take a break from the gambling and the drinking and the shows. The fashion show itself was a blaah but the mall is nice and has some good food options with a california pizza kitchen and a lot of others. They have an underground parking structure which is convenient,  a nice change from the usual Vegas eventsThe menu is very limited; all the food here comes in one color: #cc7722 aka ochre. The chicken strips and crinkle fries are a little better here than at other fast food joints. Psst, the rumor is the secret dipping sauce is a mixture of ketchup, mayo, Worcestershire and spices ... shhh!Is aiight. Good selection on snacks. The fresh donuts are the bomb. Price of gas is average. Blunts are fresh.Pros: Lovely rooms,  great spa prices, awesome pool, free shuttle to the strip, grocery delivery, friendly service. 

Cons: Only 2 places to eat: Denny's and "Tahiti Joe's", kind of far from the strip, can feel isolated if you don't have a car. No casino. Not much to do in the area. 

We traded in a time share for a week at this place and it was an overall pleasant experience! 

This is a nice place to stay if you're going to be in town for a while. They have free grocery delivery that you can arrange to have done when you arrive (it is rather expensive though), or if you have a car there's a Whole Foods nearby. We did not have a car, but we got some groceries and spent most of our time eating out on the strip. A shuttle to the strip leaves every 30 minutes, and it takes about 15 minutes to get there. 

I went to the spa, and had a great, inexpensive massage. The place is modest and no-frills, but the staff is accommodating and friendly and the rooms are comfortable and clean. 

The lazy river is neat!  Unfortunately we went in the winter and the pool was supposed to be on and heated, but it was unseasonably cold so they closed it (jacuzzis were open though).Hello again fellow yelpers!! So me and my boyfriend went to this location a couple nights ago to eat dinner and boy oh boy has the service changed!! Or maybe it was just our waiter, I will give the restaurant the being it of the doubt and say it is just the one waiter. I am going to also give the waiter the benefit of the doubt and not say his name even though I really want to (he he) but we are adults so I will not, nay!! Shan't not haha. 

Anyway so we sat down and the guy was just rude from the start which was fine maybe it was just an isolated incident but oh no not even close. He takes our drink order and as we wait I am looking at the menu and my most favorite dish wasn't on the menu!! So he comes back with our drinks (I got a pot of hot tea) and I ask about the menu item in question he says that no it's not but they will still make it for me so that was really awesome. We said we needed another minute but that I would like some sugar. Without even acknowledging the fact that we said anything to him he just walks away! And just to put the rest of the meal into perspective for you he did this every time we said or ask him anything. So he comes back to take our food order and he never brought me my sugar. I probably sound like a crotchety bitch but I'm sorry I'm not down for paying good money to come eat at your place of work and you treat me like I am an inconvenience of some sort. 

The only reason they are even getting 3 stars is because gosh darn I love there food, it is so delicious every time  and it doesn't treat me like I don't exist lmao. The only reason they lose 2 stars is for that crappy waiter!!! Honestly he was really bad, my boyfriend and I just started laughing about it because he basically took his potentially bomb diggity tip and tossed that shizz straight out tha winda. 

Basically go eat here it is worth it and the food is o'mazing just pray you don't get helped by he who must not be namedThis location was remodeled, the most significant change is the drive thru (at least for me, since I only order through drive thru now). It now has two lanes, which from my experience, surprisingly has quick service. Besides that, nothing significantly different from other Mickey D's.My trips to Williams-Sonoma will never cease. I heart this place and all of the kitchen gadgets it provides me with to oogle at. I actually do purchase things here, but typically I browse, come back, browse again, and then make a hard decision. Mostly because this stuff ain't cheap.

For me W&S is a place to let my inner chef come out and just daydream about the day I WILL OWN THAT EXPENSIVE SPATULA SET.... ahem. As I was saying...

I do like that W&S has a wide range of baking accessories and offers Star Wars cookie cutters, pancake molds, etc. Also they have a decent selection of pots and pans. 

The staff here is usually nice. I have run into the same older women a few times and they are always quick to have a conversation with me. Last time I was here there was kind of an odd guy running the cash register. He wasn't mean, just a little off. I felt awkward just taking my bag and walking away without any conversation or "goodbye".

Anyway, someday I will go to W&S and have my way... until then, daydreams it is.Ate here - food was meh but I shouldn't have been expecting much. They have a great selection of Irish and English beers on tap, and live music on a lot of nights. More of a place to drink than to eat.The place is good. The quality and service is 4/5 stars but the value is pretty low. Unlike older reviews who thought the fish and chips were amazing value, this time they only served 2 small pieces of fish and fries. I asked our waitress about it and she said it used to be 3-4. If you are really hungry order the shepherds pie. It's quality over quantity, also on the pricey side for the size portions you get. $50 for 2 people and no drinks. Guinness is $7.50 on draught.I went here too get new garage door opener for my house. Not make great first impression that for sure. I had too grab salesmen in another section too answer questions and get service. Interesting think that this Sears never really that busy so figure be like car lot salesmen checking up once see you standing in one spot. Anyway I hunt down salesperson the experience got much better. One gentlemen directed me too another salesperson in right section but then she directed me too another person. At the end got the right person knowledgable about his section and answered all my questions professional manner (honest asked about two different brands Sears carried Craftsmen and Genie) not push the higher price tag either way. So after rough start say that if looking for garage door opener Sears good place too check out.Super cheap food for Vegas, I went with a vegan friend who had a couple options here. I wasn't sure if they would because of how small the spot was. Food came up quick and decent. The hummus was nothing to speak of,  a bit bland, but I can't complain too much because the rest of the food was moderate. It is what it is and I wasn't expecting anything different...It's a decent place, not the best and not the worst. It's not really clean, but it's not dirty either. Everything about this place is just OK and average. It's pretty cheap; you do get what you pay for. 

I used to be a regular customer. Duc had been cutting my hair for years for $20-$25 (the price went up a couple years ago), and he used to be fantastic, but for the last few years he's been doing a lazy job and I kept going hoping that this time he would finally cut my hair like he used to, but every time I kept getting disappointed and decided to stop going to him. Not only did he start doing a shotty job, but he started to get really pushy. I was going through a period where I was trying to grow out my hair and so I rarely got it cut, and he kept pressuring me, telling me that I needed to get my hair cut more often or it would look bad. Not really a comfortable situation. 

I did have a few other stylists at Ann's salon cut my hair (I don't remember any of their names) and they were all decent, most of them were very nice. Like I said before, nothing amazing and nothing terrible happened, you get what you pay for.This is a pretty good place to come to for lunch (if you are in the area). The sandwiches are really fresh and healthy. And they are incredibly nice here. They will sometimes give you samples of several different breads. They also offer kids size sandwiches. 

I give it three stars since I feel it is a bit pricey. But I suppose it can be justified with the fresh and healthy part?I can't understand why places like this don't have better happy hour specials, or better hours.  I found myself taking advantage of the nice Samuel Adams Oktoberfest mug deal (more beer for same price I guess) but Guinness and others were a premium price.  I don't think I'm being stingy - Fremont is normally known for better bargains, for thrifty vacationers like myself.  As I noticed the huge Bass Ale light sign outside when leaving I really felt like a tourist who got suckered.  Oh well.  At least my server was pleasant.Serving largely business travelers staying at the game-free Renaissance hotel, Envy is classy and delivers reliably tasty, high-end dishes. Their Mediterranean salad is outstanding - with local honey vinegarette - and the garlic mash is heaven. I don't eat steak so I can't comment there, but their pesto prawns were yummy. They have a decent wine list. And all around great staff and fantastic service!If you can ignore the fact that a miniscule percentage of your hard earned cash will be going to the world's worst carnival barker this is a decent place to stay. 
Slightly off strip, no storm und drang of a casino in the lobby, and if there are a few of you they will give you a decent rate and possibly an upgrade.

I was al ittle miffed that there were no towels in my room when i checked in and some other guys underpants were still lying in the bathroom floor.Overall the food was pretty good but nothing spectacular. Enoteca loses a star because when I asked for no onions on my pizza, the waiter said it would be rude to even ask because Chef Marco wants them in there. I countered that I didn't care and still didn't want the onions... of course the pizza was covered in onions when it arrived 15 minutes later.Being a huge fan of Mario Batali and his two LA restaurants Pizzeria Mozza and Osteria Mozza, I was so excited to try his new restaurant at the Venetian. The squash blossoms were bland and under-seasoned, a big let down since the squash blossoms at Pizzeria Mozza are absolutely amazing. The fried prosciutto meatballs were decent. I ordered the bucatini with cured ham. The flavor was very good, but just incredibly waaaay too salty for one to eat and that's considering that I'm known to love salty foods. The anchovy pizza was the same.  All in all, the food was only subpar.  Service was also very slow and our lunch ended up lasting 2 hours long.They have a great shopping center. However, the parking garage is quite far and really not convenient if you need to get to your car for something. I do like the shops and all the restaurants they have here especially Earls Sandwiches which are the best sandwiches ever. They have a thundering water show in the mall and it sucks, don't wait for it.This is very similar to Medieval Times. You are assigned a country to root for and you scream and HOOZAH! every time they come out. You are fed a dinner of tomato soup, chicken with potatoes, broccoli, and a biscuit, and an apple tart thing for dessert. The tomato soup was really good but the rest of the food was mediocre. I remember thoroughly enjoying going to Medieval Times as a kid, but now that I'm older the whole thing has lost its allure. Its definitely more geared towards families with young children. I did enjoy the buff, shirtless men in the show but not enough to go see the show again.Came here during our Vegas trip, saw good reviews on yelp so we decided that we have to try it. The crawfish and the shrimp were fresh but the sauces were just ok.   Both the garlic butter sauce and the house special sauce had way too much garlic on them (my breath smell like garlic for more than 2 days).  The fried cat fish and the soft shell crab weren't that good either, we had better one before.  I think the crawdaddy in San Jose and boiling crab in Orange county have much better food than here.First visit was two days before NYE.  We had lunch.  The Green Papaya salad and the panang curry were both excellent.  Service was good.  Beer was cold.  There was litter on the floors and no one picked it up throughout the lunch period, but other than that it was just fine.   If I lived in Vegas, I would go back and explore the menu a bit more and then I would adjust my review accordingly.

Overall, I would recommend this place to anyone who likes Thai food...btw:  Their Hottest setting is not really very hot.first time trying this place & I had the mushroom melt cheeseburger & skin cleanser juice. I had my order to go.

The burger was good although i wish there was more mushrooms to keep the burger juicy.

The skin cleanser juice surprised me in that it tasted exactly like carrot juice unless that's what it's supposed to taste like. I enjoy fresh juice,but when it tastes like veggies, which i'm not a huge veggie eater i don't personally enjoy it.

I'll try this place out again.I had the brisket & pastrami. most ny type deli's will cost you as you know deli's are never Cheap but this one offers a big sandwich that taste great and will not send you to the penny slots after you pay the bill. The soup was good I will be backI had the gumbo here which I would not recommend. Also, I cringe a little when I see the oysters are pre-shucked and sitting on ice. They do have a nice 1 1/2 pound crab leg special for $16 and change, which.. is about the average price on the menu so probably should have gone with that. My wife had a seared tuna ceasar and it was made well.My bedroom closet is bigger than this store! But fun place to shop. I was visiting Vegas, had won a good chunk of change and money was burning a hole in my pocket. The staff was friendly and helpful, but I think Neimans and Nordstrom have a better selection.Since I've moved up to Vegas, I've been coming here for a while.  I usually come here if there's an excuse to.  I don't necessarily hate this place, I just don't put this place on the top of my list.  It's just ok.  In past visits, I enjoyed the fried rice, katsu and other dishes similar to them.  The food is good, not great.  I think a lot of locals enjoy this place because it's always busy.  The prices are overall, good.

What keeps me coming back though is the spam hand roll for $0.99.  As stated in my profile name, I'm a huge Spam Eater.  Sometimes, I'm not in the mood for a whole musubi, just something small and the spam hand roll is perfect.  Small strips of spam, rolled into a small sushi, with a teriyaki soy sauce.  I enjoy it, but I can't really have a lot of it.  The soy sauce is super salty and gives me a headache after three hand rolls.  That still doesn't stop me from coming back for more.  For me, it's the only reason I still consider going there and haven't NOT gotten it at every visit (if that makes sense lol).

If you visit this place, I'm sure you will appreciate the variety of Asian cuisine offered here.  There's Japanese, Chinese, Korean and Hawaiian local food BRAH!  It's a small place located on a super busy intersection.  When you visit this place, be sure to grab a table right away.  It's first come, first serve and always busy.  Be prepared to wait just a little bit.Huge, clean bowling alley with a multitude of lanes (over 60, I believe.)  Games get cheaper later at night, I think after 10pm.  There were a few communication issues with the guy working the cash register as we tried to pay for games.  He was in a pretty bad mood.  We didn't let that get in the way of having a good time, though.I know, seeing a movie while you're IN Vegas?! What can I say, I just can't get away from it! :)

I agree with other reviewers, this place isn't the easiest to spot. The cab driver didn't even know where it was off hand, so we had to use the GPS for it. You definitely won't see it directly off the strip itself, but once you've been there and found it, I doubt you'll miss it next time. 

The theather itself is alright. Prices are what I've seen back home, so nothing surprising there. Personally, I like stadium seating and they didn't seem to have it here, which is ok but not my preference. It works if you want to get away from the "typical" activities you do on the strip.I have to give this place only three stars b/c most of their food is quite bland to me.  Personally, Panera Bread kicks their ass all day but we don't have Panera in the valley, sadly.  I do like this place for namely three reasons: the fire roasted tomato soup, the walnut chicken salad sandwich and the chocolate chip cookies they give you when you order food!   I do try new things on the menu but seem to find myself let down.   All in all most locations are clean. 

I am still dreaming of a day when Panera Bread comes to the Valley!I'm always really hesitant to review places that are literally across the street from ASU West (where I take classes and work) because I worry that my opinion of the business is skewed by its convenience, but to hell with parliamentary procedure, I've got to russle up some FUC's!

At the computer lab at West we have a whole drawer of our office dedicated to take out menus. It is as expansive as it is useless, because the answer is always "something Asian". The only times we've ever used one of the many pizza menus we have is when our bosses offer to buy us lunch, because we fear letting them know what food we really like will give them some sort of power over us. 

So yesterday John S (who is Clarice's boyfriend but was my +1 for the yelp event, what's with that?) and I were doing our usual lunchtime shuffle, passing around menus for Chen Wok and Fu-Sing Garden. We came across a menu for Pho Avina. We initially saw the word "pho" and collectively agreed that Pholicious sounded like a brilliant idea, but we were looking for takeout and the staff at Pholicious is so awesome to me on a regular basis that I'd hate to dis them by walking in, giving them an order, and then loitering outside while they made it for me. 

Thankfully, John solved my culinary quandary by mentioning that he really liked the boba at Pho Avina. The last time I had boba I liked was at a Quickly! in the bay almost two years ago. The Lollicup near my house, which was promoting itself as if it's shit didn't stink but had weird, unpredictable hours and always managed to be "out" of boba whenever I was really craving it. So Pho Avina it was.

Ordering was only a minor travesty. The restaurant is so tiny and compact that the only place to put their register/takeout counter is right next to the path of the servers, so in the couple of minutes it took us to place our order we managed to obstruct every other employee working there. Thankfully, despite the complaints of my fellow yelper girls, I wear heels about 90 percent of the time, which makes me I'm easy to spot and never surprise someone turning a corner. If they run into me it's because they're jerks and want to see if I'll say "excuse me" and give away my gender. Puny non-yelpers. The mighty Jetta is not fooled by your nonsense.

We spent the fifteen minute waiting period out and about the strip mall, reading The New Times and visiting the nearby gaming store which I'm going to yelp anyway despite not buying anything. 15 minutes isn't a bad waiting time for egg noodle soup and boba. I've waited longer for a cheezburger and shake. Oh jesus, did I just spell "cheeseburger" with a z? I know I should correct it, but I feel compelled to leave it there. the internet has permanently fucked my cognitive language skills. 

I ordered the #41 (egg noodle, shrimp, crab, calamari) and a coconut boba. John ordered the old school "beef and rice noodle" pho and a taro boba which he could not describe the flavor of and whenever asked how it was or how it tasted kept thrusting it in my face and telling me to try some. The sense of urgency in his voice didn't compel me to want to take that leap.

The takeout arrangement was both clever, convenient, and troublesome. In our bag were two styrofoam cups of soup, little baggies of warm noodles, and a ziploc of cilantro, sprouts, peppers, and limes. While this made taking our lunch back to the office quick and easy, it did cause some problems in unloading its contents. The noodles, while still warm, were beginning to stick to each other and solidify, which made stuffing it in the cup of broth rather difficult, especially when the noodles didn't separate once submerged. The portions of noodles were relatively small, and I ended up having to put in handfuls of sprouts just to adequately fill the cup, which itself was modest at best. I know I would've gotten more if we had ordered dine-in. 

I don't mean to sound like another one of those portion-obsessed Americans, but with work and school and Aramark's price-gouging at our cafeteria, my lunch has to hold me over for the whole day. And this didn't work out for me.

The food (what little of it was there), was actually quite tasty. The squid was chewy, the crab meat tasted real, and the two shrimp that were in there were pretty massive. The broth was hands down the best part. I could drink a whole bowl of that shit. But won't. Because too much sodium is never fun.

I realized waaaaaay after the fact that what we had ordered was not in fact boba milk tea but in fact "snow bubble milk tea" (i.e. frozen boba). The pearls were frozen solid and hard to chew and more than one my straw did the "McDonald's Choke" where the contents became so cold they would not submit to the vacuum I was creating. Eventually I just let it sit on my desk for a half hour where it melted and was then delicious.

[Joke about how lesbians aren't as good at sucking things as other people has been omitted. Yay self-censoring!]Very different building. Cool vibe. Food was good but pricey for what you get.Been here multiple times before. The most important memory: first time I ever had creme brûlée.

This restaurant is located in the Planet Hollywood Mile of Shops or formerly Aladdin hotel. It's strategically situated in the middle of that long streak of overpriced shops. All that walking gets my buddies and I hungry. What do we do? Eat at One Ocean.

The restaurant actually doesn't have many walls. Instead, large window spaces make the restaurant feel more open and spacious. A nice touch.

Environment: the open feeling of the restaurant is very welcoming. The place never really feels crowded although because of it's location and the setup, it's always loud. If that doesn't bother you, then have a seat and take a look at the menu. The decor fits the personality of the restaurant which is trying to pull off a casual but sophisticated look.

Waiters/waitresses: Our waitress did not go above and beyond the call of duty. She only came to our table to take our order, drop off food, drop off the bill, and pick up the bill. This was probably the worst part of this particular dining experience. Otherwise, there is nothing that really stands out about this employee.

Food: had the half pound sirloin steak burger. The patty was cooked medium well (no pink) and was covered with melted provolone cheese. In addition, it was topped with the normal staple of lettuce, tomato, and raw red onion slices. All together, this was pretty tasty. It had the distinct flavor of a home made hamburger prepared with fresh beef. The restaurant was a little stingy with the steak fries. It didn't look as if they were seasons but a hint of garlic was evident.


Drinks: only water. Sorry.

Recommendation: EAT!This is a casual restaurant with patio seating in the Miracle Mile shops.  We came here for the $5.99 lunch specials.  I had the blackened tilapia and my husband had the buffalo chicken wrap.  Both were good, especially for the price.  Our server, Carlos, was very attentive and came by several times to check on us.  If you're looking for a cheap place to grab lunch, this is a great option.Came here on Friday to celebrate a friend's birthday.  I didn't stay long.  I had an OK time and at the moment, other places really suaded me otherwise.

The place is dark and filled with Asian decor and influence.  It's located in the middle of a Chinatown strip mall with one of my favorite Pho restaurants, Pho Kim Long.  I was baffled as to why there was bouncer, since we were the only reason the place was busy.  There's a bunch of couch seating in the back creating an intimate setting for a small party.  Unfortunately there was no food and I was super hungry :(

The bar was filled with TVs and LOTS of seating.  There was also a DJ there doing Karate Karaoke which helped liven up the crowd.

I had an OK evening.  Unfortunately that might not be enough for me to consider this place in the future.  Chinatown is filled with little jems and I don't really consider this place on that list.  If you're looking for a venue to hold a party and not looking to get an upfront charge to save the space, maybe this place is perfect!I love this place! There are a few items on the menu that aren't very good, however, that's why my rating is average. And I'm Filipina. 

I would order the cheaper 6-piece bucket, it's more worth your money! Split it between your family or something. I love the chicken, the sweet potato fries, and the banana langka dessert pie--much better than the peach mango, in my opinion. Jollibee is pretty satisfying for Filipino fast food, I'm likely coming back, I'm way too Filipina not to.I saw this place on PBS "Check Please, AZ" and decided to give it a try.  It's in a corner of a little strip mall and you can sit outside if you like.  I'll just say "it's OK".  We ordered the breakfast brioche egg sandwich and a cinnamon roll.  The brioche bread was very fresh (so soft it felt like you were eating air).  Although I liked the sandwich, it could have used something . . . some salt and pepper perhaps?  It just didn't taste like much.  The cinnamon roll itself was good, but had way too much frosting for our liking (it was swimming in frosting and we had to scrape some off).  And I wish it had some walnuts.  The service was good and prices were reasonable.  But I agree with some of the other yelper's . . . stop using plastic plates (not good for the environment).  I don't think I'd drive out of my way to come back.Very, very nice and customer friendly owners gets this place 3 stars, but on food alone I give it 1.5 stars.  Though it's nice to have a Korean place so close by, Jun's House food isn't what real Korean food should taste like.  First, shitake mushrooms should be reserved for just a few dishes since they're so pungent.  However, Jun's seems to place it in many dishes (including the yuk-hae-jang, or beef and veggie soup) which is a big big BIG mistake.  Instead of a spicy, savory soup, all you taste is shitake mushrooms.  The banchan (side dishes) are subpar as well, esp. the kimchi (bland and sad).  And don't get me started on the kimchi soup.  Using "raw" kimchi in kimchi soup is unheard of...I had no idea why it was so strangely sweet until I called my mother to ask.  And lettuce in the bibimbap?  Just weird.  But the BBQ is decent so if that's what you're looking for, Jun's shouldn't disappoint.  Jun's food made me grumpy and now I'm grumpier because I'm posting my first negative review.  Thanks a lot, Jun's house.So I'm not a HUGE coffee fan although I have started the foray into liking it more. I'm really more into it for the social factor (Imagine that...)

The Coffee Bean is a great place to come and chat with friends...I love to sit in the leather seats and have a Decaf English Breakfast Latte and a Bagel. I usually go with one of my good friends after we drop the kiddos off to school. 

Don't get too close to us though as we are knee deep in an argument over politics. She wears her vote emblazoned across her chest while I berate her for the hour or so we get together. We always leave arm and arm with a big hug though and usually have someone take our photo to update the caller ID in our phones. 

Who is wearing which shirt...Well I won't say of course but come down one day you'll see us there and then you figure it out...she's the tall gorgeous blonde, I'm the buxom depending on the day can't figure out what color my hair is :)well not that our experience was horrible but this gal must have been new she brought me the wrong breakfast she did not seam to know if toast came with my wife's breakfast, though she was very nice there was no offer of compensation for her and or the kitchen staffs screw ups and we did not get our side of fruit which is shown on the menu to come with our meals. the side of gravy i ordered was cold by the time my breakfast showed up the second time. 3 stars are being generousI like this mall, I do. There's downsides, like every mall, but it's cleaner than the Meadows, not as touristy as the Las Vegas Outlets (eh.. they keep changing the name on this one. I think it's gone from Bellz to Las Vegas Outlets now to Premium Outlets - South. lol), certainly not as pretentious or crowded as Fashion Show, and not subject to Las Vegas weather like the Premium Outlets (North? lol). 

There's gangs of teenagers roaming around, but they're really not a bother. The stores are a mixture of high end and regular ol' department stores. The food court is average, the place is generally clean. What can I say? Just average in my book, but convenient to my house and somewhere I'll go when I need something from the mall I can't get anywhere else. A-Ok.First off, I only review burgers.  Heard from my friend Yohan that this place had a pretty dang good burger so I went to verify with my non-burger loving mother again.  She ended up getting a salad this time and seemed to enjoy it.  My burger was pretty plain.  No frills.  That being said, the patty was seasoned enough so that it didn't need a lot of help in the condiments department.  That being said, while it was good, I don't think I would crave it unless I already happened to be in the Paris hotel and casino.

WHAT I ORDERED: 

Le POULET (salad) - 3/5 pretty tasty, but nothing spectacular

Le CLASSIQUE (burger) - 3/5 solid patty, adding a special sauce might push it to 4/5

Sweet Potato Fries - 4/5 how can you go wrong with these?

STAFF:
Exceptional.  Our waitress was attentive and genuinely sweet.

WAIT TIME:
No wait time Saturday around 6:30pm

PORTION: 
Hearty sized burger.

BANG FOR YOUR BUCK 
The portions and quality of burger match the price well.

WOULD I RETURN 
Probably notLike other reviewers have mentioned, try not to go on a Sunday if you have a groupon. This particular waitress didn't honor it and my friends who had the groupon didn't want to keep pushing it. Anyway, I had the veggie burger (wasn't really feeling in the meat mode) and it was pretty good. However would I pay $12 for that plus $5 for waffle fries again? Probably not. We just came here for my friends groupon and because they wanted to watch some games.We've eaten here several times over the past year.  We visited again on 3/29/2014 and were very disappointed to see that the menu had been changed... and NOT for the better.  Our favorite item was the kobe beef burger which was no longer on the menu.  After checking with someone, our server said they could still prepare one.  It was delicious as usual but I have to wonder just how long it will be available.  As for the actual menu itself, it was not clear and easily understandable.  Compared to their previous menu (still viewable on their web site), it's a major step backward.  The old menu very concisely laid out all the burger choices in a very easy to read format.  Another item of concern is the shakes.  If I understood correctly, all the shakes now contain alcohol.  I get the fact that this is a sports bar but this change is certainly not for everyone.Why the changes guys?

The food server was very good and extremely professional.  The atmosphere was very good as well.  This would easily have been a 5 star review except for the items noted.

As an aside, as Caesars Seven Star members, we have always been offered little sample size shakes on each visit.  That was a very nice touch and very much appreciated.  Alas, apparently this practice no longer exists.  Must be because of the alcohol.  

We'll try it again but a I have the  feeling that our days at Le Burger are coming to an end.Uh. I certainly wouldn't eat dinner here, but breakfast was fine and lovely. I chose from the benedict section and husband had the scramble.   Service was quick and friendly... probably should have walked over to Paris for some crepes but dammit, my feet hurt....  

The breakfasts surrounding us all appeared tasty and of good quality!  Of all things, what I enjoyed the most was the man enjoying a glass of what was probably scotch and breakfast.  I love Vegas.Ok for after clubbing food. Our waitress was happy and friendly.We ate here twice during our stay at the Planet Hollywood hotel.  The prices were more reasonable than the buffet or the steak house or Koi.  

Both times the food came out INCREDIBLY slowly!!!  The first time we ate there was late night after the 9:30pm Peep Show let out and there was nobody in the place.  This was on a weeknight too.  No excuse for it.  

The waitress couldn't have cared less that we were there.  She was not very friendly.  Left me with an empty soft drink glass for a long time.  

The second time we went there was around 11:30am.  It was busy.  Still took REALLY long time to get the food up.  This time though our waiter was great.  Bronson was his name.  He engaged us in conversation, made us all smile, and even laughed at my dad's jokes.  My husband is very picky with what he orders and Bronson was very patient with his indecisiveness as well.

The food itself was not bad.   I'd say average, but all and all I would have given this place a poor rating had it not been for Bronson.Every casino has their standard cafe and this is Planet Hollywood's.  The food choices were good, ranging from standard American dishes to Asian foods.  The sandwiches offer the best value being cheap and large.  Nothing fancy here, but one of the better casino cafe.Always excited to see a new place open, I tried this one the first week in.

Now granted, probably the first month of a restaurant opening is crazy until all of the kinks are worked out of it.  I do take that into account.

The first thing I noticed was that there was a huge line of people waiting to be seated, and half of the booths and tables were empty.  The teeny bopper hostesses (I have never seen three hostesses before, especially in the morning) were behind the counter chatting and talking badly about some of the customers.  In addition, there were lots of wait staff just hanging out in different areas.  Even if you're waiting for a table to serve, you probably shouldn't just stand there with your finger up your nose in the middle of the dining area.  At least pretend to be busy.

Finally, we were seated after a 20 minute wait.

The breakfast menu is pretty decent, various omelets, pancakes and waffles with a Hawaiian theme.  I had the Maui Jim's Crab Cakes Benedict.  Yeah yeah, I know, eggs benedict again?  I'm always in search of a good one.

The waitress was pretty nice, but the food was a little slow.  Seriously, eggs benedict shouldn't take long, if a kitchen is prepped properly, crab cakes or not.  The coffee was a little watered down too.

The hollandaise sauce tasted right out of a package, a little powdery gritty with a little too much lemon.  Trying to hide that package flavor eh?  One egg was slightly overcooked while the other one was extremely runny.  Er..not even sure how that could happen, they were the same size.  The crab cakes were nothing to scream about either.

Just a note:  If you ever want a bone in ham, you need to actually see the bone in.  Maui Grille's "bone in ham" is actually a processed piece of meat, and pretty pricey for fake meat.

So in conclusion, the food and service was average, and not really worth the price.  The smidgen of a plus was the design of the building.  The entire center of the restaurant opened up into a sun filled patio with a little water feature in the center. 

I may go again to try out lunch or dinner.  Maybe it's better then.Switch has some pricier menu items, but is pretty good happy hour/ brunch location.   Spacious patio in back, friendly servers, etc. .  Best things about this place: Froofroo drinks, Fruit, Fries, and Free Internet.    

Froofroodrinks:  Refreshing and cheap.  The Sangria and mojito- vodka cocktail that I cant remember the name of right now, are great.  They are 1/2 price druring happy hour, which I believe is before 6:30 pm....then beer is half priced.   Brunch on weekends -- $1 cocktails.  nice. 

Fruit:  Fresh fruit can be found in every section of the menu; sangria chicken sandwiches and salads (with grapes and feta) ... Berry Turkey Sandwiches..etc...  The drinks come with oranges and strawberries and grapes.  they should start infusing the fruit with liqour.  that would be even better.

Fries:  Switch has amazing fries.  Plump, seasoned and oven roasted potato wedges are a steal at 3 bucks.  They go great at the froofroo happy hour.

Free Internet: Also great for the froofroo drinks happy hour.

Sunday Brunch
I recently went to the brunch with my manfriend, mostly for the amazing drink specials.   $1 screwdrivers, bloodymarys and mimosas, oh my.  It lasts till 3pm, which is also a huge plus.  The brunch menu isn't too exciting, and, likethe rest of the menu, pricier than it should be.  Also, the proatoes tasted like they had been cooked 3 days prior.  


Overall, Switch is a great place to split food with someone and spend the rest on drinks.  Especially if it is 2:00 on a Sunday.prob should get 3 1/2 stars.

Liked.. not loved.

Very classy looking place. Swankie. Kind of place to bring a date, or your woman, or sig other, or.. whatever you got.

Liked the wall with the pillows.  Nice lighting. This place would get a 5 for the looks.

Food was ok.  Again liked not loved.  Had Calamari that was good. I had a pork chop with apricot glaze that was very good. My womans pasta was great.

I can't explain why this place should not get at least 4 stars. The service was a little slow, but I could care less about that.  I will always take great food over service... but this place and the food and everything was just missing something. Not sure what, but for me at least... the "it" feeling of love I have with so many restaurants just wasn't there.$5.95 for a 2 item combo plate with rice. You cannot substitute rice with pancit.  Additional entree is $2.95....

I had the Adobong Pusit and barbecue grilled chicken. It was pretty good, but Adobong Pusit had too much oil.  I prefer Filipino food with less oil, but kind of hard to find since fat and oil is part of the culture...

Kapit Bahay is in the same hood as my office, so I would come back if I feel too lazy to drive up the street to Nanay Gloria's, want to spend the same price as Nanay's AYCE buffet and prefer more oil.On the woman's side of the spa the attendants  were lacking and food and drink service was near non existent. They have no cafe or assigned pool waitress. If you want great service see Eugene and he will make sure you are taken care of.Stopped in here for breakfast this morning.  Place was not very busy around 7AM.  I got the special posted for the day consisting of 3 eggs, 1 each bacon ham sausage, hash browns (or home fries), toast (or biscuit).  Total with decaf and tax came to $9.83.

Good points:
I like the decor, especially the color scheme.
There was plenty of food for the price.
Josh gave me excellent service, most of the time.
There was not a long wait for the food and it was all hot.

Stuff that could use some work:
While Josh directly gave all his customers great service I do not think the whole dining room needed to know about the steak that was served way over done or what mess the closing shift left him, He should be a bit more discreet talking to the rest of the staff rather than shouting.
I was drinking decaf and there was no marker under the cup so the other waiter almost added regular coffee to my cup.

Overall it was an OK place to go.I've never STAYED at Bill's...although it does look like they've spiffed the place up since it was Barbary Coast.  I had been in BC a few times to play the cheaper tables over the years, but there wasn't any real draw for me to go there for any other reason.
Bill's probably wouldn't have any appeal to me either...but they made the smart move and hired Big Elvis.  If you haven't seen this guy you're missing out.  He's great.  Good interaction with the crowd and AMAZING voice.  He's still a big guy, but apparently he's lost a shit load of weight, and he talks about that quite a bit - very inspiring guy.  He plays 3 shows during the day on weekdays.  
Go check him out in the lounge.  Two thumbs up!  :)Went here a few weeks ago while visiting the Mesa area for business.  I was really hopeful that it would be the best, but it was just OK.  I got a Chicken Chimichanga with rice/beans and like I said, it was just OK.  The limeade was great, but the food left me looking for more.  We did get to sit outside in the 65 degree weather which was a nice change for me from 25 degree Utah at the time.  That was the best part for me.I'm not a huge club fan so I will say I probably won't give the best review.  Here it goes.  It's to damn DARK in this, walls, floor, doors, bar and stage all painted black.  Must of been a sale at Home Depot on black paint.  They also have nothing to deflect sound so the sound bounces off the bare black walls.  Unpleasant experience, except for a couple of years ago I worked for Taco Bell and their food truck sat in front and we passed out free food... now that was fun.  :-)  BTW, I don't work for taco bell so don't try and hit me up for free food.Lots of places to eat in this complex! That said, the theatre itself is so-so. My bad for going to see The Campaign on a Sunday afternoon at the end of its run: cue a group of seven 13-year-old boys who only got in on the whim of their parents' liberal parenting methodologies. 

If there's nothing I love more than gay/butt jokes, it's having them occur for a constant one-and-a-half hour stream, in a dark theatre, where it would be socially inappropriate to leverage physical disruption of their ability to speak. 

Managers, check in on your theaters every now and then. Spare your patrons the hypertension, or at least equip mature-looking audience members with tasers.It's a very spacious saloon with lots of TVs.  Probably a good place to watch the games on Sunday.  I've been in several times for takeout.  Service is always good.  Food quality is below-average, (not terrible, but just not up to the level of the typical pub grub).  Wings and onion rings are great.  They do have a punch card program that gets you a free meal after buying 4.Sushi, I'm sorry but I'm just not that into you.. Seaweed (yuck), raw fish (cringe), and huge bites at a time (gag).. but I digress.. 

My other half has a deep love for sushi (and most things Asian for that matter, haha) so I like to be a good sport and attend these all you can eat feeding frenzies whenever the suggestion is made; it's me compromising ;) 

Not located in the greatest parts of town, we entered the somewhat warm establishment. We were greeted right away and sat with a quickness. The server took quite a while taking our drink order and didn't express much in the way of personality. 

The music was quite eclectic, Asian techno, to indie music, to um..??? The decor was bland, much like the chicken dish I ordered but the cucumber salad was sort of redeeming really, how can you screw up cucumber salad anyway, right? 

The other half enjoyed one roll (I forgot which one) out of (I lost count), several and stated that a return visit wouldn't necessary be in the cards. Not that the food or service was so terrible, but that there are plenty of other, "better" choices out there for sushi. 

I give this joint 3-stars because it wasn't terrible and it was about as fantastic as an inexpensive sushi place could be to a non-sushi lover. 

Best part: cucumber salad and price 

Try it, or don't..whatevs ;)I've only been here one time, and they DO honor the 25% off with Nevada ID and LVH players card. (At least, they did in January.)

This restaurant is lovely...small and cosy, with kind of a romantic atmosphere.

I received my very own cast iron teapot for my hot tea, which was awesome. 

The pot stickers were tasty.

But what I LOVED was the Pacific Seafood Noodle Soup. 
Scallops, Sea Bass, and Shrimp in the most fragrant and delicate broth, with tender noodles...truth be told, if they ran out of the seafood pieces and only had the broth it had been in...I'd eat it.  

It was a great experience.  I'd go back, for sure.  My only complaint was that it was kind of chilly in the dining area...but it WAS January, and I don't think I had a sweater with me.Phoenix airport and the whoppers here are delicious!  Service without a smile sucks though.If I was voting on beer selection this place would be a 5. They have a large selection of reasonably priced drafts and they change weekly brining in new and different beers to try. 

I can also say most of the servers are very good. I come every week for trivia on tuesdays and the service is always good, nobody has any problem with splitting tabs for the 6 or so people we have every week. I never go long with out a drink or waiting to order. It is a very well run crew.

Now for the bad the food is very hit or miss and even the hits aren't that exciting. Since I am here on tuesdays I often get appetizers as they are half off. Some like the southwestern or apple/pear quesadillas are good and a solid amount of food. Others like the pizza wheels are barely edible. I have had some of the regular menu items and they often suffer from being bland or over salted. Some recommendations of mine on stuff to get include the california carver burger or pizza, the hummus appetizer, and the tatonka burger. 

Also costing them points is bad AC and that the bathroom may be one of the worst I have seen in an otherwise decent place. They have a horrible hand dryer that isn't high flow or hot and they don't have paper towels as an option. The door to the toilet doesn't have any lock and swings open on it's own.

If you want a place to have fun drinking and playing trivia you can do worse than here. Just be careful with the food selections and don't get your hopes up.It's out of my hood, but had to check it out anyway.  While waiting for a friend, I sat at the bar next to a gentleman that had recently been cut off.  Instead of asking him to leave, he hung around telling everyone how he had been cut off - and by everyone I mean anyone sitting at the bar and anyone that would answer his phone call. (He was obviously a regular - every bar has at least 1 of those, if you know what I mean)  I know the "you have 30 minutes to secure a ride rule", but his friends were there to take him, which means the 30 minutes does not apply.  Anyway, once I got a bartender's attention the service was good.  They were training someone new and she was very nice and polite.  

I was told to order one of the hot pretzels so that's what I did.  Holy CRAP!  The sauce was not what I was expecting....it was every better!  I didn't have time to try anything else, but I will be back with my friend to try some other items.  The pricing wasn't bad, there were sports on the TV and there is a smoking patio.  Coolest thing:  TV's in the booths!Average. Ordinary. Not bad but not special, and prices are in the 15 to 25 average. Overcooked shrimp, salty crab legs, OK fish fry. Service OK. I have had a better meal at Red Lobster. Sides are ordinary. And not special either. Red beans are watery and seemed like from a can, not Louisiana style. Very limited tap beer selection. Some decent wine prices by the bottle, by the glass expensive. Nothing special on the wine list.Well I had fun here but most people will think it sucks. I'll start with the negatives: It's small, older crowd, whatever music, expensive drinks (its at the Wynn).
Positives: Small and intimate, older crowd (you can actually be social), very low profile. 
Again, if your looking for the mega vegas experience and seek an uber-club, dont come here. If you're looking for a no frills experience, this is it.Food is sub par, but the drinks and patio are perfect.  Even on a semi-chilly March afternoon, being outdoors and out of the casinos is a much needed change of pace.

Four of us stopped in for an afternoon intermission that led to the remaining day and night's chaos.  If you don't want something too sweet, try the Honi Honi, a mix of bourbon and juices served in a cup illustrating some pretty interesting "positions".

If you want front row people watching, grab a seat at the edge of the patio and you can watch "America" walk right by.Jasmine Thai is just OK Thai food in my opinion.  My girlfriend thinks it's a lot better than I do.  I hadn't had Jasmine in awhile, so I grabbed a GC off of restaurant.com and we went there for dinner tonight.  We had to spend $35, so we ordered 2 appetizers: the crab rangoon (awesome) and the chicken satays (disappointing).  I had the pad thai, which I didn't find as good as Thai Taste, where I usually go.  My girlfriend had the pad se eu, and I tried it and liked that a lot better than my dish.  We also had a large thai iced tea to get us up to $35.  Good meal, yeah, but I'd personally rather go elsewhere for Thai.This restaurant was opened in 2007, in the height of the Vegas boom times and housing bubble, when pricesof everything was going up and up, and money was flowing easily. Million dollar condos going up everywhere, speculators betting on housing prices getting lucky more than rolling the dice at the craps table. IThe time was like rolling 11's consecutively and parlaying your bet....the odds were long (18 - 1, but pays 15 - 1) but it just kept coming in to pay. 

So a great Pho restaurant owning family from the Portland area, (they own several popular ones in the Pacific northwest) decided to roll the dice in Vegas, They spared no expense in the decor. It is decorated with all high end materials, with marble-like tables, 2 large flat screens, and a lot of quality to make a very clean and pleasant restaurant. The problem is, it is too far from the Strip, out on Spring Mountain a mile from the strip at Decatur in the A&M strip mall. And that long odds 11 crapped out, the housing bubble burst, and Vegas is hurting. 

One of the owners was the cashier the night I went, and she was very friendly and accomodating, asking what I wanted to watch on the flat screens.  We had a nice long talk after my meal about Vietnam, Saigon back then, where her family is from, now Ho Chi Minh city under the communists now. They own a restaurant back there, called Pho 99, at 139 Duong Nguyn Trai, Phuong Ben, Thanh Quan 1, T/P Ho Chi MInh, Viet Nam. There is one in Portland called Pho Hung.

I ordered my standard over the past year, Pho Tai Nam. The beef was good and the broth was, too. Plenty of fresh greens to go with it.

The price was more like glitzy Vegas, not the grungy pacific northwest.
Bonus: they accept credit cards, which most grungy dives do not.I really, really, really wanted to like this place. Really. In fact before I even knew much about it as a restaurant, every time I passed it in Mandalay Bay I thought it was so cool how they had this towering wine cellar. I loved the exterior decor and what little I could peek into the interior. Five years in the making and finally I got to eat here.

Sigh. Maybe I hyped it too much myself? It was, after all, a one Michelin star recipient. What went wrong? 

Well, for the most part although my meal didn't taste bad, it didn't taste particularly great. It wasn't fantastic. For the prices, it was only alright and not something I'd pay for next time. Most of their dishes were un-inspired and lacked the glistening luster of a one Michelin star place. The service was too casual to be consistent in my book and what kind of decent restaurant like this as DRY limes? 

They also don't ask you before re-filling your sparkling water, what if I didn't want to pay for another bottle?

The only dish that saved this meal from a complete lackluster of goodness was their daily inspirational preparation of foie gras. It was truly delicious with the sweet pudding bread that they paired it with. My chicken liver pate was almost tasteless which was very unexpected of pate, and my salmon dish was overcooked, dry and lacked any salmon flavor whatsoever. I even offered it to the rest of the table to share and they all agreed that it didn't taste like salmon at all. Their black cod was alright but then again ... cod as a fish is delicious and difficult to mess up to begin with. I was especially disappointed that although they had a fantastic wine selection that some top names other restaurants had were non-existent in their vast towering cellar of wines. What's the point if you're just going to stock it with 100 bottles of the same wine with no room for others?

Overall, it wasn't worth the money and I don't see how it was worth the Michelin star.It was fine.Typical outdoor Mexican place.Niceview of the strip from the upper bar where we sat.It was hot out that day and I was tired so maybe I wasn't enthused enough to enjoy it.Friendly folks and the Jager girls were out that day giving away free stuff if you bought a Jager shot.This place actually deserves 3 1/2 stars.  I went to the one located on Tatum Blvd.  It use to be some other kind of restaurant/game place before.  My husband and I met up with a big group that was visiting from out of town and it was great for that.  They have some good deal where you buy a dinner for a certain amount (i want to say $15.99, but don't hold me on it) and you get a $10 game card.  Not bad, especially if you have a lot of people into playing the games.  We also ended up in the bowling section and had a blast.  Wait staff good and attentive.  Also, a big plus about them...you don't feel like you're being police patrolled...or that someone is going to walk up to you in 5 seconds shining a light in your face with a Breathalyzer just because your on your second drink in an hour and a half.Their sandwich helped me transition quickly from "HUNGover" to food coma + Family Guy episodes.

It didn't taste very good, but it did the trick at a low price.So freaking average. We came here because of all the reviews. We waited in a super long ass line and had a little trouble finding it. All that to get to mediocre sandwiches. I did notice that 90 percent of the line looked like college students. Maybe because it was somewhat affordable is why so many people like it. Otherwise, I don't get it.???Earl of Sandwich is a good spot for a quick bite at all times of the day. The sandwich and the price were on point, but I don't think it lived up to the hype.Not understanding the rave reviews, but it is nice that they're open 24 hours. The sandwiches run about $7, and they're the size of your average Subway 6 incher with slightly more filling. Relative to other Strip food, this is still a bargain. Quality/taste reminded me of Quizno's - good but not 5 stars.Good but not great food.  Friendly service.  Fun place with nice location in Forum Shops.The food was ok. The service was mediocre. The location is a 5 star.It's been 4+ years since my last review of the place; I met friends here for dinner on Saturday night (11/2/13). 

Notes:
+ Full bar menu with decent selection of spirits
- Upcharge for asking for drink(s) with rocks. Additional $2 for ice in spirits

+ Service was excellent and prompt throughout the night
+ Staff was very friendly and accommodating, from front of house to server(s)

+ My friend was able to order something that wasn't on the menu; he wanted a simple spaghetti with red sauce, which they happily made and he reported as excellent
- They charged him $19 for it. Seriously? $19 for spaghetti????

+ Chicken salad was flavorful; lettuce & veggies fresh and crisp
- Very small amount of chicken - maybe 3-ounces
- Salad was $13

+ Pizza was good; Thai Chicken
- Pizza was small and expensive

Seeing a theme here? This place charges as though it was much better than it actually is. Yes, it's decent, but it's not as spectacular as the prices would suggest. The bill for our table of 4, with just one round of drinks was $110, without tip. I struggle with that...First of all, I will say it's not a real spa atmosphere when you walk through the doors. It looks like a hair salon.  When we walked in there My husband said, did you look this place up before you bought the groupon?. Honestly I didn't because I bought the wrong groupon. So we had no choice but to use it. I will say once I walked in the door to the massage room, it looked cozy and the smell of aromatherapy filled the room. I had a massage by Casey right after my husband so I figured she would be a little weak for another deep tissue back to back.  I will say she did get a few knots out and I feel better today but I felt like I got more of a Swedish than deep tissue. My husband said she was really good and enjoyed it because she took a few of his knots out too. I thought she was okay. Also make a note that you can't add services when you get there.  The lady at front desk said they are short staffed on Monday's so no one was there to do a pedicure.  Would I go back? Probably not because it's far from my house, but if I lived closer no because I like places that give you the real spa experience. I think you should try this place out using a groupon to see if you like it. Based on past reviews customer service has improved!S has been on Yelp searching cool places for me to try during my visit here to the Phoenix area.

Being away from home and wanting some comfort food, S suggested that I try Sake Bomber to get my sushi fix. The location was in close proximity to my hotel so I made arrangements for transportation to the restaurant. The staff at the front desk mentioned that the food there was pretty good.

So, let's put that into perspective...

I'm sure that there are many fine restaurants in the Phoenix area. When I'm visiting I love to experience restaurants (not chain) to get a taste of the local flavor. I'll have to say that SakeBomber is not the best representative of what Japanese food should be...

I arrived during happy hour and the wait staff was very friendly and accommodating. I had imagined that I might be able to catch up on some reading while dining - but this was not the case. A patron of the restaurant, who thought he was being funny, was loud and demanding more drinks from the server. The dark interior, dim lighting and thumping music wasn't conducive to a serene dining experience. 

Oh well, I was here to get my sushi fix. I'm thinking that I shouldn't judge on appearances and maybe, just maybe, the sushi would redeem the thoughts that were going through my head.

First came the gyoza and agedashi tofu. The gyoza was ok, but was very disappointed with the agedashi. I'm used to the agedashi dishes from Gombei or Hoshi's - piping hot chunks of creamy deep friend tofu, swimming in that wonderful sauce, covered with bonito flakes, grated ginger and radish. Instead I got chunks of barely warm firm tofu arranged on a platter with tempura sauce and sprinkled with a few green onions. I was hungry so, I ate it. 

I must admit that the salmon skin roll was the best deal of it all - 8 pieces of salmon skin nigiri with grilled asparagus and carrots. It was filling as well as yummy. I also had smoke salmon and hamachi maki. The fish was not the best I ever had, but I think that the sake I had during dinner helped the experience along with watching the snow boarding competition on the big screen TV behind the bar. 

I called the hotel shuttle to pick me up after dinner. I had to chuckle when the driver asked, "How in the world did you end up at SakeBombers?"

"You see," I told him. "It was like this..."open 24 hrs, wifi available.  standard pho, nothing spectacular but good enough.  broth on the mild side, noodles fair, meat scored 3 out of 5.  loud Vietnamese-language movies on the big screens all around.  very spacious, with solid furniture."The Place"

You've been "there" with me, haven't you?
You know the place.
The one you go to when you're tired, you're hungry, and there's nothing in the fridge.
You go there when you don't feel like shopping, and take-out or pizza just won't cut it.
So you hit your "go-to" joint.
You know the one.
It's close to home.
It's consistent.
It's reasonably priced.
And they know you there. 
Montana Meat is that place for me.
And I was in that "there" zone two nights ago.
Got my ass a 12oz rib-eye medium with onion rings/french fries, vegies and Scotch.
Scoped out some games on the multiple screens and was waited on to perfection by the dry-sense-of-humor barman.
I like their steaks and Kobe burgers, and the bacon-wrapped scallops hit the spot every so often. The salads are big and the drinks come quickly.
It's good to have a go-to place, me thinks.
Don't you agree?
:)This place is pretty good for a deli. It opens late, it might even be 24 hours because when we were there it was pretty late. We stayed at The Excalibur but the food options there were really sad so we ventured out to Luxor. 

I had the Bagel sandwich with Eggs and Cheese. Jesse had the Veggie panini. Big portions and they hit the spot. The only problem was they didn't put enough seasoning on our dishes. A little dash of salt & pepper will be nice. 

Prices are lower than I expected for Vegas. It's a great people watching spot because it's by one of the hotel elevators. We saw quite a bit of ladies with high heels and almost fell on their asses. Great late night munchies and entertainment for sure.This is your average small airport, its modernized so traffic flow is slick and services are smooth. Not a connections place but a fine starting or final destinationI'm not a fish fan, but the group I was with was, so as long as there's some non-fish on the menu, I'm fine with it.

It's a nice place, and the service was friendly and attentive. The cocktail napkins with incredibly corny fish jokes (where do fish borrow money? a loan shark) was kind of a fun addition.

I ordered a pasta dish which included chicken, peppers, and a creamy tomato-based sauce. It was good, but I don't know if it was $14 good. Prices went up from there for the various fish dishes, but I can't really judge those without trying them.

I've got no complaints, and I'd probably go back if I'm with people that want to go, but I think I can find similar quality food for me at about 4 or 5 dollars less for lunch.I came here for "easy hour" a while back with my ladies and what can I say...

At 5pm on a Friday, business was crazy busy!  We waited around for about 30 minutes before we were seated.  The wait time isn't so bad when you're guzzling pina colados and bloody marys with great company.  

When we finally were seated, we ordered two oyster samplers, the baja ceviche fish cocktail, a garden salad with Caesar dressing on the side[my friend is quirky like that], a hot seafood combo, and the macadamia nut crusted Alaskan halibut.  The oysters were delicious and the ceviche was refreshing.  The salad had ranch dressing poured all over it even though we had asked for Caesar dressing on the side.  When we asked our waitress about this, she apologized and said she'll bring us a new salad in 5mins which actually came out 20mins later after a reminder from my friend.  Oh well.  It's just salad and it *was* pretty busy.  The seafood combo was very flavorful and delicious but the biggest disappointment was the overcooked halibut.  I was most excited for the halibut so when I ate a fork full of dried fish, I was pretty sullen.

My overall experience with King's Fish House wasn't too bad but I think I'll just stick with drinks and oysters the next time I stop by.So I've been back several times and I've tried some other flavors and they do have a weird aftertaste, as in "blech, cough" I need some water to wash it off my mouth!

The tart flavors are pretty good and that's what I'm going to stick with from now on. Plus, is pretty inexpensive and instead of me filling a huge cup to the brim with yogurt, they do the portion control for me.The Beatles are my favorite group of all time, so I expected AMAZING! I had already heard the soundtrack a few times, so I was a huge fan of that specifically going in. I loved that George Harrison composed the whole complication and was super stoked to come. In fact, it was the sole reason I came to Vegas after having not been here since I was 11. I am now 34 and knew that The Beatles would be the only thing to make me go there as an adult. It's true, there seemed to be no bad seats and the overall ambiance was pretty cool looking. We sat like 7 seats from the stage. The shows performance did not match the soundtrack, however. It was lacking in many areas and beyond slow for at least 60% of it. The creepy as all get out little Beatles with blank faces was unnecessary and freaky and the Blackbird scene was probably one of the stupidest things I have ever seen. Totally took away from the beautiful song. There was nothing about the show that was worth $127! That is what the person who bought my ticket paid. It was worth about $80 and that;s what I would pay if I ever went again. I would also never sit near the stage again because I do not enjoy massive sheets dragging over my head for 5 minutes, which is what happens if you sit near the first 20 rows or so. If you went in with a hair style, you will leave those rows void of one. 
Go for the soundtrack and overall show, but don't pay more than $80. 
5 stars for the soundtrack and 3 for the performances.Food is maybe slightly above average in my opinion.  I have always had great service, however.  Reliable place to go if you're in the area.  It makes my husband's trips to Fry's Electronics across the street more tolerable for me.  Last time we went, we were seated in a separate building on the other side of the patio.  Was very nice and relatively quiet.  I'm not overly fond of the patio since Baseline is so busy.

I do prefer the Aunt Chilada's on Dreamy Draw-both the food and the atmosphere.  But I'm sure I'll be back to this location again.  Damn computer geeks.If you can get in for cheap, like less than $30, and got nothing else to do, then it's OK and entertaining.  The girls are not that hot.  But it's cheaper than other forms of topless dancing...  

I did like the bungee dance.  

My show's comedian was so so.  People laughed a little, but most of it was make up on the spot, about where people are from, etc.. basic stuff.It's all about perspective: if this is your first time staying in Las Vegas or 1st time staying in one of the nicer hotels, you will think that the Palazzo is awesome.  Yes, you get the multiple flat screen televisions, decent beds, marble bathrooms.  On the other hand, if you have stayed at the Wynn or the Bellagio, you will be disappointed.  For a Girls' Weekend Getatway, 10 of us chose the Palazzo (prestige) because it offered all suites. We, of course, wanted to have a great time, common areas where we could all commune in (drink, dance, do makeovers, whatever).  The layout of the Bella suites is odd in that you walk into and through the bedroom to get to the living room. I've never seen that before. That wasn't a big deal though.  The two things that are hilarious / annoying is the technology.  Evidently, when the last Holiday inn closed down, the Palazzo ran their cheap asses down to the auction to buy all of that hotel's old crap.  The telephones in the room will qualify as antiques. No exaggeration (will post pics).  There is also a huge, 1980-style fax machine for your use. No huge deal--with a shot or two of tequila, they came a huge running joke. BUT--the big deal for us was that there is no place to plug in your Ipod.  I travel a lot. Even the basic hotels, now have an alarm clock that you can set your ipod on. They have a spot for you to play a CD --really? a cd? hell, why not an 8-track? It's 2012 folks at Palazzo. 30% of people Nationwide use ipods.That statistic is even greater when you just factor in people who take at least one vacation per year.  An ipod dock is a standard amenity that travelers have come to expect--particularly travelers who are possibly coming to party with friends.  To their credit, the Palazzo was nice enough to allow us to rent a huge boombox for $35 a day. So, on top of our $469 room, we had to add $35 a day to be able to listen to a little Rhianna while we got dressed to go dancing at night.  David, the manager with whom I spoke at the Palazzo thought that this was absolutely fair.  Really, David? Penny-wise, pound-foolish, my friend: we had 4 suites, 9 women who come to Vegas twice per year--better customer service could've meant repeat business. But hell--you got your $70.00. 

Remember, your first or second apartment, where you are just trying to 'make do?"  You take your parent's old tv from the basement, your older sister's old stereo system until you can save enough money to get some new stuff. That's how the Palazzo felt. The room was decent enough, the amenities, seemed as if during a budget meeting, some bigwig told the IT department that he had to 'make do."  So some poor middle manager was spent hours on ebay and at hotel auctions trying to 'make do.'  I, as a frequent visitor to Vegas will tell you that there are far better choices than the Palazzo.  There are many hotels that aren't trying to 'make do' and won't ask you to either.All I have to say is Fried Chicken!  So 'effin good.
The butter & cheese corn.  How could that be bad?!
The beer was too warm, but tasty otherwise.
Atmosphere was decent.  I'd go back...After seeing La Piazza al Forno consistently listed in the Valley's top pizza joints by numerous outlets, I decided to try it out before an event on the West side.

My friend and I arrived around 6:30 on a Wednesday evening expecting a dinner crowd, but to my surprise there was only one other table of guests!  I have to say, you cannot beat the wine prices - $5-9/glass.  We shared a spinach salad, which was so-so.  Next, the Margherita D.O.C. pizza with carmelized onions.  Unfortunately, the onions weren't carmelized, just slightly cooked.  I'm not sure if there was a mix-up in the kitchen or somebody back there doesn't know what carmelized onions are...  I felt like the bottom of the pizza was a bit soggy in contrast with the charred crust edges.  The flavors were there, but the execution could've been improved.  We couldn't resist the zeppolis (pillows of fried dough covered with powdered sugar - see pic) for dessert.  So good!  

Overall, we were content with the food and the fast service.  I think La Piazza al Forno is a solid choice for pizza in the Glendale area, but did not make my Top 5 Valley Pizza Joints.Not bad. While the wifey and I only tried breakfast, the rest of the menu looked interesting (like Salmon pizza). It was fairly decent, I feasted on the Eggs Any Style breakfast and the misses ordered the smoked salmon bagel sandwich. The smoked salmon was a hit and the Eggs any style was just as you would expect. The eggs any style comes with homestyle potatoes (good stuff!), meat and toast...pretty fulfilling. Prices are high, but you should expect it for the convenience and city location.

Update: 1/24/11

I recently revisited this deli and I'll keep it at three stars.  They took the Salmon Bagel sandwich off the menu, but now offer it in a DIY boxed version which is still good! My kids had the french toast which I sampled and it was awesome! It came with white chocolate additions and a really good whip cream topping! This french toast is a must have!!!!I went here for happy hour today.  The bartender was very attentive. I ordered shrimp and crawfish fondeaux and catfish beignets. I also ordered a large swamp thing to drink. The swamp thing was really good. The catfish beignets were delicious. I didn't love the fondeaux though. First of all it had mushrooms in it and I hate mushrooms. But also the shrimp tasted like dirty dishwater, which is not unusual for shrimp in my opinion, but that ruined the fondeaux for me. Overall my experience was A-Ok.I like no extra charges for ANYTHING pickles, pepper, onions etc."Six Schlitzes please".
Funny looks all around.
"Uh, an appeltini then".

It's kinda like that.

Cheers

Total:  $42Well I heard the food was good here so a couple friends and I decided to give it a shot. 

We had sat down and got situated. We started off by ordering some fried pickles and they were a lot better than expected. Can't say the same for the worthless biscuits that they only gave us 2 of. 

Well then after waiting a bit we got our food. But after a wave of servers went around trying to figure out what goes to what table. Is this their first shot at the restaurant business, is there no order to what food goes where. 

Upon getting our food, seemed our expectations were just too high. It was good but nothing spectacular. The food must have sat under a heat lamp for some time, our gravy was dried, my meat was dried out. 

All in all I would say go just a little further for a better place with better service at Famous Dave's. The service at Lucille's is just not on par. The servers are under trained and just can't handle the load.It was just okay.  I think this was the first time one of our locals had been here where the service for a large party was less than exceptional.  I think they were just a little unprepared for a group of 16 that evening.  

The Texas-style BBQ briskly was good, but a little dry.  The brisket DID have the perfect smoke ring!  The spicy BBQ sauce was my favorite from the three available, but a little too sweet. The veggies that I chose for my side were overcooked.  

I had the Lucille's Amber Ale, and it was very tasty.  I thought that the drink menu was impressive.I do not usually like to rate chain restaurants as the experience is quite typical. However, I was quite unsatisfied with my experience so I thought I would share. I was frequenting the restaurant for a work meeting and we were hoping to be seated near an outlet. As we approached the hostess stand I asked the hostess as to whether or not they had Wifi and outlets. The hostess simply stated that she did not know and she did not bother to find out. We sat in the bar for happy hour, my drink was okay and the food was okay; not worth more than the happy hour price of course. The server was nice and somewhat attentive (she is the reason for the 3rd star). As we left the hostess as the stand walked away as we were not worth a simple good-bye. 

Hey, hey, hey ..goodbye.It was decent. Nothing more, nothing less. Went with girlfriend and her friend on his recommendation on a Sunday evening. I ordered the Epicenter and it tasted nice enough but wasn't anything special. I would say the best thing about the SanTan Brewing Company was their unique beer glasses. I wonder how many of those get stolen on a regular basis...

Food-wise, the girlfriend and I shared a "Windy City" pizza, while her friend ordered the buffalo wings. I tried one of the wings and it was good, but good is how I would describe average buffalo wings. Short of overcooking or forgetting to apply the sauce, they're kind of hard to screw up.

The pizza, however, was pretty bad. The only thing that saved the dish was requesting a side of their ranch. It wasn't regular ranch... really wish I knew what it was because I would love to have some of that at home, whatever it was. So the delicious ranch helped me finish eating what we had ordered, but otherwise it was a very bland pizza.

I won't throw out the cliched "tasted like cardboard," but I will say that it was the most forgettable pizza I've ever had that didn't come from a frozen food section. If you're going to name a pizza "Windy City," it better be a damn good pizza. This wasn't.

If friends wanted to go, I wouldn't mind going back and trying something else (presumably something recommended in a Yelp review) but I certainly wouldn't suggest returning if it were my choice; I'm usually much closer to Four Peaks and they blow this place out of the water.I ate here because I had the 2 for 1 dinner coupon. The food is pretty good but the selection was very limited. For $25 per person is too much. I ate at Spice Buffet at Planet Hollywood and that was $27 per person and there was a lot of selection. So for $2 more I rather go to Planet Hollywood.My first time here , we were seated right away,  it's very noisy, so good for groups but not for romantic dinners,  it did tend to be less noisy as the night went on, the sushi was delicious and totally worth the price, in fact it was a steal , all u can eat off the menu, with exception of sashimi , I will definetly be back.
It's perfect for a large group, and especially for those with big appetites and those who want to try everything off the menu..
They do offer teriyaki which is tasty for those who do not like sushi...Their salad bar here is lacking. I used to go to Whole Foods when I was too lazy to make anything to eat, but didn't want to be riddled with guilt about eating out. 

The people who work here are friendly and they have a huge selection of canned veggies for salads, as well as other specialty items that may be harder to find out here.

They also carry the largest selection of Amy's Organic frozen foods that I adore. mmmmm tofu pockets...Of all the places to drink in Vegas we ended up here twice mainly due to proximity.  The service is a little random but if you are staying in the Luxor this is a good place to have a drink at a reasonable price, drinks are under 10 and beers 5.  

The lighting is cool but that doesn't make up for the ugly people.  What would one expect from the Luxor? You get what you pay for. 

On my next trip to Vegas you will find me eating hotdogs and drinking dollar beers at Excalibur.If I was to title this review, it would be "Time to Freshen up".  When people go to Mastro's they expect first class service and food.  In my experience, they just did an okay job at both.  My fiancé proposed to me at home and then had reservations at Mastro's for dinner that night. It was a big evening for us (obviously) and he wanted to make sure we celebrated.  He spent so much time and effort planning the proposal that he didn't even think to look at the menu for vegetarian options.  He assumed that they would have some... well they didn't.  My only option was to order side dishes individually or they would give me a platter of 4 smaller sized sides.  Side dishes are not a meal, with the level of chefs they have working in this restaurant they should be able to put a composed dish on the plate.  While my side dishes were good, I will never go back.  Vegetarians, Vegans and Gluten-Free diners should have at least one option on every menu (A salad and sides does not count, that is what we order in addition to our meal).  Ten years ago, a restaurant could get away with this, but not now. But,  I am not going to totally bash the food, because the butter cake was to die for, but that is definitely not enough to make me want to go back.  

Okay, now for the service.  Let me just say that we waited 5 minutes to be greeted, then another 5 minutes to place our drink order... and then another 5 minutes for our drinks.  Not exactly "wowing" the customer from the start. Our server was nice, but overall the service was slow. It was the day before thanksgiving, so they may have just been understaffed.  At the end of the meal we waited at least 10 minutes after we were finished with desserts and drinks for the server to come around again so we could ask for our check.  

After reading this review, you may wonder why I even gave them a 3? Well it is Mastro's, they do have a great ambiance and my hottie said his steak was amazing.  If they want to stay relevant with all the great dining popping up in Old Town, they need to freshen up their food menu, narrow down their cocktail list to real "specialties" and put more attention into the customer's experience.after 1 visit

ambience B+ loved the decor, however, the lighting was quite dark. it was hard to see anything. 

service B+ i would have given pin kaow an A, however, they over-killed on the table touches. i think we had 5 people check on us in the matter of 5 minutes. 

food B+ i enjoyed the dishes, but it didn't make me say, "wow, this is REALLY good."

chicken satay
the chicken was grilled perfectly. the peanut sauce (most likely an authentic sauce), fell a little flat on my palate.

tom ka koong
lemon grass soup with coconut milk, galanga root, mushroom, and shrimp
great in small doses. i could only eat one small bowl, because it was a rich and slightly sour broth. the sourness wore on me at the end of one bowl. that same sourness is why so many people love this soup. it's just not for my palate.

roasted rice beef
beef, cabbage, roasted rice, thai basil and spices
roasted rice is a new concept for me. basically, it is crushed rice that has been roasted and scattered on the beef. interesting texture and a great experience. but not my favorite dish. 

chicken yellow curry
delicious.

overall: B+
hope to be able to visit this place again. sample some other dishes i've never sampled before.Rose and Crown pub has become a Tuesday and Thursday staple for me. Industry night meant for the cool cats, hip hangers on, and other laborers in the so called "industry" (meaning food service) is a great late night reverse happy hour. You can get a $2 well, $3 draft, 1/2 off appetizers, and free pool. EVERY night a letter is randomly selected and written on a chalkboard if that letter begins your last name you are treated to a 25 cent drink! Now "random" I will also call into question so those pals of yours that have names that start with S's or really common names, y'all are out of luck/ they might draw those letters on slower nights. Luckily for me the "T" has been quite frequent popping up and surprising me with the gift of a wonderful well cocktail or draft for a quarter!

Like any good ol' pub, it slangs typical bar food which I have had one wing and not been impressed enough to continue eating. What really makes this place THE PLACE to be is the excellent vibe. The bartenders are funny, personable, and are super attentive which makes it just a generally relaxed place to shoot the sh*t and enjoy the patio misters. The varied seating outside that includes high bar tables, low tables, and the picnic benches allows you to fluctuate with the crowd you convince to come and drink the night away. Also, if you are feeling like a casual DJ you can pay for the high tech jukebox sound system and play some tunes on the great sound system.

All in all, a solid place especially for those deals if you wanna celebrate "Turnt Up Tuesdays" or "Thirsty Thursdays". Chat with the bartenders and Evan, the cook, they are all great people to get to know.I would return for the beer and bar but not the food. It's hard to find an authentic British pub fare in Phoenix. The fish was tough and there seemed to be a layer of water between it and the crust. It was the first time I heard my dad complain about anything in a restaurant .The manager did try to right things by taking it off the bill. The shepherds pie was average. The asparagus served with it was delicious. Is this a normal side dish in Britain ? While the atmosphere - an old house- was cool, We wished we would have passed this by.Lot of pre-made slices lingering in the display area just waiting to be reheated.  I didn't get the feeling I would be eating a fresh slice unless I arrived right at the opening.

A lot of places have the 2 slices w/drink, but most do not end up being $6.22 with tax.  Normally you can get this combo for $5 tax included.

NY mural on the main wall, and certainly has the NY pizzeria feel to it.  Red & White checkered tablecloths, garlic knots, etc.  Hard to find the first time because the mini shopping area is tucked away off the road.40/40 has potential.  Maybe it was just the night that we were there, but my friends and I didn't really enjoy it.  We got in quickly, but then only stayed for a little bit because of the music...it was SO LOUD.  I don't mind it when the music is cranked up, but this was uncomfortably loud.  Like, feel- the-tip-of-your-nose-vibrate loud (no, I'm not making that up).  Make-you-nauseated loud.  "I want to leave NOW" loud.  So yeah, we left.  

I think it would be an awesome place to watch a big game, though.  They have huge screens everywhere, and a big VIP area with stadium seating (at least, I think that was VIP).  I imagine it would be a lot of fun for the Super Bowl.This review is for their conference center only, not the hotel.

Can I just first say, turn the AC doooooooown! I know it was 100+ out, but that doesn't mean I want to be a frigid 63. Not to mention...wouldn't they save money by not blasting the AC so much?  I digress.

I was here for a local workshop/conference for 4 days and we were given full breakfasts and lunch for those 4 days. I had to make sure to write this review in order to say how much I loved their stuffed chicken. It was served to us and normally meat is so dry or undercooked for things like this. But this stuffed chicken was perfect! Juicy. Tender. Soooooo dang tasty! StAte lunch here with my sister on Friday.  The patio was well shaded and so not too hot but it felt a bit cramped even though not all the tables were full.  Lots of items on the menu sounded good but we ended up with the vegetable pizza (we added chicken).  Even though this was on the menu as a starter, we actually split it for our entrée and also ordered a crab cake appetizer to share.  (Full disclosure, she is a very light eater and I was not too hungry that day either).  The crab cake was nothing to write home about but we both really loved the pizza.  It was extremely tasty.  I also loved my ice tea.  I can't remember what it was called, but it had a very complex flavor to it.  I tasted hibiscus and mint with a hint of chocolate.  My sister had a glass of white wine which was fine but I was surprised by how much their wines by the glass were.

The service was spotty as the other reviewers have mentioned.  Our server was friendly and knowledgeable of the menu but it was a long wait for the food and check.  He also completely forgot about my ice tea refill until I flagged him down.  I understand that you won't have flawless execution in a small local joint like this but considering that our bill came to $30 for what was basically drinks and apps (and at lunch time, no less!) I would expect more.Food is good. Atmosphere is good. Service is poor. It could be the location, but the wait time is ridiculous.So I have this thing for AYCE sushi. Sure, the quality isn't is as good as a regular sit-down spot, but I'd rather get my money's worth. And considering it was $24.95, you bet I was gonna stuff myself. All you Henderson residents should be aware that its just down the 215, so there's no need to go deep into Vegas itself for places like this. 

The place is rather small, and it was actually kinda packed for a Tuesday night. Thus, the people I went with were not allowed to sit at the bar because that section was already full. Service was pretty good though considering it was busy. Our waitress came by often to get us more water or take more orders for the all-you-can-eat dinner. If I remember it right, sake bomb shots were $2. Keep in mind it comes in a glass with the beer already. 

Their salmon nigiri is pretty decent, and I'd usually get that with every order I made. I also enjoyed the yellowtail nigiri because the place I normally go to in the Bay Area doesn't have it. Noteworthy rolls include the Mauna Kea, Mt. Charleston, and the spicy Mexican. Had a rainbow roll as well, but yeah it was just like any subpar rainbow roll. Do yourself a favor and get the tempura ice cream for dessert. It's pretty damn awesome, so save room for that. Yeah. I'd go again, but I'd like to try something else too.TGI Fridays was on my radar as soon as the Las Vegas Wranglers kicked Colorados A*% @ the CMYE Hockey party. GO WRANGLERS..WOO HOO! 

Just having stadium nachos and three beers during a 3 hour game was definitely, not the end of my dinner plans for the night. My wife and I rushed over as soon as the game ended and sat in the bar. Our server was Ricky. He's a low talker for sure, but very nice, and knew what to say and when to say it. Fridays is just like every other commercialized restaurant around the universe. Old records, pictures, random rowing oars hanging on the walls, and constant striped patterns everywhere you look (probably even on the toilet seat covers). But they do have one thing that I was super stoked to see. They have a bell that you are supposed to ring if you received excellent service. Now, when I see a bell, all I want to do is ring it.....hard! I was hoping Ricky, would be killer in the service game, so I could ring that bell. Fingers were crossed.

To start out, my wife really wanted the "Loaded Potato Skins"(refer to pic), which I have never had before, anywhere. So I figured, alright, I'm down. They weren't exactly "Loaded", or very good. Bacon, yes, is always good on everything, BUT.. the thing they go on still has to have flavor! It can't just be some semi-soggy, piece of cardboard. Anyways, no bueno on the skins. 

For our entrees, we both ordered the "Jack Daniels Chicken Sandwich"(refer to pic). The sandwich looked good, and came with (over)seasoned fries. The sandwich alone was pretty bad, but when you drizzle the delicious Jack Daniels BBQ sauce all over, it becomes pretty tasty! Not amazing by any means, but good. The fries that came with were just way over seasoned. They were so salty, I found myself shaking each one, trying to knock off all the seasoning, before attempting to eat them. During this ongoing battle with my food, Ricky brought both of us refills, made some small chat, and ended with a smile. I'm not big on complaining about food, and figured it wasn't that big of a deal at the time. 

For dessert we had the Chocolate Caramel, and Pecan Explosion (forgot the name, but thought this sounded awesome)(refer to pic). This dessert was actually very good. It put a nice, big smile on our face's. The chocolate brownie was topped with vanilla ice cream, and chopped pecans. Very moist brownie, covered in rich, flowing chocolate sauce. Nomnom.

Before we left, I had to ring that bell. Ricky was a good server, and I went for the bell. Let me tell you..., it felt so good to ring that bell, I would go back just for that feeling again. All-in-all, bell ringing is amazing and everyone should have a good bell ring daily. Head to Fridays for your bell fix today.$1 margaritas, $1 tacos, $2 tequila shots and $2 draft beers, can't go wrong with prices like that! For those prices you're not getting gourmet food but the tacos aren't bad either. The chips & salsa is $3 and is bottomless, the waitress actually offered to box the leftover chips for us to take with us too. 

I wouldn't make a special trip to go here but if you're near Bally's it's a place to get some decent CHEAP food and drinks!I can't really say too much about this place since I only had drinks, and that was a mojito, which isn't my favorite drink. I did have a strawberry mojito which was actually really good. My friend had a coconut mojito and she loved it. The specialty menu shows mostly mojitos so I think its kind of a niche for them.How the hell am I gonna rate a fabric store? I have noooo idea. But, Rickie, fashion designer extraordinaire, knows fabric stores. Like I know Calphalon from Falseaphlon. Or Safeway Vodka from Grey Goose. Or American from Velveeta. Ok. I didn't say I was classy. Just that I know. Remember that. Anyway, big problem with Fabric Depot and Supplies isn't the nicely appointed restroom complete with HUGE can of Lysol and weird vase of baby's breath. Or the strange location. I'd have to say Fabric Depot and Supplies, if I may, that you're biggest problem IS YOUR MISGUIDED NAME.....It should be Upholstery Fabric Depot and Supplies. Very few bolts (yea, bolts, I know the terminology). Lots of heavy, I wanna cover my 80s Ottoman, fabrics and very few I wanna make an a line skirt with a lace halter top, kinda stuff. Store is very organized and nice, helpful staff. If only they'd had lace. Maybe I'd be wearing that cocktail number I mentioned instead of these old Nike sweats and my Every thing's Bigger in Texas T shirt.I can't give this place an additional half star! booo!! But i would give it a 3.5 stars.

i honestly expected a bit more out of this place.. intimate? not really... There was just a girl in lingerie in a windowed room repeating her routine every like 20 minutes.. she puts on her makeup.. she reads a book.. she changes..lights turn off she goes to sleep.. then it repeats again...The waitresses were in not so revealing outfits, not that I wanted to see it but The website i guess just overhyped the ambience of this place.  It is like a classier HOOTERS! 

Decor: Dim lights all around. Cool changing lights lamps. Creative Idea with the different wooden doors around the bathroom area, even though it does confuse us a bit on where to go. The walls were padded like a fancy cabaret.  Nice chandeliers hanging down.  One thing I didn't like though was the selection of some chairs... with barely no back rest.. how do older people lean if they are tired from eating?  I didn't think that was the best chair selection... and for a cold night.. where do you expect us to put our coats? on our no back rest chair? on our laps? so we ended up putting our coats on the side chairs since that's what everyone else was doing.. lack of space basically.

Food: Very good i must say.. Nothing too SPECIAL or UNIQUE but at least the food was very satisfying.  I had the grilles salmon, which was cooked perfectly, a bit raw in the middle.. Perfect for my taste.. The sauce complemented very well.  I also tried the organic brick roasted chicken.. So tender and the spices were cooked with it to perfection! Not too oily or greasy.  I am always iffy when ordering chicken dishes because the chicken might end up being dry.  But i have to say this was one of the best chicken dishes i have had in awhile!  I had a piece of the filet mignon, pretty good. I liked how they had few selections of steak sauces, where I can take turns trying the sauces with the meat.  

Dessert: we had the red velvet cupcakes for my friend's birthday. They were so moist! I loved them. I liked the cream cheese mix frosting on top of it  Another thing that was pretty cool and basic was the cotton candy they gave us to share.. with the LCD light in the middle of it making the cotton candy glow.. i am a big sucker at little things and get all happy!

Service: Excellent.. I would like to say my waitress was hot! hahaha that is all.. Very attentionate and tells us updates on if food is taking awhile. Very considerate.  The place was definitely packed but not the lounge area.

Club: Pretty dead.. we came back here on our club hopping..someone handed us free shot on the house and front door entry so we went back in.  It is definitely an older crowd.. Everyone was just drinking and sitting.. maybe 4 girls were dancing on the dance floor.. The decor is nice though, similar to the restaurant.. There were go go dancers with wooden canes dancing around.. but it was empty so ehhh?!?  We just left with a stamp in case we wanted to come back in and got our free shots.. It is definitely cheaper than drinks at other clubs though..$10-$12 a shot.. compared to The Bank for a patron shot of $15..... I wouldn't come here again though for a night out of debauchery.Not bad, but I should note that my group opted for a table and bottle service when we realized the door people were holding up the line on purpose. Splitting the cost 8 ways means everyone pays $150 for 3 bottles of alcohol, plus no wait, and we get our own space to dance and drink and just have fun in general.

The security guys in the VIP booth area were very accommodating. One thing that annoyed us was the busboy (are they called busboys in clubs?) kept picking up our used cups even when they were half FULL with alcohol. They probably did that so we would drink more, and hence, purchase more $400 bottles of non-top-shelf-alcohol.

We had to pay mandatory 30% gratuity in addition to overpriced alcohol. But we had fun, since we were allowed to dance on the couch. The music was pretty good, the sound system was pretty good, and the place was crowded, but not too crowded. I'd go again ONLY if I was getting bottle service.I guess I expected a little bit more... but they changed it a bit.  You no longer get into costume or throw beads as they had previously done.  The dancers and performers though were HOT!  Hopefully you'll be placed on a float some some hot performers.  I enjoyed being on the float, but it was a tad too short.  I thought that they go around twice as with a show I had seen, but it was pretty cool while we were on them.

The performers made me want to leap up out of my seat and just perform with them.  Initially I thought the performers were people who paid to be on the float... I was like, damn, do we have to learn a small routine (as my excitement built up)... too bad :P...

Watch the show though cause it's a pretty good free show... and do ride a float as it is an experience.Four reasons I come here: it's downstairs from where I work, they have decent prices, the bartender makes a pretty good margarita and I like the patio.

Not a huge fan of their food and in the summertime when the windows are closed it kinda stinks when you first walk in, but overall it's a good place for drinks on a patio-type day on Mill.A Copy of the Reply from Rich Rush... 
I will give them one more chance, for sure... 
NIce letter, I am happy Kay has declded to take some time off.  I have worked in the restaurant biz myself and I know exactly how she felt that day.  I can respect that.  Thank you for your offer for a free lunch.  When I get the spirit to leave the building I'll come in and order the fish tacos, till then, adios! 

Ayren,
 
First I would like to apologize for taking so long to respond to your message.  It can take a while for messages to corporate to make it back to us at the store.  
 
Second, I'm sorry that you had a bad experience! The woman you refer to in your letter is named Kay. She is a sweet old woman and the mother of the owner.  She is heavily invested in the business and has not given herself a day off since we opened nearly 3 years ago.  This experience has finally convinced her to take days off! 
 
We take painstaking strides to make sure that our patrons have a good experience and want to come back.  Even though we are franchise, our store is privately owned by a local family.  We try to win our customers one at a time and we would hate to lose you over this experience. If you would please give us another chance, I would be glad to give you and a friend lunch on us!

Rich RushMy mother takes everyone to this place; she's a big fan of tea. I drink tea but am certainly no connoisseur. Their food was pretty good, and the place is very girly and cutesy. Great place to take grandma or mom. Things were reasonable priced; my only complaint was that it was kind of close quarters. I felt like I was dining in a closet. The staff was friendly and the service was good. Unique experience.First time at this restaurant.  My family and I went there because of the favorable reviews.  My meat lovers pizza was good as were the other pizzas we ordered.

My father ordered the spaghetti with meat balls.  Awful!  I mean, seriously not good spaghetti.  How do you not make passable/decent spaghetti with meat balls?  We told the waiter of our displeasure and he did make good on the meal.  I got the feeling that they had heard that before.  If so, then they should make a better spaghetti sauce.  

The roasted olive appetizer was good but the calamari we ordered was just ok.  For the money I expected much better calamari.

The service was very good and the waiter had a great attitude.

In short, stick with beer and pizza at this place and you'll be ok.  Would I go to this place again?  Yes, but I'll stick with the pizza and olive appetizer and beer.I don't get it

no. really. 

 I. Just. Don't. Get. It.

Alright, so maybe I'm not a hamburger fan - but i am when it's good, prime, juicy, beef (like kobe, for instance).  

And the fries?!  O.  M.  G....  D R Y !

That said: the service is very cool.  Top Notch.  Days gone by.  Anyone I have visit from Canada is in awe when I take them here - and I do it serisouly for the service experience - oh, and when I get "is there a burger place around"  (G R O A N ......here we go again....)


So, aunite & uncle were happy.  I didn't even touch a fry.  sorry.  GR8 service (as usual) today - Kudos... and high 5 to ya'sI love the carne asada and guacamole. The flour tortillas taste homemade. The dinner portion is big enough to share. The servers are friendly and attentive. But, the ice tea comes from the soda fountain and the chips taste like they come from a stale bag. The guacamole side was $5.95 for a small cup size bowl. The carne asada plate is $17.95. I think both are very expensive.Breadfruit is a cool spot. The interior of the place is well decorated and they can only seat about 15-20 people, making a nice, intimate ambiance. I really appreciate that they serve locally grown organic produce and that their chicken is all natural and raised cage free. Any addition of a Jamaican restaurant down town earns at least three stars in my book. We arrived at 7:30pm and were the only people there throughout almost the entire meal..

We brought our own bottle of wine and there was only a $5 corking fee, not to shabby.

We started with the plantain and avacado spring rolls, I really liked that wonton was baked and not deep fried, the presentation was nice, the mango chutney was fresh but the rolls themselves lacked flavor. I really wished they would have paired some other fruit or spice to add more contrast to the dish. 

For my main I got the jerk chicken and I was a little disappointed. Again they did an excellent job with the presentation, but the corn was mushy and what the jerk rub lacked in flavor they tried to make up for in spice.  I like spicy, and can handle a lot of heat, but heat shouldn't overpower flavor...

The chef/owner came out and asked us how we enjoyed our meal, and explained his philosophy behind the food. The service was excellent, but in comparison to some other Jamaican places I've been, it really only warrants 3 stars (sorry)!I had the molasses lollipops, which were pretty delicious (and are actually chicken), and a fabulous punch.  However, the waitstaff was kind of icy (although the bartender was very friendly) and everything was overpriced.  I'd go back if someone asked me to but it's not somewhere I'll choose to frequent.**Update** Ok, so I met a friend here for lunch this weekend. We were the only people in the place- sort of a plus in some ways, not so much in others. I am not sure if there is a different chef on during lunch than dinner, but I hope so. We ordered the crostini with hummus (eh), black olive tapenade (eh) and tomato something (this was actually really good) to start off, and bottled water. The bottle was already open before it was brought to our table. Not that a big deal, but I should have gone with no ice (duh) because the drink smelled and tasted like Phoenix area tap water. Is it copper or iron? Hard to tell around that calcium taste. I dunno, you be the judge. My friend and I wondered if it was a 'fresh' or 'refilled' bottle. Whateva on that, we ended up not being charged for the it. My friend had the sliders; I ordered pecan-crusted salmon on spinach salad with raspberry vinagrette. My friend thought there was too much sauce on the sliders; I kind of agreed but it didn't kill the taste of the fresh beef. The salmon was ABSOLUTELY PERFECT, it had just enough crust on it without overwhelming the fish, and cooked perfectly. YUM. The salad... eh. The vinagrette lacked dazzle, and this seemed to be 'compensated' by drizzling a lot over the spinach and salmon. The spinach was very fresh, but would have been better plain than with that stuff. It was disappointing enough that I said something about it to the waitperson. Oh yeah, and apparently there was a special of the day... which we found out after placing our order, when we overheard the next couple who came in ask if there was one. I dunno, maybe our fault for not asking? Well, even after a less than stellar lunch, we decided to go for that flourless chocolate cake I had so coveted. Eh. Again, the oversaucing of chocolate and caramel to cover a kind of hockey-puckish little cake that reminded me of those easy-bake oven cakes. The raspberry puree on the side was the best part. 

So I am sad to say, I have to take one star away for now. I will be foolish enough to give it one more try for dinner.... maybe it was an off day. :P


My husband and I went to this place to celebrate my birthday. Despite a good review by the AZ Republic (lol), we decided to try it. Wow, are we glad we did!! 
     The decor adds to a lovely ambiance - low lighting, a beautiful bar, and simple yet elegant table settings. There's a player piano, and conversation tables with overstuffed chairs. Our server, Jason, could not have been more gracious or attentive, even as the restaurant began to fill up. It was nice to be offered bottled, artisan water ($6), which was crisp, clean, and kept in a wine chiller at our table. As Phoenicians know, the local tap water here... yeah, not so much. I hate even asking for a glass of water, normally. 
     The menu appeared to be typical bistro fare, with artisan touches throughout. Each item includes a wine pairing, for those unsure. For those who take too freakin' long to decide (like us), Si the Wine Guy pops out of nowhere to give a knowledgable hand. The wine list has a nice selection, in price range as well as regions, and we were given excellent recommendations for the flight we each chose ($8-15 apiece; ours were $10). We started with an appetizer trio ($17), selecting the ahi tuna with caviar (a nice blend of delicate taste with the bold tuna); the prosciutto-wrapped melon, very nice, and then the crab-imperial stuffed mushroom, with creme fraiche and tomato-topped bruschetta. This last one was excellent, with a rich buttery crab filling. 
     My husband ordered the petite sirloin ($24), and I had the lamb ($26). His was very fresh, nearly fork-tender and cooked perfectly to order, with an understated but complimentary mushroom and spinach sort of ragout, and fingerling potatoes. My dish was tender with an incredible syrah reduction, just bold enough to match the thin-cut and perfectly cooked chops. It was on a bed of delicious mashed potatoes, with sauteed baby green beans and pepper slices- a little bit of heaven from the first bite to the last. 
     For dessert, the flourless chocolate cake with molten raspberry sauce ($8) sounded so tempting, but that will wait for our next visit. We shared the chilled fruit compote crepe ($8) instead, with creme fraiche on top. It was a perfectly light ending. 
     The portions were dead on- generous without being huge, which would have made the richness feel like overkill. After such a scrumpt-diddly-uptous meal, our bill seemed like a deal. 
     Tastings is a well-needed touch of class for the far West Valley, and an excellent value for what it offers. Minus 1 star until same experience with several visits. Oh yeah, I put myself on their email list and they do a lot of prixe fixe/single mingle/that kinda thing events. And wow, this review is long... but it was just that good. It's been a long time since I've been this happy with a dining experience, so check it out already, dammit.Came here for a bachelor party weekend.  Go karting is clean, sober way to keep busy during the day, especially if you're in Vegas when it's too cold to sit out at the pools all day.  You do need most of your faculties on this one, so don't come in hungover, like some of our guys did.

A group package (~$65 each) gives you two races; a time trial that sets your position, and a straight up race.  They let you borrow a head sock so you don't sweat up the reused helmets.  They let you watch a short safety video, but you're soon jumping into the seat of your own car.  There isn't too much tutorial so you're pretty much learning on the fly, even if it's your first time in a go kart.  They give you a few laps to roll at cruising speed before turning on your karts power.  I won't go into driving tips but be mindful of the workers with the flags.  If you see a blue/yellow flag, move over so that faster karts can pass you, this way you'll avoid getting slammed into on the numerous hairpin turns.

One of our guys was too aggressive in his bumping (not allowed!) and crashed under the plastic barriers, 'causing them to stop the race.  He was warned, but not disqualified.  He ended up with some deep scratches along his arm and hands where the barrier scraped him, so needless to say, it's not something you should be doing.

Lastly, the crew are pretty friendly, and if you check in on Facebook, you can get a free can of Monster energy drink!what can i say about costco ? no matter the town your in your likely to run into the hordes of hellen keller wannabees. Is everyone seriously that dense that they think  its ok to run over everyone else. Never ever go in on a weekend if you can help it. not unless you like battling hordes of mindless automatons seeking out mega packages of burritos. My favorite are the slugs who mooch off the free samples. get the F out of my way you sample whore. Seriously do people just come here to eat lunch at the sample stations? The food court is cheap enough ANDELAY... I am pretty much convinced that you end up spending more at this place unless you have a family of 20 to feed..but the illusion is fun..lolSo bitter-sweet. I never bring my dogs here first but I do rely on on them for a variety of reasons. 

I take comfort in the fact that their vets and vet techs are knowledgeable and obviously love animals.

I also take comfort in their late hours. It is really expensive but if my dog is freaking me out, the $200+ visit are usually worth it to me if i don't think it can wait.


Regular vet visits are insanely expensive so I also have a regular vet I take my dogs to. This is my last resort place.

My girls have also stayed at their pet hotel while I was on vacation, they came back looking really nasty so I probably won't be taking them to the pet hotel again. HOWEVER, they seem to always have a spot in case of emergency and every other pet hotel is booked.I am always rooting for the small indy owned places around town and even the small local chains. Going in I really wanted to like Hougan's.  I ate my sub and although I didn't dislike it, like Mindy A., I just though it was OK. Nothing really stood out flavor wise. 

The ladies behind the counter were very friendly and that's a plus, however, service alone isn't enough to make me go out of my way to visit again. The sandwiches need more flavor. They are slightly pricey and even if they were cheaper, there are too many better sub shops in Vegas to seek this one out.   Johnny Dill, Capriotti's, Any decent Italian deli, and Naked City all dominate by comparative standards. 

You have the service down, now work on the flavors and I'll pay a revisit. I want to give you more stars, give me a reason Hougan's.This bar is a lot of fun, but very weird....the later the night gets, the more older generation you'll see. It's not a bad thing, please don't get me wrong at all!

But, us girls usually get hit on by people...who are at our dad's age. that's the creepy part. 

Drinks are unbelievably cheap! it's crazy.Cookies

If cookie monster had not been arrested in Times Square recently I would say that you could find him here eating all the yummy COOKIES.

I like to stroll over here and devour a few dozen cookies now and again... I guess you could call ME a cookie monster (legal).

Everyone here is so friendly and sometimes even gives me FREE COOKIES when I order 2 they give me 3 etc...

I've eaten other food here a few times, chili was good, but no tabasco was available to make it better.

Never had a sandwich here so can't say. I will say it one more time though:

COOKIES (no one judges you for it)

http://todayentertainment.today.com/_news/2013/04/09/17671380-costumed-cookie-monster-arrested-after-shoving-2-year-oldI've been here a couple of times.  (Out of sheer laziness..)

Their gyros are ok.  They give you a good portion, but I wouldn't really rate their food as anything more than average.

I usually judge places like this by their chicken shawirma, much like I judge a sushi bar by their spicy tuna rolls.  The difference between their chicken shwawirma and the same dish from a better restaurant is like the difference between L&L's chicken katsu vs. Aloha Kitchen's chicken katsu.  Aloha kitchen's chicken katsu is FAR superior.My husband got the shrimp and I got the crabettes:

Fried Shrimp - delicious! Great breading and fried to perfection.

Fried Crabettes - STAY AWAY! I actually really like imitation crab (I know, weird)...so when I ordered it I was expecting it to be imitation crab. But it just didn't taste right. The first bite was maybe okay, but I really didn't like it much after that. I will stick to keeping my imitation crab in crab louie salads and California rolls :P

The fries that came with both of our entrees were decent. Nothing special, just good fries.

I'll have to get the shrimp next time, or try the fried fish. I should have just went with the fish, but I'm a sucker whenever I see crab on a menu.The employees are definitely nicer than the Pete's in South Phoenix but I would rather deal with the mean and tatted up old lady in South Phoenix than getting under breaded and under cooked onion rings. The burrito was excellent and they give you more sauce than usual in this location though.If you're looking for a nice piece of meat you'll certainly get that here but I think it's average at best overall.  I tried 4 different steaks, New York Sirloin from Nebraska, New York Sirloin from Washington, the Ribeye from Illinois and one of the American Waygus. The Waygu was overcooked, ribeye tasty and both sirloins my favorite of the 4 (I actually liked the Washington best because it was kind of sweet which sounds weird for a cut of beef but it was really different and tasty).

With that being said, I thought the sides were EH...cream of spinach my favorite, fingerling potatoes kinda crappy (I think I've had better at Outback), mac n cheese ok, mashed potatoes kinda like Boston Market, you get the idea.

The wine selection was excellent though and so was this cocktail I got called Pins and Needles that's a gin drink served with cucumber and egg white.  It's only about 1/4 of the way full when you get it which is certainly disappointing but I guess standard for a top notch steakhouse (or big name I should say) but definitely delicious and refreshing.

Best part hands down was the service. Very elegant and over the top but a lot of fun. I think I'll try a different steakhouse next time though since I know there are better ones in Vegas and plenty to choose from.We came on Sunday afternoon and ordered the chicken katsu bowl and the spicy chicken teriyaki plate for 16.

- Perfect intensity of spice! Not too hot where you'll be trying to calm the flame in your mouth with a drink.
- Nice crisp of chicken katsu. Not too breaded and oily like L&Ls.
- Kikkoman spicy teriyaki marinade fail. I love the marinade bc I use it myself. It Pretty much tastes the same. 
- A bit expensive. Expected. franchise prices. Should be 4 bucks for a bowl and 6 for the plate. 
- Horrible Mac salad. I thought this place is Japanese? 
- I'd opt for island flavor just a mile away.I don't usually write reviews very often (in fact ever).  But I felt that the 4.5 stars does not currently reflect my previous sushi experience here.  

First off, the service here was really good.  The waitress was really nice, very prompt and courteous and provided the food quickly. 

The food itself, was prepared well, I usually eat a lot of nigiri and the pieces are ok in amount of fish, the rice was packed well and the quality of the fish was good.

The major downside in my opinion is that its pricier than I expected.  I wish Yelp would provide "2.5 dollar signs".  Granted, I did not come for "Happy Hour" which ends relatively early at 5pm.  I go to a lot of sushi restaurants and for the amount of fish provided, I would have expected it to be cheaper.

Also, the edamame cost $$.  Even the miso soup is not complimentary.  Considering the above average price, I've been to too many other places that have the same price, same quality, and provided the necessities for free.  Oh, I even forgot that a bowl of white rice for my child was even a charge.  

So, the nickel and dime of things I would have expected compounded with the surprisingly above average price, I can only say that Yen Sushi was "ok".  The other two people in my party (minus the children) also agree.i loveeeeeeeeeeeeee sanrio. specifically badtz-maru!! but there was no badtz-maru to be found at this sanrio store T_____T

the selection at this store was alright-- lots of hello kitty things. they didn't have much variety with any of the other characters, though. 

the girls behind the counter were very friendly and accommodating.

i think i was just really disappointed that i couldn't find anything that had badtz-maru on it.

hopefully they'll bring in more variety next time! hello kittly will do for now ^___^Prepare yourself for an authentic experience. Depending on your comfort level authentic may not always be a great thing. Staff very friendly and decor is pretty cool.We had a discount coupon for this restaurant and visited for the first time. Upon arrival we discovered the majority of the seating is outside on an enclosed covered patio. Even though they had heat lamps it was chilly. We decided to wait for an indoor table. The wait lasted almost 30 minutes and there's very little area to stand in while waiting.

This restaurant has a VERY lively bar that you can also dine at. It was full and loud. The layout of the restaurant is laid back but accommodates few tables in the main dining area. The entire end of the restaurant restaurant is taken up by the trio that plays on the weekends. Fearing the noise we were happy to find that the trio played familiar but low keyed music that didn't interfere with the dining experience.

Now the food. It was very good with emphasis on Italian naturally. We ordered different items and all were quite good with enough left over to take home. Our waiter was outstanding, friendly, competent and kidding. Every time he brought out a dish he would say, "Take a Picture". It was funny.

Anyway I don't think we will go back. While we enjoyed the food, the atmosphere just was found wanting. When you make a reservation that should ask if you want indoor or outdoor seating.Sephora is the what Orwell's 1984 would have been like if it took place in a makeup outlet instead of a dystopian Britain. 

A large, spacious warehouse occupied by at least a half dozen identically dressed employees, separated only by their choice of eye shadow, all programmed to say the same four or five phrases. Some of the smarter ones know how to shuffle the order of the phrases. Some don't.

Employee 1: "Can I help you with anything?"

No. I'm good.

Employee 2: "Can I help you with anything?"

No, didn't you just hear me? I'm good.

Employee 3: "Would you like a basket for all that?"

Actually, I would, thanks.

Employee 3: "Can I help you with anything?"

...

Seriously, though. Why do you need six people at a time in a makeup shop? It's makeup, it's not Sam's Club. You're never going to need an extra pair of hands to lift a crate of palletes.

Why are you staring at me? Oh. Shit. Am I wearing makeup?

Haha. I didn't even notice that. Man, am I glad you caught that.

How ridiculous would I have looked wearing makeup... in a makeup store?

You wouldn't know this from my pointless ramblings, but I'm actually quite the Sephora whore. With the exception of one excursion to a MAC Cosmetics in Redwood City, CA, all of my makeup has been purchased from them, and usually at this location.

Egad. Does that mean...

Yes, I'm an attention whore and just like to complain about shit. Probably because my parents didn't love me. Oh well. This Urban Decay eye shadow makes up for it. Kinda.

I must be stopped.I wasn't crazy about this location. I have eaten at the one in Henderson that was really good but this location just lacked in many areas. 
First let me talk about the service. It is the ONLY reason this place gets 3 stars and not 2 stars. The hostess was super friendly and checked on us at our table many times.  The server had a nice charm about him and was excellent at providing service to us. 
Now to the food. I ordered Strawberry Chicken and it just tasted like they simmered some strawberry jam and then poured in over the chicken. It was dripping with the sauce and that made the chicken very soggy. The BBQ Pork Fried Rice was dry and lacked flavor. The soup was unlike any I have ever had it was almost gel-like and very strange.
I had high hopes from previous experience at the other location and the decor on the inside made the place look very upscale but the food is what it comes down too and it just wasn't up to par.Me, Terri R, and Alicia R recently hit this place up for dessert.  The original plan was Claim Jumper but since we were all tired out from dinner, something light like boba was good enough to hit the spot, catch up on the week, and hang out.  Nothing beats dessert and great convo with some of my favorite people (i.e. the Wonder Twins). 

I had their Cappuccino Blast with double boba.  The boba was consistent and the drink itself was pretty good.  For a Lollicup, I was actually surprised that there was a little coffee kick to it.  Usually their drinks are just okay and powdery.  But not on this visit. 

This Lollicup has your regular after lunch and dinner treats like smoothies, milk teas, and boba.  I prefer my boba from places like No 1 Boba, Icy Juicy, and the Perfect Scoop.  But when you're in the mood for a cold refreshment with boba and you're in Town Square, then Lollicup is one of those places that needs to be visited.  The drinks here are average, but will still hit the spot. What makes this Lollicup different from the rest of the Lollicups out there is the that this one is a basically a little stand meaning there's really no place to chill.  You simply put your order in and wait for them to serve it.  The drinks here aren't bad at all, just not the best I've had.  I'm not giving Lollicup 3 Stars because it was bad.  It's just average to what you'll find around town. 

Cappuccino Blast w/Boba:  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lollicup-coffee-and-tea-las-vegas?userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ#Wj5nK6zMi1zi92pQ8hks3QI'll start out by saying that Blue Wasabi used to be my favorite restaurant. When they first opened they had amazing sushi that was far better than Ra. I felt that way for years, but recently things have been changing. The last few times I have eaten here, the sushi just hasn't been the same. The rolls have been loose and fall apart as soon as they are picked up. It makes for a messy meal. It also doesn't taste the same, the food just isn't as flavorful. I don't know what is going on, but they need to check themselves. I still appreciate their happy hour and their quick service, but I find myself looking around for better sushi now. If it weren't for years of happiness prior to the last year than I would have given them 2 stars instead of 3.So because we were staying at Monte Carlo, for our Anniversary dinner, we decided to try out this restaurant. I searched on Yelp for a nice restaurant, and this one happened to come up as closest (obviously, since it was inside Monte Carlo) with 3 money signs. Plus it said it was romantic. 

So we made reservations and headed on down there. First of all, the hostess was not friendly. She asked for my last name and when I told her, she replied "what??" instead of "excuse me" or something similar.. And then when she located my reservation, she said "ah" with no further instructions. And as I looked around, she finally said that another hostess was coming up to escort us to our table. (awkward of her to make us momentarily confused).

Then we get to the table.. The restaurant is literally right next to the tables at the casino so it's pretty loud.. (specially when some Las Vegas Virgin is overhyped and keeps yelling VEEEGAAAAAASSSS every time he wins a hand.. Uff) So it's not quite romantic.. 

Then the service was ok.. I felt rushed by the server. He seemed rushed as well too. We ordered the calamari, my boyfriend ordered the filet mignon, and I ordered the Chilean sea bass.

Calamari - was amazing. Probably the best calamari I've had in a long while. They were fried to perfection

Filet mignon - was amazing as well and I don't even like steak! HOWEVER, the steak came with NOTHING. It as just 2 bits of steak on a plate plus 2 different sauces and that was it. Um!? Usually, at a steakhouse, steak is served with at least a side of veggies or fries.. or SOMETHING. NO. Here, it came with nada! WHY!? Idk. But fine, if the steak comes with no sides, I would expect the server to inform us "the steak does not come with any sides. Would you like to order any sides such as fries, baked potatoes, or etc?" But no. He didn't say anything. 

Chilean Sea Bass - was amazing. It came with lemon risotto. Cooked to perfection. I finished the entire plate way too quick!! Excellent. 

We didn't order any dessert here so I can't comment on that. 

All in all for the above items plus a beer and a glass of wine, the total came up $130 + tip. For that price, I wish the server was more attentive to us and MAYBE told us about the sides situation for the steaks. "/ Also, as mentioned above it was pretty loud.. Not a good place if you want a quiet dinner with conversations. Also, the wait time between taking the order.. and getting our appetizer.. and then finally getting our entrees was quite long... But I must repeat again that the calamari and chilean sea bass were AMAZING. Just was a bit disappointed with the service (including the hostess who should be the face of the restaurant who provides us with the first impression of the place... And she ruined the first impression ;[ )Not quite what I would call 5 stars. The music and production is fine, the performances are spot on, but its not quite for everyone. If you didn't grow up listening to the music, I don't know how it could be a five star event for you. that said, it's still very entertaining, extremely well executed and fun. It's not a knock out punch like Love or KA, but it's very much worth the price. If you're not a fan of the music, check out Love, Blue Man or KA before giving this a try, those shows have a wider appeal, better sound and sight lines. After that-- definitely worth giving this a try. Interesting and lively east coast crowd was there when I saw this. Dedicated cast!Love the atmosphere, love the temperatures, love the lazy river, love the access to the casino when desired, LOVE the option to get comfy reserved seating with waitress service! Fun in the sun. 
Just really don't love the dis-jointed way the reservations themselves are handled. We were told by the cabana rental people to just go grab a cupla loungers behind the red ropes and someone would be over with a credit card swiper. By the time the swiper-toting person arrived, they were accompanied by a couple who wanted our seats! Not fun in the sun. 
We all eventually worked it out, but it took some of the fizz outta my soda that day :[Free is nice... And maybe, if you are luckier than I, something will actually be going on in the factory.  But it is always nice to get the free sample, especially since the product is prohibitively expensive.  The cactus garden is pretty.to see during the day or holiday decorated. During holiday evenings (at least tonight) is BUSY!  So be prepared to deal with inconsiderate crowds!First, I have to say that I tried to explain the name to my English husband and he just did not understand the humor.  At any rate, he was willing to try this place.

We have been twice and, although my husband likes the burgers, I am just not convinced yet.  It is possible that I have not tried the right combination yet.

On our first visit, I had the chicken wrap with avocado.  Except it was not avocado - it was more of a guacamole spread.  It lacked the fresh avocado taste that I was expecting.  The fries on this occasion were a bit hit and miss with the seasoning but good overall and the onion rings were nice - with soft rather than crisp breading.

Today I tried the Bleu Chicken which includes swiss and bleu cheese.  The first problem is that the chicken is about half the size of the bread.  I can deal with this because the grilled sourdough bread is nice with cheese.  The other problem I had is that the swiss cheese had a really strong taste.  Of course, this is my personal preference but it was a little off-putting.  The fries this time were seasoned perfectly and uniformly.  Also, we ordered the half "best of both" as we did with our first visit but there seemed to be so much more in the basket today (certainly not a bad thing!!!).

So, I have not written off Cheeburger Cheeburger.  The chicken is moist and the fries taste good.  I think that I just need to find the combination that works for me.  I will definitely try it again - especially since I joined their mailing list and receive coupons regularly.  I think if you are a beef eater, you will enjoy it greatly.I went here for the first time with a few coworkers for lunch last week. The prices on lunch were actually really decent. The portions were equally as satisfying. What it lacked was flavor. One person in our group ordered one of the $17 (which the price isn't listed) lobster specialty rolls. We all tried it and agreed, it could have been fake crab and tasted better. I am by no means a sushi snob, but this placed really disappointed me. I would rather pay more at one of the many other sushi places that flank this area on Sahara.My wife insisted that we take this tour. Alright, I have nothing better to do on a Saturday. It took about 4 hours of my time between taking the tour and driving back and forth. This place is out in the boonies so call ahead for directions, I don't think GPS will be your best bet.

Shamrock Farm is run by one of the largest companies in Arizona, Shamrock Foods. I believe they said there were about 2,000 cows/Heifers (a Heifer is a cow that has never given birth) and a handful of Bulls on this farm. The cows are milked daily and it's so interesting that they all line up into these contraptions that lock into place so they can be milked. This place is very clean, they must clean this place constantly. They have a gift shop and a place where you can grab a hot dog or some ice cream. They take you out on the tour in a tram, you can pet or feed some newborns. There were 15 newborns the day we were there; those bulls are definitely living the good life.

I heard this place is popular for field trips on Tuesday's & Thursdays so plan your trip accordingly.Had a burger here for lunch.  It was ok.  I had to pay extra for bacon and cheese to be added, which brought the price to about what I would pay at Delux, but the quality was nowhere near Delux.  The service was excellent, the iced tea was fresh, but it was a very expensive lunch at $20 plus tip, for a burger that just did not impress.There's a reason people flock to this place, it's cheap. But that's really the main appeal other than the pre-made sushi revolving in front of you. I learned quickly that the staff do not deserve much of a tip because they're not very attentive or trained to refill cups or ask you for your check, etc. I think there's a reason the staff never comes around to ask how everything is going because they'd be getting terrible feedback. Food is okay but even then I've had some bad experiences with getting a roll off the belt and it tasting warm. I dont think sushi should stay in room temperature for as long as they let it. 

My word of advice is to not get anything that everyone else is ignoring. Its probably been sitting out for an hour or two. Especially "Today's special Conchi" - I don't think anyone's ever actually had it.I attended Simon's restaurant when it was at the Hardrock......alas it has moved.  

Begun by my buddy's $25 shot of Patron Platinum (following a $30 OpusX cigar earlier at Shadowbar) everything at Simon was good but overpriced for the quality.  The one shining aspect of the meal was the AMAZING breadbowl, however, featuring homemade cheeze-its, buttermilk biscuits, handmade pretzels, and zucchini bread.

For my meal I had the Cali Pizza (Toro, Crab, Avocado, Daikon, Endive, Soy) and 4-cheese saffron truffle mac n' cheese.  Simon states this is the best Mac n' Cheese in the world but I've had better at Michael Mina's Bourbon Steak, Emeril's Fishhouse, and M at Miranova.

For dessert?  The junkfood platter with gourmet versions of a hostess cupcake, snowball, ricecrispy treats, and a chocolate shake.  Cute, but essentially just sugary.

My friend loved his steak and chocolate cake.

The highlight of the meal, however, was the hostess in the leather apron.....yowzaz.Went here last night for dinner around 8pm. It wasn't too crowded and we were seated promptly. There was a pizza and wine special (every Weds apparently), but we opted to go order from the menu as i had pizza for lunch.  I love trying chicken salad sandwiches at new places, so why should this place be any different? Maizie's had grapes and dried apricots mixed in... Wonderful! Perfectly peppery to balance out the fruit.  For the side, the server recommended a mix of hand-cut and sweet potato fries, which did not disappoint.  I love SP fries that are medium cut like theirs and the fresh-cut potatoes were amazing! The chipotle aioli was quite good too.  I wasn't in the mood for a drink (what?!), but i did try the bf's red sangria, which was pretty good and i would definitely order it next time i want a cocktail.  He ordered the special which was ribs with sides of new potatoes, roasted veggies and some sort of corn. He couldn't finish it all and that is quite odd for him. At $13 it was quite the steal for him to have leftovers!
I hope we can get back there for happy hour, which runs from 3-6pm... I can't remember if its weekdays or every day... But i look forward to a few $3 sangrias!   =)I had heard this place talked up quite a bit, so I came in with high expectations.  They were not met.  It's not bad, but it is definitely over-hyped.

The space is very small, so the menu is necessarily limited--the first time I came in, I actually left without ordering because none of the day's offerings really appealed (plus it was SUPER crowded).  Since I came in this time with a group of 3, I found the paucity of tables a bit inconvenient--I feel like the bar seating should be reduced to make room for smaller tables (and then there's the 6-8 person table in the middle which seems like overkill).  I admit, we did come in at 10am on a Saturday, which is one of the busier times.

I had one crepe each off the sweet and savory menus.  The savory crepe contained eggs, summer squash, and cheddar, but it was so heavily salted that it might as well have been a crepe stuffed with salt.  I seriously could barely taste anything else.

The sweet crepe (raspberry & lemon curd) was much better, although I felt like there were a few too many berries in relation to the rest of its contents.  I tasted my friend's banana/almond/nutella crepe and it was completely delicious.  My skim latte was also very good and complimented the sweet crepes beautifully.

My overall assessment is that this a decent place to get take-out dessert, but avoid the savory crepes and only plan to eat in during off hours.There are some undeniably regrettable parallels between the protests for democracy in Egypt and elsewhere in the Arabic world, and what's going on in Wisconsin, but there are also some very important differences.  In the Middle East and North Africa, the protests are the result of an expansion of the literate middle class concomitant with growing social expectations, they're fighting for democracy.  In Wisconsin, we're an embattled middle class, fighting to preserve democracy in the workplace.  In Cairo, protesting is frightfully dangerous, and protective headgear for protesters is a must.  In Madison, the three main police agencies are very nice, polite, not at all dangerous, and silly headgear for protesters seems to be de rigueur. In Cairo, a lot of coffee shops and tea houses are shut down, and protesters would be limited to Turkish style coffee or Arabic style tea.  In Madison, there's an excellent, personable, unique bourgeois coffee shop serving organic fair trade coffee one block out from the state capital building (which is absolutely beautiful, protest or not) in literally every direction.  
      Okay, so if you're in need of a cappuccino, served properly in a dainty cup with saucer, finished with a leaf shaped mark of steamed milk, and you walked  due north of the capital building from your protest, then here's your place.  Its main advantage over the ludicrous plethora of other quaint little coffee shops playing independent indie-rock in this college town, is its location. For those who want to walk from the capital, it's very convenient.  Other pluses are, it is a sunny little location, with friendly competent staff, tasty crepes (using Wisconsin produce and cheese), I recommend the spinach, cheese and mushroom.  The somewhat cramped interior is ringed with seats facing out to the two streets for solitary drinkers and their notebook computers, but the center has an L shaped low table with unfixed stools, making it perfect for group project work.  When you're protesting to preserve worker rights with a bunch of teachers, you want to proofread your placards for spelling and punctuation, these tables are perfect for neatly fixing those inappropriate apostrophes on protest signs with colorful Sharpies.  
     It is a small location, but when I was in there, the turn-over was quick, and the coffee is excellent.  Although the location would seem to be convenient for the children's museum right next door, like most coffee shops, it's not really an appropriate place for young children, the space is tight, there's hot coffee everywhere, the tables are low, and "the grown-ups are talking here."  If you're looking for a longer, solitary, coffee drinking and reading hide-out, there are better places for that near by, with more comfortable seating.  The prices are pretty comparable to the other campus and downtown area coffee shops.
     Okay, properly re-caffeinated, its time to return to the fight for democracy in the Wisconsin workplace.  And Cairo, I hope you get both democracy, and cappuccino, soon.Not sure what everyone else was eating, but for me it was just okay. The meat had a great flavor/taste but a slight tough and fatty at times. The salsa bar seemed to be flavorless and cut down with water or something. Every great taco must be accompanied by a great salsa/chili.
 If your in the area I would give it a shot.Just got a very nice email from the GM apologizing for our bad experience and explaining the whole "global cuisine" deal, and also to ask for a second chance. OK, I'm impressed. I might just do that. Stay tuned.....Had an early morning flight to Philadelphia this morning.  Didn't get a chance to grab a bite to eat before I left the house, so I stopped by Flatbreadz.

I decided to get 2 toaste Sesame Seed Bagels w/cream cheese.  I was pleasantly surprised to see that the bagels were pretty fresh.  They toasted it just right too....not too burnt, but not undercooked either.  I would have rated them 4 Stars, but the cream cheese was a fluffy cream cheese and didn't have much taste....must have been fat-free or something like that....which is a bummer because I like full-flavored cream cheese.

The employees were friendly and the place was clean.

Will I return?  If I'm in the A Gate area, sure.The atmosphere here was great, but the hostess was pretty irritated with us that we didn't have a reservation (funny because the place was empty). She seated us in the very back corner on what would be the patio in better weather. They had a tarp surrounding it with heat lamps above and cold air coming in from the sides right on our table - I think that was our punishment for the lack of reservations. 

As for the food, the appetizer of calamari had few squid. You had to dig for them amongst a tower of fried carrots. But everyone liked the carrots. The steak I ordered was HORRIBLE. It tasted like roast beef, maybe being baked in the oven first and the salmon was overcooked. The salad was amazing, though and so was the lasagna, but don't expect your normal Italian lasagna - not happening here. It's different, but good. The winner of the night was, surprisingly, the giant burger which my boyfriend claimed was the best he had ever eaten. The dessert of chocolate cake, almost like a torte, melted in your mouth - I'd come back for that! 

I would go again if someone else was paying or if I were just going for drinks and dessert. I don't know if I'd take the chance ordering entrees again.I attended the opening ceremony and opening night of Encore.
The crowd waiting to enter encore at 8 PM for the grand unveiling was in a festive mood.
The crowd was festive even though the line to get in snaked through the entire Wynn.
The mood began to dimish as 8:15, 8:30, 8:45, 9PM started to roll around and the line had moved a grand total of 45 feet.
The employees of the Wynn spent the entire day promoting the 8PM start and invitation to experience the new hotel an casino.
Then they treated it like entrance to Tryst. 
Opening the line a few "guests" at a time so as to not impeded on the "total experience" of the Encore for all the others.

Please - - - it is another huge addition to the Vegas strip and there was nothing magical to it..........
The hotel is pleasing, the casino is very similar (obviously) to the Wynn-although there is a touch more red in the decor and the experience should be wonderful once the staff is on the par with the Wynn.

I do not think, as a whole,  there is an entire staff that can match the quality of the people that work in the Wynn.
Encore will get there .........  the place looks great.
Soon the quality of the staff will catch up as well.

By the way ...... The casino was very enjoyable about 2 AM on opening night ( or morning).Until 5:30 this morning I would have rated this five stars, but having to deal with drunk smokers while trying to find a cup of coffee really put me off. The cafe doesn't open until 6am and we had an early flight to catch. I was directed to the East Bar which was packed with drunk 20-something smokers. Really off-putting--some of Encore's guests *are* grown-ups. The hotel itself is gorgeous (aside from the smoke) and our room was really nice (aside from a torn duvet cover and a lack of outlets in useful places.)

We had several meals here and one big plus is that my allergies were easily handled--with absolutely no hesitation or trouble. Dinner at Red 8 was fantastic. Breakfast at Society Cafe was meh (the omelet was dry--overcooked and maybe had been sitting?) but the way my allergies were handled was impressive. 

I was fully prepared to only stay at Encore any time I'm in Vegas but after this morning, I'm not entirely certain I'll be back. While I don't need to find the Senior Center just yet, I would rather stay in a hotel that caters to adults, not the club crowd.Great environment, great bartenders... just an OK placeto dine. I'd go to 4 stars if I were reviewing "a good time", but as such, 3 stars have it. I would have to say the best food is their fish tacos, but I haven't tried everything on the menu... so give it a shot.What not to love unlimited fries and great burgers. I love the milk shake. I would rather pay $3 more dollars and go to roaring fork.  The prices here are way overpriced for burgers in a plastic basket. But mighty tasty. I really want to give four but my index finger wont let me.3 Stars = I have no idea what Pho should taste or look like. I'm a newbie, I've heard good things about Pho, so I've been dying to try it. 

Tried Nam Sao this past Sunday. They don't have an online menu, but they are right down the street, so since it was freezing cold outside, we decided what a good night to try some pho. It's a bright little shop, where you can sit down or order takeout. There were about 10 tables, which is probably plenty. Seemed there was only one guy working, but I couldn't really see in the kitchen. We got a Beef Pho, and Beef and Shrimp Pho, threw in a veggie egg roll and spring roll just to try, it comes with two and it was our first shot at trying the place so figured it was worth trying. Figured out later that the BF wasn't sure he'd like pho so just in case he'd have something else to eat. 

Had a little trouble figuring out what to put our Pho in when we got home. We didn't think it was meant to be split up, so we just busted out some oversize serving bowls and dumped it in. The to go order came with some bean sprouts, a little pack of what looked like hoisin and some siracha or some type of chili sauce mixed together, a couple of green leafy things, and some slices of jalapeno. We decided all of it was meant to go into the soup, so we added it all with the exception of some bean sprouts. I really enjoyed it. I love noodles, and I thought the flavors were real good. I will definitely return for more. I can't imagine getting anything other than beef though, it was perfect for this meal. Can't wait to try other places and see how it compares. Super Cheap and very filling!DO NOT come here for any sort of massage/facial. Then again, it might just be the woman who serviced me, her name was COCO (SO REMEMBER THAT NAME). The massages were really rushed and fast. NOTHING about it was relaxing. It was like "Get in, get out", I think the massage should have been one hour but they tried to squeeze a massage, body scrub, scalp massage and wash, facial all in 70 minutes. I should've known better. The shampoo and conditioner they used for the scalp massage wasn't as good as the ones in the public wash area. My hair was all tangly afterwards, but my skin was soft enough after the scrub. Wat do u expect tho, the scrub was one of the most painful i've ever had -.- I was a little suspicious about the cleanliness of my masseuse because when I came in, I asked for another towel and she just threw my old towel into the pile of new towels. Then one of my towels had make up stains on it and a piece of here.. I don't wear make up to the spa so it might've been someone else's towel that she mixed in with all the clean towels. Kind of disturbing.. 

 I did the $130 Body Scrub package "Scentau" or sth.. I've had more relaxing scrubs at Wi Spa. However, this spa is definitely much cleaner. The sauna rooms were very organized and clean. The customer service was really good. There is a lot of facilities within this spa, like 8 types of saunas or sth. There're definitely not as many people as other korean spas I've been to. The food is not that great but the price is alright. I ordered a Strawberry smoothie for around $5 and it tasted like they mixed some sort of soup into the drink. Maybe it's a healthy blend of things, who knows. The kimbap was kind of bland, they put sliced up fishballs in there or sth.. it tasted kind of spoiled.. Overall, the spa was great but just no massages for me, as for the food. I'm sure you can't go wrong with the kalbi, which was $10 but i wasn't that hungry. And just don't get the smoothie, the facilities are great though.It's your standard, run-of-the-mill hotel with all the normal amenities included. Free internet, good deal. Cookies are tasty.
Location is the one advantage it has, that and free parking, even if city parking in Madison is a breeze (less than $10 for 24 hours, yes please!).
It's just so strange to have such a hotel smack in the middle of campus, but that's definitely a good thing.Finally a place to watch local sports with sound.  I always find it unbelievable that many sports bars here in town look past our local teams and support the foreign hoards from Wisconsin, Minnesota, NY, Illinois etc..  Not at Dukes...local first.

Please return to your frozen tundras and leave us with the Suns, Cardinals, Devils and Coyotes.

The food here is nice bar/pub fare and is always fresh and hot.  Drinks are plentiful and service respectable.  Would like to see a little more variety on the taps but other than that Dukes is a great place to catch a game.Great value for lunch!  Quick service......tasty meal.......good prices!Pretty good, especially considering that it's a fast food joint at a hockey rink.My husband being a native New Yorker is always searching for a decent pie. He enjoyed Glass Nickels pizza and plans on coming back. 

I thought it was okay but I am an Ian's Pizza junkie.We went to celebrate a classmate's birthday and had a really good time.  I adored the tableware: it was heavy and had a "medieval" feel.   The lunch special is a really good deal.  I'm not a fan of paneer and that was the day's veggie lunch special, so  I got the veggie wrap instead.  It was excellent!  So were the fries (more fries please!).  The waitresses weren't that personable and although the lunch special includes dessert, they asked my friends if they still wanted it.  Huh? I didn't have a lunch special, so I used my handy dandy Yelp check in offer for a free dessert, so I could get some rice pudding.  I've been eating rice pudding all my life and have had many different versions.  Liquidy rice pudding? No thanks.  Thank God we had a terrific birthday cake.My husband, a Glaswegian, and I decided to check this place out. It is a bit of a drive from our house in North Scottsdale,  but there is such a dearth of places to get a good pint and authentic British food that we made the drive. The restaurant is large and nicely done. It was a quiet Sunday when we went and we both thought that the size of the place and the lack of a crowd made it seem a little cavernous and lacking in energy. Seems better suited for a live music event or busy weekend crowd. The food was good although my husband's steak pie came to the table cold -- we noted that another Yelper commented on the same issue. Once would expect the management to correct something so simple. Another note: How can a pub be a pub without Curry and Chips on the menu!? The service was adequate, if somewhat authentically British.  The staff were pleasant but seemed to be hiding at times. We had to track our waitress down to pay the check. We are looking forward to giving this place another try on a more lively night.Guys in Ed Hardy shirts - check (although less than one would expect at a nightclub named after the Ed Hardy designer)
Weird sunken bar that makes it a tad awkward to order drinks - check
No line and no cover on a Saturday night - check (TI guests - even guys - get in for free)
Good music all night long - check
Plenty of space to dance due to a moderate sized crowd - check
Patio with a nice view of the Strip - check

I wanted to hate this nightclub. I went in expecting it to be douched out to the hundredth degree and it wasn't. Even the clientele was less douche-tastic than I thought. In fact, there is very little about this club that makes it memorable or worth the time to go out of your way to check it out. Go if you are staying at TI. If you aren't, there are better clubs on the Strip.Total east coast dive deli... and there's nothing wrong with that. CCC is a place that has what you're looking for when you need a quick lunchtime meal. Coffee, fresh cookies, daily soup specials, salads, wraps, hot 'wiches. It's all there. While the menu on the wall lists about 20 items, don't be afraid to make a custom sammie. They have a decent selection of breads, meats, cheeses and toppings for you to make a beautiful lil' hoagie for yourself. While nothing will blow you away here, it's nice to know that there's still a sandwich shop in town with a friendly owner running the place and some homemade food on the specials board.Still a fan of Jet, since I like the 3-in-one feel this club has.  But I thought I'd update you guys since I was recently here again for NYE 09.

Overall, the New Years experience was OKAY.....  not the greatest time of my life but I didn't hype it up to be so I'm okay with that.  As usual, I was in LV solo, but that's not gonna keep me inside when the bell strikes midnight.  So I planned ahead to go to Jet, because their management company sent me an email advertising tickets to their new years parties.  Honestly, I kind of sat on the email, didn't respond right away and buy my ticket to Jet New Years because I was undecided between going there and to Tao.  A couple of days before I flew to Vegas, I did respond to the email with my credit card info, blah blah, but I never received a confirmation.  Now, this was mildly irritating and worrisome, because I didn't want to find out later that I bought a ticket at the door in addition to them charging my card.  But it all worked out, I guess, since they never acknowledged the email or charged my card anyway....

So I put on my sequin-ded dress and my good shoes, elbowed my way through the crowd assembling on the street, and made it over to the Mirage.  Now, here's one important IMPORTANT thing to know about Vegas on New Years - as the night goes on and it gets more crowded on the streets, a lot of the hotels periodically close their doors to people entering from the street unless they're hotel guests.  So if you're able to get your hands on a discarded hotel key, do so, or you'll be standing out in the cold like I was (WEAR A COAT).  I waited maybe 15 minutes or so before they finally started letting people into the Mirage, so I suppose it wasn't too bad.  (As a side note, if I had had my Jet ticket ahead of time, I'd have been let in right away)

I walked over to Jet, was able to buy my entrance ticket for $150 at a counter to the side of the line, and I was let in about 10 or so minutes later.  Coat check was an additional $5.  At this point it was after 11pm, and if they were still having the hosted bar they advertised I missed it or walked past - because I definitely paid for my drinks.  So I posted up in the video screen room for a while, migrated to the middle room, and then back to the big room for the midnight countdown.  Which was pretty unremarkable, actually.  There wasn't an abundance of streamers or confetti, and the DJ didn't do a countdown, which was kind of disappointing.  A couple of drunken guys tried to grind on me on the way past, but there was actually a MUCH smaller crowd in here NYE night compared to other nights that I've been to Jet.  This might be because of the admission cost but who knows....

So overall, it was interesting and basically fun, although not the greatest New Years experience I've had.  I had more fun in Tijuana at a $20 entry/ all you can drink NYE party years ago, and I can't help but think if I had traveled with other people and we just stayed outside for the fireworks and stunt jumps we'd have had loads more fun than the clubgoers, with their uncomfortable clothes and shoes and overly ambitious expectations.  I left the club at about 1am, changed clothes, and hit the tables.My friends and I went on a Monday and this place was PACKED! It could have been because a lot of clubs are dark on Mon, but damn that line was long. We were lucky and called early in the day and got on VIP so we got to walk in for free. There are three room (one main dance floor and two smaller ones) and a bunch of different bars. It was really hard to move around and I'm pretty sure by 130-2 it was passed capacity because i couldn't turn my head without bumping someone. My friend got on the stripper pole and that was some fun. Good music, bitchy waitresses and bartenders and ok decor. Not horrible tho.We were staying at the Mirage, so we decided to check out JET.  It was a Thursday night, and there were only a few people trying to get in...no lines.  Since we were guests in the hotel, we got in for free.

SKYY Vodka was doing some promotion that night, so I was able to get a free drink.  There were a good amount of people on the dance floor, but it wasn't that packed.  We walked around to check out the place, and it seemed like an older crowd that night.  I guess Thursday nights aren't poppin' at JET.  

I had a few drinks, danced a little, and then headed back out to meet our friends that were gambling.  This was one of the smaller clubs that I've been to in Vegas, but not bad.  I'm assuming it has more potential on the weekends.We have been fans of Del Dente for years, but our last visit felt like they have slipped a bit in terms of the wait staff.  The pastas we ordered were very good.  Our waitress seemed like she just wanted to get done her shift - didn't seem friendly or attentive.I like this place! It's simple and it delivers what you expect. The burger's are decent and their milkshakes are great! If you enjoy the simple pleasures of a nice burger and milkshake you'll love The Grill!THE place to hangout and get away from your study life in Waterloo. It's got quite a number of brand stores in all diversities. It's also got a movie theatre where you can relax and a food court to fight your hunger if you ever get starving while hanging out there.Went to a company retirement party here, just appetizers and drinks and it was awesome! Too bad the wait staff herded some non-company related customers through the room while the guest of honor was giving his speech.you want a hotel, what really matters?

Cleanliness!!!  5 stars.
Friendly staff.
And they got the really good cylindrical candies... mmmmm.  

ok, now that we got that out of the way.... some funky odors in one of the hallways and elevator at one end of the hall was out of order our entire stay.

i would come back though.  solid price performer.On the way back to the Phoenix airport, George's Gyro's came up on my Yelp.  Willing to give this place a chance! We did have a plane to catch, so we were a bit rushed; service is a tad slow.  Full menu of gyro's falafels, hummus plates, salads, burgers, Chicago hot dogs, pasta dishes (seems unusual for a Greek place) and more.  I had the falafel pita and the Greek salad; pita was fresh, falafels were home made and delicious.  the Greek salad was tasty, greens, dressing, olives, feta, etc.  soooo good. Husband had the chicken sandwich, it had a nice charbroiled flavor and a good marinade, very good.  Sis had the hummus, very tasty, too bad we had no room for dessert!  Place is clean and friendly, service was a bit slip b manageable.It's about time I tried this Mediterranean joint I've passed many times before.  Tonight, I finally decided to try Manna.  It's located in a strip mall with other eateries like Subway, Roberto's, etc.  Here's what I thought about this place:

AMBIANCE:  Well, what can I say...there was nothing that distinguished the inside of Manna from a Roberto's a couple of doors down.  Small tables around the restaurant.  At the back of the restaurant, there's a glass case big enough for lots of trays of desserts.  Unfortunately there was 4 trays top, which took up less than half the case.  I'm going to blame it on the fact that it was early in the evening.

FOOD:  I got the chicken kabobs (grilled chicken breast, long grain rice, flat bread and Greek salad) for $9.95, shish kabobs (ground seasoned beef grilled, long grain rice, flat bread and Greek salad) for $9.95 and the fried zucchini (deep fried zucchini chips, served with a marinara sauce) for $3.99.

The chicken was moist and seasoned lightly.  The rice was a little oily and having the flat bread gives another texture component.  The salad was served with a Greek vinaigrette.  Although the shish kabobs were served with the same sides.  The ground beef, although flavorful, was a little dry.  The zucchini was super crunchy and offered a lot of texture to the dish.  The marinara sauce was really runny, so when I dipped the zucchini chips, nothing really stayed on the chip.  

All in all, the place was a good choice for dinner.  For being a fast food joint, Manna did make a delicious meal.  Kudos for the quick and tasty!Tried Bar Tepo for the first time tonight, thought it was pretty decent. I had heard from a friend that the Brown Sugar Hoisin Chicken Tacos were good so my wife and I tried them off of the tapas menu, they were very good. My wife commented that she would order the tacos from the dinner menu where they are also available. For dinner my wife had the Chicken Caesar Salad, the chicken was cooked very nicely with good seasoning, but the salad itself (at risk of sounding snobbish) was rather pedestrian. I had the Prime Rib Sandwich which was a really a French Dip sandwich. The sandwich was good but in my mind misrepresented on the menu. 

My problem with this restaurant is that it is not sure what it wants to be. The decorating is very high end, but the food we received does not reflect the atmosphere. We will definitely be back and try the food again, hopefully I can raise my rating of this place. I really want it to be good.Looks like a cool place (a lot bigger than it looks on the outside) with a pretty big menu.  Food was pretty average and coffee was as well.

Service was really friendly though.A big group of friends went recently because this was her favorite restaurant of all time.

The food was good but it wasn't anything to write home about. The pasta was really al dente which I liked but I wasn't blown away by the sauce or the meatball. Again, it was all pretty good but it wasn't really worth the high price.

The oreo dessert we got at the end was probably my favorite of all the items we got.

3.5 stars overall but decided to go with a 3 because of the unwarranted high price.Mediocre food in a trendy atmosphere. Expected a good meal, instead got dry and over salted chicken parm. Waiter never checked with us on how the meal was after it was dropped off by the runner. Manager came over with attitude to inquire on our complaint, but barely acknowledged it. Eat elsewhere, then come for the drinks upstairs.The Willow House has lots of unrealized potential.

It looks like a hostel as much as it does a coffeehouse from the approach.  I was expecting to see a garden variety of drifting McCrustersons sprouting from the porch and was queerly disappointed when there was not.

The interior is run-of-the-mill ordinary.  The menu is pretty lean for breakfast; muffin, bagel, or something like a muffin or something like a bagel.

My friend and I got bagels and cream cheese. Her with coffee and I with earl grey.  The bagel was not really toasted enough and the cream cheese was 2 prepackaged "PHILADELPHIA" pouches dropped on my plate.  Jen said the coffee was ok and I suppose I could say the same about my earl grey--simply a tea bag in a mug of hot water.

Despite the subparness of the eats and drinks, there are a few things that are really positive about The Willow House.  Such as:

+++Free Wi-Fi+++
Not only free, but blazing fast Wi-Fi and no silly password or time limits.

+++Vinyl Digging+++
Their is a coat closet filled with 12" albums covering a good range of musics and qualities POOR to VERY GOOD and maybe some NEAR MINT if you really dig. The price was reasonable too with $1 per one or $6 for an entire crate (50+ LPs)!!!

+++Local Resource+++
The local rag is there as well as flyers for DIY shows and even a Crispin Glover speaking event.  This is pretty ordinary, but still always commendable when these types of resources are getting fewer and fewer with big box infiltration.  Not every biz allows free advertising space for DIY artists and musicians.

+++Outdoors***
Red picnic tables are scattered around in the side lawn of The Willow.  True that in Phoenix, comfortable outside dining time is limited. Near these tables there is also this wall comprised of beautiful metal panels all colorfully weathered, rusted, and corroded.  Perhaps I am biased with my unorthodox rust-belt view of what true beauty is.--But I find it so and i write so and so it is.

***Cats***
I am a gigantic catfag in every way.  Outside, next to the picnic tables there was a concrete garden bench and under this bench was. EEEEEKKKK!!!  A mussy mess of black and white cat keeping her cool.  She was a very skanky looking cat and I was smitten.  I instantly made her a little song as I sung to her and took photos . I think, "Dusty Desert Skanky Cat" was part of the lyrics and it was a tad Pete Seger sounding.  I later learned that that was a momma cat that the employees of The Willow House named Thundercat and there are other cats that climb a tree to bathe in the morning.  Yeah, I can see myself returning for the pussy and pussy alone.

I hope that The Willow House uses these posi things to build themselves a better tomorrow.I'm extremely selective on the buffets I will go to. This place was bad the food was bland and just did not taste good at all. There was one thing that I eat that I thought was good it was a turkey stuffing soup. But for close to 25$ the food should of been better. I gave it an extra star because my wife does enjoy the food here.I ordered a pepperoni pizza, garlic knots and chocolate cannoli. I didn't like the pizza. It was really greasy and the bottom of the pizza was soggy. Also the cheese seemed very heavy. The garlic knots were good but different. They seemed fried  rather than baked. The best part was the cannoli! OMG they are to die for!  Next time I'll try a pasta dish rather than pizza.Bacon blue cheeseburger and onion rings with cayenne ranch. Nice location for sitting outside, not a lot of traffic noiseMy boyfriend and I were hungry and wanted a sit down place to relax, eat and get out of the heat for a bit. He suggested Applebee's so off we were to get some grub. I have not been to an Applebee's in a very very long time.

We ordered the two for twenty deal, I got the Fiesta chicken and he ordered the cajun shrimp and chicken dish which includes one appetizer to share so we went with the mild buffalo wings (boneless) with ranch.

The meal was good and the service was pleasant as we had a sweet waitress who called us kids, I thought it was cute. 

I probably won't step foot into Applebee's for another year or so.I got a gel manicure here and I didn't leave impressed. 

On first impression, the salon is larger than many I have been to and everything appears cleans. I arrived without an appointment and someone was there to do my manicure right away, which is also a plus. Also, being at Tempe Marketplace makes it very convenient. However, I felt like my manicure was rushed. The lady trimmed my nails well, as I asked her to do, but I feel like they could have been filed a lot better. Immediately upon getting home I re-filed them myself in order to make them more straight and get rid of some of the sharp edges. I also feel like she missed the sides of some of my nails, as well as some of the tips. A nail or two even look slightly chipped as a result, but my own filing helped correct that some. There was also no massage of any sort, she just put some lotion on in the end, so that was disappointing.  In the end, I don't think it was worth the $30 I was charged. I have been to other places that have done a better, more thorough, job for the same price.While I make no hesitation to criticize some other campus skeezeries on State Street and University Avenue, I am hesitant to do so with the Stadium, because what you see is what you get at the Stadium Bar.  It is your typical sports bar that can be found in towns small and cities large.  There are big screens a plenty, bar food galore, and volleyball in the summer. Game days is when this place truly shines, it's packed with a crowd of many ages and often rooting for opposing teams -- but everyone can agree that they really do need that Leines in a can or to throw up in the porta potty before they do a shot from that grandpa who loves Penn State.

If you're a 45 year old alumni and drunk at 6 am on game day -- The Stadium was BUILT for you. Enjoy!New to Vegas I was looking for Persian food, most of all Kabob. After living in Los Angeles I have had my fair share and know good Kabob and persian food. I decided to order Kabob and gheimeh. The kabob was good but the ghemeh was mediocre at best. The price was certainly higher than what I have paid for in the past, especially given the service and the ambiance.Pretty chill spot. Outdoor patio seating had people. Fourth of July so it wasn't busy. Sat inside and enjoyed the Mac and cheese. No complaints about the food but I wasn't wowed. The service was fine.NIce and clean. Big selection of prepared food. A lot of hard to find items. Expensive as usual.

This is the location they filmed one episode of "Top Chef" from bravo.I chose BLT for my birthday dinner a few weeks ago. We were given a  table with an excellent view and our server started off great. He recommended a few different cocktails and told us about the daily specials.

 

The popovers were amazing and I loved that they gave us the recipe to them. I'm eager to try and recreate these masterpieces in my own kitchen.

My oysters were fresh, the sides we chose (the asparagus and the Potato Gratin) were both were excellent.

 
The only problem was our steaks were barely luke warm when we received them. They were cooked to our preferences, but both were almost cold. We attempted to send them back but it seemed at that point our waiter disappeared. After several minutes of trying to make eye contact with someone working we decided to just eat before the rest of our food got cold.
 
I had great expectations for BLT, unfortunately the cold steaks and lackluster service at the end will not justify a return visit. I'm still going with 3 stars, because steaks aside everything else was great.Grilled Double Cut Bacon for an appetizer....enough said!  Sooooooo Yummy!
Tuna Tartare w/ Avocado & Soy-Lime Dressing.....OMG!!
The steaks and sides are Fabulous!
Everything we had to eat was fantastic....so why not a 4 or 5 star rating?
Well, that would have to be the service.  The service was good, but not what you would expect to have at a 5 star restaurant.  
Also, when we received the bill the staff had added someone else's drink order to it.  Mistake?  Maybe, or a way to give someone great free, on the house service by having someone else pay by slipping it into the bill.  Thank God we check out our itemized bill before we pay!
I won't be back and neither will the other 5 people I was dining with that night because of that, to bad because the food was outstanding!Saturday night, prowling around the Mekong Plaza. I was sadly disappointed by the Tet festival. Determined to have fun regardless I decided to check owhat else the plaza had to offer. I'm glad that I did because this place is filled with hidden gems.

I was drawn in by the window advertisement for boba/bubble tea. I had seen this before on one or another of the discovery/travel channel shows.

After staring at the board forever and asking the poor kid at the register for recommendations I grabbed a honeydew with boba. 

The drink was very fresh and did not taste as if it had added sugar. The boba was a fun experience with a hard to explain the texture. I would say its almost like gummy bear texture but in little round balls. After a few drinks of mine I recruited a friend to come and try another flavor. He got the coconut/pineapple which was the other flavor I almost got. He had zero complaints about his and liked it very much.

The food the other patrons ordered looked and smelled amazing. I wish that I had some more room in me so that I could give it a try. Their menu is HUGE and the prices are very reasonable. I want to get back here sometime with a decent sized group to get a large variety of items.

The front of the store was manned by a Mom,son, and daughter team who were all very nice. The lady even gave this little girl a free bubble tea while I was there.

This could easily be upgraded to a 4+ star if the food tastes as good as it smells.This place is ok, not great and missed the wow-factor for me.  I'm a native, born and raised on carne asada, I'll probably die with a burrito in hand. 

As you will see, there are a lot of gringos in this place at lunch time.  Here's a clue for the white folks, good Mexican foods can be found where the Mexicans eat.  

Again, don't get me wrong, this place is ok... just didn't deserve all the hype.A very popular bakery that serves breakfast bagels and lunch pizza.  You serve yourself and pay into a box.  Get there early, because they run out of their very limited selection quickly.Mixed emotions; decor was nice with comfortable chairs and a nice selection of books. Service was friendly when I could get it - at one point I was the only person in line for 5 minutes, then when others where in line they were helped as if I'd never been standing there. Another time, had to ask twice after a long wait for a beverage, it was never made. First coffee was good, refill was luke warm and tasted like it had been sitting a while. Pastry was decent, wi-fi strength was good.This is why I typically wait until I've been to a restaurant more than once to write a review. Consistency means a lot - I don't care if the service is consistent, but the food should be. Especially if you're trying to sport a "healthy eco-friendly" image capable of reaching naysayer-veggie-haters that have only had bad experiences with healthy cuisine. My experience would certainly not have convinced any timid diners that they should try new foods. Which is unfortunate and makes me sad as a healthy food lover.

My first experience in February was absolutely lovely. Went for a friend's birthday and had the private room in the back. I ordered the green tea soba noodles with tofu and extra veggies - simply delicious. Everything I wanted...light, healthy, flavorful and a good glass of wine to boot. Service was spectacular and dessert was delightful.

My second experience really let me down. Fine if the service wasn't outstanding, I can get over my awkward waitress. The wine was fine. The food was not. I ordered the roasted vegetables with farro. Both the veggies and farro were undercooked and barely lukewarm. I don't like mushy vegetables, but al dente would be nicer to my jaw. And PS - those weren't figs. Definitely not figs.

I'd like to go back and try something else on the menu to see if this was just an off night, so for the time being I will deposit this mediocre review in hopes to have my confidence restored next time.Decent food not amazing, liked the atmosphere however they charge extra for everything. Only one free refill per visit, and extra for the containers to go.The Highs:

- Wide array of events and gigs covered, for all over Scotland (so it's not just a clever name!).
- Tickets available for purchase and/or collection right up until only a couple hour before the actual event.


The Lows:

- Fees are a bit of a joke; booking fees charged per ticket, and also an additional 'collection fee' for tickets purchased online.
- Opening hours aren't very working-class-friendly.
- Given this day and age, they should really have an alternative method of distribution for those unable to get to the office for collection within aforementioned opening hours.

Highs 2/Lows 3

B-I've been here for a couple of nights out and the cocktails are good and the music is cool! A bit crowded and full of a lot of posers taking selfies but if you can handle that then its a good place to start your night!I made up my mind that I would eat fish and chips no more than twice during my eight-day trip to Scotland, and unfortunately I chose the Beehive as one of the spots.  It was okay, just not great.  Everyone expects bland peas, but the fish and chips themselves were boring too.  

However, sitting outside with my meal, beer, and the Daily Independent on a late-May evening when it was still warm and daylight, people-watching the various foot traffic in the Grassmarket--that was one of the most pleasant hours of the vacation. 

One other note--the Edinburgh Literary Pub tour departs from the Beehive.This review is based on several visits as a couple and lastly on a visit with a Christmas night out. of around 30 people. 

American diner, serving American style food in reasonable to big portions. Alongside cocktail and American style beers (and Tennent's)
Should I stop here? I could. Perhaps I should not to put you off. Still interested? OK. 
The place is big, 2 floors and 2 bars and many tables and booths. The main bar on the ground floor is where the till works, the downstairs bar it has been kaput for absolutely donkeys years. So when eating downstairs you need to order at the table (group of 4 or less? no sweat) or go upstairs and wait, wait, wait... wait some more to get served. Just for your information, a corona is £3.95 - yes .. a pint of Guinness is £3.20 - Pretty expensive for an MotR American diner.. We were on a prepaid meal of about 30 people we didn't want the hassle of divvying up the drinks bill so we had to go to the upstairs when thirsty. This lead to many people arriving to cold starters or mains.. 
Granted they offered to open a bill per table, but unbeknownst to us we opted for ordering at the bar..

The food was well received (especially the salmon and pesto pasta) but mostly bland. Or overuse of sauce (do I taste BBQ sauce - again?) salads and coleslaw sides - nah. 

The food service was speedy and accurate (remembering each dish ordered belonging to whomever ordered it as a preorder. well done!)

however i will not be back in a hurry.I love this place, I really do so it pains me to say anything negative about it, but I must admit: the service is below par. They're just .. really, really slow. You can easily stand beside the counter for a couple of minutes waiting for a table, and then have someone pop over to you asking if they can help you with anything (in a slightly puzzled look). Well, since there's a sign asking me to wait to be seated, yes you can!

But the thing that really bothered me the last few times I was here was the lack of hygiene, spotty subject, I know. But when I find dust in my teacup, we've got an issue, and I don't just mean a cleaning issue. We've got a caring issue.
I love this place, but in order for it to be great, the staff must love it as well and take care of it as if it's their own.

Now, this might just have been the winter blues for the past 2 months but come on people, step up your game! I'm rooting for you here!Jenny Ha's is dead; long live Kilderkin.

Okay so not much bar the name has changed it would seem. Layout-wise Kilderkin is still homely, comforting and rustic. Perfectly situated at the bottom end of the Royal Mile, a few strides from tourist-magnet the Scottish Parliament.

Prices seem reasonable and, for the beer drinkers especially, the range seems quite eclectic. Kilderkin seem to have an unofficial relationship with Stewarts Brewery, so expect to see the latter's wares in the chillers behind the bar.

Staff are pretty grounded in a no frills sort of way; not overly friendly, not overly polite, but in now way dismissive or uninviting. It's almost like visiting a relative's place for a beer or lunch, the straightforwardness of their approach. Very refreshing actually.

And so... the food. Kilderkin doesn't sport the most diverse menu, but as the saying goes, it's short and sweet. Scottish gastro classics are present and correct alongside a couple of irregular options such as Quesadillas and Tikka Masala. I would recommend both the Haggis, Neeps and Tatties, or the Kilderkin Burger, a pork and spring onion patty, served on a thick grilled bun. Very tasty indeed. Most mains vary between £4-8.

All in all a decent spot for a quick and cheap lunch. Or a not so quick drink in the warm and comfortable bar.A perfectly serviceable and cozy option on the Royal Mile. It's inoffensive and the tourists will probably love it, as it's stacked with Scottish feeling. 

One niggle is the seating, which I always feel there isn't enough of. The pub itself has a nice atmosphere, but the long galley style means that seating is stacked up against one side of the room and there's not really all that many spots to pull up a pew. 

However, it's a friendly little place, and location-wise is well oriented. Nice spot for a catch up with a friend.I realise that there's nothing that remarkable about a Hard Rock Cafe in itself, or there being one in Edinburgh for that matter, but seeing as they are pretty different depending on what city you're in, I thought this establishment and tourist magnet of worldwide recognition would be worth reviewing.

When I lived in Barcelona for a while, I actually used to hang out in the Hard Rock Cafe there quite a lot, which I never thought I would find myself doing. It turned out that the cocktails were amazing, and just the right level of potent, and the banter was great because there was always such a mix of people milling around. The premises were also huuuuge, and with a pretty striking HQ right on the central square in the middle of Barcelona, it was quite hard not to enjoy the whole thing.

I suppose that's why I find Hard Rock Cafe in Edinburgh a little bit underwhelming, but I suppose it's not totally fair to compare it to the one in Barcelona, it's not its fault it's small and feels a wee bit cramped. The mix of tourists and locals, blasting rock music, huge portions of food and hard hitting cocktails are all here though, and I do enjoy all of those things. Sometimes a large portion of nachos or a hefty burger and chips is just the ticket.Mmmm....pussit.  Love me some purple squid.  Had some chicken caldereta too and it was good.  My mom enjoyed the sinigang and fried tilapia.  Kind of small portions for the price but I guess it's a little more expensive because it's on the strip.  A good selection of to go Filipino food.  Place is clean but nothing fancy.  

Free parking in the back, enter on the small lot right before the Hawaiian Marketplace.My cousin insisted I try the longhorn burger...my mouth was ready but I was disappointed....I broke my diet to eat this burger that was greasy...I can say the sweet potato fries were okHad the Singapore spicy noodle and salt-n-spicy soft shell crab.  The noodle was ok, a bit on the bland side.  The crab was tasty.  It was soggy by the time it was delivered, but I wonder if it'd be crispier at the restaurant.  Price was comparable to other Chinese restaurants at around GBP 7-9 per dish.  I'd give it an extra half stars for its super quick delivery.This little shop seems to cram quite a few books into its space without seeming cluttered.  It is simply wall-to-wall books packed tightly into the shelves.  They also put out a sale box on the stoop without too much fanfare, and are open a bit later than I would expect (it was early evening but I don't remember the exact time).  The proprietor was painfully indifferent on the day that I was there but that's par for the course with bookstore owners.  Lots of fiction here.Quite small and in a fairly grim setting, you can sometimes forget this branch of New Look is so close to the high street. I actually spent a good while over the past fortnight doing just that, and wandered the length of Princes Street twice looking for it.

When I eventually remembered it was here, I was fairly disappointed since it's quite a small branch. Selling a number of really long maxi dresses just now, I've got to say I thought this New Look were selling the cheaper looking stuff that the shop often sells. It's an odd high street store, because you usually can either find some absolutely stunning skirts made of good quality material, or some really naff, fake frilly summer frocks that look like they haven't been ironed. This isn't particularly to do with this New Look, it's common of all of them. It just seemed there was more of the latter on display in this branch, but that's probably to do with the limited space this unit has.

They did have some of their sale stock still available, and their London range can be found at the back of the store which is a good contrast against the heavily pastel coloured window displays. They also had a number of "going out" dresses, high heels and, if you're wanting to go casual, an amazing jeans collection. 

The staff were helpful and really efficient, while also seeming to enjoy their job. That's why I don't want to slag this outlet off too much. It just seems, sadly, that they can't showcase New Look's best bits to their full potential because they are hindered by the size. It would be nice to see this central shop take its place on Princes Street proper, rather than be hunched up in here. I'm not the biggest fan of Princes Mall - it's a bit run down for a shopping centre set in the heart of town, and I feel like this New Look may be overlooked by many because it's stuck in here. If it had room to stretch out and sell a more extensive range of clothing  that the other stores boast, it would fair better. Move to Princes St, you will prosper!Awesome experience. Everything is ice, even the cups! 

From my druken memory i believe it was $75 total wait, or was it $85 (uh oh) , for two people.
 This includes two drinks per person and they provide a jacket and slippers also.
1. Fruit fusion - fruity and wasn't too strong.
1. Icy margarita - you can definitely taste the alcohol .

They have this outrageous rule that doesn't allow you to bring your camera inside because they claim that the " condensation" will mess it up. BULLCRAP. If that was the case, then WHY do they take pictures with their cameras inside and charge 20 dollars per picture.  In other words, they want to make more money by lying to you. hahahaa. We didn't believe it and took a few pictures with our own camera til we were forced to put it into the locker. ( the pictures and the camera came out fine) hehee. 

Overall, a pleasant experience.  Something to definitely stop by and try with a date or a group of friends.  

1 out of 5. 5 being the highest.
Drinks - 3.5
Ambiance - 4
Price - DecentIt's hard to know where to start with this review, because there was nothing that hugely stood out as being wrong with the 2 times I've eaten here. It's just that there was also nothing that stood out as being fantastic about them, either.

Maybe I'm too picky; they already have 4 branches across Edinburgh and one in Aberdeen, so they're obviously doing something right. I'd say this is most likely to be down to the the emphasis placed on local ingredients from local suppliers. For example, in my Trio Of Seafood starter, the "fragrant poached salmon" that came alongside the pickled herring and seared scallops was one of the nicest bits of salmon I've tasted in a long time. Likewise, my main course of Lamb Rump was sourced from the scottish borders and was extremely well-cooked.

That aside, when you scan down the menu you can't help but think that none of the dishes are particularly any different to what you'd find in any british restaurant, regardless of where the actual ingredients come from: other options for main course were a beef steak burger with blue cheese served with chips, or a butternut squash gnocchi dish served with grated parmesan on top... hardly anything hugely imaginative and yet you'll still pay up to £17 for a main/£7 for a starter.

Don't get me wrong, both times I've eaten here have been good. It's just that "good" is about as excited as you can get. In somewhere like Bruntsfield, which has so many restaurants, bistros and brasseries, Howies does seem to fade from your memory fairly quickly after you leave.Just make sure you have time on your hands to get to see this tour. We arrived and it was booked for 3 hours. Luckily it was lunch time so we headed over the road and came back for our tour. 

The tour itself was fun, the guide in full period costume was the daughter of Old Mary who the close is named after. She really hammed it up and played the part very well while taking us one a tour round the close. Initially is was a bit disorientating what the close was with the rooms you went in first and I didn't fully understand the l;ayout until the end when you get to the street.

Surprisingly, I learned a lot about the history of Edinburgh and it gives you a real feel for the people of the time. There are also sound effects, life-size recreations and eerie lighting, and jumpy bits. We only spent about five minutes in the actual close but it was very interesting although I was not bothered about getting a photo. That being said, it was very entertaining and I would go back next time we have visitors. The gift shop was also really good with some great souvenirs.A mishmash of just about any household item you could possibly get your hands on lies in this tacky, musty smelling establishment.  If your in need of cheap ironing boards, light fittings, stationary etc then it's worth having a good old root around this place. 

Patrons should be weary that it's not quality that this place aims for, more like quantity. I bought a £3 landline telephone from here once and it's managed to stay intact and in good working order throughout many of the flats I've lived in whilst in Edinburgh.

Perfect for those cheap temporary items that will do until you can afford the better quality replacement.The tights they sell here are the kind of tights that could give a grannie a headache. I'm not a fan, but that's because I'm easily visually affected by bright things. For example, girls who walk around in so much fake tan they look like doritos. Or neon pink. They both scare me. 

But Pie in the Sky actually has a pretty cool range of clothing. I don't go often for the same reason I never go often to places that sell pretty things I can't afford. I mean, they once upon a time had a sales box and I got myself a dress from there, but that's only because it cost a fiver and I could afford to do that. It's definitely a great place to go if you feel like you can splurge.This place is overpriced but yummy. We came here on a whim for lunch and the service was great and there is a wide selection of margaritas to choose from which is nice. The white peach was very good!

The little tacos are not worth 13-15 for three though. I dunno, they were okay but could use some sour cream and guacamole..., just my opinion. 

The spareribs were yummy and we ordered the appetizer sampler which we didnt eat the tamale, it wasn't all that great, but the litle taquitos and nachos were.

Come here with an open mind and you will be okay!Came here with a bachelorette party of 9.  The atmosphere leaves much to be desired, but it did fit with the utilitarian feel of the Luxor.  We were hoping for a lively vibe, but it was pretty quiet and dull.  The food was decent.  I had the chicken enchiladas.  They were good.  The chips and salsa were pretty good.  I won't be rushing back here.For quite a few years I dismissed River Island as a shop selling over priced, cheap looking clothes to chavs and tarts. This branch was given a make-over relatively recently and since then, my opinion has been changed. The brand seems to have taken a different, edgier direction - some of the clothes put me in mind of All Saints, but without the exorbitant and unjustifiable prices. I bought some fantastic mid length lace-up boots (very similar to an All Saints pair) in October and they were barely off my feet until they fell apart a few weeks ago; I walk everywhere, so six months is a good innings for footwear. There's no student discount, but there are some excellent sale bargains to be found if you can be bothered rifling through the rails - a few months back I found a pair of smart harem pants for £2.Situated in the Southside is this handy wee stationery shop. There aren't enough stationery shops like Newington Stationers. I love stationery! Seriously once for Christmas when I was a child I just asked for stationery. One of the best Christmas' ever. 

I digress. In fact I am surprised there aren't more stationery shops, especially in studenty areas. Unfortunately this isn't  really a student stationers. Despite what others have said, when I ventured in the stock seemed to be lacking.  I didn't find a wide selection of all kinds of pens, protractors and quality notebooks. Instead expect more newsagents standard. A few pencil case basics, some standard paper plus some birthday cards and other bits and pieces. Newington Stationers doess offer a handy scanning and printing services.

This isn't a bad shop though, as long as you know what to expect you won't be disappointed.My brothers were obsessed with roller blading. They've moved onto snowboarding you'll be glad to know, but it meant that a lot of my youth was spent in here. 
This is your typical skateboard shop. Full of Japanese names and baggy jeans, if you're going through puberty / never really grew up this is your place.This place used to be a cool little joint just down the street on King that had a lot of character. Now, it's still the only place to get decent sushi in Madison. I really like sushi, so I went somewhat regularly over my 4 years in Madtown, but if you're not from the Midwest, then you will not be impressed.The food and serivce was great- very fast service.Food was awesome! However could have been much better service. We were last party to eat and my friend appetizer which was the 1st item ordered was totally dismissed.pretty good food here, the brownie dessert was fantasticOur company Christmas party was held here. I wasn't impressed by a few things. 

First we awoke at 7:14 am to someone pounding on the door and attempting to put a key in!!!  My husband quickly demanded an answer as to who it was from our side of the door and a hotel employee explained he was sorry that it was an error and the system shows this room as available and he was trying to show a guest to their room. We laid back down and the employee continued to have a very LOUD conversation over his two-way radio with the office to figure things out. Hello people!!!!  It's 7:15!  I could have stayed home and slept in later than this!  After about 10 mins of this (now the customer is arguing with the hotel employee because he's angry) my husband finally asked them to "take it somewhere else so we could sleep".

We lie back down and try to go to sleep. Upon starting to doze suddenly the TV automatically turns on with the volume extremely loud!  The remote was literally across the room so there is no way we even touched it!  Weird. 


Now wide awake on my one day to sleep in I decided I wanted to make coffee... it took me forever to find the Keurig stored away in a cabinet below the TV. It was a large tray that contained the coffee maker and condiments. There was no place to plug it in!  I literally had to move a dining chair over to the wall near an outlet so I could make coffee. Whew!  That was an ordeal but coffee was brewing and I would soon be enjoying a cup on the balcony. NOT!  No creamer. Nope not any creamer of any kind to be found. Period. So I decide upon coffee via room service or at least some creamer!  I can't find the menu. I call down to dining and she explains that the menu is on the TV. Fine. I fiddle around with that for about 5 more mins and finally get the menu up. It's impossible to see because it is in extremely small black font. (Not very well thought out for a resort of this cost!). 

Forget it....we will go to the dining room Prado. We shower and off we go. We get there and the host isn't anywhere to be found. At this point I seriously need coffee so we seat ourselves and wait. The host now sees us (Frank) and comes over and introduces himself and in a very confrontational manner says "what is your last name and room number please."  We tell him and he marches off check it out to be sure we are credible. 

After all of that I am waiting for this resort to call and let me know that they owe us a free night!  I think it's the least they can do. And they should include a couples massage package so my next review will be singing their praises rather than this type of review!  Make it right Montelucia!  We are counting on it.Good place to take someone that can eat a ridiculous amount of food. The waiters hovered which was kind of annoying. Sangria was ok. They really pushed it and was a bit over priced. Otherwise the meats were good. Some kind of bland. Salad bar was nice but don't bother eating too much over there and wait for all those meats. Earlier the better. It gets a tad crazy there and you have to wait for the good stuff. You can request something on the list but dont hold your breath. They never did get back to us once it started getting busier so we just paid and left. Was an experience but just ok. Lamb chops were my favorite.We enjoyed lunch here last weekend. I liked the complimentary Parmesan potato chips and thought the Indulge cheeseburger I had was good. I would go back to try some other menu items. I thought service was good and liked the decor. If you are in the neighborhood it is worth a try to see how it measures up to your tastes...indulge yourself.OK. The owner contacted me and was rather disconcerted about my one star rating and review. He should genuine interest in ameliorating the problem and expressed thanks for my review information to help him do so. He seems to be an owner who really does care and doesn't just discount a review as "some idiot out there" as many owners do. I raised the review from 1 to 3 stars because of his pro-activeness. He offered for me to come in when he was working to discuss the matter further. I will probably go back in again and amend the score if it warrants.My husband and I came here for lunch the other day after we had heard some good things from co-workers. I feel like this place is trying to be a hip and gourmet burger joint - sort of like Delux Burger - but falls short. The location is decent and I like all the windows. The color scheme is blue and there's plenty of burger artwork inside. However, the inside seems a little cramped. You definitely have to do some maneuvering to get to a table all the way in the back of the restaurant (or the restrooms). There are plenty of tables and a short booth section, but then there are screens than hang from ceiling to floor and that makes it even more difficult to navigate. Lucky for us, we sat all the way in the back and had to do some fancy dancing to get back there. 

The waitress was nice and attentive. She answered any questions I had about the burgers and was quick to take our order. They have a lunch special for $9.95. This includes a burger (or sandwich), fries, and a drink. You have to choose from a list of burgers/sandwiches, but they have a wide variety. I thought about getting the chicken or veggie sandwich, but went with the standard classic - cheeseburger. I ordered sweet potato fries and since it comes with a drink, received an ice tea. My husband ordered almost the same, but got regular fries instead. 

Our food came rather quickly and looked good. The patty was a little thinner than my husband normally likes, but compared to some places it was decently sized. The flavor was good - tasted meaty and no real spices. I liked the cheese they used, real cheddar cheese, and I think this was my favorite part of the burger. My husband didn't really care for his burger, wishing it had more flavor. His fries were okay - nothing special. However, I really liked my sweet potato fries, which came with a cinnamon marshmallow sauce. The sauce, I didn't really care for. It was waaay too sweet and looked unappetizing.  

Overall, I don't know if we'd come back for lunch, unless we were in the area. The happy hour looked decent and I do love an adult milkshake (or just a chocolate malt!) so I might come back to try. I might not indulge with burgers, but I definitely can try with dessert!My friends and I were in town for Spring Training and were looking for breakfast place walking distance to the stadium.  DD caught my eye on N. Scottsdale Rd. since it was bustling with action.  Tired and slighty hungover we gave it a shot and were pleasantly surprised with the food.  I thought the food was good and the service was very good.  Attentive server who as friendly and got our day off to a good start.  One thing I can't be sure of is if the Spring Training crowd slowed the kitchen down.  The food did take over 20-25 min to come out but when your having a bloody mary and trying to remember things from the past night that wait goes by fast!When Cafe Carumba closed last year I started going to Daily Dose. They have good food, a nice (but small) patio, and a good location. I normally come here for breakfast during the week because it's less busy and crammed. They have a very small patio so on the weekends it feels like there is no breathing room and you're forced to listen to five other conversations going on around you at other tables. The service also gets really slow on the weekends. I was there one Saturday and I actually got my food before my mimosa. And that's not because the food was quick, actually I remember the food taking a long time too. I had to order my second mimosa when the server dropped off the first one just to make sure it came before our meal was over. Pity too because I absolutely love mimosas and would normally drink more than just two with breakfast. So far everything i've tried at Daily Dose has been pretty tasty. They've got a great pancake selection, and you have the option to have them made from a honey wheat batter. As for lunch, I always get the same thing. It's a grilled chicken sandwich on a deliciously soft pretzel bun. It's the pretzel bun that keeps me coming back. Normally, I would branch out a little and try other lunch entrees. As for the service at Daily Dose, it's always the same. The servers always seem annoyed. I actually went there this morning with a few girl friends and we ordered hot chai teas that came room temperature. We told the server they weren't hot and asked her to please warm them up for us, we even told her she could nuke them in the microwave and she told us they didn't have a microwave and then asked us if we had tried them yet. Of course we tried them, that's how we know they are not hot. I don't think i've ever really had good service there. Of course, despite all that I still go to Daily Dose on a regular basis. They've got good food, free wi-fi, and a good location.I had a good time there, the brunch was good, was fun and it was a lil different. the service was not so bad. it is kind of small, so we had to wait 25 mnts for our table. they should have a bigger waiting room than that little room that fits 5 people. i would go back, just earlier. again good breakfast big, u can even share it HA, the food tasted fresh, the juice was maybe fresh squeezed..... sure will be back .!!This is probably the only decently good quick place to eat at when staying at the palazzo. I've had a couple of things here before on the togo menu; the fettuccini alfredo which taste dry and thick, but the chicken is good if you add it in, could probably feed two people, any of the pizza selections are pretty good, chicken bites are satisfying and will do your stomach some justice before heading out. While dining in, the menu is huge, honestly there is so much to choose from, I kind of see that as a bad thing, makes people take a long ass time to order, but I ordered the Zen noodles which was like thai noodle soup, it was ok, soup was pretty decent, they don't pour all the soup in and leave it in a cup in case you want to poor the rest, it isn't huge, but I didn't expect that it would be.Wife and I tried it out today with mixed reviews. I had the gyro, which came with a small amount of fries. The gyro was very good. The fries not so much.
The gyro had lots of meat and small amount of the rest of the filling. At many places it's the opposite.
My wife had the deluxe combo (which I intended to sample), that had chicken, beef, pork, with rice and Greek salad and a pita.
The beef, which was tasty, was stringy and super tough, so denture wearers, steer clear of it ;-)
The pork, again while tasty, was 80 percent fat, with a bit of edible meat.
The chicken, once again tasty, was very dry. 
The salad and rice were OK.

The gyro was $9 dollars and the combo, 13+. Way too much for the overall quality of the food.

My impression, being an excellent cook, is that the recipe and flavour was good, but they used the least expensive cuts of meat which plummeted the overall quality.

So it's yes to the gyro, but no to the chicken, beef, and pork.I have to say I was a little disappointed with XS. First they made all of my girls pay (we were 6 girls) a high cover. Not cool when drinks are $18 bucks a pop or over!

Second the dance floor was a hot mess with no hot men in sight. I don't know if it was an off day or Paris Hilton scared everyone away, but it's summer time on a Saturday night....where are the good looking guys? 

Oh and let me mention the $18 drink that had almost no booze, and I'm talking about an AMF here. I'm a small girl and I couldn't even feel it's effect.

On the bright side, they had their hot tub going so I could chill and put my sore feet in after dancing for 6 hours. Dancing on the pool steps was also plus.

We finally found a chill spot near the back of the club where we could spread out and dance, talk and drink. The music finally started getting good around 3 in the morning and lasted about an hour then it went back to the top 40 hits....blah.

Over all, unless they are willing to work with more hosts to be on guest-lists, I'm not coming back.Dazbog Coffee is locate inside The Great Indoor and serves really good coffee. As I've said in my other review, I come here a few times a week and always enjoy the folks behind the counter and the pastries. They also have a flat screen tuned usually to the Food Network or the Golf Channel.Went here on a Wednesday evening after flying for 4 hours from Chicago to AZ: I was hungry and wanted a drink, and was in town for work, but wanted to hang with my friends as well.

long story short: the drinks were weak, the food was awesome (shrimp tacos were infinitely better than I imagined they would be at such a place), it got insanely crowded after about midnight.

If you don't look like a douchebag or aren't wearing heels and a miniskirt you might feel slightly out of place, only reason this place is getting a decent rating is because the tacos were awesome and they have a nice patio.  Get there early if you want to have a good time free of stilettos and sunglasses worn at night.I've been here several times and overall the food is very good.

Sandwiches and burgers in the $7-8 dollar range are above average. I recommend the triple decker reuben sandwich- lots of good quality corned beef- ask them for the dressing on the side though as they tend to drown it. Burgers are good- recommend the patty melt. Downside is the fries are sub par.

I've also tried a couple of their Chinese dinners and they aren't too good IMO- pass on those.

Service is typical Vegas- hit or miss and usually at a snails pace.

The restaurant can get very crowded during peak meal times.This place has come a long way from the early days of the "South Coast" hotel and casino. Back then, after being only open a few weeks, I experienced terrible customer service and mediocre food.

Last night, my cousins and I wanted some late night steak and eggs, so we picked the South Point. I was surprised at the quality of food. The cut of New York steak was visibly better than some others I've had lately. It wasn't the most tender on the inside, but still good. In any case, it's easily one of the better steak and egg graveyard specials in town. My cousins also seemed to enjoy the items they ordered. In particular, they were impressed by the vanilla ice cream.Jack in the Box like most fast food restaurant seem to be hit or miss. All while being completely random when that is. 

Some days, very same jack in the box food can be good. With great service.  On other dayss, at the very same jack in the box the food can be nasty and service down right horrible.

Simply put it's a gamble whenever you go. 

This one is no different.  On some days my order is perfect.  Other days, I cant help but wonder if the food I was given had been sitting in the trash bin and it was served up to me.

Service years actually mostly good. That is always a plus. Getting in and out of the drive through is painless and they always have great shakes. 

Seen that things are always random,  you're pretty much going to be gambling when food and service is good and when it not. So you are on your own.Another food outing with my OG Ryan B and we decided breakfast for lunch was the way to go. We arrived around 12:45 and they weren't busy at all, which is always a plus when I have time constraints. 

Service was friendly and our food came out at lightning speed. I got the avocado and bacon omelette with wheat toast and cottage cheese. I ordered the cottage cheese since I really don't like the potatoes they are famous for but I was a little disappointed to find out that they put that same paprika or whatever it is on the cottage cheese so I'll have to make sure I tell them to skip the seasoning on my next visit. The omelette was good albeit a little too much cheese was added for my personal taste. Another thing I'll have to be a little more careful with how I order my meal for the next time. 

Overall our meal was good and very basic for a breakfast.Saito's is located in an area that seems to be a bust, or at least slow to take off.   The location is unfortunately in the pretencious City North, a small strip of restaurants and posh shops just North of Desert Ridge, which gets tons of traffic.  To survive there, they'd have to keep the prices reasonable, which they have.  A friendly lady named Linh greeted us on multiple occasions, I believe she is related to the original owners back in Florida.  The great thing about Saito's is that they are still independently owned by the same owners, which means, more hands on management, which is needed in this Phoenix market.  

The food was good, the fish is fresh, though the presentation of most dishes a little plain.  The uni is not always available, which tells you about what kind of sushi lovers are in the area...  

They do serve these lobster puffs for about $8, they are are good, they arrive at the table hot and with a sweet sauce that complements the cream cheese to the tee.  

Strange things though... The Japanese daicon was missing.  On all the dishes at one point, no dicon.  Dicon is crucial to cooling off the mouth from a good chunk of Wasabi! 

Overall this place is huge with an impressive bar, the food is well priced, it does have a good a la carte menu.  Let's hope that they can make it on a strip that has vacant lofts above restaurants and businesses, if you want good attention from the staff go for lunch.Food is tasty and the anticipation of what the next course will be makes for an interesting evening.  A 5 course meal is the minimum, first course appetizer last course dessert. Not a place to go if you have a hearty appetite you may be satisfied but you'll be hungry in an hour,  Restaurant week was a good time to try it out  but we won't be going back anytime soon.The World's end is one a pub I have visited quite a few times during my time in Edinburgh. Always busy, this pub has a very cosy atmosphere with it being split in two with both a restaurant and bar part. The bar section is small but provides a great selection of real ales and drinks. Seating is also at a premium so if you come late in the evening it is unlikely you will get a seat. 

The restaurant on the other side is also snug, with the warmth from the kitchen being felt through the entire place. The food is very good in here, slightly expensive but well worth it in my opinion. The burgers are very filling and come with generous portions of chunky chips! The fish and chips are good but the fish, when I have been there is always slightly over done! 

A great bar, and a bar which must be on your list of places to visit on the Royal Mile!Taste: 3.5
Creativity/Authenticity: 3
Atmosphere: 4
Service: 3
Bang for your buck: 2

When your hungover as F*#K and in caesars palace this is the place to go to get some hot soup to cure that hangover! been here many times cause im way to hung over to go anywhere and room service doesn't have what you need. soup, noodles everywhere, if your looking for it they probably have it, chinese noodles and soup and chinese food only though (THEY NEED TO SERVE PHO) but anyways i always start with the chinese breadsticks or donut?! than won ton soup with egg noodles cant go wrong, they def use out of the packet egg noodle but its still good, i haven't had any problems with food here but the service is pretty bad; you order, get your food and thats it you will not see your server till your ready to pay? weird or coincidence? Anyways i only go here when im hungover so i cant really give the best rating but so far ive had a decent experience so nothing bad to say hereThought this place was pretty good but I have had better.  My friend ordered the brisket noodle dish and felt that all the meat was fatty and didn't it any of if.  However, the broth and noodles were tasty.  I did enjoy the steamed shrimp dumplings...they were very good.Solid breakfast joint off the Strip. French toast is the best thing we tried. But the breakfast burrito is good too. 

The service is outstanding and they do a good job in keeping the place clean. Other places had a wait of about 30min but this place had us wait a good 20. 

Plenty of strip mall parking.The main reason to miss a star is that the one that we ordered (the mint-lamb) was a bit dry to my taste and no mint to taste at all. For desert we had the apple one and that was much better. I'd like to try a different one some other time and compare :).

Good environment, and for groups, friendly staff who would explain you what they are cooking!!I am a fro-yo junky, so I was excited to enjoy some FROZEN yogurt on a nice chilly evening.

I was excited to see what flavors they had for me to drool over, but was highly disappointed.  Their apple pie flavor tasted more like pumpkin pie, egg nog was way too sweet, chocolate wasn't chocolatey at all...so I opted for the plain tart.  

Thankfully they had some mango boba and lychee so I was able to satiate that craving.  

We were going to sit inside, but the tables were pretty dirty so we opted to sit outside under some of those portable heaters.

The yogurt is good, they have a decent variety of toppings, but I suggest some more variety of flavors...that is all.I was happy when I came across this little spot not too far from my gate. I ordered a killer breakfast sandwich... when I say killer I mean it. This thing was HUGE. It was on a pretzel bun which was tasty but there was honestly about 8 eggs worth of egg... I mean I guess that is good value. Who complains about too much food right? Well I had to toss a bunch of egg in order to fit this bad boy in my mouth but it was delicious.Person 1: "So, where do you want to go to lunch?"

Person 2: "Hmmm.  I'm not sure"

Person 1: "Want to go to Paradise?"

Person 2: "Naaah, we've been there three times recently."

Person 1: "What about Subway?"

Person 2: "I'm so damned tired of sandwiches. . ."

Person 1: "Well, here's Qdoba."

Person 2: "Qdoba?  Okay, I haven't been there in a while.  We can get in and out pretty quickly and get back to work."

That's pretty much how it is.  Nobody really plans to go out and eat at Qdoba.  It's one of those places you decide to go to on the fly or because you've eaten everywhere else.

The Mexifood is fair.  Nothing special, nothing bad, nothing to distinguish it.  There's tons of Mexican joints within ten miles that are better, but Qdoba's here in this strip mall.  Haven't eaten here in a while and don't want to drive any further?  This will make a nice alternative, and then you'll be good on this place for another six months or so. . .WE had lunch here because we were in the neighborhood.  Not really our part of town.  We had the $5.75 lunch special, there were 35 choices available!  The restaurant is next door to Chandler BBQ and a nail shop in the Fry's strip mall.  It had half dozen tables but did a bang up take out business.  The place was very clean and the padded chairs were comfortable.  You help yourself to plastic tableware and your cold drinks, straws and fortune cookies.  A similar but much better restaurant would be The Red Dragon about  5 miles north on Alma School Rd.  We had the Orange Chicken which was made with dark meat chicken instead of breast and the sauce was not spicy as indicated on the menu.  It came with 2 tiny pieces of broccoli.  We also ordered pork Egg Foo Young, getting 2 approximately 4 inch pancakes filled mostly with onions and a few tiny pieces of bbq pork.  The brown sauce was served separately  in a paper soup bowl, was a bit pale and didn't have that rich taste I am accustomed to.  The egg foo young was tasty.  With both lunches we chose the pork fried rice (tasted nice, not greasy, large portion) and egg rolls (hot, crunchy, not greasy and rich tasting).  Overall the management was friendly and efficient, parking was easy.  I might go back and try some different dishes, they rate 3 to 3 1/2 stars.For a place called express this place is slow as molasses. I got a combo plate with Kafta and chicken and my buddy a chicken wrap. Took almost 30 minutes to get out food and this was with the place mostly empty at 8pm on a thursday.

The food was very good when we got it but the wait was just too much to overcome.I give Thai Rama 3.5 stars.

A couple of weeks ago, my Denver friend was still in town, and we really like Thai. Had been searching for Thai Elephant because of yelp reviews, but gave up and got desperate and actually located Thai Rama.  The servers were all clearly ASU students and several were working on homework. We came in at a really random pre-dinner hour on a Sunday so we were the only people there, but that was alright.  Prices were reasonable, and service was obviously fast... however, I was deciding between the yellow and panang curry, chose the yellow eventually but was served the panang.  It's okay, though because it was truly delicious... but she didn't really listen to me.  My curry was substantially better than my friend's pad thai, which was very hot, as she requested (two-star "thai hot") but kind of had a strange flavor, different than other pad thai we have tasted.  It wasn't awful by any stretch, but paled in comparison to my awesome panang curry.  The flavor was second to none, and panang curry is one of my favorite comfort foods.  The restaurant itself wasn't special, though the ambiance wasn't too bad.  I'd come back for an inexpensive date night or to have a quick bite with my friends... not to impress any Thai connoisseurs, though.Ok place to grab a good meal.  The place was packed on a Monday night with a short wait.  The salad was ok and the bread, oil, and spices were great.  My meal didn't come out so good.  I ordered the Penne Franco with whole wheat pasta.  The menu said any pasta can be whole wheat...such a deal!!  I was excited.  When my meal came out it was regular pasta.  I asked about it and they said they could remake it, make it to go, or ask to speak to a manager.  I spoke to the manager and she agreed to comp the meal.  I can't believe you can't get what you order here.  She said they only have spaghetti in whole wheat...I don't care!  What a mess.Quite good.  A bit pricey and it was dead when I was there.  That's never a good sign.  The only real complaint is that all the food seems to have meat in it.  Can't you make a couple vegetarian dishes?I LOVE casino coffee shop food!!   It is what it is, so there are NO complaints.  Omelets, hash-browns, toast and coffee--all went down smooth!Scramble has a really cute layout and color scheme like all the other breakfast joints: 
Very clean and hip
I had the impression that it was a sit down restaurant but it's an order and seat yourself sort of deal... It got a little bit packed and was kinda hard to find a seat but we managed to find one... 
I got a coffee, the breakfast blend...
And the Costa breakfast burrito which came with potatoes
The burrito itself was really good and flavorful
I didn't like the potatoes, so I just let them sit there 
The service was a little slow but not a big deal at all, I'm very patient and I saw how busy it was
All of the girls working were very friendly and cute
It was a good first experience and maybe next time I will try the breakfast pizzaLunching with my OG Ryan B, we were on the search for something different. I have been to other Ohana locations, but had never tried this location on Eastern. 

I was craving kalbi, so we decided to give this place a try. They have a very extensive menu and plenty of great lunch specials. You can get pretty much every plate in mini / lunch or full size. I came in knowing I wanted kalbi, but I was almost swayed by all the other great options. I eventually went with my initial craving and got the kalbi. 

The food was ready quickly and we grubbed and chatted while we ate. The atmosphere is really nice. Clean and comfortable. I wasn't too in love with the kalbi, wishing it was a little more flavorful, but overall it was still a tasty meal. Not the best I've ever had, but I'll probably be back to try some of their other lunch menu options.My stay at Aria over the weekend was OK but not excellent.  This hotel was really crowded, and they ran out of rooms with double beds and rollaway beds.  Despite we booked our rooms for double occupancy, we did not get it and people in our party had to sleep on couches and on the floor.  I think the hotel still needs some time to run its operation smoothly.

Pros:
- Decor was contemporary.  Everything was new.
- High tech features in the rooms.  You can choose to open the curtain, turn on the TV with a specified channel, and turn on all the lights when you set the alarm clock.  I felt like a queen when I was woken up in style.
- The bath was in the shower.  Interesting design but nice.

Cons:
- Hidden hotel elevators.  We walked pass the elevator banks a couple of time because they are hidden behind the chocolate shop.
- The layout was not clear.  We did not know that there was another side of the casino hidden behind the Players Club until after we checked out.
- No covered walkway from Aria to Crystals Shopping Center.  You have to walk outside to go to the next building.
- $30 to use the fitness center.  The machines and equipments were upgraded from those in the 24-hour fitness.  But nothing special that was worth paying $30 a day to use the facility.Humm.. Well the view was pretty nice.. The kid that parked my car was a doll and kept it up front just like I asked him to. The door man was uh, pretentious and unimpressive. Not sure this would be my ideal living arrangement, food shopping would be a huge pain in the butt, if they close the strip (and they do) you are in it to win it, and STUCK until it reopens, no thanks. If you are a young professional and you can walk to work from here it might be fun for a bit..I definitely think the pizza is flavorful and portions are adequate, however every time I've gone to this location the waiter/waitress has messed up some part of my order. They are personable and nice, but that doesn't compensate for the fact they have never gotten a simple order correct. The service time is poor and the Resteraunt is noisy. But I would go back because of sheer flavor!What can I say, great coffee! I have to be gluten free so I couldn't have the heavenly belgian waffle that everyone is talking about. My wife did and said it truly is heavenly (making sure to rub it in that I couldn't eat it - Grrr!). It was a little frustrating to only really have one thing on their menu that I could order to eat and when it came, I was able to eat it in like 4 bites. It's ok though, I enjoy the place, the atmosphere and next time, I'll come JUST for the coffee cuz ... well... that was great!When you taste the food it takes you to HEAVEN!  Service is so SLOW it takes you to HELL! cant complain about the food. The best Filipino food this side of town. But as i said all the cooking and serving happens at a snail's pace. If you arrive really hungry, prepare to have ULCERS before they bring in your first order. Their sizzling  beef bulalo is 3 out of 5......only because the steak plate it came in was off the shelf-cold and there was no sizzle at all when they served the dish. the meal was good though so i guess that pretty much offsets the lack of SIZZLE in their so-declared SIZZLING bulalo.
Their sizzling fish belly (bangus fish) is EXCELLENT.supposed to be a five but again there was no physical sizzle to what they call Sizzling Bangus Fish.
Their sizzling BISTEK (beef slices) with onions were GOOD. Except for the lack of sizzle.....but again the taste covers up for the missing SIZZLE.
Their tapsilog (beef and egg combination) and bangsilog (fish and egg combination) is supreme and their banana fritters which they call TURON takes you to unparalleled heights of gastronomic nirvana!
They have karaoke which we enjoyed except for the fact that their song selection is so VERY LIMITED.not enough songs. Asian Bistro MUST improve their song selection because their song selection is similar to what a lot of Asians have for HOME USE. There were also some problems with the karaoke system.Sometimes the songs had too slow a tempo....sometimes the tempo was too fast......this so seriously needs to be addressed. Their karaoke is on every wednesday and Friday nights. I wish they would turn it into an every night thing but only AFTER they work on improving and widening their song selection and gets a karaoke jock that actually is musically adept enough to know if the tempo is just about right or if it is way too fast or way too slow. Doesnt take a musical Mozart to be aware of this. It just takes two unclogged healthy ears.
Prices are reasonable.the people were friendly....aint surprished cuz i have read that people from the Philippines are a smiling lot and merrily go about their ways........
Even if their karaoke sound system sucks and even if they dont have the actual sizzle to their 'sizzling" food line-up, this doesnt take away the fact that this is still the best tasting Philippine food this side of the valley.I have been on a mission of sorts to find the best fry bread in the city. This wasn't it, unfortunately. The owners were nice but not too upbeat. The restaurant itself is in a small plaza that is easy to miss when driving by (I know because I've driven by it about 100 times and never noticed it). The interior of Sacred Hogan is a bit run down but appears to be pretty clean. 

I ordered red chili beef stew with plain fry bread. The serving size was fine, but a bit expensive for what it was. I felt like the stew was something I could make at home and probably with more flavor. The fry bread was ok but greasier and chewier than I like.

I might go back to try the tacos or burgers, but I won't be in a hurry to do so.I remember once going into a newly refurbished bar with a friend of mine.  It was beautiful and clean, but she was unimpressed.  "I don't like it," she said.  "It doesn't have character yet." And so it is with Goodyear's new ballpark.  It's fresh and clean and oh-so-sterile. It doesn't even have advertising yet.

And for now, it basically feels like an unfinished Chipotle restaurant.  Fake brown paneling, and lots of silver, gray, and clear tin and other galvanized materials.

The positives: great sightlines, roomy concourse, and lots of amenities for kids, and ... it's a ballfield.

The biggest negative: on the day we went, Cleveland pitchers gave up 17 runs against Milwaukee.  All while Hall of Famer Bob Feller, who recently turned 90, was watching from the stands. It was a miracle the old man didn't have a heart attack.Came to the Cheesecake Factory for a late company Christmas party back in January and it was an okay experience. I usually go to the one in GV and compared to this one, GV has way better service. We constantly had empty drinks and even though we asked for the wheat bread, the waitress kept trying to shove the sourdough down our throats. The only reason I gave this location 3 stars was because of the food, too bad the food couldn't save them to 5 stars.my friend's sister who lives near this place recommended this place while I was in town. I ordered the tropical french toast with Bacon, sausage and 2 over medium eggs. If you're a fan of french toast, you definitely need to try their tropical french toast!  Very generous portions and really good service.Came here because my group was indecisive about what to have for dinner, so what better way to please everyone then to go to a buffet. This one is like any other local casino low key buffet. Food was good and it filled my belly, but nothing spectacular. 

Pros: 
-No wait at all for dinner on a Saturday night
-Good variety: BBQ, Carving station, Mexican, Asian, Italian, Gelato
-Cheap! Get an aliante card and earn yourself some discounts

Cons:
-Quality was medicore
-Some of the food had the appearance of sitting out too longI  rate this as a 3 1/2 stars.  Ive only been here once so far.  The service was great and the menu selection is large.  Good beer selection too.  I had the prime rib dip sandwich.  It was good, but I would not say that it was great (3 stars).   My girlfriend had one of the pasta dishes and enjoyed it. (4 stars).  The portion sizes were good. I will be going back here,  but will be trying something else from the menu.  Hopefully then I can upgrade my rating to 4+.Went here to take my mom to lunch, just curious to try another tex mex restaurant...service was prompt, a bit slow but our service was nice and the complimentary chips/salsa was great. The food was good, not something to go crazy about, my fish tacos were yum but I dunno why they couldn't serve it 1 grilled & 1 beer battered, it has to be either one :-/  but yeah, prices are little high but overall it was ok.The vegetable plate, albeit kind of expensive, is absolutely delicious and highly recommended.

I can't speak much for the rest of the menu. I ordered the Salad Nicoise and thought, hmm, I can make a much better salad dressing at home, with olive oil and lemon juice - so I took the rest home with me. With thoughts like that, why bother to go out and eat?Not nearly as delicious as North Side Nathan's BUT their pizza crust was worth stopping in for. Spaghetti and lasagna portion was normal size and nothing to brag about. The service was friendly but EXTREMELY slow. Do yourself a favor and call it in even if you decide to eat there.This place is okay, BUT I would hesitate to call it a Pizza place. Maybe if it was specified as flatsbread style pizza than it would get four stars, but when you want pizza and you go to a place that puts toppings  on a cracker it leaves you saying WTF??? Okay so the toppings are awesome, like truffled mushrooms with arugala, very healthy too. My only beef is it is not like a traditional pizza, or even a thin crust, it's a dang cracker. The salads were good too and the service is awesome. All in all three stars, unless you like pizza crackers than bump it up to your liking.If you are in the mood to go to an absolutely beautiful restaurant, this would be the place.  In addition to the beauty of the restaurant, it features an open kitchen which I love as you can watch the staff work their magic.  In addition, you can also see the flaws, our order of gyozas came fresh out of the bag from the freezer into the hot oil.  Honestly, they were not terrible and I am sure making them fresh would be a nightmare, but many restaurants do go to the extra trouble to make them fresh.  

We stuck to the happy hour (Happy hour runs until 7pm) menu and there was a large selection to choose from.   We went with the standards, tempura shrimp roll, spicy salmon roll, and a special roll called a golden blossom that was topped with scallops, all rolls were quite good and priced between $4 and $6 dollars.  Our server was attentive and friendly.I went to Broadway Burger Bar & Grill with my husband, his brother and his brother's girlfriend on a Saturday evening before seeing Zumanity. I am going to need to revisit Broadway Burger Bar & Grill sober so that I can write an update... I was pretty Jagered up by the time we arrived, and can't even comment on the burger I had (I will spare you all the details, haha!). I wasn't too drunk to notice a few things though! 
 
Likes: 
Prices weren't bad, considering it was a casino on the Strip. 
There was no wait to be seated at 8 pm on a Saturday night. 
Options for turkey and veggie burgers, variety is always a plus. 

Dislikes: 
I had to ask for water multiple times before I got it. My husband also asked for waters for the table. I was the only one that got a water, after asking again...  And I REALLY needed some water!!!
When my husband asked for his burger to be medium well he was told his options were medium or well, nothing else. 
Most of the beers that our table requested were not available. Having a decent selection of good beers means nothing if the ones people order are not actually available. 

The garlic and herb fries smelled fantastic but I found the flavor to be a little weak. Maybe it was the booze messing with my tastebuds though?? They don't skimp on the amount of fries, consider splitting an order if you aren't a heavy eater. My brother in law RAVED about his burger, he even said it was the best he ever ate. That may have been the whiskey talking though...  My husband devoured his burger as well, and commented that he could really tell the meat was good quality. 

Since the guys were so happy with their meals, I would definitely be down to go back sometime... When I am a little less lubrucated of course!I had a chile relleno burrito and an iced tea.  The burrito cost about $6.99 and was also filled with beans, rice, and other goodies.  It was very tasty, large, and I couldn't finish it.  The second diner ate taquitos.  The plate came with guacamole and sour cream, as well as beans and rice.  She stated that the taquitos were a "4" on a 1-5 scale, but the avocado in the guacamole was not ripe.  I believe that the tea was about $2.00, and it was about 32 ounces and delicious.  The second diner did not like the beans, which I tried, and they were not served hot.  The taquito dinner was also $6.99.  The portion size was generous, and the second diner could not finish her meal.  Overall, La Cosina Mexican Restaurant was more of a 3.5 than a 3 star restaurant.  I do believe that this is the only Mexican restaurant on Las Vegas Blvd between Mandalay Bay and South Point.I love the serendipity 3 in New York. It's got great ambiance, makes you feel like a little kid again looking wide-eyed around you at all the treasure (chocolate) and magic (chocolate) you can find. 

This one...is not quite the same. They have a to-go order place outside which can be pretty useful, and an indoor/patio seating area. It definitely didn't have the fantasy-landish, childlike daydream, alice-in-wonderland feel of the other one. It felt more like a glorified Mcdonalds. But hey, its' Vegas right, maybe feeling like a lil kid here would be too much. 

We ordered

ABC burger - Avocado, brie, caramalized onions. Sounded delicious but it wasn't. I love burgers too :( I would rather have had In n Out. And for 3 bucks instead of TWELVE. 

Chicken pot pie - NO. nonononono. Two ppl ordered it and neither finished more than a few bites. 

Hangover omelet - this was one of the better dishes, an omelete with bacon and egg and french fries. But even this was only okay, which sucks because bacon and french fries is almost like cheating! Overall it was just really ...eggy. 

Corned Beef Reuben - Pretty damn good. Thick slices of corned beef. But this isn't supposed to be a jewish deli. Still a good sandwich though.

Frozen Hot Chocolate - Just as good as NY. It was amazing. 

Come here for dessert. don't eat here for lunch/dinner unless you want to shell out 12 + bucks for mediocre food. Bring your date here though and watch as the freaking Godzilla-sized sundaes are brought out!why have i not yelped on serendipity yet?! the very first serendipity i went to was the one in NY, and we all know that it is delicious!! so in vegas we wanted to try the new one that came out. When we got there, we called to ask for reservations for that day bc if its anything like the one in NYC, then theres gonna be a long line. Luckily we went there early in the day when they opened so they werent that busy and were able to squeeze us into a table. The place is pretty small. They have outdoor seating available as well. We had their food there. Wasnt the greatest thing in the world. It was actually just mediocre. Nothing too fancy or special, plain american food. But we all know what everyone goes there for is their frrrrrrrozen hot chocolate and boy is it yummy!!! it is definitely the highlight and the standard of serendipity. just like in NYC (without the movie feel haha)! so it is a definite must! it is huuuge so share one with a friend. actually with a couple bc its that big!

The place itself is very cute, from the boobie hostess desk to the cute souveniers and shirts they sell. way overpriced of coursem but hey what can you expect?! its only in vegas!!! hahaThis one is tough - 4 stars for the frozen hot chocolate (I got the mint, others got the white & original), and 2 stars for the food... But I suppose that's really the focus of the place... Had the A, B, C burger (avocado, brie & caramelized onions) which was ok but not incredible. The crabcake sandwich that my friend had was pretty good though... 30 minute on what appeared to be a restaurant with plenty of open seating, which was somewhat frustrating, but that's Vegas... Overall would come back for the frozen HC, but probably would skip the meal.i may not be a huge dessert lover or burger joint junky...

But you have to try (at least a hundred times) Serendipity's frozen ice-cream shake, esp the strawberry. OOOOOh, your tongue will thank you!

would have been a 3.5 stars but the hour wait...you serious? Host aren't that friendly either...perhaps the 105 degree weather...perhaps!Desserts are the star here! If you come solely for a frozen hot chocolate or yummy treat, you'll have a 5 star time all the way!

HOWEVER, if you come here for dinner, don't expect anything different than you could get at your local diner. And for triple the price. 

Waitstaff seem hurried and frazzled. Hostesses are drone-like. Very mediocre service.

That being said, I will ALWAYS be back for the signature frosty indulgences...no matter how blah everything else may be!Came here for the first time to try the frozen hot chocolate with the guys. thought it was just a random bar from the outside. waited about 15 minutes so we chilled out in the patio out front and people watched. Text us when our table was ready. Server was very cheeful and pleasant. Took our order, 3 frozen hot chocolates, order of onion ring tower, tacos and sliders. Food came pretty quick, Tacos and sliders were okay, enjoyed the onion rings. Looked for our server and couldn't find him for awhile, our water glasses were needing a refill. overall good experience.We came just to get an Asian fruit cake for my daughter's birthday.  For an 8" cake, it was $25.  That seems steep to me.

Dealing with Asian Asians, they are sometimes rude and not courteous.  We got the typical Asian rudeness here.  The place was crowded with similar rude Asians and the parking lot was crowded with rude Asian drivers and people smoking outside the store.

Well, we got what we came for, the cake.  Just didn't feel like seeing what else the store had.Great service, friendly, and nice ambience. Loved the Appetizer plate with cheese and crackers and fruit. Very tasty. Terrible wine unless you enjoy kook-aid on your me was porch. Hey..I am not a wine snob but eh.I believe in second chances but I'm still wary of eating their meat. So I stuck to my favorite: vegetarian tacos. The beans aren't mushy, the fajitas veggies have crunch and flavor, and they're cheap. My lunch was under $3 (one taco and a water cup). I'm not big on heavy lunches so this was a quick bite and it satisfied me until evening.Clean, modern, Roomy Spots-bar atmosphere.  They offer a Tepan grill or a regular Sushi bar.  Chicken can be dry depending on the Sue-Chief so I always go with the Steak & Shrimp at the Tepan grill.   For those of you who are timid when it comes to Sushi try the Lobster Tempura Roll to dissolve any reservations you ever had (its cooked).  Fun place to take out a group of people.Good hands on experience - pick your food then dunk it in a boiling cauldron of stock to cook. Not overly expensive and if you pick a busy time you get a free sauna into the bargain.I know this place isn't authentic, but the Orange Chicken is pretty darn good. Also, the staff here is friendly and the location is clean. I don't love the prices, but it's fast and convenient. They also have this Peach Green Tea that is freakin' tasty. I think I refilled my cup like 3 times.I've been here for lunch twice and Oliveo lives up to its expectations as an inexpensive fast food style pita restaurant that caters to the college crowd.  I've had a greek salad with gyros that was generally flavorful, but just of average quality across the board.  On my second visit, I ordered the portobello mushroom pita with a greek side salad.  The girl behind the counter let me stand there for almost ten minutes while she took a phone order from someone who could not figure out what they wanted and then when she finally did take my order was rude and seemed put out to have to do so, typical of restaurants of this caliber located in the ASU area.   My food arrived on two separate plates which at first seemed puzzling.  After the first bite of my pita, I realized why.  The portobello mushroom was of average quality and had decent flavor as did the pesto that was included, and the wheat pita itself was fresh and of good quality.  What I wasn't expecting, though, was the absolute geyser of liquid that shot out the end of the pita that I bit into and sprayed all over my face.  Similarly, the other end of the pita (the whole thing was wrapped in foil) was gushing liquid as if someone had managed to hide a garden hose somewhere in my pita and had stealthily turned it on as a joke.  By the time I was done eating, I'd gone through an entire stack of napkins and my plate was filled to the point of nearly overflowing with liquid. I could barely manage to carry it to the bus tub where customers are supposed to place their dirty dishes without it dripping onto the floor.  I still can't explain what all that juice was.  I love portobellos and make portobello burgers at home all the time and have never experienced anything remotely like that.  Be forewarned, if you're planning to try that item, I would suggest slipping on your rain poncho first.Lets get past the people at the host desk trying to look like club promoters, past the45 minutes it took to get a drink at the bar while the table was getting "prepped" which I don't get they were not even doing anything to anything. I was staring at an empty table for 15 minutes..guess whose it was. excellent.. Ok, let's also not mention the slow as hell waiter...um...let's see...what is there to mention then?? I guess the scallops where ok, not the best esp for the price. The mashed potatoes where ok but really again, not for the price.I do think it is what I get for ordering shellfish at a steakhouse but still, if you are going to do it you should at least do it right. I would not pay to go there again, but I would give it another shotSo, first off, I'm biased because AJ's was my favorite Vegas steakhouse for years. I ate here one time before but it was right at opening so I reserved judgment.

Got a comp for 2 last week after a marathon gambling session. Both got the ribeye, an app (salad, kobe meatballs), and two sides (asparagus, cream spinich). 

Best thing I can say about the above... good not great. It certainly has a hip vibe fitting with the rest of Hard Rock so I'd reccomend it if you're already staying at Hard Rock and either have an expense account, a comp, or just craving a high end steak and don't want to leave the property. 

There's really not much reason otherwise.I was really pleased with our most recent trip to iHop. The service was a little lackluster in that the server was having a particularly loud conversation with another guest. 

Red Velvet Pancakes were really good and left me wanting more. I seriously considered ordering more, but didn't want my company to wait around on me just so I could hog on more cakes.The Friday after Thanksgiving we needed to have something other than Turkey. Mexican sounded awesome. The reviews for Gallo Blanco sounded equally awesome.  So, we jumped in the car and made the 20 minute drive from Glendale. 

The menu looked as good as described on Yelp. It was 10:20 and we had each picked an appetizer and a main course.  This was going to be an expensive breakfast/lunch.

The waitress came over to ask if we knew what we wanted to order.  She acted like we were inconveniencing her. The restaurant only had 3 or 4 tables so I wrote the attitude off to the fact she was having to work the day after Thanksgiving. 

We began by ordering two of the Yelper's recommended appetizers. The waitress immediately scowled and said they were only serving breakfast (which consisted of less than ten items and none of the highly rated appetizers). Since this completely screwed up our order, we asked for some more time. She said, "Why don't I get your drink order.". We ordered two teas. (Except for the fact it said "Breakfast served all day" on the menu, there was nothing to indicate when any of the other items on the menu would be available.)

She came back and told us we could only choose from the breakfast items. They did not serve anything else for forty more minutes. 

A little customer service would have been nice. How about, "We are really sorry but we are a small restaurant and haven't finished the preparation of the other items. If you want to order (enter suggestion here) I will put in your order for lunch as soon as possible"

Really, try a little. Act like you care. 

After briefly contemplating just walking out my wife and I ordered from the limited breakfast menu.  

She ordered the Chile Quiles and I ordered the Chorizo and Eggs.  

While we waited and enjoyed the excellent tea, we were bothered by flies.  Fortunately, the table next to us received their food order and the flies went over to their table.  

Despite the rocky start, the food arrived and it was very good. In fact, it was excellent.  The hot sauce and green sauce were fantastic. 

I can only give three stars because of the total lack of customer service during the initial and, in my mind, crucial ordering stage.    Also, the flies were kind of gross.  

The food was four stars.  I will try this place again.  But only after 11:00 a.m.I'm not quite understanding these 5 star reviews....maybe they are friends with the manager or owner. 

It's not that I think this is a poor experience. I agree with most of the comments: "unpretentious" "comfortable" "great ambiance". My visit was all those things --  pleasantly surprising a restaurant found in a hotel. 

The menu is interesting and even innovative; not many nuevo-Mexican establishments serve Chilaquiles on the menu. The mini tacos were good, with a veggie option, Carne Asada or Cochinita Pibill. The carne asada was grizzly (and remember, this is a mini taco - so to have all three bites to be grizzly was a disappointment. ) Conversely, the Cochinta was flavorful (but it was a little greasy))-- but man -it was delish! 

I ordered a side of Guacamole - yuck. But I also ordered a side of French Fries (don't ask what spurred that combination), which I LOVED. 5 Stars for the French Fries which came along with an Aoili Chili dipping sauce. 

The Gallo Blanco Cafe deserves your attention and hopefully they'll just continue to tweak the food a bit because the place has potential. 

(NOTE: I went for lunch, so I'm not sure what the bar atmosphere or happy hour/dinner is like.)So we hit up Toby Keith's bar after dinner for a bachelorette party. My friend loves country so we thought this would be really appropriate. We walk in and it's Saturday night around 10:30pm and it was a little on the empty side which was a little surprising but obviously who cares, we came here to party! We go up to the bar and stand there for 15 mins before a bartender asks us if we want anything. Several bartenders were walking around not doing anything which got me a little irritated as well as my friends. We finally get our drinks which were pretty good at least. I'm not a big country fan but if you love country or want something different you should try this place. Definitely not my scene.They have unique pastries...a lot of the stuff they sell are something you don't see at other places.  My friend and I ordered the pistachio cheesecake, chocolate whoopie pie, rum ball and danish with whipped creme and custard (the day's special).  

Everything was good but  I had an over-expectation seeing yelp and they did not amaze me at all.   Everything is reasonably priced and the employees are friendly.No negative feedback. Just my local CVS.Had a pretty good dinner here the other night.  Wish they had a couple of different salsas,  the one they have is really hot and I like hot, but it was to hot, It would also be nice if they gave you a small bowl for salsa when you order and pay for the chips and salsa,  the tiny one ounce to go container is kinda hard to eat chips and salsa out of.  The chips were homemade and tasty.  The beans were really good and the fresh flour tortillas are awesome.  pretty disappointed in the enchilada,  the tortilla was really tuff and I wish I had a knife to cut through it,  also the sauce was not  very good.  This is a quick easy place to grab decent fast Mexican food.  Will be back for a bean and cheese burrito for sureGreat homemade tortillas but meat was bland. Needed to use outside sauces and salsa to flavor, but maybe that's deliberate. Floor needed to be swept a little but appeared very clean otherwise. Very casual/simple dining, almost like fast food. Not a sit-down and be served by a waiter place; you stand in line and your food is handed to you on a plastic tray. Other reviews I've read seemed to have been expecting a traditional sit-down restaurant and that's just not what this place is. It's very laid back but the food is real good.I stayed at this location for one night during my spring training trip. I arrived at 4pm, my room was ready, it was clean and nice. Bed was very comfortable and room was very quiet. I did get a very good nights rest. There is however not a whole lot of places to eat or ammenities close to this location so if you want to go out and sample some night life you had better have a car. Also, pool is kind of small and not very fancy. Other than that, the stay was good.Did they change the restrooms???  WHY?!!!

I don't know if I can visit after hearing that.  Those things were art.  ART.

Alas, I'm sure some day I'll wander down and check out the food.  Photos make it look delicious and interesting... so glad to to see we're keeping the restaurant biz rolling downtown.meh - it may look cool and even seem cool but it's mostly just surface treatments with the illusion of high glamour. 

quite the empty mall.  

another reviewer mentioned not enough "positive chi for shopping" - it's true. this environment smacks of trying too hard. yes there are ultra chic shops, plus casual dining etc. but it's not quite enough of an experience to be in the space itself. 

its hallways felt barren even with its luxury - kind of like a high fashion model that just can't smile because she takes the idea that she's just a clothes hanger waaaaay too seriously.

just doesn't stir the senses enough to actually shop.Cartwright's is American Cuisine fused with Southwest ingredients. You have to give them credit for preparing everything in-house daily that means sauces,  breads and desserts. They proudly let you know they only use all natural steaks and mesquite grill them. They even employee a rising star pastry chef that prepares the desserts for Cartwright's and the sister restaurant Tonto.

They started us off with a nice fresh baked bread sampler and some really ice cold better that cracked the bread when you tried to spread butter on it. I started out with a bloody mary and I was impressed that they rimmed it with celery salt ( a nice touch ) but then after the vodka only added Mrs. T's Mix to it. Maybe this drink is out of style I don't really know but I thought a nice flavorful bloody mary with horseradish , maybe a dap of hot sauce and worcestershire would go really well with steaks in this old fashioned looking kind of place. Switched to wine it was fine.

Our server made the special salad of the evening sound really good and her story of the chef going out and picking the flowers from ocotillos impressed us so we split one of those salads to try. They did present us with two beautifully prepared salads. That were pristine fresh and had all the fruit and vegetables hand cut fresh to order. For me this might have been the high light of the meal. 

The rest was good for it's price point and I'd go back!

3.5 StarsHad a Living Social coupon for Arcadia Tavern and anxious to try it out. The place was packed - of course it was a Friday after work so this was to be expected. After about 20 minutes, we were seated and the waitress came by and asked if we wanted our drinks refreshed (well, yes!!) Both the wine and the whiskey were generous pours [smile]. What we didn't realize was that Arcadia Tavern is basically a sports bar kicked up a notch or two. Not that that's bad - just was a surprise.

The food isn't your basic sports bar food either. That too, has been kicked up a couple of notches - no jalapeno poppers or potato skins on the menu!!! Yea! I asked the waitress what type of bread/roll the chicken caprese sandwich came on and was told it was an "artisian" roll. Guess my interpretation of that is different as it seemed like a plain white hamburger bun to me. In any event, the sandwich was good and the chicken was moist. The Phoenix Philly was very good - great flavor and just the right amount of heat. The waitress was pretty much MIA - brought our food - sped by once, and then again to drop off the bill. 

The place was LOUD - crazy LOUD! Our table was right by the door and it was obvious that a number of the people coming in knew some of the other patrons - obviously a lot of regulars. 

There is an outside seating area - in nice weather it might be nice, but we noticed there was a city bus stop right out front - not so sure I'd want to side outside with all the car fumes and city bus fumes, too.

Good food, decent prices, generous pours on the drinks, LOUD atmosphere (did I mention that already??), energetic vibe. I think we'll try it again - and when you check in on Yelp - you get a coupon for $5 off your bill!!!I like Jacobs, but I can't give it anymore than 3 stars.

Cakes, considering the raw ingredients that it takes to make them, end up costing penny's. I remember I throwing together a whole traybake for less than £1 (and sold 12 slices at 1.95 each).

Even though they look pretty like Amy says, 3 bits of cake were nearly £5. That's a hell of a profit they are making off each cake, which probably cost them 20p to produce each. I don't want them to sell it to me at cost, but at least take 50p off each cake. Then they would be able to compete with greggs at lunchtime.

Tastey if you can afford it.I got the carrot/cream cheese frosting cupcake and loved it. I am a sucker for cream cheese frosting, though. The latte was good, and it was all under $5.

The furnishings are very cute.Yummy!  Had the funghi pizza and it was delicious.  Lower stars because husband hated,I mean really hated his lamb sandwich.  Whinged all the way home about having to brush and floss his teeth to get the horrible taste out of his mouth.I had high expectations for the Parlor, and I've been told to go here for the two years I've lived in Phoenix, but the stars didn't align until tonight, when my wife and I were able to sneak away for their happy hour.  

First, the decor is comfortable and modern, just like any number of restaurants in Phoenix--think Postino's, the Vig, Windsor, etc.  We asked to be seated in the courtyard, as the weather was close to perfect.  Hostess was friendly. So far, so good.  

A waiter arrived at the table that was seated a couple minutes after us and he enthusiastically told them about a fresh salad that had just been picked from the owner's garden, and it piqued our interest.  Our waiter arrived a couple minutes later and offered drinks, but nothing about specials.  I would describe our waiter as cautiously friendly.  I waited tables in college, and I remember waiters seeing certain patrons come in and wanting to shuffle them off of someone else...I felt like that patron.  I had a nearly identical experience at FEZ a couple years back, and I've only returned once.  There are too many restaurants in Phoenix to bother with mediocre service.  

So service was a little chilly.  How was the food and drink?

The freshly-picked salad was excellent.  Bitter greens with fresh-made croutons and a beet vinaigrette with beets picked out of the same garden.  Simple, fresh, wonderful.  

Ordered two of the happy-hour pizzas: the Margherita pizza and a pesto pizza.  They were both decent, with the pesto being a bit better, but neither were spectacular.  I still prefer Pizzeria Bianco for this kind of pie, and no one in town, maybe even the state, can match Pino's Margherita.  It just felt average.  I've also eaten a lot of pesto on trips through Liguria, so I know what I want.  

Had the cherry zeppole for dessert.  Good, but not inspired, and probably wouldn't spend the money again.  Tiramisu is probably a safer choice.

I really wanted it to be better, but we were turned off by the service, and the food wasn't spectacular enough to overcome that obstacle.  Plus, I can go across the street and have better pizza with Bianco, and no parking headaches.I enjoyed the pizza. The bar area is a great place to meet new people because the seating necessitates sharing tables.Made the mistake of going there 2 days before Christmas... There was a lot of staff which is good! But there was just too many people inside...Good sandwiches and salad bar, a tad pricey for items.My friend and I were about an hour late, but we were accommodated. The whole staff was friendly. We started with two flutes of champagne and a seafood platter that had oysters, clams, lobster, shrimp, and the biggest crab leg I've honestly ever seen. The three sauces that accompanied the seafood platter were all divine. We were served different types of breads with butter, a soft mini pretzel roll, spicy, large fancy cracker, and a chewy raisin type. I just couldn't get enough of these! The different textures were a delight. Then came the expensive bottle of  Riesling which i practically finished myself before the Entree was even ordered. I asked for the label. But, I guess they forgot. I regret this. It was the best Reisling I've ever had. I ordered the smallest portion of filet mignon and a side order of roasted bone marrow. I never would've thought that bone marrow would be that tasty. a woman stopped by the table and took some photos. It was then that I realized, I took too long noshing on bread and guzzling  sumptuous wine. I looked at that picture perfect, untouched filet mignon. I was full when it came time to dive into the magical creation that was the reason for coming. It ended up in a doggie bag. Shameful I know. I never got to try it. The pictures were nice. The prices I'm sure were way out of my economic league. I bet the bill would've been a car payment. But, thanks to my well-to-do friend, who $$$$splurged on me, I got to experience this epicurean adventure.
Would I return. Doubtful. But, splendid experience.This service was not up to level that you expect for this type of highly priced restaurant.  The food was inconsistent.  My entree was great- I had the scallops- but my dining partner had the waygu beef and it was just ok. For $50 it should be better than ok.  The ambiance is just ok, music a little loud, seating is uncomfortable. Wine list is also not that interesting.  All in all it was just an ok experience.  For the prices, it should be a fantastic experience.The service - 5 stars. The food - 2.  I love me some fatty red meat, but the short rib was over-the-top fatty. I couldn't eat half of it.  My friend's gnocchi was way too garlicky. The only thing that saved this meal was the service which, as stated at the start, was impeccable. Don't think I'll be returning, though.The food is adequate, the atmosphere acceptable, service competent. Should you want your basic B,L,D... it gets the job done.. albeit at some higher prices. You know going in... it's not fine dining.Okay I have decided to write a review on a buffet that is so-so.  Not sure if I am being fair with this as I generally do not enjoy buffets...any place that I have have to wait in line or watch people mull around with plates of food in their hands while they "sample and eat" at various food stations does not appeal to me.

Needless to say The Buffet at Aria has vastly improved from its original days.  Clean, open dining area seen from the hallway makes it feel spacious.  The individual food stations were small while the portions were also small...nice!  Better than a huge stainless steel tray and a spoon where you scoop up your portion size. I think this is better so that you will eat smaller portions and more variety.

It was nice to see a seafood station that is part of their regular menu...nit some special Only on Friday or the weekend.

If you like buffets and are with friends or family, I would suggest giving this one a shot however if you're looking to be impressed there are others that are far better than Aria....Coming from SGV and SF, I was a bit underwhelmed by this place.  Although it is decorated to be fancier, being in Vegas.  

Service: This is the better part, they were friendly and suggested wines or alcoholic drinks.  

Food:  Nothing that stands out too much, although we did do the restaurant week for Vegas, some portions seemed to be small but definitely nothing special.Clearly, I was inebriated beyond belief. This was right after a glorious adventure at XS. I had met a new delightful friend and we walked here, or better yet stumbled here. The usual Denny's. Nothing special. We ate.

Upon leaving, I hadn't realized it then but my phone accidently fell out of my pocket. Once I got back to my hotel room I noticed it was missing. Losing your phone in Vegas is pretty much losing touch with reality. In a fit of panic I called over and they were kind enough to hold onto it for me. 

Again, still inebriated. I thought it was just a hop, skip and jump from my hotel room so I decided to walk instead of taking a taxi. It's approximately 6am, crazy hot and I'm walking. As I continue to walk, I begin to realize that it is ALOT further than I thought. Urgh.... 

Finally got my phone back with a pleasant txt msg waiting for me. I can exhale.

Thanks to this Denny's for holding onto it! Saved my life.The service was VERY slow.  The potato chips were great.  

The food was OK but nothing memorable.

My wife had halibut which was overcooked.  I had a short rib pasta that was OK.

We DID love this eggplant dipping sauce and bread.  That was great!Cute little space in Scottsdale101, with nice staff. Red Mango may be the original tart yogurt place (as they claim), but they've been far outdone by newcomers. Their new tangomonium flavor and the pomegranate flavor are both good, but personally, I find their yogurt too creamy for tart flavors. I prefer the slightly more icy Pinkberry yogurt (Ice Tango, here in AZ, is more similar to Pinkberry). But the ultimate fro-yo place, IMO, is Yogurtland, and they spank Red Mango silly on variety and cost. For about $10 at Red Mango, you get two smalls with two toppings each. For roughly the same price at Yogurtland, you can get two huge cups with as many flavors and toppings as you'd like (it's done by weight). Red Mango may be the first but Yogurtland is the champ!Date/Time: Sunday - 12:30pm
Occasion: Hangover lunch
Party of:  Eight
Ordered: Pho tai bo vien & fresh squeezed OJ
Location: About 15 minutes from the strip; clean & spacious location 
Total incl gratuity: ~$10pp

The broth was really refreshing and so good especially after a night of drinking.  When we got there, there was probably only two other tables so we thought it'd be quick - in and out!  Unfortunately, we learned the hard way.  The service turned out to be extremely slow.... nice, but slow!  Whereas it normally takes about 30 minutes for me to order, receive, and eat a bowl of pho...this place took us about an hour and a half.  The woman who was our server was running around like a madwoman and took forever.  It took about 20 minutes just to get our water and beverages.  The chef appeared to be the same person delivering our food...which took about 30 minutes for us to get.

The food was good, vegetables were definitely fresh. however this place is not good enough for us to spend that much time waiting.  I think I'll stick with the pho restaurants closer to the strip in Chinatown next time.Good solid Panda Express.  It is in the Meadows Mall.  There is never too long of a line.  When I walked up and ordered a Panda bowl with vegetables side.  They made the veggies fresh while I waited.  Then I added the peppercorn shrimp.  I wish I go more than 6 shrimp with the veggies that come with the peppercorn shrimp, but my whole meal was a total of 270 calories.  It was filling and tasted good.  I enjoyed it.  

When I am not on a diet, I enjoy the cream cheese ragoons.  The mall is right across from my work.  I have no complaints about this place.Some of my friends say I live out in the middle of nowhere and there isn't anything of interest here. Well now we have a yogurt jungle! Self-serve frozen yogurt. Take that! (you know who you are...) Our dining options are actually very limited so when something new opens, we flock to it. I have driven past Yogurt Jungle for a couple of weeks and longed for the day I could try it. After a small salad at the neighboring Paradise Café, it was my shot. 

I entered the store and to be honest if smelled a little funny. Too clean maybe?  I couldn't quite place it - perhaps a hospital? Either way, that was just the first reaction but I got over it. I was impressed with the seating. Mod furniture chairs, tables and sofa made me want to come home and watch Austin Powers. I took a minute to look over everything - it was a little overwhelming with all of the options. I made my way to the back of the store and looked at the various options for frozen yogurt. Cool - they have the little ketchup cups from McDonalds to use as samples. Being my first time I had to try them all - it was research after all. The pistachio was very good (and ultimately that's the one I chose), there was New York cheesecake, pomegranate, blueberry, something called Euro Tart (which ignited me by name, but when I tasted it I was quickly turned off), peanut butter (which was good, but I didn't go with), chocolate (which was a little runny), Vanilla and Mango Tango (didn't try that one) and another one or two that I can't remember. The selection was good and most tasted really good. 

Next up was the sauces - white chocolate, milk chocolate, marshmallow, caramel and something else. There were toppings - anything from candy bars such as Twix, Heath and Reese's to cereals such as cookie crisp and coco puffs. There was banana chips, some assorted jellies (which looked and sounded nasty) and a lengthy list of others. I was guessing over 50 toppings (but reading an earlier review it says over 60 so I will go with that). It was impressive...but I have trouble making up my mind and I find too many choices hinders progress. Fortunately my friend & I were the only ones in the store. 

I went with the pistachio with white chocolate, milk chocolate, chocolate chip, health bar and a chocolate jimmy. She has New York cheesecake with cheese cake bits and I can't tell you what sauces she put on it. What I can say is I finished mine and when she was finished with hers it was offered up to me and that was the first time in the history of my existence I took a bite and passed. Get a pen and write it on the calendar. Fat boy couldn't eat the dessert because it was nasty. When you have too many options you can go crazy with things and try experiments that fail.  The price is 39 cents per ounce, which is good. Together for both of ours it was about $7. In addition to the cool furniture, they also have 2 lap tops set up with Wi-Fi, so that's a bonus.

The quality of the yogurt was good, the toppings seemed endless, but if I am being honest, it was just okay for me, dog. There is the opportunity to make some nasty concoctions and we did just that. While the experience wasn't bad, I think to myself would I go back and really be a regular? Probably not. If I happen to be there and I have a hankerin' for a yogurt...and the line isn't too long, I will stop in. But would I go out of my way and make a special trip to hit up the Yogurt Jungle? Not likely.Cheap and easy.

If you are looking for quick mex, Maria's is the place to go. I wouldn't say it's the best mexican food but it's good enough. I like the quesadilla which is pretty hard to mess up. :)This place Is a little heaven for pregnant woman. As soon as you step foot in the place it is as if you entered a small retreat celebrating babies and bellies. They offer many different massages that target pregnancy needs. I never retrieved any pampering services because they are very pricy. I went to massage envy had a prenatal masseuse for half the price. This is why I gave it 3 stars. Belly Bliss should be aware that the clients comb through the door are getting ready to stray families and cost should be something that is reachable. As I said Before I received 2 massages for the price of one at Belly Bliss. The boutique has much you look at with some great ideas of things to purchase. Chewable necklaces??? Awesome! I took there prenatal yoga classes and they are great. The room is small and comfortably can fit up ton 10 woman plus instructor. The only draw back is the class schedule. Yoga I only offered a few times a week and the majority are in the morning. For working moms this limits you to only Wednesdays in the evening (I think 5:30). The classes are a good price (5 for $30) or $8 per class. They also have post birth classes yoga with your baby. A way to meet moms in the area. Last I forgot to mention the snack bar! There is a free snack bar with yummy and healthy goodies. And yes it's free!Da lat was just that.  Simple and okay.  I would not send a postcard from this location raving about the pho.  I will try it again someday but for now I found an amazing Vietnamese restaurant.Two drink minimum!  Really?  

The pianists were okay, but didn't seem to mesh well together, sounded the same (as far as fingerwork on every song and voice), and kept messing up.  

The location by the pool is gorgeous and the servers were not super friendly or smiling, but were professional and prompt.

Requested "Lucille", a dueling piano classic, and they just kept apologizing that the Wynn/Encore prohibited them from doing the song the way they usually do, as they have a strict "no profanity" rule.  

Well, for an adult's late night bar, that's no fun.  :-(Nice layout. Plenty of TV's and almost any sport you can think of.

Service is just ok. I usually only go around lunch and happy hour so I don't know what the night time is like. The food is ok. Some items are better than others. The fish and chips can be really good at times and then not so much other times. The pizza was surprisingly good. I'm usually skeptical about pizza on the menu at an Irish bar but it was pretty good.I didn't come here for the food, but the apps I've had there are okay.  I've only come here because they have karaoke all the time and they have pool tables that I have yet to use.

Service could be better.  We often wait awhile between drinks.  But the servers are friendly.

The drinks are watered down.  Don't get anything with their sweet n sour mix.  Yuck!  Had to send those drinks back.  I've stuck to bottles ever since.  

Although the place is never packed, there always seems to be a long wait to sing.  The KJ sings in between customers which is a no no in the business if you have as many singers as this place does.  

The seating could use a little help as well.  It isn't very comfortable.  I think the only reason I gave this place 3 stars is because we know we can get our karaoke on and play some pool (someday).  It's not super pricey, but given the quality of their drinks, I would say they are overpriced.Great 80s music but drinks are overpriced (but what isn't) unless you are gambling; you can sit at the bar and put money in the video poker and get free drinks.just average. the precooked food as ok. most of it was room temp not hot. The server never offered to swap the grill. Overpriced for the food... better off going to tofu hutSura has a large selection of meats and other Korean dishes but since it's a buffet, none of the food was really memorable. It's quantity over quality here. Definitely think about coming here if you have a large group (we had about 20 people) but don't come expecting the best quality Korean BBQ. There are plenty of other options in the area.I've eaten here a couple of times with my kids.  My dining experience there was ok.

The food is typical.  I really like wings and pretty much order them everywhere I go.  I expected more from this place, since the word "wings" is in the name of the restaurant.  

I'd eat here again if someone invited me to meet them there... and if they paid.I was disappointed with the food this time. The spicy yellowtail roll was too spicy. They over did it with the siracha sauce and spicy mayo. I didn't eat much of it and none of the servers or sushi chefs noticed. The rice on the nigiri tasted not so good. It was hard and maybe undercooked. I also had a tuna specialty roll and though the portion was large but the rice was ehhh. The service wasn't bad except for not asking if the yellowtail roll was okay. Don't think I will go back though.My food was really good-- my only complaint was the rude waitress who was very angry when I asked if I could eat there, only because she had already boxed it up without asking me if it was to take away or eat in. Not a huge deal, but disheartening for a weary tourist tired from hours of walking!It was good, wasn't great.. Just average and no good gooey toppings like warm Chocolate or marshmallow creamFood was good, service good, other reviews are harsh, food nothing to write home about but it's an 'american' Mexican and it delivers what you'd expectThere is a sense in which this place was on a hiding to nothing, from the outset, as we'd had a simply excellent meal, the night before, at Cafe Fish, with the same group of people, visiting for the Six Nations rugby. It seemed unlikely that we could hit those heights, two nights in a row.

And so it proved. I had a disappointing spinach souffle, to start, then followed with the steak hache, which was good without being particularly memorable. Service was confused and confusing, with a lot of staff overlapping and the pace of delivery rather pedestrian.

It was a shame as I really like the venue. It's an excellent marriage of old and new, and the place has a lovely vibe. Their wine list is as impressive as you would expect.

It's priced as fine dining, but the quality on offer is nowhere near that.

Overall, we said: "Bistro du Vin certainly met our post-match needs very nicely, but it didn't quite hit the heights, for me. While the setting was lovely, and a jolly good time was had by all, I'm not sure the quality of the dishes was all that it could have been."sure this place has decent food,  but i have to say its crammed in there and to tell you the truth, i dont like to listen to other peoples conversation  much less smell their freaking perfume. the selection was small and the bill higher than expected. probably will not return. in my list of buffet's this ranks in at 5The combination of chicken and waffles has baffled me for years. I never quite understood what would inspire a chef to serve these two unlikely meals on the same plate, but couldn't ignore how much folks raved about it. Day 25 of my 30 day blogging challenge  called for a "first" of sorts and I figured I'd get out of the house and do something new. Despite seeming like a breakfast/dinner clusterfuck, I opened my mind as well as my stomach, and ventured to Lo-Lo's Chicken & Waffles.

It had been years since I went to the original Phoenix restaurant (the epitome of a hole in the wall) but I did remember the food being good. Since the company branched out to include a Scottsdale location I was thrilled to only travel 5 mins for food. The location is nice, though I agree it doesn't have quite the "charm" of the original location. It felt more like a little, sit down restaurant than a hot food spot.

I fought the urge to stick with what I know and get catfish... but ended up biting the bullet and ordering the #10 (Tre-Tre - $7) which consisted of 2 legs and 1 waffle, a side of fried okra ($3.50) and "red" kool-aid.The restaurant happened to be running low on legs so there was a bit of a wait but I came equipped with a magazine so it wasn't a big deal.

The Verdict? It wasn't a bad meal but I don't think I'd ever order this again. It didn't taste bad... not at all, but I guess it just felt like I was paying for something my mom could've made me lol. The only reason to pay for this meal is because you don't have access to cooking it yourself. The Okra was just okay. I like Church's okra better. My mom has made better chicken but I'd take their waffles. This meal reminded me of going to Sprinkles for cupcakes. It's more about the hype around the place  than the actual meal itself... or it could be because my mom is from the heart of Mississippi and knows how to put her foot in southern food. Ehh.. I'm glad to say that I tried something new so I can turn it down in the future based on personal experience and not a notion.

Sidenote: The credit card machine was glitching out when I was there so next time I'd just bring cash. The staff was VERY friendly and it was a pleasant experience... just felt like I paid for a meal I could've gotten from home.Wow - I am super sleepy! That is a frequent occurrence when I eat at a Filly B's. It must be the magical combination of tortilla, meat and grease or perhaps a secret ingredient that makes me feel this way - but within 20 minutes I am ready for a nap. It is a struggle when I go for lunch, but just write the day off if I get a breakfast burrito in the morning!

This location is new, replacing Moe's a few months ago. The store is clean and the staff friendly. The food arrives quickly. I think it is a good portion for the price. I get a number 2 (taco & burrito combo) and I have never been able to finish it. The chips and salsa are free (I go with the tomatillo) and drink refills are free.  The rating would be a little higher perhaps, if not for the 60 cent surcharge for using your debit card.

If you are having trouble sleeping, come get a burrito here - it isn't just me. I have taken live sample surveys of people I know and they all are sleepy after eating Filbertos. Sweet dreams!I decided to go with something semi light so I went with the club sandwich: Sourdough bread with bacon, turkey, avocado and some other stuff  It was pretty good the fries that came with my sandwich were just right.. soft but very crunchy . My meal was good but  it gets 3 stars  from me because they don't have a very good selection on the menu. It does have a nice little patio in front looking out towards the various gates so you'll never miss your flight unless you are inside the bar watching a game. it's a Cool place to sit while u wait for your flight. :)had to go in and try the pie..

giving it 3 stars, and not because it was bad or anything was wrong with it.  It was very good.  But if it was back in NYC it would just be another average pizza place.  I know that sounds like a backhanded compliment, but it isnt.  This place is legit, especially for out here.

really glad this place opened as I think the more legit east coast pizza places around here the better.  This is most like Joe's NY pizza in scottsdale and  It reminds me alot of slices of pie you get on the Jersey Shore.  Obviously made by the same people who have made pizza back home in years past.

Had the onion and tomato pie and I liked it.The service is quick, though very impersonal.

Their gyro is good, but the meat is a bit too oily/greasy for me. Their cucumber sauce is absolutely amazing, though. The pita is average.

Their side greek salad is... a joke. It comes with a sort of ranch dressing, which is pretty ridiculous.

My Big Fat Greek Express is also a bit pricier than the tastier and friendlier Pita Shack which is only a block away.

BOTTOM LINE: I only come here when Pita Shack is closed.In the death throes of Big Wong the place had really  fallen apart. I was glad to see that the new owner had revamped the place. Nice decor...TABLES OF BIBLICAL PROPORTIONS. These tables are not only something that you'd expect to find at the top of a beanstalk, but I think archeologists will have a big find in a few thousand years (sturdy). The walls have been tastefully painted. The ceiling has been restored to it's 1970's, stick your pencil into, glory.

Food: Hot. Great gobs of hotness. They give you a scale of hotness (I love thai people) of 1-5. I hesitantly ordered my Spicy Noodles at a level 4. My wife ordered her pad thai at a level two. My dish came out at a perfect heat for me. The noodles could have been a little less done. I couldn't taste the spice at all, but my wife still enjoyed it. 

All in all, I'll probably be back.I wished I had known the massage alone was $55.. the groupon deal was a waste of money for me and I was a little disappointed... The jade bed is impossible to relax in while 5 people walk around and talk around you. Then I sat in the infrared sauna while it heated up for 10 minutes (equivalent to just sitting in your car during March) because they forgot to turn it on.  So, a bit annoyed, I just went home early. 

The massage was terrific though, I would give her 5*'s if the other factors weren't involved.. I also wish I could remember her name :( 

I was tempted to ask for my extra $20 back, so I could go relax at the bar at Frasher's! AgghhDinky little pub on Hunter Square that's ideal for a quick drink heading home or just heading in to town, but not quite big enough to spend a stretch of time in without getting a little cramped.

Owned/sponsored by Belhaven, this pub is linked to the White Hart bar in the Grassmarket and the World's End bar on the Royal Mile. How The Advocate squares up to the rest of the Belhaven pubs I'm not too sure but taking it at face value it is a nifty little pub that had an impressive selection of whiskies for a small bar.

There isn't an awful lot of space in this bar making it feel quite closed in as you can be standing a couple of feet away from people eating dinner as you're drinking a beer and watching the football on the TV.

I never tried the food as I was only passing by but with what I seen it looked like general pub fare with things like burgers, sandwiches and steak pie (do you really need anything else in a pub?)

A few bottled craft beers were available from Belhaven at around £3.40 per bottle. Tucked away between the Cowgate, the Bridges and the Royal Mile, it's only understandable that they sold "The Advocate" beanie hats too. I have to admit that I was very tempted to get on.

Service was good, pub was nice and warm for it being a cold afternoon and the beer was cold. Definitely worth a visit if you're passing through.For Madison this place is excellent, for those of us that live in large cities it is not fabulous.

At least it is in the city and you don't have to drive to get to the place.  And the interiors are nice.  You would do great in Boston!

On the downside, for a gay bar, 70% of the patrons are straight gals from Lodi celebrating someone getting married.  Not that there is anything wrong with that.

Oh Madison.  It was great to visit, but I am thankful I don't actually live there.After a few more meals and a few more months, I'm downgrading Green Owl to three stars.  It's still a cool place, and a useful veggie alternative, but honestly, the food is just "meh."This place use to be a 5 star for us.  Then the main waitress left, and things started going downhill.  I think business started to slow, and then the owner started trying to save money in the most ridiculous ways.  We were "regulars" and had a discount card, but she stopped excepting it when we used coupons.  Then she stopped putting coupons in the local clipper mag.  Last time we went the waitress said she couldn't initial our frequent customer card (eat there so many times and get a free meal) when we used a coupon?!?!  We have one more coupon we purchased from one of those daily deals places, but when that's gone we won't be going back.  Not to mention that the service is horrible now :(. Very sad... We were there 3-4 times a week.Went on the tour last night and it was interesting. This not a scary tour it's more historical. Having lived in Vegas for years I learned some new things. The bus is small kind of like those party buses or the bus that picks up senior citizens. My boyfriend liked the size of the bus it was comfortable and had plenty of windows. The 2 1/2 hours flew by. The hotel was nice on the inside and they had free parking. I can't say I would of paid the full price but since I had a groupon it was cool.There lack of consistency bothers me... when everything is done correctly I love it but over half the time my foccacia is different. Either no meat in the end pieces, chewy chicken (sometimes tastes microwaved) or bad service. The appetizer should be served before the entree! 

When they're on they are one of my favorite spots but I now second guess going more often than not because I never know which Zipps is gonna show up.It's a bar. There's some sand. Some waitresses are more concerned about their looks than their customer service skills. It's just a typical, average, North Scottsdale bar.

The location is highly convenient, and there's never a line to get in. Even when this place is packed, it doesn't feel that packed. They have ample room inside and out so you never feel squished. It's usually pretty easy to find a table but it's definitely not as easy to find a waitress/waiter that wants to serve you, especially when it gets crowded. During one of our many Sandbar visits, our waitress was so MIA that one of the security guards started acting as our waiter... It was pretty funny to say the least.   

When I used to live up in N. Scottsdale, Matt and I would come here for NFL Sunday football all the time. They were also pretty accommodating when it came to changing the channel so that each of us could watch our favorite teams. I always requested the 49ers, and Matt needed to see his SeaChickens. They would even change the channel for our friend, a die-hard Buffalo Bills fan (yes, they still exist), without thinking twice. I truly appreciate a bar that accommodates fans of different teams outside of the one that happens to be playing the Cardinals that week.

This is also a fun place for Happy Hour Mon-Fri. They have great specials, and the drinks get the job done. As far as bar food goes, Sanbar's menu isn't amazing but it isn't horrific either. There have been may times when I've made a meal out of their bottomless bucket of chips and salsa. As far as the crowd goes, it's kinda random. You'll see groups of coworkers enjoying some after work brews, lots of out-of-towners, young 20-somethings getting their drink on, old creepy guys with fake tans. But for the most part, this place turns into a party scene at night. Although I am totally not a UFC fan at all, Sandbar hosts a lot of UFC nights where they put the game on the big screen projector TV, and people can reserve seats/tables in advance... just as an FYI for all of you UFC people out there. 

I know what to expect from Sandbar, and it's an A-OK place in my book. I'd recommend it to anyone in N. Scottsdale looking for a fun, reasonably priced bar for happy hour or a night out. However, this just isn't a bar that I would drive out of my way to get to.This place is close by. And in Vegas when its HOT!!!! that's very important. Great selections.My trusty dining companion and I had dinner here a little while back, er maybe 2 months ago, so I'm a tad late on my review. But as I was eating an order of fettuccine alfredo for lunch it made me think back to the most delicious fettuccine alfredo I have ever had, which is from here, Tommy V's. 
You would think that after such a statement they would rank up on my 5 star reviews list but alas the rest of the experience was sub par. My boyfriend had the baby clams linguine and it was just OK, not a lot of flavor and just not exciting; we had the fried calamari for our appetizer and again OK, but nothing to write home about, very very plain. 
The wine selection was good and for just a wine drinker and by no means an expert i appreciated the server (sorry can't remember his name) listening to my likes and dislikes and then choosing the perfect wine for me, that was impressive. 
The restaurant itself is nice but it just doesn't seem to fit the food, it seems very western and I would expect to see a menu for rustic American food as opposed to the Italian fare they serve. Also I didn't feel completely welcome, when we walked in, both of our first times here, we were unsure if it was seat yourself or wait to be seated and we had that super uncomfortable stand in the doorway while other diners stare at you moment which seem to last much longer then necessary, a server even walked by and said nothing to us. 
So Great great fettuccine, but next time I think I may just get an order to-go.Im writing this one for the unhappy reviewer who stopped while on a road trip, just to clarify the La Bamba experience for any other Yelpers. La Bamba is a college town restaurant, famous for serving burritos to drunk college students when the drunk parade starts after the bars close.  La Bamba burritos as big as your head are well loved and well remembered by many Big 10 students.  

The Madison location used to be just off State Street, but moved out to the burbs some years ago.  The atmosphere of the restaurant is very cold and cafeteria style; get your food, eat and get on your way.  I would not go here for a sit down Mexican meal.  Most folks go for one thing - the burritos.

My personal fave is the mini combo con todo!  Including that famous hot sauce.  It's been sixteen years since I graduated college, but every time we drive by East Wash we have to jump off 94 to get a La Bamba.  You crave them, wolf them down, and then think, meh.  It's alright.  (Not as good as at 3:00 a.m. after many many cheap tap beers).  The tacos are good as well, and they do have pastor.

I even pack a cooler and haul some up to my old college roomie in Mnpls.

Hint:  they taste even better the next day, after refrigeration for a day, and they do freeze well.

So if you want to try this wonderful burrito as big as your head experience, have at it.  If you want a nice Mex-American meal with frozen margaritas, this is not your place.We were craving Korean food, last night and I figured we would give E-Jo a shot, since the wife was always wondering about it.

We walked in as they were serving a pretty good sized family, and were seated at what almost seemed like folding card tables. We ordered 2 hot corn teas and a water, we got 2 hot corn teas and a cold corn tea. We were given one menu for three people too, which was rather inconvenient. 

Upon looking over the lone menu, and the picture menu on the wall, we realized E-Jo is strictly a soup restaurant. Unfortunately, that doesn't work for my stomach, as I can eat plate after plate of "real food" and still be hungry, soup is just like an appetite kick starter for me. My wife and her sister weren't really feeling the soup either, so we asked the server what we owed for the drinks, as we were looking for more than soup. She was very friendly and tried to sell us the kal bi and bulgogi soups, when we said thank you, but we are going to try somewhere else, she wouldn't accept payment for the drinks and wished us a good night.Service was TERRIBLE. Two ladies that helped us looked like they were having the worst day ever. But the food is good. We had my six year old niece with us and she asked for crayons and they were so rude to her! Not going back.I truly wanted to love this place. It's clean, family oriented, obviously adult friendly (beverages), and had the most amazing jukebox I have ever seen (although not working at that time.) Too bad the food
 was a let down, the knot were good but tasted like they were microwaved, the pizza was good if you like a sweet crust (I prefer sourdough), the pasta was okay but the sauce was a let down, and the worst was the tiramisu (a store bought tasteless mess). I would have loved to make this my regular place if it were just a bit better.Ordered the hottest wings and they were not very hot.  OK food at best.  Service was good.Food & service was good. I had ordered the buffalo chicken sandwich. I had mild sauce, provolone cheese & the potato salad was good. Over our waitress was excellent. She was very polite & attentive.Menu has a lot of items. Cider on tap! Food left a little to be desired. Steak sandwich was a hunk of steak (not sliced on a roll).My first experience here was very much a 1-star. If I could have given it negative stars, I would have. Sticky drink glasses, the stuff in our curry looked old, the meat had a bad texture, the soup tasted like soap, and the shrimp smelled rotten. We had to send a dish back. We wanted to send them ALL back, but we paid anyways.

But then we went again. We got smoothies, stir fries, and some of the crunchy fried stuff, no meat and no soup. Oh SO much better!!! I wanted to order dozens and dozens of wontons. Mmmmm... This place is excellent, but there is too much menu choice (I can't help but think of kitchen nightmares lol, too much menu choice = disgusting food... this was the case here!!). I think they should cut their menu down and remove some unpopular dishes. Their menu feels like a novel, and half of the stuff doesn't even taste fresh.I hesitate to give The Griddle 3 and not 4 stars. I wish 3.5 was an option. 

The staff was helpful, the Orange Juice tasted like it had been juiced on the spot, and they had no problem making my order custom (I basically invented a sandwich and they didn't bat an eyelash).

Prices are decent. The place is sortof cute. Something is missing or else this would get 4 stars. It doesn't quite feel... cozy. Maybe because the doors are open and it was freezing, or maybe because the layout is awkward. I'm not sure. But it has potential. Worth a shot.Nothing extraordinary about this place, but I digged it.  I ordered their nachos, which was good for the most part.  Ordered a couple of Mimosas too, but I would skip on them.  They came in small plastic cups and were expensive and I didn't even taste the alcohol!  However, I would definitely recommend sitting outside.  The umbrellas actually work here and they provide a good amount of shade.  And it's perfect for random people watching!  In a non-creepy way.It is pretty decent for fast food BBQ. The ribs are not excellent but they are decent. I really like the Mac and cheese here a lot and I buy the cornbread to go when I get a chance. They have a lot of sauces so it is fun to experiment. Jut stay away from the riblet appetizer. I have no clue what those are but they are nasty.When the price of your burger combo exceeds $10 you start treading into Vig, Delux, Farm House Grill, Indulge Burger territory.  And when you draw that comparison the Five Guys is out of its league.  The burger is good but is it better then In-N-Out, Lucky Boy, Culvers, or Two Hippies? All of those options would be almost half as expensive as Five Guys.

Sorry, I liked you better when you were an East Coast treat.My old man is OBSESSED with Chinese food.  This can be a problem when he wants it for every meal, and I only crave it about once every couple of months.  Since I dragged him along to Vegas for a soccer tournament I was playing in, and he would be forced to pretend to enjoy watching me play in the sweltering heat for several hours each day, I decided to oblige his love of Chinese food and get dinner in Chinatown.

He chose Wendy's Noodle Cafe, based on the great Yelp reviews.  They had a couple of vegetarian options, but not tons.  Your usual options were there - veggie spring rolls, vegetable fried rice, vegetable chow mein.

We ordered the veggie spring rolls, vegetable chow mein, and my old man got something that was seafood and noodles - it might have been called seafood and noodles.  The seafood included squid, fish, and shrimp.

I thought the spring rolls were particularly good - it is difficult to make an outstanding spring roll, they are generally all good, but few are great.  These were great.

The vegetable chow mein was not as good.  I didn't like the sauce, I felt it had too much corn starch or something...couldn't really put my finger on it, but there was something about the sauce I wasn't into.  Also, the noodles were very thin, and I like thicker noodles.  Not a major failure, just not my cup of tea.

My old man loved the seafood noodles thing.  He said the shrimp was perfectly cooked, and he even had an entire conversation with our server about how well-cooked and fresh the squid was.  She said they get it fresh each day, it comes whole, and they prepare and cut it there.

I would definitely like to try Wendy's again, but I would not order the vegetable chow mein.  Although they don't have a ton of vegetarian options, I'm sure they would change up a recipe for me if I asked - the staff seemed very friendly and accommodating.  

Oh, and their iced tea is excellent.So if you need to catch a game but want some food as well, this is the place to go. Other than the TV's everywhere showing every game currently playing there is really nothing special about this spot.
Our waitress did an okay job. The drinks were a bit weak and pricey. I had the Steak sandwich with French fries. I have to say it was pretty decent for a sports bar.
I wouldn't go back, it's not really my thing, but you may like it!Fun restaurant! Fun menu! Too much of a loud, crowded, college-age scene on the weekends for my taste.I dig this spot.... smoothies are refreshing on a hot day. I love all of the smoothies. I have not had a chance to sample the food, but the next time I stop by, I will check it out. The decor is cool af. I like the shabby chic feel to it. I love to support local businesses,  so I will be back.Wonderful comfortable atmosphere   Wonderful selections of beer and wine   Love it!!!  However I will not go there again as the bathrooms ARE NOT WHEELCHAIR ACCESSIBLE!!!!!I've noticed inconsistent reviews here. People are either really happy or really ticked off. I live on the other side of the universe from this shop, and I have a "regular" shop near me which I visit 2x a month. However, this is the only shop I have found to do "creative" designs (like a plaid pedicure at Christmas).  
I have been here 6 times and have been very pleased.  The shop is in a bad area, so I don't know what people expect. Also, when English is not a first language and the shop employees are not from this country.....you sometimes have to make allowances for culture.  Yes - I have left nail salons because of a lack of friendliness, cleanliness.....and yes, I wish those who open businesses in our neighborhoods would prioritize learning how to do business according to the client's expectations ......and not their own. There ARE nail salons where they have learned to do this: speak English, be friendly, run an organized shop, be professional. This shop has a lot to learn, but I've never received a "bad" pedicure.The food was gr8. I'd give it 5 stars if only I had seen the server more often. The venue has a beautiful view n layout. I had no reservation n I got sat down immediately. Besides the sticky menu, the food came out promptly n was delicious. 

What really bothers me is that,  I wish we could tip the busser NOT the server. The bus boy gave us gr8 service, more attention n packed our leftovers. That's my only gripe. 

Please tip the busser cash. I'm a regular n I feel for themIt was okayAs a massage chain goes (which doesn't really even make sense because every massage therapist's touch is different, so you can't exactly guarantee the same service no matter where you go), I've always had a good massage therapist.

The membership deal is an interesting idea, not something you can get anywhere else in town.

My only beef is that the massage rooms are too small. My massage therapist was banging into the wall while moving around the massage table. It was a little on the claustrophobic side.I split a burrito bowl with the S.O.  We get the brown rice, black beans, double chicken, fajita veggies, several salsas, and guac.  It was more than enough for both of us, and for fast food, it doesn't get much more healthy than that.  This specific location would benefit from more umbrellas outside: there are plenty of tables and ONE umbrella. It's not brain surgery, folks.Well I have been going to Mellow since it has opened. My Yelp account says I have 50 check ins, but in reality I have more than 75 check ins. So I do love this place. The food is awesome, beer is always changing, and happy hour prices can't be best. So why lowering my review from a 5 star to a 3 star...the service...

Since coming to Mellow from the beginning I've been sitting at the bar. I enjoy watching people and interacting with the bar staff. Mellow had some awesome bartenders in the past, and a few current ones like Maralena, but some of the others just don't seem to care. Or worst yet..because we only come once every few weeks now if days (too much Mellow not good for the diet!) they seem to give preference to their new regulars from the nearby restaurants. I really don't mind that much, but don't make me wave you down or ask you for a drink! If you want to ignore me for most part, I'm ok with that. But don't clean glasses right by me and don't even look up to see if I'm wanting another drink or not?  That's my biggest pet peeve. On our last visit the other day it took us forever to put a order in even though it wasn't that busy. I can understand when just 2 bartenders have the bar, bar seating, and patio on a busy night. Maybe Mellow needs to have more staff on those nights. 

Anyways I've had some really great memories of mellow. I was coming 2-3 times a week on average and was a strong regular. We've been slowing down on going to mellow mainly of the service. Easy fix is just to ask if we want anything else, don't make me ask you as the bartender. Once or twice I can understand, now it's becoming a habit. Hope the manager reads these because I'd like to share my frustration in greater detail.The valley could use more locally owned places such as this, a relaxing joint to have a bite and no need to feel like in a rush.  I definitely give credit to our table runner... just as I asked where the knife and fork was, he immediately said he'd get it and other staff were unobstrusive about removing our plates later.  Since it's not restaurant style and leave a tip on the table, I think the higher prices are justifiable for their great service and pay their salary. 

As for the food, it's ok.. nothing mindblowing.. the bread (MJ's?!) under the croque monsieur was excellent but the rest was meh.. ended up scraping off the bechamel and eating the bread alone.  Tunia fish is fresh and tasty, generous helping.  It's really the combo of the  atmosphere and friendly vibe that would have me come back if I'm in the Ahwahtukee area.I liked this place.  We went for breakfast and I had an egg and sausage dish on a roll.  Really didn't like the roll at all, but what was inside was great (didn't need all that bread anyways).  We sat outside and I really want to go back at night with the fireplace going and listen to some music.  I'll be back.I know I only gave this spot 3 stars, but here's why. I come here almost every Sunday after hiking south mountain. It has fantastic lattes, way better than Starbucks, and the food is delicious too. However, the prices here are way too high for the amount of food/drink you get, and the service can occasionally be slow, depending on how busy it is. They do not handle busy times well, although they are much better than they used to be. The most disappointing thing about this place is that they no longer allow dogs in their nice side patio, so after my hike with my dog, I have to sit near the front door which downgrades my experience a bit. I still go here frequently despite all of the above as it really is a decent place for breakfast. Btw the mimosas are to die for!came here last summer and i was so excited to visit!! this place reminded me of sweet factory in sf (but they closed it down couple years ago). when i got here i was a bit disappointed because they did not have a big selection of sweets. but i did like how they had those candy jars and boxes to put your candies in. it was a bit overpriced but hey! i'm on vacation. it'll be souvenirs and i can reuse it at home anytime i want to. haha.Right at the intersection of N. Scottsdale Rd., N. Greenway-Hayden Loop and Mt. Getoveryourself Lane is the new shopping center, Scottsdale Quarters.  Because there was not enough shopping at Kierland Commons and certainly not enough within the surrounding square mile, Scottsdale Quarters was wisely erected during this recession.

I visited because my daughters received H & M gift cards for Christmas and there is an H & M here.  H & M is pretty much targeted at 20 somethings and wannabe 20 somethings.  Sort of Ikea meets The Gap.  Although in fairness I did spot a Sgt. Pepper looking jacket that I tried on...it just didn't work.  For me or anyone.

So Scottsdale Quarters also has some upscale stores and Brio restaurant which I have not tried but it has reviewed pretty well.  What they are lacking at this point is a good coffee house where dad's can chill while the kids are at H & M.

I like the upward rather than outward design of much of the shopping center.  It would be nice if they add apartments or condos rather than office space above,  Or at least a mix.  That would certainly lend itself toward an urbanism that the Valley is missing.I'm so torn on this race. I want to like it much more than I do. But, unfortunately, it's not really what I'm looking for.

It seems like everything here, like a Schwartz, comes with an up side and a down side.

Up side: You get to run up and down the strip. I mean, really, how cool is that? They only shut down the strip a couple of times a year, and to have it shut down for this it's extremely cool.

Down side: You're really only on the strip for a few miles. You get the full length on the way up, but only about halfway on the way back down. (Wow that sounds dirty.) And if you're doing the marathon you're going to spend a lot of your time on the west side of the 15, and nobody wants to be there.

Up side: It's an experience every runner needs to have!

Down side: It's an experience every runner needs to have. This past time (2013) my first mile was at about a 10min pace (I was looking for about 8min). There was just a wall of people that you couldn't get around. And despite the fact we were in the right corral for our starting time we spent the entire race passing people.

Up side: The organization. They've fixed most of the problems they had in 2011. Signs were clear, the finishing area was nice as you were just dumped off into the strip, which made walking back to the hotel easier.

Down side: Still room to improve. Once you entered the starting area you were stuck there; you weren't allowed to leave even to warm up. And from the start area it was still a good half-mile walk to the corral we were in.

This is a race to run once, and with no expectations of a PB/PR. I've done this race 4 years in a row now, and I don't think I'll be back for year 5. Unfortunately the annoyances have finally built up to the level where they overtake the good parts.What's wrong with me?!? I love popcorn but this place just didn't do it for me. Love the concept, merchandise, staff is incredibly friendly and generous with samples. I must agree with Mur T. I miss the popcorn smell and the availability of fresh popcorn. I did buy three different flavors, Chicago, Vegas and a chocolate but I think I was a little turned off by the way they are just stored in big containers in the back. I'm also not a fan of the hard shell coating. I think Maw N Paw in So Cal and Garrett's in Chicago have spoiled me.Paradise is ok if you aren't looking for something amazing. I can easily make the same quality sandwiches and soups at home. But I like to go out sometimes and have a sandwich somewhere else. Don't get me wrong they beat subway easily but they aren't great by any means. There is a young girl there who is too cool for school but everyone else is super nice. I will always continue to eat there, but not with high expections."Disappointed they advertise a healthy lifestyle yet offer no sandwiches that are veggie friendly. Only one hummus veggie friendly wrap that is not include in the half sand and smoothie deal.  Bummer!" tip posted night of dining at Tropical Smoothie.

Review now:
After I posted the tip above I heard from a fellow Yelper that they offer a no meat option, yet I was not offered that at this location. The woman taking my order wouldn't even let me order a sandwich with no meat, just cheese, only option was hummus veggie wrap. Luckily for them the smoothie was good and I gave them 3 stars for that and their quick service.Nothing special here. Just an average, forgettable burger. If there was a Five Guys in the area, I would pass on this place.Dear Fox Restaurants - I am slightly disappointed in this recently opened Fox creation. I am a fan of your other joints, and this one fell a little flat for me. We went to dinner with some work colleagues. They all seemed to enjoy their meals. But mine was a little disappointing. 

When we arrived my colleagues had already ordered wine and the pretzel appetizer. These were both great. I ordered the gnocchi for my entree - this was were I was disappointed. I think with some work this dish could be great. But it was -- ehh. The gnocchi (which is usually one of my favorite dishes) was a little mushy. I also did not think the sausage and mushrooms blended (taste wise) in the dish. 

I would go back and give this place another shot. Just order something different.Oh, the dulcet tones of RE CALL WALK ER while we attempted to enjoy our al fresco dinner.  Which isn't to say that I disagree with the sentiment - just that it interfered with the otherwise very pleasant ambiance of Coopers Tavern.

We stopped in for dinner a few weeks ago on the recommendation of our Airbnb host - when he learned we liked beer, he insisted that we try Coopers.  We were grateful for the recommendation!.  I really enjoyed the Irish Cobb salad - house-cured corned beef, oven-dried tomatoes, asparagus, hard-boiled egg, Dubliner, and scallion-mustard dressing - but we were disappointed in the beer cheese pretzels, as the "dip" was more like soup.

I'm not sure where to rate the service, exactly.  I think our server was new, but she was definitely enthusiastic, peppering us for our drink order before we'd had a chance to open the menu.  When my husband asked about a beer listed on the menu, she informed him that they were out but it was SO GOOD.  Very helpful!  He really wanted the beer, and now would obviously have to take his drinking dollars elsewhere if he wanted to try something that was obviously recommended.

Despite that overly grumpy digression, we'd definitely give this place another shot.Cute guys wearing tight black shirts selling cupcakes covered in glitter?  Yes please.  Nothing more to say.4.5 for really nice rooms but 1.5 on the service. Scored a 1 BR suite that had a living room AND a screen that came down that also turned into a projector for the tv. Sweet set up for the kitchen as well. Makes sense since these were condos that didn't sell and got converted into hotel rooms. 

Here's the downside: the service SUCKS. The funny thing is, this room was comped because the first time my boyfriend stayed here and got such horrible service that they comped our room this time (hey, you can't turn down a free room). This time, they didn't clean our room. We got back to our room around 5PM, saw house keepers outside and assumed they'd clean our room. When they didn't (and left!), we called customer service who said they would send someone to clean our room. We leave and come back around 1AM and our  room hasn't been touched at all. We call down to customer service and they said that our room got a note that said we "refused service". What the hell? Finally they send someone up after 20 minutes (poor lady) and we don't get back to our room until 2AM. That's pretty crappy way to end the night, especially if you've been out all day. Normally this wouldn't be a big deal but cmon when most people stay at a hotel, they aren't expecting much. In fact, the only thing you expect is for them to clean your room. That's it. If you can't even do that, that's pretty much a fail in my book. 

So, like I said, really sweet rooms but man, no wonder all the ratings gave it such crappy ratings--service sucks! C'mon PH Towers, you gotta know that customer service is HUGE.Decided to drop in to fulfill a sweet tooth. Walked in close to closing time, so most of the sweets have been sitting out all day. The guy behind the counter (who I think was also the owner) was very friendly, and answered any questions we had. I ordered the tiramisu.. Pretty good. My boyfriend had a cannoli.. Eh. Let's just say we liked the tiramisu better. The layers in the tiramisu were a good lady finger/espresso/cream ratio. The cannoli fell flat, the shell wasn't crunchy. More soggy than anything.
Gave it 3 stars for the tiramisu & customer service.Great service but the massage therapist are hit and miss.  I enjoy the rates and how close this location is to my home.  I would try to find a therapist that I like but it's more important that I can just call ahead about 30-45 min and get scheduled which is great.  Very clean location with nice furniture and I always buy the 3 massages for $150 since that is a pretty good deal as long as I use them before they expire.If you're looking for bang for your buck and by that I mean HUGE portions, this is a quality place to eat.  While there are definitely other places on the strip with higher quality, more flavorful food, most of them aren't offering portions this size.

I had  the Sage Fried Chicken and a Bloody Mary.  The Bloody Mary was the first one I've ever tried and it was delicious.  Peppery, with the perfect amount of Vodka mixed in.  The fried chicken was average and the bacon waffle was a little disappointing.  They basically throw a bunch of full pieces of bacon into the batter, throw it in the waffle iron and call them bacon waffles.  Good try, but the waffles just didn't have the flavor that I was looking for.

It wasn't a bad meal by any means though.  For the price, I definitely feel like I got my money's worth and I wouldn't be against coming back to this place next time I'm in Vegas.My boyfriend and I got the corned beef hash to split. It was good but nothing to rave about or go out of my way for. The portion was huge, which was a definite plus. It had corned beef hash with country fried potatoes, an egg and a biscuit on the side.

The wait time is absolutely ridiculous here until it hits about 10 pm. From then til about 5 am, your in the clear and I say go for it!

Located inside of The Quad, on the second floor. 
The inside is relatively on the small side considering how popular this place is.

I would probably come back again, but try something different.This place made me hash house a go go to the bathroom. Okay that may not even be true but I wanted to write it anyway.

Not a surprise that we stumbled in here at around 2am on a Friday. I was with a group of seven, though that really only counted in terms of bodies. There were about three functioning brains in total. Then a few girls came and joined us. One of them knew my brother. Somehow that made the functioning brain count go down one. Boom! Take that, girls that I don't know at all!

I ordered some eggs and they actually weren't that bad. They weren't that good, either. But again, 2am. So whatever.

Every single plate that came to the table had a piece of watermelon, a strawberry, and a giant sprig of rosemary. Every plate. Not sure why. The guy who orders things must have a connection with the guy who distributes those things.

Strawberries and watermelon are not in season (actually, does Las Vegas have a fruit season at all? can produce grow amidst despair?)

Rosemary...well that would have been fine, except that every indication on the menu suggested that it would be sage. Sage waffles. Sage chicken. Sage this, sage that.

But then it turns out it was all rosemaried instead.

Computers went down at 2:45. Computers came back up at 3:00. There is no bathroom in the whole restaurant. I think that is illegal in California. But we were not in California. We were in a hash house in Nevada.I agree with most of my fellow reviewers that no matter what the service is going to be like, most of us will continue to shop at Victorias. Where else are we going to go? Since I have a V.S. credit card they are always sending me coupons for free underwear or a couple bucks off...which I realize is just an excuse to get you in the store. I fall for it every time. Of course I want my free underwear! oh, and maybe while I'm here I'll just take a look. They are so sneaky that way!
Anyhoo, I find the customer service to be either hot or cold. Sometimes you're bombarded with 10 associates asking to help you, and other times no one says boo to you. I guess you just fend for yourself and if you need help you can find someone to ask. I have no problem with that. 
The store is usually stocked pretty well with sizes and selection and generally speaking the sales staff is pretty friendly.  They know they have us hooked though, right???Let me start by saying that the room itself was okay. Good pressure in the shower and free hbo. Free wifi and a hot tub in the parking lot (seriously).

Then let's get to the bad:
* Tons of construction outside the hotel. Like literally every piece of Main Street is covered in cones and pylons and great huge signs directing traffic. There were no left turns out of the hotel and after the first couple days you couldn't even turn onto the street from a couple directions.
* The neighborhood was a little sketchy. We didn't have any problems, but it wasn't a great area.
* The pillows were no larger than breathmints. Like seriously, smaller than my head. And they felt if they put 5 of them on the bed that would make up for it.
* I could hear everything going on in every room around me.I've been to this place twice. The first time I went for a new set of acrylic nails, I didn't have to wait too long and the tech (Terry, I think?) did a great job - I was very pleased.

I went back about 2 weeks later for a fill and left extremely disappointed. Terry was not available, but that was my fault, I should've made an appointment. I was assigned to a male tech who took over an hour! I asked him a couple of questions - one regarding the type of fill and the other regarding a nail color and he answered "I don't know" to both. Nobody else was there to help so I just went with it. I tried telling him the length I was looking for and he just nodded but ignored my request. It seemed as if he was annoyed and hated what he was doing. Needless to say, the final product was very disappointing. The nails were too thin, two of them broke within a few days and the nail polish peeled.

Maybe I'll try a third time? With Terry.Every time I've been at this shop Ely hooks it up with a really nice cut!  Also make sure to go when it's not busy since he's the only barber.I tried to avoid this place when I need a car wash, gas, or a few snacks. When this place opened, the service and atmosphere was great. Since that time, a decline in appearance and service has set in. The store looks similar to a run down Circle K on the inside. Outside you are likely to be approached by the car detailers looking to sale you wash and service or by someone asking for change or a cigarette. Getting a car wash usually pits you against someone who cares nothing for their job nor has any level of intelligence. After returning to the serviceman for my air freshener that is supposed to come with one of the washes and having him ask for my receipt and then go back into the building to verify the purchase (despite already having my receipt and having literally just watched me go by minutes earlier), I stopped having any type of faith in this place. It is frequented by teens who sit outside smoking or asking for smokes and has become nothing more than a run down gas station. It is a shame because it looked so nice when it was first built.My favorite things at Old Navy are their tees, tanks, and pajamas.  They have a big selection of jeans, but you have to commit to trying on a whole bunch before you find the right fit/style.  It seems like you could even grab two or three of the same size/style and they'd still all fit differently.

This location does carry maternity clothes, but don't look in the women's clothes section - the maternity clothes are in the other corner of the store, with the baby clothes.I ordered a frozen coffee and when I received it, it was runny and lacked flavor and was way over priced. I'll stay going to Starbucks!So far I haven't had the best experience.  There have been a couple miscommunications that I wasn't happy about.  Our first visit to the store a young lady helped us and referred us to their website to use build -a -tux so we went home and did that, came back the next weekend to find out that we didn't even need to do that.  My son got measured for his tuxedo on that visit and I was told I could come back and pick up the tuxedo when it was ready.  I got there today and they needed my son to make sure it fit well.  It's a 40 minute drive for us so we have to come back again tomorrow.  I talked to the manager, John and he was very generous and understanding.  Even more important he listened to my complaints and made me feel better about coming back.  Crossing my fingers the tux fits tomorrow!Yep. It's a Target.I tried to order a pizza tonight for delivery and the wait time was so long I didn't even bother. 

Last time we ordered a pizza I remember the delivery time they told me was a hour to an hour twenty, but it took probably an hour 45! The pizza was good thankfully.I tend to avoid chains and I don't eat burgers and fries very often, so this place isn't really catering to me, anyhow... but for what it was, I didn't love it and I didn't hate it.

Here's what I didn't love:

I thought that the fries were supposed to be bottomless, but the server did not replenish them. 

The restaurant is really loud.

For what I had -- burger, fries, and a soda -- I ended up leaving $20 for my portion of the meal. That's too expensive for what I had. I don't want to pay that much for a meal like that unless I'm at a theme park or somewhere else with more of a geographic monopoly... or unless it's like the best burger and fries of all time, which it wasn't.


Here's what I did like: 

Even though the restaurant was crowded, we were seated quickly (party of 4). 

The two teenagers who were in our party wanted to share a milkshake and the server brought it already split into two for them, which was nice. 

My burger (guacamole bacon) was cooked the way I asked (medium rare -- sometimes places like this overcook even when I ask for medium rare) and tasted pretty good. It wasn't my favorite burger, but it was fine. 

I upgraded to sweet potato fries, and I liked them!

Anyhow, it's Red Robin. It's a chain. You know what it's going to be before you go, probably. We went because the teenagers in our party wanted to go. It wasn't my choice, but I thought I would share. There is a Red Robin really n ear my house in Delaware, and I never go and likely won't go. No judgment if you like it... it's just not my thing!This place is a bit unprofessional. We never get out order right. We use them as delivery most of the time. I usually venture to Anthem to get it right.This Starbucks is weird. Drive through and walk-up only. Only outdoor seating. Weird can be good! But, it wasn't great. 

It's essentially in the parking lot of a hotel, and I visited while I was staying in that hotel. They had the same ratio as my local Starbucks... my drink was right 3 out 4 times. However, the one time it WAS wrong - it wasn't just a LITTLE wrong - it was completely the wrong drink.

Definitely not somewhere you'd go to do work in less-than-perfect weather, and it might as well be located ON the highway... i.e. there is a ton of road noise.  

However... friendly staff. 

Standard Starbucks experience.The only reason I go to this Circle K is because its a 3 minute walk from my apartment and the gas is usually 20 cents cheaper per gallon than other gas stations less than a mile up 7th st. Be cautious when they scan the merchandise didn't realize I was double charged for a bag of chips until I got home because I used my debit card. Was told only the manager can refund the chips but her hours are weird. When I did catch the manager she was in a hurry to leave and said she would call me which she never did.  See a lot of unusual people hanging out and asking for change. Had one guy try to sell me a bike and the major selling point was that he swore it wasn't stolen. The employees have to deal with a lot of unruly customers.Ok fellow Yelpers...it seems many of you are yelping about the hotel. I believe this location is specifically for the restaurant and NOT the hotel.

The restaurant is located inside the Forum shops in Caesar's Palace hotel.

The food is your average American food with average prices. The service we received was pretty good though. She was really friendly, outgoing, and funny at times. The only thing we had to complain about was the fact it was quite dim and the dim lighting kind of made us sleepy or hurt our eyes trying to see our foods.

I ordered the Pasta Carbonara and it was a good size. I almost finished it. It was also pretty tasty. Everyone else ordered burgers and other sandwhiches that looked decent too. Again, there's nothing super special about their foods. But it isn't that bad and there is a lot to choose from.After a busy grocery shopping outing at Walmart, my tummy was growling and I didnt want to go home and cook. What's the next best thing? L&L! I was right across the shopping center. I made a quick call on my way back to my car and placed my order. I figure by the time I unload and drive over there, the food will be ready! Now thats being efficient!

I order the Loco Moco, Hawaiian BBQ Chicken, and two pieces of Spam Musubi. The total cost came out to around $21. The food is very consistent with the other L&L's I've been to. Never a complaint from me. Would I come here again? Definitely. Would I recommend what I ordered? Definitely! You really cant go wrong here.I heart their chicken and green chile soup and their bottomless mango iced tea but have yet to find an entree that's worth coming back for...Drove a long time to get here because of the super high yelp rating. But I don't think it should be that high review, at least for my first time experience. 
We got the Carne asada plate, taste just average and the size is small. The inside is small and very simple but seems very busy during lunch time.  I don't think I will drive back here for lunch. Maybe it is good for ppl live near by.First off - I'll try them again, so that's a good start. But second, this was disappointing. Delivery was late and the food quality needed some work. It probably would have been better if we had eaten there, but the big problem is that the food was delivered cold. We ordered a  fried chicken dinner and a steak sandwich. The chicken had a nice flavor but it was tough. cold, and the pieces were small. I think if we got it closer to when it came out of the kitchen it would have been much better.  The sandwich also had a good flavor, but because it was cold the bread was dry and the flavor of the steak was lost. We'll try it again soon and hopefully they'll overcome the shortfalls of our first visit. Maybe if they had a better carrier than a plastic bag to deliver it then the food would have been delivered hot and certainly would have been better.  We'll see.I'm didn't think I was really a Dress Barn kind of shopper. I was in a pinch for a decent, somewhat conservative cocktail style dress for a wedding and NYE party I was attending. I was on a SUPER budget and in a major time crunch. It was close to the holidays and I was doing everything in my power to avoid a mall (Fashion Show and Galleria) and avoid Town Square. I was feeling quite anti-crowd you could say. I came into Dress Barn (Located in the Aroyo Crossing shopping center near Michael's and Famous Footwear) after unsuccessful trips to Marshalls, Ross and TJ Max, thinking, "Oh what the heck, it's worth a shot." 

I was pleasantly surprised by several things. First, the cleanliness of the store and the availability of product. I thought the shelves would be empty and the store wrecked, that was not the case. Second was the quality of the clothing. Much to my surprise I found some really cute stuff, AND, they had sizes that fit me in stock! The prices were pretty decent, and the quality of the clothes was equally decent. The staff who helped me in the dressing room and during check out were not overly friendly, but they did handle the job. 

Wow Dress Barn, I was surprised and impressed! I guess I might need to come in here every once in a while to check out their every day and work clothes. I though Dress Barn was for "moms" turns out I was wrong. It's ALSO for young adults (just avoid the mom type stuff)! Hmmm...who'd of thunk it!Gamestop (AKA Funcoland, EB Games, etc.) has been a nationwide game store chain for years. They certainly have no shortage of stores around the Vegas Valley, as well.

This place is all about video games, so the associates are generally pretty knowledgeable about the subject. They are usually nice guys as well, so that's always a plus. Typically, any time I go in the store I am asked if I am looking for anything, and while I am usually not, they don't seem to have a problem with people just there to browse. 

Gamestop carries just accessories and games for pretty much every video game system from the Playstation 2 up to the modern age. They have a solid selection of used titles, so you can often get some bargains on that end. Likewise, the chain has a frequent buyer program where you can save money and gain extra money when doing a trade-in. What systems they carry games for, though, as far as slightly older ones go (PS2, Gamecube, original XBOX) tends to differ from store to store. 

I have one major complaint with Gamestop however - they severely downsized their on-hand merchandise in recent years. I used to be able to come in this place and get memorabilia/toys/etc., plus cheap movies people had traded in. Now it's pretty much games/systems/accessories only. I liked the way this chain thought outside the box, but now they're back to "just games." Likewise, there aren't a whole lot of bargains/savings on "new" merchandise (though this is typical of most stores that sell games.)

If you have a Gamestop by you, they are definitely worth checking out, just don't go in expecting an out-of-this-world selection and prices.As far as Vegas bars go this place gets two thumbs up. There food is excellent they have some good beers on tap including Guinness. The staff is friendly and attentive. They have a DJ on weekends with a good local crowd.I was able to get a side salad and rice & beans plate for under $5. It was a nutritious, vegetarian, and cheap. The salad was just romaine lettuce (not that shitty iceberg) with chopped tomatoes and tortilla strips. It was definitely not mindblowing but at the $1-2 range, I can't complain. My rice and beans plate was surprisingly large and in charge. However, the rice was bland but fluffy. The black beans (you can choose either black or pinto) are the real gem; they were cooked perfectly and topped with cotija crumble cheese. Baja offers a salsa bar and most of it is okay. Even the hottest sauce doesn't have that nice fire punch I was craving. The pico de gallo was unimpressive because the tomatoes were unfresh and mushy. But they have banana peppers and jalepenos. And a nice bonus: next door is a Starbucks so you can have a your caffeine midday fix, too! I know I'm judging a Mexican fastfood restaurant based on a salad and r&b plate, but hear me out, rice and beans are a simple staple, and sometimes simple is all I need.The Skinny: some pretty great entrees, some not so good... skip the bread pudding (3) service: slow service - took a while to place our orders(1.5), value: remains to be seen (2).

After the great experience the last time, we brought all our friends to feel the love that is Mundo. But the love just wasn't there tonight.

It took a while for us to order our dishes and to hear even what the specials were tonight. It basically took at least 15 minutes to wait for our waiter to come around and take our order.

I got the roasted chicken dish with tamales which was excellent - great flavours. Paired with the sweet tamales, and I was in heaven. My husband ordered the filet which was only alright. The side of mushroom didn't appear to be "wild" at all - yup! $8 for a small side of plain old button mushrooms. Would definitely not recommend this side.

Another member of the table ordered the tortilla soup and taquitos which she said were both good.

Unfortunately, the carnitas was a rather poor compared to the other dishes on the table. Like a previous reviewer noted - some appeared dry. 

We did order the bread pudding which was fair at best. Nothing special. Would probably not order again.

Service, as I mentioned, was slow tonight and the timing of the dishes were poor.

Overall, a significantly less pleasant experience than the last time. I'm downgrading this place to a 3 instead of a 4.Coffee was on par with other coffee bean locations, but the place is small and there were some kids getting busy in the entry for way too long. 

There's a Dunkin Donuts next door. I'll probably go there in the future.Though the smell of the place can really get to you, the instructors here are amazing.  Down side is the people at the front desk are extremely rude and not very friendly.  If customer service were good all around I would have continued to come to this studio. But since it's all the way on the other side of town I think I'll have to opt out for a more welcoming environment.  

Other than the downsides, they have a clean changing area with 2 showers where they provide body wash, shampoo, and conditioner so you can wash off all the nasty sweat after your classes. 

Try catching Summer and Stacy. They're both awesome in their own way.Cleanliest Walgreens bathroom out of all VEGAS on the strip at least.We went here for a quick snack and got a vanilla milkshake and a side of fries. The fries were a good portion for one person, and the milkshake wasn't as thick as we normally know Johnny Rockets for. The service was good.

Other than that this Johnny Rockets is the only place in the food court that's open 24/7, there's nothing special.This is a pretty nice neighborhood joint.  Pretty typical - but nice.  Stopped by and found some nice happy hour specials.  $5 appetizers and cheap draught beer.  Mostly a gaming establishment but it is a good place to throw a few beers back!Yes, the sticky buns are great.

My grandparents would think this was one of the best restaurants in the world.  The menu is very old-school with rich, heavy dishes.  We started with the recommended shrimp pepper pot.  It was delicious, but we both commented on how heavy the butter seemed in the dish, and how it could have been lightened up with a little olive oil.  The house salad was romaine lettuce with a sherry vinegarette.  Again, a more modern menu would probably use different greens.  Our entrees were huge - my prime rib was cooked nicely but lacked a little seasoning. My wife had the fish special: halibut in hollindaise sauce.  Again, huge portion, very rich.  Coffee was very watery and reminded me of dinners at grandmas house.

The patio is amazing with beautiful views. The menu a throwback to an earlier generation of "fine dining." it was nostalgic to eat food like this, but i doubt we'll come back.Valentines 2/14/11

Bopped in here for a quick margarita tonight before we left the strip. I have only had a full meal here once but the burrito I had was $15 and worth every penny. The burrito was double the size of a Chipotle style and even more tasty. Margaritas are decent price for being apart of the Mandalay Bay chain as well as the authentic tacos. 

Mostly a noisy bar atmosphere but well decorated with a great friendly staff.

Good place to catch a quick drink of a meal before heading out on the strip.Stopped here with two of my buddies to eat dinner. Before getting ready for a night on the strip. We were pretty hungry. This place is ok. Nothing amazing. Beer and food was all we needed to refuel for a long night. And that we got.

I ordered a chicken chimichanga. Came with beans and rice. The usual stuff. Buddies ordered some beef tacos, and nachos. Had a few rounds of beers. Also they were debuting some new tequila that night. So we got complimentary shots. Free is always good. Prices were ok. A little overpriced but thats expected. The atmosphere is pretty cool. They had a live band playing Spanish music that night. Not too loud, as others have stated. It's not a rowdy get your ass kicked kinda place. At least I didn't feel it was. But id come back if I was craving Mexican food in Vegas.This place was mediocre..no complaints really but nothing really wowed me to come back..The breakfast burritos are very good.  Everything else I've tried hasn't been as good as the Filoberto's on Arizona Ave and Ocotillo.GREAT food and I would definitely recommend it for carry out.  This is about as authentic as it gets.  A long wait for your food can be expected, but is well worth the wait.   However, I'm deducting 1 point for service and another for atmosphere.  

We recently stopped in for lunch, and were the only guests.  When placing our orders, the server seemed annoyed that we had come in.  It felt like we were interupting something very important that was taking place in the back.  We did not receive our drink order until our food arrived about 25 minutes after we ordered.  It would not have seemed as long had it not been for the terrible atmosphere.

The dining room is very bright with tall ceilings, so sounds echo very easily.  Some other people stopped in for lunch, and we all spoke very softly to not share our conversations with each other.  If they'd turned on some music, it would have been much less uncomfortable.  They did have a TV on, but it was muted.  

I think with a few minor adjustments to the front of house staff and the atmosphere, this place could definitely earn a 5 star rating.  They've definitely got the food for it!Despite how good the food was, and it was AMAZING. The service was awful. Our waitress wasnt really interested in helping us. She forgot half of one of the orders at our table, it took almost 10 mins to get water. Then when I ordered a black and tan she brought me a full guiness because the Bass keg was empty and they needed to change it... ummm yea wouldnt you ask before you assume?
Not to mention it took forever for her to return with our checks.we stayed at city center and had some time to kill between check out and our flight so we went here bc it was super close..to continue with our one meal a day during this trip.. 

we split the apps..
-chicken wings: had a nice kick from the spice
-corn dog puppies: mini corndogs with fries.. i liked these the best
-roast beef sliders: only thought these were ok 

this isn't a place i'd crave on my next visit but i wouldn't mind giving it another shot..Place is pretty good but expensive! Almost everything on the menu is $20 bucks or more! Had the lobster rolls which was good. They have lots of beer on tap.. Pretty fun crowd. If your only in the crystal palace mall/Aria area this is worth the short walk but i wouldn't go out of my way to just come here.My boyfriend built up this place nearly every time we passed it, so naturally I had to take him there on his birthday for dessert.

Let me just start by saying, I am a real snob about certain desserts-and bread pudding is one of them. I grew up in the south and I have my own personal preferences for how it should be done. And I was NOT crazy about their bread pudding at all. Not only was it very, very overly egg-y and soft (bordering on runny), the flavor lacked anything like a true rum raisin bread pudding. Maybe they put some sauce on the top too far in advance, but the general flavor was not traditional at all to me.Big disappointment. 

Now, the donuts they served us complimentary for his birthday were amazing. Specifically, that perfect caramel sauce that comes along side them. WOW. I could drink this stuff by the bucket, it is dangerous. 

The place itself is interesting, a small, quaint place that I imagine gets very loud when packed. Service was good as well. I might return for a meal if they put SOMEthing on the menu that was vegetarian : /I had a really good burger today.  Mushroom and swiss, juicy burger, lots of mushrooms, good bun!  Yep, good burger.  The fries were ok - a little too salty for me.  My daughter's chicken strips/fries were the typical kid's meal fare.  The whole place wasn't as clean as I'd like considering they weren't busy and they had lots of staff.  But I will go back for a burger.Has all of the usual suspects that one needs from a Starbucks but Holy Long Lines!!  All day!  It's right near the elevators so it's the main Starbucks in the MGM. (I think there are 3 on the main floor of the MGM).  OK selection of food.The breakfast buffet was delicious, well stocked, and had a great variety of choices.

I enjoyed the chorizo and eggs, and the biscuits and gravy.

It's a good buffet, for not a lot of money. I'll be back.3/16/11

Came in to see what Pomo had to offer on their happy hour menu-- certain cocktail drinks are half-off (I had the lemon drop, or something akin to that, with lemon vodka and fresh lemon juice).  The two pizzas I've tried here were just OK.  The Quattro Formaggi (mozzarella, provolone, gorgonzola, and parmigiano) was very salty, but good, crispy crust that didn't stay crispy for very long (not even ten minutes!), and the Quattro Stagioni (minus 'shrooms) was tasty, but I wouldn't order it again, as the crust was very soggy due to the tomato sauce.  Such a shame...  

Order the bruschetta!  I had it for happy hour-- sadly, HH menu only offers discounts on cocktails, not food.  Boo!  So, I ordered the bruschetta to try while waiting for the pizza... I should've just ordered two of the bruschetta!  Loved the crunch of the bread, and the toppings tasted so fresh!  

The panna cotta I had for dessert was good- you wouldn't have to twist my arm to order it again.  :)  (But of course, I'd like to try other desserts on the menu first.  That is, if they aren't off-limits...)  Mom liked the millefoglie w/ chantilly cream and strawberries offered to her as a token of appreciation when we had dinner there on Pomo's first-year anniversary.  I really enjoyed the slice of "anniversary cake" I was given, since I couldn't have the millefoglie special (due to powdered sugar and cornstarch in this pastry).

Service was very relaxed and probably modeled after the service you'd find in Italy-- it brought us to recall the same nonchalant attitude we encountered when we visited Rome many years ago... (Most, if not all, of Pomo's servers and bussers are Italians from the "old world," complete w/ accents!).  Mom and I noted that most of the dinner customers here seemed to be Italians, w/ many of them carrying an air of being visitors, or tourists, not locals.  

Two visits and the only things I can vouch for are the lemon cocktail, the bruschetta, and the anniversary cake (which wasn't even on the regular menu!).  One more try, perhaps...Beware of reservations. On two ocaasins they were lost. The third one done thru open table was not lost but was for 7:15 and or outside. We were finally seated at 745 inside. Had to check with the less than helpful hostesses who seemed either overwhelmed or none to bright at least three times.  First was told it would be ready soon, then was told  they were paying the check THEN the table we were supposed to have was ordering  dessert. SAY WHAT? Was with another couple we had bragged about the food about.  It was a liitle embarrassing. Not sure we will go back.Ok.  So I had heard about SmashBurger for a while, and considering I was in the area, I figured, might as well see what the fuss is about.  After perusing the menu, I decided that the Sin City Smash and some sweet potatoes fries sounded very appealing.  I order, they give me my number and I sit and wait.

Finally, the food had arrived.  Mind you the wait wasn't that bad, 5 minutes maybe, decent time, nothing to mark down on.  I take my bite, and I'm overwhelmed by the onions.  There were 2 types of onions in the burger that it pretty much took over.  I could taste the burger and the egg, but it was well masked by the onions.  The burger was well cooked and very good, and the egg was nice, though a little overcooked.  Altogether an good burger.  The sweet potatoes fries were tossed in olive oil and rosemary (and I think garlic, not sure on that one).  It was very offsetting for the sweet potato fries, though I'm sure it would taste better as the normal SmashFries instead.

All in all, I was kinda let down after all the hype I had been hearing.  I'll probably be back, as it is a better burger than 99% of fast food, but as of now, probably not too often.The third or fourth time I went was today, a Saturday afternoon, Always have had good quality, but I have a couple of pet peeves. First the cost, I think kicking it down a is not going to happen but...How about not hosing me for 99 cents for adding a smallish amount of Mushrooms on my Burger and the Fries are 2.69  (i think) and super small order size, yes cool Iron basket with high tech wax paper liner but please Load it up.
I did enjoy a chipolte Bun today and it had a Spicy kick to it which I enjoyed.
So there you go.So the burgers are good, as most people on Yelp have posted, but the experience could be better for a number of reasons.  We had the $20 dinner "special" for 2 - where you get 2 burgers, 1 order of fries for $20.  So when I got the bill, I was charged $21.25, and not $20 (this is not including tax), so I was thinking "wait the special is advertised for $20, NOT $21.25!  

The server informed me that I was charged an "extra" $1.25 because I asked for onions on my burger! WTH!??  Are you serious??  The server never said that I would be charged extra for onions - so be careful when you order here, because Zin likes to add deceptive charges - what a Sin Zin!  Shysters.

I reluctantly give 3 stars because the burger was good and the service was also pretty good.  But Zin should include some food on the side with their burgers, because when you order a burger you are getting it stand-alone, no fries, no veggies, nutin.

If you want to add "extra" on your burger, be careful.Two reasons to come here, you like metal music or you are still hankering for more drinks late at night or early morning when the bars are closed.  If you a fan of metal and want drinks late at night, this place is the place for you.

This place a labyrinth, rooms into corridors, into more rooms and more surprises.  We ended up in a room with a pool table, and its own juke box, I found of the bars and I just kept going back to it because I didn't want to get lost.  Everything would have being fine but the pool cues were as crooked as a NY politician and the juke box started getting pricey and the bar I did fine was always packed.  They served drinks but the prices were slightly higher than the other bars I visited my time in Edinburgh.There is absolutely nothing special about this bar whatsoever, but it is perfectly nice, and nice is better than horrible. It is pretty small, but has a friendly atmosphere, especially during the evenings, when they have live traditional Scottish folk music. The band are great for background music and are especially welcome in the cold Edinburgh winter. With the unusual addition of a video of a fire on the wall, you feel like you are in a traditional pub.

The bar is tiny but still manages to have all the normal drinks, with a good selection of bottled beers and ciders. The food is what you would expect from a pub, and is relatively cheap. They are particularly proud of their buffalo burgers (sourced locally. Yes apparently we do have buffalo in Edinburgh) which are apparently much healthier than beef, with less fat and reduce cholesterol. To be honest though it tasted exactly the same and my cholesterol, as far as I know, hasn't massively dropped (or increased for that matter, just pretty much stayed the same). 

They have a pub quiz once a week which is quite easy but a good laugh. Overall the pub is a nice place to come for a few chilled out drinks, but not much more than that.Been wanting to try this since I moved here because of the 4 and 5 star reviews here on Yelp. While the service here is very good, I would have to say that the food is just OK. ( based on what I ordered - Thelma's Special).DATE: August 20, 2009

I was leaving for Indonesia 2 weeks later and the boy and I had just spent the night before talking about our plans for the future.. As soon as I reached home, I would talk to my relatively conservative social figure of an Asian Dad and announce that I was ready to get married - to this "fresh-out-of-college American boy" he never met. Considering the high risk of meeting opposition from my side, we decided to make a quiet, private commitment to each other in the form of a marriage license in the city that sealed the fate of our relationship 8 months before. When we called concierge at 1:30am the night before to find out where to go, we were informed that we'd have to go to the courthouse (which was closed at the time) and get a license before meeting an officiant. At around 1pm the next day, we headed for the Clark County Courthouse.

Getting a marriage license here is a pretty simple process:

1. Fill Out Forms
2. Wait In Line
3. Pay + Answer Questions For The Official To Complete License

However, I can't imagine that anyone who were stumbling in here drunk off their asses would be able to go through with the process. Contrary to how the movies make it seem, it's not as simple as wandering into a chapel and getting it done. You have to be lucid enough to fill out forms and then coherent enough to talk to the official BEFORE getting to the chapel. There's no way you can do that completely knackered..The customer service in the childcare dept is subpar. What is that all about, Lifetime. It seems like the facility, when it comes to childcare, are more interested in telling the members what they cannot not do for them instead of what they can.
Other than this, the facility is great! May cancel my membership if the childcare customer service does not improve.I love the staff here, always friendly and they know what I drink. I come with my dog and sit outside. Few places in Vegas that you can do that. Always get my order right. I like their pastries though I wish they had a better selection. More chocolate cake please!!! Free WiFi... Thank you.Time for another review...my first visit to the NEW Al's wasent so great.....but in my review I did say I would be back to try the beef.

Let me start by saying...I am a VERY tough critic....I know what I like and if you advertise anything Chicago...that is what I compare to...not other local business.....

I stopped by at 11am ...(my thinking is everything will be fresh)...and I did order a regular size beef and small fry....

I was still not thrilled that it cost over $10.00 for a beef and small fry...however... I dont mind paying more if I feel its worth it...and in this girls opinion....the beef was TERRIFIC!

I did order the beef wet...with au jus and their homemade peppers on the side.

The beef (as previously reviewed by someone else) was dry and a bit bland...however...once I poured the au jus and peppers over it.....BAM!!!!

The flavors EXPLODED!  

The sandwich was ample and two of us shared it and we were both very satisfied.

I like a beef sandwich that is NOT thick pieces of beef...and this was exactly that...

Lots of beef and the bread was nicely saturated in the yummy juices....

When I was in the restaurant I had the pleasure of speaking to Michelle...one of the owners  who was very interested in my opinion....so much so that she asked me to call her and let her know what I think...

I did just that....so Michelle....this review is for you....and for all of you Chicagoians out there who enjoy a really hefty and flavorful Italian beef.

If you went to Al's once....my suggestion is.....give it another try and order something different to get the true experience.

I will DEFINATELY be back for the Beef   

I realize food is really  personal preference....

Some think Lukes is good....to me Lukes is BAD food at EXTREMELY high prices...I tried it once and wont ever go back....so bad I went against my rule of always trying a restaurant  at least twice...just to make sure....  

So, if you are comparing Al's to Luke...NO COMPARISON!!!

Al's WINS any day of the week....

It is my opinion...that if it a Beef sandwich you are looking for....no need to go any further than "Al's Italian Beef"!My group of friends takes an annual trip to Vegas which went on a two-year hiatus and resumed in 2009.  Each year, we stay at Bally's:  at first because of its central location and low rates, and more recently because we accumulate enough points to have the rooms discounted or comped.  It's a good "starter" hotel, and we find it good enough to keep coming back.

Both the hotel and the casino are the plainest of the plain, but they serve a purpose.  Usually we stay here and gamble part of the time next door at Paris.  On this trip, we did a four-hour stint at the Bally's pai gow table on Friday night which should set us up with the comps for next year.

There's really almost nothing to say about the hotel.  We've stayed here so much that the rooms look eerily identical; even last weekend, after three years had passed since I had been there, it was like deja vu.  The water pressure in the shower was really crappy this time; otherwise, it's just a hotel room.  You shouldn't be spending much time in the room anyway, right?Our south tower room had great view of the Strip and casino isn't so large that you get lost. Room was a bit tired and there are newer, cheaper options. Not bad.What's to say? It's a pretty expensive but homemade tasting food(Is that a good or bad thing - who's to say?) Like another review said - the cheese tasted like Sargento and I can't disagree. Because it tastes like something you could make yourself - its easy to say "whats the point?" I've had it a couple times and I appreciate the taste and price and its nice to goto when Ian's is full but don't expect to be Wow'd or something.I really, really wanted to love Johnny Smalls as they have a great concept and great potential.    The problem was they fell short on execution.    Sevice was decent on a Saturday night but the food was just "ok".

The best things we tried were the fried green beans and the short rib.    The bowl of beans was huge, the short rib, tiny.     Everything else ranged from "ok" to "meh".   The "meh" items were the tikka masala flatbread, the chili dogs and the sweet potato tots.    "Ok" were the Mighty balls, the PB&J (note - I am not a PB&J fan to begin with), carne asada tacos (these were only luke warm - if they were hotter, they would have been alot better).

If they get their act together this place could be really fun but they just aren't quite there just yet.There's no denying this venue isn't immaculately kitted out with the latest lighting, slouchy booths, opulent wall decor and generally sexy looking bar space. I just can't pinpoint what exactly the vibe is supposed to be, as despite all the snazzy decor surrounding you, it's hard to really get a feel of the kind of club atmosphere Shanghai is aiming for. 

Last time I was in here was during the week, and it was pretty quiet to be honest, however it is fairly large as night clubs go, so it'd probably tricky to fill it up completely, particularly on a week night. Weekends are most certainly busy, what with this being a club on George Street, plus the fact people come down from Le Monde, the bar above Shanghai. Lots of dark corners for dark snogging deeds, if that's your thing, and plenty of dance space.Fun vintage little hotspot. Parking is very limited and the drinks are way overpriced. About $10-$14 if you get one of there specially made drinks. 
I do love this place for dancing though! It's right between the feel of a club and a bar. They play old school through current hits! I first found this place and now my friends have fallen in love with it as well.I have always been a fan of Rubios, especially their lobster burritos they have a few times of the year.  Unfortunately, the last time I ate at this Rubios I am pretty sure I got a bad batch of something because I was ill for the next couple of days.  Hopefully they get things worked out.3.5 stars rounded down!

When they first introduced this program a couple years ago, it was a GREAT deal. $49 all you can eat for 24 hours right on the Strip is a STEAL.  For the most part, you would only have to eat at 2 buffets to earn your money back since most of them are in the $20-$30 range.

However, fast forward to now. They made changes to the rules. So the $49 is only for weekday pricing, if you purchase it on the weekend it will charge you $65-$70. The quality of the buffets have also gone down a lot. Costs are always going up, and buffets tend to be the most cost efficient options, so casinos still have to balance out costs and quality. 

The Bacchanal Buffet at Caesars hands down you must try..however, you pay an extra fee to eat here per visit. It's $15 for breakfast, $20 for lunch, and $25 for dinner. It only ends up being a $10-$20 discount from it's normal prices, so that's something to consider.

Besides Baccahanal, my favorite buffets are the Rio and Paris ones.  Harrahs and Flamingo are standard buffets with no standout items, and Planet Hollywood for whatever reason is just a really shitty buffet. And they got rid of the Imperial Palace (aka the Quad) buffet, which didn't matter because that buffet is worst then Hometown Buffet.

The reason why I rated it down because I wouldn't eat at half of the buffets if they weren't included on the list. Many of the buffets just aren't tasty, and worth eating at.

I don't see much value in the wristband anymore especially if you are staying on the weekend), i rather get in a solid meal at Bacchanal for breakfast/lunch at normal price. And enjoy light meals throughout the day (ie: Earls, Pinks, etc), I'd still come in for less then the price of a wristband and be more satisfied with the food.

However, I still think it's a good deal especially if you are a big eater. An extra plus, if you are staying in any of the  Total Rewards hotels that participates in the program since you can get food and drink whenever you like. I stayed at Rio once, and literally would pop in every couple hours for a snack.  

So it depends on how much you eat and what your daytime activities entail, but one thing is for sure..SIGN UP AND BRING YOUR TOTAL REWARDS CARD...if you don't have one, you don't get the $5 discount!

#GLUTTONY!The Which-Wich style of Hot-Dog orders, this place packs a solid frank. The sweet potato fries are recommended and the portion is fairly large. At the end of the day, I had trouble paying nearly $10 for a hot dog, fries, and a drink; especially when Costco is right down the road and it's $1.65 for a dog and drink. If I want a Fancy Dog, I'd recommend Short Leash Dogs in Phoenix. Unfortunately, they're not out on the west side!

I plan to go back and try a couple different options.I used to rave about this place to my friends and family, but my last visit here was just ok. I had the Kiki's Burger on my last visit and the taste was ok. The presentation of the burger was something they just slapped together. The bottom bun was hard...maybe the bread was old. It's hard to imagine that this restaurant would have old bread to serve because it is packed with people. Be prepared to wait a while for a table. The hostess will try to convince you to drive to their other location which is about 20-25 minutes away...not 15 min unless you are a race car driver. Lastly, the service was horrible. Our server or the kitchen lost our order and we were left waiting a long time for our food. What is worse is that the server never acknowledged that our order was not put it right away and did nothing to try to rush our food out.I had a slice of pizza from this place at a friends house shortly after they first opened. I couldn't remember if I liked it or not, so I suggested to hubby that we try this place for dinner. The employees inside were very courteous and friendly and the guy who gave me the pizza let me know they offer delivery, which is a plus if you like the pizza. 

Hungry Howie's claims to be "The Home of the Flavored Crust" and offers 8 different types to choose from. The concept here I do like. It sounds like a too good to be true pizza place. Well, it is in my opinion. The 8 types of flavors are butter, asiago cheese, cajun, butter cheese, ranch, sesame, garlic herb and onion. Sounds great right?

I ordered a large "Cheese Pizza" and a large "1/2 Pepperoni and 1/2 Sausage Pizza" as well "Asiago Howie Bread" to go along with the pizza. When I first opened the pizza it looked great. I asked for the cheese pizza to have butter cheese crust. I could see the ring of butter soaked into the pizza box around the crust and it didn't bother me because I did order a pizza with butter on it, but the crust as well the pizza in general had no real flavor. Maybe all the butter cheese flavor soaked into the pizza box instead? The pizza wasn't gross, it just wasn't great. Very average for all the flavor the menu claims to offer. Hubby had garlic herb on his crust and after I sampled a bite of his crust I tasted no garlic flavor. The howie bread I found to be dry and not the type of cheesy I was looking for. The total was $25.93 for the 2 pizzas and bread which I wouldn't have minded if the food tasted as good as it looked. I might be up for trying this place again in the future, but not anytime soon. 

Other things offered on the menu are salads, calzones and wings. You can also order online.Its a cool little spot, good food and caters to the younger crowd. Not that they won't give you the same service if you were older but the decor and ambiance is more for the younger hipster folks.I felt pretty let down by Rocket on my first visit last week.

It was lunch time and yes the cafe was busy but the staff were shocking.  They were all nice, but there was no order whatsoever and as a result, everyone was running around but nothing really seemed to get done in a proper or timely manner.  
It was like everyone was meant to do everything instead of something like:

1 person take orders, deliver food and bus tables
1 person man the till
2 people make food

There were easily 4 or 5 employees when I was there and we waited aaages to order (only to have 3 people then ask to take our order), my friend ordered soup and a sandwich which came out a good 10 minutes before my dish, and getting the bill was painful - we eventually had to go up to the till only to find that they had no record of our order.  

Additionally, I ordered the burrito which was fine, but was *really* heavy on the onion which was diced into the salsa so unavoidable.

Overall, as I said I felt pretty let down.  The staff were nice and I would come back for takeaway but the manic air to the place made for a less than pleasant eat in experience.To make this review authentic...I'M SHOUTING.

IT'S TOO LOUD! WHAT? I CAN'T HEAR YOU IN THIS CLUB. THIS STEAK IS DELICIOUS? WHAT DID YOU SAY? THE OYSTERS ARE YUMMY? HUH? WHAT? NEVERMIND!!!!!The atmosphere and the crowd is better than the food and the food isn't bad by any means.  

When the waitresses come out with sparklers and shots for the whole restaurant you know you're in Vegas.
P.S. the shots were disgusting.

When the waiter talks about the special 4 oz Wagyu NY strip but fails to mention its $38 an ounce and you order 24 ounces without anybody complaining about the bill you know you're in Vegas. 
P.S. the steak was amazing.

When there is a table of 1 very attractive black chick, Asian chick and white chick eating nothing the whole time you're there but sitting in a prime middle booth waiting for customers you know you're in Vegas.
P.S. they were hookers.

P.S. the pop over is great.  The appetizers are just ok and overpriced.I hate Mcdonald's I go tto be really really Hungry to eat there but my kids like it. This location service is what u expect from Mikey D's, nothing more nothing less.Old school looking, looked slightly dead. Had about 2.5 tables going, mostly elderly people. Probably a lot of Old town Vegas locals who have been playing here for years. I do like how they have a seperate tournament room though. And the hall of fame portrait photo wall of all the famous poker players that had played there. A damn good amount of them have been there. That was a cool feature.= = = = = =  THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE WEEKDAY LUNCH BUFFET  = = = = = =

Well, it's been 7 months since enjoying this India Garden here, so it was due time to whip back over & see how they're doing.  This is a nice, fairly large place with tables only, no booths, and an 18 item serving table, which is probably about average size for an Indian Buffet.

The Naan bread is tasty here, served hot with a little seasoning (& we were offered more of it).  The Daah Maharani lentil soup was good, too.  Overall, though, I thought the food was just ok this time.  Their Tandoori Chicken, for instance, was rather dry, tough, & low in flavor, in my opinion.  Also, the service was blah.  SO,

an "OK" place...  Lunch Buffet $9.99 includes hot Indian style tea.  Full bar available.So...the food was good, very good even, but I have some complaints.  I would like to preface this review with the fact that I was overly excited to try this place.  I would say my overall feeling about Nourish is that I felt as if I was being 'sold' on an idea...does that make sense?  I went for brunch and had the egg/avocado sandwich w/cheese ($10), a coffee ($3), a side of fruit ($6.5). and a cinnamon role to go ($6 for just one and rather small).  Most everything seemed overpriced, even for Scottsdale, and I felt I was being 'up sold' on everything I ordered.  They was even an add in fee for plant extract in water.  The atmosphere & service was nice, but when I asked the server the 'quality of their animal products' he wasn't sure.  I later went onto their website to check it out, and they do have very high quality animal products, although it would have been nice to know there.  All in all, it was good, but I don't think I will be going back.I have no idea how I stumbled into this place, I think I was just killing some time or so. But I am glad I did because its really a nice place even if the Mens section is the size of a book case. But everything in here is organic  and I would say its all good quality . The mens section has some really nice cologne that you cant get anywhere. There is obviously tons of women's stuff. This review will be shorter because I didnt sample any of the women's stuff but from the smell of the place I would say it smells like good quality to me!I have walked past the Storytelling Centre umpteen times and have always thought that would be a lovely cafe to sit in and watch the world go by in. It has a massive windowed front looking right onto the Royal Mile. Perfect for drifting off and staring into the distance.

 So, I decided one day I would give it a go. It was fine when I arrived, although I had barely sat down and was asked what I wanted. I felt a little rushed, especially when the waiter stood there whilst I had a look through the menu. To be fair to him I should have just said I wasn't ready, but I ended up going for  a cappuccino and a piece of millionaires shortbread. The coffee was perfectly pleasant, and the millionaires shortbread was sweet, crumbly and pretty nice. Almost as good as my mums but not quite.

Where this cafe fell down was the image I had in my head, and what it turned out to be. This may sound awful to some, but there ain't any point in beating about the bush. I came here for a quiet half an hour chillax. Did I get this? No. Why not?

Kids. When I first walked in there were about two families, that was fine. After sitting for about 10 minutes I swear the place being swamped by screaming, crying, shouting kids, and their mothers who were decidedly unimpressed at the lack of high chairs. I think I turned up just after/before some book reading for them. Needless to say I did not stay long after that, my head was starting to hurt. 

Moral of the story, next time I will double check what is going on in the actual centre before I turn up. The cake selection is wide, and very tempting. Good specials on the board and a fairly solid menu.I went here on Mother's day, and we ended up getting a reduced rate for mom ($3 bucks).....This helped offset the overall cost of admission, so I won't gripe too much about the price.  Just FYI - You can get discounted tickets if you purchase/print them on line.....

Yes, it IS expensive, but it is in a mall with numerous high-end shops, etc.  I think that if it were somewhere else, that the price of admission might be lower.

The tanks are very clean (especially the BIG one).  All the creatures looked pretty happy, so I guess they are doing something right over there.  There were a couple of dead jellyfish in one of the tanks.....The only "bad" thing I saw.

Lots of kids acting like kids.....A few times we got backed-up behind large groups of people - I can see how this would be a BIG issue on a busy day, but it was not too bad for us on a lazy sunday.

Yes, it is dark in some spots - I am sure somebody will fall & sue them one day.....LOL  The darkness does make it cool, though - Just watch your step!Nice club. I wish they had more tables and sittings outside.First night in Vegas and we were looking for a bite to eat in Caesar's Palace.  As we were checking out the menu, the Hostess mentioned they had Happy Hour at 9pm and it was half priced appetizers and drink discounts.  It was only 8:15 and we didn't mind waiting for food until 9.  So we explored for 45 mins and returned for happy hour.  For drinks, she ordered a vodka and cran and I got the Miller Lite.  At the end, our receipt had Absolut and cran, which is at a premium cost.  We were expecting them to give her just the house vodka and cran.  Oh well, you live and you learn.  

For the appetizers, we had the grilled cheese, sweet potato fries with garlic mayo, and the philly cheese steak sliders.  I would highly recommend the grilled cheese because this is the perfect comfort food.  The side of tomato cream dipping sauce was a very nice compliment to the sandwiches.  If you like garlic, then you will love the garlic mayo dipping sauce for the sweet potato fries.  I love garlic so the sauce was great to me, but some may find it too strong for their taste.  The sliders were okay.  Kind of dry.  It would have been nice to compliment it with a dipping sauce or maybe I could have used a condiment (ketchup, mustard, or mayo) to offset it.  

Highly recomment for happy hour as their prices were reasonable.  Not sure if I would go here and pay regular prices unless I'm in my drunken and hungry state after bar hopping/clubbing.  Service was ok.  Just saw the waitress when we ordered, when she dropped off our food and when she dropped off the check.  No follow-ups and none was really needed.  

Would I return:  Yes, for happy hour or if I'm drunk and stumbling out of Pure hungry and thirsty. 
Would I recommend:  Yes, for the same reasons above.Alright, already, the show goes on
All night 'til the morning, we dream so long
Anybody ever wonder when they would see the sun go
Just remember when you come up, the show goes on...at MUNCHBAR! - Lupe Fiasco (the show goes on)

Located right next to PURE nightclub, this 24 hr joint is a life-saver for ppl staying at Caesars. Their jalepeno burger is really good, their fries are less than average, and their nachos are good for the first few bites then everything tastes the same. The fact that this place is open 24 hrs though is a huge plus and they have enough tvs for you to enjoy your favorite team.  

Food: 3 stars --- Service: 3 stars --- Atmosphere: 4 stars --- Price(value): 3.5 starsThis place was ideal for the late night munchies! All your greasy, fatty options you crave after a night of getting liquored up. Or a full bar included in case your not ready to grub.

The staff was very interactive and genuinely friendly. We couldn't decide on what kind of shots to get so our super cool server surprised us. We ended up with PB&J shots. Which btw, tasted dead-on...

Food:
Chili cheese nachos were friggin off the chain GOOD! These nachos are a nice portion, good to share and get full with at least another person, maybe two others.

Sweet potato fries were a hard miss. They serve them in some cute little bucket but it made the fries soggy and gross. Not even the dipping sauces could save this disaster. 

My friend ordered the grilled cheese bites and they were not aesthetically appetizing. Per my friend they were a little dry. 

Overall, it's a koo lil diner spot with a full bar (no ciroc btw) that's open late. The chili cheese nachos are a must and with 5 stars. I say 1 star for the nachos, 1 for the server and 1 for being open late.I was really hoping Teriyaki Time would be better than my initial expectations but that didn't quite happen. Based on the restaurant's name I figured to try the Chicken Teriyaki with Gyoza. Most of the bento box was about average, nothing too impressive but at the same time not horrible. However I have to say that the salad they gave me was quite disappointing since the dressing they used seemed kind of cheap based on the looks of it. I also wished that the portions would have been bigger especially considering the overall quality of the food.

To be fair, the lady working at the restaurant seemed nice based on first impression and it's right near campus so I'll give it a benefit of a doubt for those reasons only. It seems like a decent choice to get a meal if you happen to go to UNLV, just don't expect anything spectacular.After a recommendation from Rand H. my hubby & I came here Sunday night. The restaurant was very clean & had a nice layout. When we were 1st seated a male server took our drink order, then throughout the meal a female server took our plates. Both were very sweet. What did surprise me though were the bathrooms. The sink area was actually super clean but the stalls & toilets were VERY dirty. I just washed my hands & waited till we got home to use the restroom. 

There were quite a few buffet options to chose from, plus a salad bar & sushi station. The stand out items for us were: crab legs, mussels baked w/cheese on top, green beans in some sort of sauce, mini eggrolls, sausage w/mustard & salmon. For dessert we each had some tiny cakes (coconut & coffee flavored) & I got a piece of this apple turnover looking thing w/some vanilla ice cream on top. 

Total including tip was about $30. Fair price for a buffet & we would probably come again if we were in the mood for it.I expected quite a bit more from this place.  Let's start by saying that the facilities are absolutely stunning.  You walk down a hallway that is lined with wine rooms and sommelier quarters and flanked by private booths with stunning views.  It opens to a huge white tablecloth dining room with incredible 180 degree views.  They absolutely have that right.

I had the braised porkshank.  It was very good.  It was not amazing and it was not the best that I have ever had but it was very good.  One member of our party had the lamb.  He said that it was just ok.  It looked great and the presentation was really executed well.  The other had a filet.  I am not a fan of filet but that being said it was still very good.  He also said that he enjoyed it.  I have to say that it was prepared perfectly.  I di did not try it but the quinoa was raved about by the others at the table.

I think they have it right.  A beautiful dining room.  Really good food...not the best...  Prices were reasonable for the quality and experience.  I was there on business and would return on my next trip.  Not being from the area, if someone else had a suggestion that they thought would be better I would pass on orange sky and try that new place.Decent price
Quick service
Busy place, so it's difficult to find a table
food was interesting, I love Mexican and Korean, but together it's just not my cup of tea.  The food just seemed greasy albeit seasoned well
and NO scissors for the kimchiIn a similar bracket to H Samuel, Warren James offers a good range of jewellery for all age groups at affordable prices. They tend to be hot on the latest jewellery trends offering copies of more pricier brands but at cheaper prices, perfect for gifts and if, like me, you're not too kind to your jewellery and are prone to misplacing it. 

At the moment they have an extensive range of charms starting for as little as £6. This is perfect for children if you don't want to splash out on more expensive brands.We tried `Off the Strip' based upon it's high rating for Italian cuisine in the Las Vegas area. Even on a Saturday night, they cheerfully accepted our reservation for 2. I made mention that it was our anniversary. When we arrived there were just two tables available, both right by the kitchen. Not exactly a `romantic' location w/ all the kitchen crew noise and wait staff traffic.

The service was prompt and very personable. We both ordered the Caesars salad w/ our entree. I asked for a small side of marinara with the bread. I usually do this because I enjoy a dip of marinara with my bread, but more so on a first visit, it lets me evaluate a key ingredient for most of their offerings. We all have formed our own particular tastes when it comes to Italian, and mine was formed during my travels to Italy, in particular Southern Italy. For me their marinara was not bad, but a bit too salty w/ a just hint of tomato. Not that fresh tomato flavor I have grown to love, so I avoided their marinara offerings and went for a vodka sauce dish.

The salads are made to order, I know because we were just steps from the salad chef. The Caesar salad was too 'hot' for both of us. It overpowered all other ingredients. We were later told that it was due to the amount of garlic used. I suggested they try cutting back a bit to give all of the complex flavors of a Caesar salad the opportunity to shine.

Dinner was good (not great), but we were both pleased w/ out entrees. After dinner we were surprised w/ a complimentary slice of their famous cheesecake. It is not under rated. It was delicious and the highlight of our Off the Strip dining experience.

A Tip... I don't know what the Off the Strip corkage is, but if I were to return, I would bring my own favorite as their most marginal wines are in the $35 range w/ most anything decent at $60+.Since not eating any meat for a month now and I went in to try their veggie sandwich. It was ok I guess but the best place to get green waffles though..Its not my favorite spot for Vietnamese sandwiches in the area .. but it does the trick for being open 24/7. I absolutely love the coconut waffles and the location is pretty convenient.The prices are reasonable. Its more of a American Vietnamese sandwich spot then anything.Stayed here this past weekend. The hotel looks so cool from the outside, so I have always wanted to stay. We checked in at 245pm on Saturday, and we were quoted a 30 min wait for our room to be ready, which ended up being 5 minutes.  We were put in a junior suite, however, my reservation was for a deluxe suite. I'm not sure if they tried to put us there because we wouldn't notice, but I had to check to be sure. They "upgraded" us to a premium oasis suite, which sounds cool, but is really just a deluxe suite with a pool view. The location was cool, because it was right across the street from the hard rock. If you are going to a concert at the joint, like we did, you can walk right over. The rooms have modern decor, similar to cosmo in my opinion. 

Here is what was advertised and not provided: there was no iPod docking station, no rumor bath supplies, no adult channels.  I would have preferred to know there was no iPod docking station, because I would have brought my own. Also, there is no valet service on Sundays, which was part of the "resort fee". Also, the bathtub was not really clean, which made me not want to use it. There are no towel racks, so towels will not properly dry. The ice machine in building 3 did not work all weekend, closest working ice machine was in building 8. Also, they provide 2 drinking glasses, much smaller than a regular cup, but just bigger than a shot glass. 

Also, there are two flat screen TVs, but the living room tv is tiny, maybe twice the size of an iPad. Also, the air conditioning units are loud, so you will be sleeping in a warm, stuffy but quiet room, or a cool, super noisy room. 

Overall, it is a Cosmopiltan Room on a budget, away from the strip, but has its share of drawbacks.I'd give it a 3.5 stars. We went last night and had dinner. The pizza is brick oven. Thats a plus. It's not a coal fired pizza, so I understand the difference. The pizza was good. We got a large pepperoni. It was nice and greasy and had average tasting peperoni. The crust was crunch and chewy, witch you expect from a brick oven. I got a cheese steak. It was average at best, but at least they had cherry peppers. Usually I have to order a cheese steak and have to add my own sweets and hots (chopped cherry peppers). I read that they had a kids area, not true anymore. That was a disappointment. My wife had to take the kids outside to play for the 50 min wait. It all worked out. 

Bottom line: I'd eat there again for pizza. It was good but not Grimaldi's or  La Piazza al Forno. Better than Barro's or anyone else within close driving distance from Goodyear.Late review.
Decided to try this spot while in Vegas since another spot was closed on 4th of July.
Used the Yelp coupon for checking in.
My daughter LOVED the grilled cheese meal.  She's a picky eater when it comes to her sandwiches.Want in to give it a try, didn't hate it, but I've had better. I had beef pad thai and it was great. My boyfriend on the other hand, he had the seafood soup, as usual, when they brought it out, it seemed good , but had a really strong bay leaf smell, and when he went in for the scoop he saw there wasn't any shrimp, and the portion was smaller than others we've had. Other than that service was great and the restaurant had a nice ambiance.Burgers are pretty good here.  I had lower expectations since it was inside Harrah's, but they delivered a nicely cooked and prepared burger.  The problem was the service.  The waiter kept avoiding us and it must have been 20 minutes before he brought over our water and only wanted to take our drink orders.  I asked for the manager, who waited on us the rest of our meal.  Food took forever.  It kind of ruin a nice burger.  Not sure if I'll be back unless the service is improved.  But how am I suppose to know that?Fantastic that they were close to where I work, rushed over to pick up my lunch here.

I must say that 3stars is all that they're getting, they didn't quite live up to their 5* hype.  Straight to the food I ordered a fukuburger & jazz fries, rushed it back to the office & started devouring this beastly morsel. 

The patty was medium well, I enjoy having a little pink in my meat which melts in your mouth & that's where the fantasy stops, no explosion of flavors nothing exponential new that catches my palate, a very subdued burger which is completely fine just subtly boring possibly due to the hype around it.

The jazz fries on the other hand, were absolutely effin fanstastic, only that thick fries don't work too well combined with the gravy, its still pretty good. I would  definitely start having gravy with my fries.

In all honesty I wouldn't go out of my way to track this roach coach down for their burgers, I would however be compelled to chase them for their fries. odd...Standard Sandwich Offerings with that Government-Smell

SITREP

This is the kind of place you hit when you are working close by, have about 15-20 minutes to (literally) grab something fast, and probably actually consume it while back to your deposition or training.

But creative props for at least having a sense of humor for choosing a name that is befitting of the location and vibe of the surrounding professional environment.  It is a Courthouse afterall.

SETUP

This reminds me of the low-key delis & cafeterias I usually frequent at the Clay Street Center in Oakland, the California Highway Patrol Complex in Monterey Park, CA, and the Health & Human Services Cafeteria inside the Bateson Building in Downtown Sacramento.

* Non-Descript
* Near a central government plaza
* An array of pre-made sandwiches, beverages, chips, etc.
* But quick and inexpensive

THE LOWDOWN

A decent good "grab & go" establishment when you have little time to grab a quick lunch.I've been a member of several gyms over the years, and Pure Gym is best described as the place to exercise for the financially conscious. 

It's a cheap as chips gym for £17 a month, which doesn't dent your pocket as much as a typical gym membership at £40+ a month. However, you get what you pay for at Pure Gym. 

The basic facilities are absolutely fine. There's a large ladies' changing room, showers and a really well equipped gym. It's also large and despite it being monster busy over Jan I've never had a problem getting on a cardio machine. There are weights, spin bikes, mats and a wide range of cardio equipment to keep you busy. 

So for £17 if you're a loner gym bunny, it's pretty good value for money and just what you need. 

However, where this gym loses it for me is its complete lack of personality. The classes are quite poor (my abs class saw a bloke reading instructions from an iPhone while he watched us doing tummy exercises in an island of mats visible from the cross-trainers - not much effort there!), there's no chat from fellow gym members and it's all a little bit too goldfish-bowl-esque (no, I don't want the entire gym and passers-by outside to see me screw up yoga poses). 

So a solid three star effort. It does the job but don't expect anything extra!Now that I have attended, I have a better idea of how to better enjoy this festival in the future.  
We arrived right when the doors opened on Sunday.  It was busy, but well organized and traffic and the lines moved fast.  Though there were quite a few booths set up with jewelry and such, it all looked liked junk and wasn't much fun to browse.
The food looked good, but it was a little too warm to sit in the sun for long and the few tables in the shade filled up quickly.  If I came another year, I would rather come at night, grab a table and some wine and enjoy the music and people watching.
The pastries were delicious!  I was very happy with the great selection of desserts.This is a cute little place that's very clean. The sandwiches are good but a little overpriced, around $7.25 for sandwich and another $2.50 for side and drink. We got the chicken salad that came on a croissant.  There was a lot of employees in my opinion for such a small place, about 4 and two were kinda standing around staring at us when we were ordering... Kinda awkward. Would probably come back if on the area and try another sandwich, wouldn't go out of my way though.Great for a quick cup...
Really easy to get to...
After a journeyThe Blue Bean Coffee House is certainly one of the better places in Portobello to go for a quick bite to eat and a warm cup of coffee. With it being on the High Street, this place does not have the luxury of the peace and quiet that other coffee houses have which are located nearer the beach. However, when inside, you become less aware of the busy traffic.

The coffee house itself is quite small inside with a relaxing, laid back atmosphere. The coffee was not very expensive at all, and when I was looking around I found that this place offered a lot more than just your normal coffee. On top of a range of hot drinks, this place also offers small bites to eat including soup and small sandwiches. 

When I was in, the coffee House was not full, but was certainly getting busier when I left during the mid afternoon. 

A laid back atmosphere which is always nice when having a coffee.Grabbed dinner there with my boyfriend.  I was pretty excited bc I've walked by plenty of times and thought the space looked really cool.  I guess I just felt underwhelmed about the experience.  The bartender was a little less than friendly, although the cocktail was pretty good.  We were seated in a table in a semi crowded area near the hostess stand.  The menu seemed a little all over the place.  I understand they were going for an upscale comfort food theme from the fried chicken and waffle and the meatloaf sandwich on the menu.  I got the steak which seemed like a decent enough deal at $20 and my boyfriend got some kind of Vietnamese sandwich.  The steak portion was pretty skimpy, they kind of feathered it across the plate so it looks like more than it actually is.  The sandwich my boyfriend got was cold and the bread was hard and stale.  I'd save your money visit Natt Spil down the street for a better meal at about half the price.I appreciate the need to be trendy and local, but this place is all talk and not enough show considering the Yummy factor for a guy like me....

I've had much better food for the price in many establishes around the Capital. 
I do strongly appreciate how much they are supporting the surrounding Madison Area food (for that a solid 3 out of 5 stars), but I was a bit let down with the production of what I have received in my orders. 

The menu is unique for sure, finding some really cool Madison area alternative eating's, but just be ready to expect that your ordering unique so what they will be bringing you might now be up your ally if your similar to a country boy like me who wants a big old bar burger (grease me up!) loaded up. 
It's hard to screw up a cheeseburger, and I think they may have totally messed it up pretty bad the last time I was there. I'm just not a fan of an English Muffin as a bun for a burger. 

They are a popular place that does not take reservations, so be prepared to wait to be seated. but if your lucky, you will get to sit in a huge booth or nice table, definitely, a great date place with huge place windows over looking Madison at it's finest. 

I'm not trying to be negative about Graze, I'm just not into it as much as everyone else. I would still suggest to try it out. It has enough window appeal to draw anyone it.I hear Legends recently closed, was sold, and is being redone to re-open soon. Fingers crossed as North Scottsdale needs a good little neighborhood hole.Every time I decide to get lunch from M&S, I think I'm in for a treat, and then by the time I get here I've remembered that they don't make nearly as many different sandwiches as they used to and what they DO make is pretty... meh.  

They used to have great wraps, avocado sandwiches, brie and grape, tasty tastiness.  In the place of the tasty tastiness they have lots and lots and lots of pasta salad type things.  Now I realise I just listed avocado and brie as sandwich choices but have you SEEN the health information on those pasta salads??  They're like, 2/3 of your daily intake.  That's narsty.

Additionally, the lines in here can be incredible.  Points for the staff for dealing with it quickly, but man at lunch it's absolutely ridiculous.  

So... I'm just really not that keen on M&S anyway, but poor lunch selection paired with ridiculous lines makes this place 2 stars at lunch time and 3 stars the rest of the time.First time I tried this place I was blown away.  Had a $20 steak that tasted like a $50 steak.  The next time I took some friends and they all enjoyed their meals but I was let down by their burger.  Went again and ordered the steak and it took forever and was nowhere near as good as the first one.  Willing to give them another shot based on first experience.  I just hope they have their act together.went for full lunch and dessert w/ kids:
waffle fries A+
Chicken strips w/ 'paintbrush' for mustard and ketchup A-
Cobb salad - overdressed and chopped, nothing special C+
bacon/chicken on sticks - 4 pieces $7, tasty B-
Croquettes - 4 pieces $7, okay C+
onion rings - tower of 10ish $7, Weee! A-
   came w/ chocloate ranch sauce, meh C+
Penne pasta $14, meh C+
mac and cheese kids meal w/ syringe full of marinara B- for fun factor

The real reason we'll return in the future:
decadent desserts and drinks!
- 80s milkshake (no can for refill) $7  - A
- Frozen lemonade $4 - A
- fondue for sharing - A
- kids loved their 'mess', cakepan sized bowl of ice cream w/ own house choco sauce to pour over - came w/ mini spatulas to eat with - A
- kid loved his chocolate syringe - A

all this w/ tip ran family of 5 $150.00I would give the chocolate 5 stars and the regular food 2 stars, so I ended up with 3 for my overall review.  I got a butterscotch shake that was DIVINE!  When we were ordering our lunch food, the waitress boasts to us that she has never had complaints about the food ever.  That was a bad sign.  Turns out we were her "first ever" complaints.  Or so she said.  A few of us ordered the Max Brenner burger.  We requested medium when asked how we want them cooked.  I ended up with a super dry burger that was charred on the outside.  I should have shelled out the extra $2 for the kobe beef because my friend said that although hers was overcooked, it was still juicy.  Mine was completely devoid of juiciness.  The waitress did comp one of the burgers when my friend complained, but I can't imagine she would have comped them all, so I stayed silent.  I was so full from the shake that I didn't bother finishing my burger.  Also, the BBQ sauce is non-existant on the burger, so make sure to request extra.  So disappointing for a $15 burger!  I will only come back for the sweets when I return to Vegas.My husband and I shared a burger and dessert. The burger was pretty tasty though small and I enjoyed the waffle cut fries that came with it. For dessert we got a waffle that had chocolate sauce, rice krispies, bananas, and ice cream. It was pretty delicious but again a little on the small side considering the prices at this place. We were in a group of 6 and the service was a tad on the slow side too. All in all an okay place to go and if you're in a group they take reservations which is convenient. Coffee is decent and there is a bar and chocolate shop inside. Next time I think I'd stick to just fun drinks and dessert there rather than a meal.The food and everything were wonderfully delicious, but the service bothered me a lot. The person who seated us was really nice, but our waiter seemed really rude. He would just throw everything on the table, napkins, forks, spoons, the check. It seemed like he was having a tantrum yet trying to be nice for a good tip. The food here is extremely good to eat, I had the hazelnut strawberry crepe and a Oreo milkshake. I would go back again even if the service is horrible.Honestly, I don't know jack about Thai food. I eat it occasionally, but not frequently enough to pick up the nuances of specific dishes. So, take this review with a grain of salt. The wife and I got takeout the other night. It's a cute little place... clean, modern, but small. The red curry with chicken that my wife ordered was hot. Very hot... at least for her. She got a level 5 and couldn't finish it because it was so hot. She also ordered extra veggies which cost a dollar. I don't like spicy food so I went with a 2 for my yellow curry chicken dish. Perfect (lack of) heat for me. It was tasty but could have used more chicken. I'd go back to try other dishes.Shave ice (or ice shave if you're from hilo) is the perfect treat for the ridiculous Vegas heat. Ever since big island boba closed, I've had shave ice withdrawals. Its great to finally have a place that's also on my side of town. 
Their flavors were pretty unique, but they were out of about 8 things. I opted for wedding cake just out of curiosity. It was good but I wouldn't say that it tasted like wedding cake - I mainly tasted vanilla. Roomie got banana and strawberry - banana tasted like banana, strawberry was tart and we both didn't care for it. I guess I got too exited when ordering, because I totally forgot about adding condensed milk or ice cream. 
As another review mentioned, service wasn't awesome. Then again how happy would you be packed into a trailer in 100+ degrees? I put $20 on the counter right in front of her, which the wind blew away. Roomie had to chase it and luckily got it before it flew into the street, while the girl remarks "yeah that happens a lot." If she knows that happens a lot, why not grab my damn money right away? 
I also thought they were kind of stingy with the syrup. You get a straw and everywhere else I've had shave ice, you drink the combined syrup on the bottom. Even at the end, standing in 100 degree heat, there was nothing to slurp up. As a kid, that was my fav part so I was a little bummed. 
I'll definitely go again but maybe I'll pay with quarters next time.Same cashier, same experience. I was offered a free meal from their awesome Yelp team, which I told them I would use today. Well the cashier didn't know what I was talking about and gave me $6.99 off (my meal was more then that). I brought my dog so I was going to sit outside, the chairs were still chained so you could sit on them but not comfortably use the table. This is a nice neighborhood I don't see why they need to be chained during business hours. Seems excessive. Never seen anyone sit on them and now I know why. I got it to go and won't be back.

I did appreciate their Yelp teams awesome customer service but that has to transfer over into service in the restaurant.Cool concept.  Hopefully it invigorates Downtown Phoenix nightlife.Spirit is OK. Like other reviewers have said, you need to prepare yourself for a flight, otherwise you WILL be caught by surprise by hidden fees. The key to this is reading their contract of carriage. Yes, it's like 900+ pages, but be aware of the fees and charges and you can indeed get a very cheap flight with them. 

I have flown back and forth a few times from Boston to Myrtle Beach for as little as $90 for my wife and myself. More typically, we do check a single bag, and end up paying around $160 or so RT for the two of us. 

We let the airline select our seat (it's an hour and a half flight, who cares?) and make sure to print boarding passes ahead of time. My wife and I have never not sat next to each other even with assigned seats. Double check your carry on items fit into the small personal item container. And you are OK. 

Yet, every single time I fly I see someone at the gate freaking out over a $40 checked bag fee. While I do feel bad that they were surprised by these costs, they aren't hidden. 

Finally; don't make any assumptions about what is free or not on Spirit Airlines. I wouldn't be surprised if they hooked up a mask to you to measure how much oxygen you use and charge for that. They key is research and making sure you are aware of what those fees are. 

Chances are, once you calculated it all out, you will still save a ton of money vs. flying another airline. It's just more of an aggravation to get there. 

Pros: Cheapest flights around, even after fees, if you plan for it. 
Cons: Requires hours of research to ensure you don't get charged extra for things; flights are often delayed or late.I have never used "ghetto" in any of my past reviews, but I was quite sure I would be plastering all over this one.

We were originally booked on another airline, but due to a mechanical failure our flight was either going to be delayed several hours or cancelled. These things happen and I really wont hold against that red tailed airline, as I would rather arrive safe than not at all.

It was the last flight of the night and we just wanted to get home and our options were limited. The customer service agent then suggested we head over to the Spirit counter.

No, really.

I've heard all the horror stories how this airline charges for everything from carry on baggage to peanuts. But it was literally the only option. 

Amazingly there was no line at the ticket counter. I told the customer service rep the deal and in turn he gave me the low down. He did an excellent job explaining each and every additional charge and broke everything down right down to the amount they charge for fuel (pretty much all airlines charge for fuel, you just didn't know that). My last question before committing. 

"hey, leg room is essential can we book aisle seats?"

Unfortunately all the aisles were already taken, but the agent then told us for an additional $75 we could book what they call the "Big Seat".

What the hay, we want to get home and even though the flight would take us to Oakland and not SFO it was worth the risk and maybe might even score a Yelp review out of it.

I must say, I was pleasantly surprised by said "Big Seat". It was pretty much like any other domestic Business Class seat on most any other airline, minus the pitch. The airplane itself was new and not at all smelly like I had expected. The service in the air was again good but not great then again it was only an hour plus flight. The overhead compartments were large enough to easily fit our carryons.

You probably wont find me switching my allegiance to Spirit. But I must say this, for what they advertise they are. That is exactly what you get.

We got Spirit yes we do!Before Jaiho I had never had Indian food and I must say it was not bad. This is not a put down to the restaurant, I just have no previous experiences to judge this against. 
This place is a self described Indian/Chinese fusion joint and it is that, from the food to the decor of the restaurant. It is a nice mix of both cultures. 
The food: I had the Garlic Paneer Chicken and it was not too bad. The sauce was a little too thick for my taste and I asked for hot (spicy) and expected my face to be on fire. But there was hardly any heat. A little disappointed.
My wife had chicken curry which was just average. We had an order of Samosas for an appetizer which was good and tasty. 
If we are in need of Indian food right away and in the area we will stop in again.I loved the pizza but the service is horrible.  I keep going back for the pizza but every time I go I am disappointed with the service.Hi my name is Katie, and I have a cupcake addiction. To date, my favorite cupcakes have been 1) Hey Cupcake in Austin, TX, 2) Cupcakes Couture Manhattan Beach, CA. I'm still searching for my favorite cupcakery in my home state of Arizona, but until I find something I like more; I was ecstatic to find Cupcake by Design just down the highway from my house. 

This isn't the first time I've paid $3.50 for a cupcake (decorative cupcakes are $4), and I liked some things about different cakes we tried.  This is the first time I haven't seen a discount when you buy a half dozen ($21). Mini's are available for pre-order at $2 a mini.


The flavors we tried were my signature Red Velvet (red velvet cake, cream cheese filled, with cream cheese frosting), Devil's Delight (Devil's food cake, filled with bavarian cream, and fudge icing), Love My Peanut Butter (peanut butter cake, fudge filled, peanut buyer cream icing), and Chocolate Peanut Butter Cup (Devil's food cake, peanut butter filled, chocolate peanut butter icing).

The red velvet had a pretty deep red color, and a moist cake, but I liked the cream cheese filling (which there could have been more of!) better than the cream cheese icing, which was just a little too sugary. The Devil's Delight was skimpy on the bavarian cream, but had a delicious devil's food flavor and a the fudge icing was a nice balance. This one I ate in the shop, and the owner even had complimentary water and coffee set out for patrons who decided to enjoy her deliciousness before they even left the store. It was a nice touch, and reinforced what a great neighborhood feel you can find in the Uptown area.

The Chocolate Peanut Butter Cup had what seemed like solid peanut butter in the center, and was tasty when you distributed it between bites. If not, you may look a little like Mr. Ed as you eat this tasty cake. I probably should have had the Love my Peanut Butter before the chocolate peanut butter, because I totally lost the peanut butter flavor in the second cupcake. Some of this could be as a result of by tastebuds still lingering in the strong chocolatey peanut buttery goodness from the cake before. And if you're thinking, wait, did this chick really eat 4 cupcakes? Yes and no. I brought them to a friend's house and we cut them up and all had tastes of each one and shared our thoughts.

Final verdict: Would I go back for more? Yes. Is my search over for the perfect cupcakery in AZ? No, I will still be on the lookout for a replacement. Until then, I have found a tasty place for my tastebuds to flirt until I find "the one."

To view the other cupcakeries I've tried across the US, visit:
http://eatinganddrinkingacrosstheusa.blogspot.comCompared to a typical Indian grocery store, This place is very clean and organized. All the isles are properly marked and doesn't smell like a Temple(mixed smell of about 5 mil incense sticks)

Kitchen looks very clean and some great items on the menu with close to homemade taste. Their inhouse sweets are just ok but they are fresh, not frozen for a week shipped from NY or Chcago.

My only issue here is service. The lady at the front cash register is so rude, I don't even go inside the store because if her. Absolutely no greeting, no smile and if you ask her a question, lets just say you'll regret it.

EDIT: Service has somewhat improved and I feel the review should be changed a bit. Changing from 1 start to 3 till my next visit. Keep up the good work.

Anyways, here are my very accurate ratings

Cleanliness 9.5/10
Organized 9/10
Variety 8.5/10
Food/Kitchen 7/10
Service 5/10
Location/Parking 7/10Interesting that this is a small chain.  This location has a 4 star rating and the Chandler Blvd. and 16th St. locations have only 3 1/2 stars.

I wanted to hate this place after ordering.  I thought the prices were quite high for a counter service middle eastern style restaurant.  It took FOREVER to get our food and I was so hungry.  I was close to asking for my money back and leaving.

Then the food came.  My girls loved the stuffed grape leaves.  The falafel wasn't the best ever but it was pretty good.  My husband ate all of his chicken and rice and salad.  The eggplant dip was what really shocked me.  I wasn't sure I liked it with the cream sauce on top but the more I ate the more I loved it.  The flatbread was good also.

I likely won't go back as I just adore Haji Baba (Tempe) when I am in the mood for this type of food but it wasn't bad if you are in the area.La struttura non è nuovissima ma è pulita e funzionale. Si trova poco distante dalla Strip e con un costo molto contenuto (circa 34$ a notte per una stanza con doppio Queen Size Bed) non si può chiedere molto di più.
Il personale in reception è cordiale e disponibile. 
Piscina e jacuzzi sebbene piccole fanno molto piacere per rilassarsi dopo una giornata in giro con temperature al di sopra dei 40°...
Il WiFi copre tutta la struttura e funziona bene, il parcheggio ha un costo di 3$ a notte.I'm staying at the hotel right next to this bar so it's really convenient if I just wanna go down and get a beer. They whole layout of the bar is a little interesting and I can't say it's really conducive to the bar's success, but I'm not Jon Taffer, so what do I know?
It's just your basic bar w/ pool tables, TV's, food, and some games--nothing special.The food seems the same as when it was the Griddle. Not bad Not amazing. Pancakes are big ! The biscuit and gravy woulda been better if the biscuit wasn't hard. One thing that bothered me was the setup of the tables and being in a busy walkway . And there felt like there were sooo many workers working that had nothing to do. I felt smothered every few minutes ..I am not the biggest fan of fast food ever. But I really like Five Guys and this location is superb! 

They have really yummy fries and they give you so many! Like your bag overflows with the greasy buggers. Say what? Yeah they are really greasy. But good!

The burgers are really quite the bang for your buck too! Not the best burgers in the world but it is fast food not gourmet burgers. Be considerate for what you are eating and enjoy it for what it is. 

The pop machines are radical. You can pretty much have flavoured any beverage you like. 

The staff here is really friendly and that is a plus anywhere you go!The location of this Five Guys was great, as it was right downtown amidst many other great places. The service was splendid. The food was good; it was better than a normal fast-food burger, but definitely not worth the price I paid for it. The cajun fries are great; you get well beyond the price you pay in fries. I got a "little fry" that I was told "feeds one person". I could have fed two guys off of those fries (and I can eat a lot of fries). I am so glad that they have the Coca-Cola Freestyle machine! I have used this machine in another restaurant in Tennessee and became fascinated with it. You can pretty much make some crazy drink combinations; I had a Peach Mello Yello. 

Overall, the food was great but not worth the price I paid. Would I go back? Sure, but not often. Would I recommend it to other people? Yes, but with an indication of the prices.Love the concept. Born and raised is owned by locals who were actually born and raised in Las Vegas which i can appreciate because i was too. If you also are from here you can bring in your birth certificate and you will receive 10% off your bill forever. Awesome. Great ambiance, love all the unique chairs and TVs galore. Decent prices and pretty good food. Cant complain about the over all place. 
Whats the deal with only 3 stars? The service is beyond horrible. It doesn't matter what time of day or how busy it is the bartenders always look like they want to kill someone. Being a bartender myself I notice the little things and I hate sitting at a bar when I'm paying and tipping (usually at least 30%) and I'm treated as if I'm annoying them by asking for drinks/etc. 
I continue going back because like i said i love the ambiance and the idea of people being from Las Vegas. And its convenient :)I think for the price this food was reasonable but I wasn't exactly impressed.  It was good but my date and myself agreed that the noodles weren't as good as we had eaten at other places.  I don't think that it is fair to give it a bad review but I also thought that the menu was kind of hard to understand.  Maybe it was because it was my first time there but it wasn't really straight forward to me.  Service was standard, nothing out of the ordinary.Our experience at Otto's was mixed. They brought the breadsticks that are imported from Italy. We ask for bread, which came with no butter or oil. They brought oil after we ask. I has the braised pork shoulder and would give it a five. The apple reduction was out of this world. My wife had spaghetti with pepper and butter. It was just average. I ordered Lemoncello and it was terrible. I sent back and the waiter said the bar tender did not shake it up. The second glass was better, but still not good. I would not recommend. We share the three flavored of Gelato and we only found two favors and they were just OK, again I wouldn't reorder.
Our service was good. The prices were high, but for what I have seen of Las Vegas, they were about right.Came back recently to get more of their bomb Garlic Crispy Chicken Wings and noticed that they also have a spicy version.  I opted to go with my old fav, and it did not disappoint.  I also ordered the Curry Chicken over Rice (you can also have it over noodles instead), and the curry was good.  However, the larger pieces of chicken were slightly undercooked, just the way the French Chefs like their poultry. 

If you need to brush up on your Chinese, drop in and watch some TV while you wait for your take out order or while you eat.Here in the former shell of Red Dragon nee Daily Buffet comes the new China House Buffet, & I stopped in to give it a try today, having been alerted to it by friend Alexander C. just yesterday.  All of the charming, funky old '50s atmosphere is gone, as is the Mexican buffet table, & in it's place we have a two sterile, completely blah rooms, with the old booths still in place, but with everything else (like the important room dividers) gone!    :-O

For food, this is strictly a Chinese buffet now, & the new owners had 44 food choices out today, plus dressings & sauces.  The food is different than it used to be, it was good, & certain things were special, including fresh papaya, & the broiled chicken.  It's also the same reasonable price as it was before, & the Hostess/Server/Cashier lady was nice.

I overheard another customer ask her friend what she thought of the change, & her friend replied, "I'm sad.  I'm in mourning."

Me too. 

Lunch Buffet $6.29/$5.66 Sr.Well I went here twice during the week for lunch but I admit it was mostly because of the patio.  Great location, very central on the strip and easy to meet friends at.

The first time I felt screwed by the waitress as she kept bringing buckets of beer, and I don't think anyone was asking for it.  She was also assuming the previous order was the same s the next order which wasn't the case because some of the guys were leaving. long story short, we ended up leaving behind four full beers that we paid for, but didn't order.

The second time I went was great.  I can't complain. And it was very relaxing.  The food is typical bar food, no big deal, but it is such a nice way to chill when you've been walking around all morning.Cave Creek is certainly not a foodie's paradise.  Old town CC is a tourist trap, and Scottsdale Road offers very little.  

In the residential area of Tatum Ranch where thousands of husband, wife, plus two kids abound, Amaro's is the only real dining experience that is accessible.  

And thank goodness it delivers.  

The interior is a bit flawed.  They could benefit from having an interior decorator redesign the dining room entirely so it doesn't feel like a recycled restaurant that spent a little money on a paint job and some re-upholstering.  The space just feels weird.  

But, the cuisine benefits from the fact that you will be hard pressed to find a worthy competitor within shouting distance.  

The pizza is actually very very good.  The crust is top notch and their red sauce is bright and fresh.  

The Caesar comes up short, with not nearly enough dressing.  It coulda been a contendah...

They do this cool thing with kids where they give out small samples of dough to play around with while awaiting the food.  

All in all, this restaurant stands out because it is:
- good quality food
- the only choice in the neighborhoodHad the ham and cheese and it was good but definitely not worth the nearly $7 I paid. As with most sub places, you get one tiny piece of cheese that you can't even taste. Skipping it saves a few calories!

I also got mustard and mayo, which meant my sandwich was now swimming in mustard and mayo. Next time I will ask for light mustard and mayo. 

Will go back, maybe if we get a gift card :)I am so thankful there is 24 hr places around town in case you want something at your convienence!Had a groupon and had to try this place out. Jake was our server and he was excellent. We were very pleased, spouse had a ribeye, was a little fatty but good. I had king crab legs, good but I've had better. Cocktails were excellent too.The Red Velvet pancakes was good Not Great like everyone Hype it up to be. Don't like that they close so early. Not everyone can get up so early in the day. People work all different hours in Vegas.This place was just OK. Nothing to rave home about. I didn't think it was any worse or any better than other froyo places I have been to.The food was good and the portions are gigantic! Two can share one plate. Three stars because the service was pretty bad which is a shame. My lil 9 year old bro ordered a kids burger and they brought it out after being reminded and when everyone else was pretty much done eating. I felt embarrassed for the waitress when he told her " how hard is it to make a burger?"  But the food was good.Very yummy tacos. They were pretty small but you can get 3 for $9 so that's not too bad. Unlike other food trucks, they don't make the food to order in the truck. The meat are roasted ahead of time and then they just put it on the tacos with the toppings and salsas you desire. The pork and beef tasted great but I'm not sure I'd do fish that way.Great, great coffee. I haven't tried the crepes but from what I've heard they are good. My hesitancy with giving it 4 or 5 stars is the cleanliness or lack there of. I like the local charm , but the owner should look to spruce things up  bitFish tacos are not good.I would love to see this bar succeed.  I think a couple of things I feel they could do better.  

A couple of criticisms -  
Food:  Flatten out the chicken for the chicken sandwich.  Makes it a lot easier to eat and stays on the roll better.  

Service/Waitstaff:  Although I think the service is over all good.  They aren't that exciting.  Often times I go in there and other than my order, I literally say 3 words to the bartender.  It's the bartenders job to keep people coming back.  They need to strike up conversations to make the visitor feel that they are important and create a fun atmosphere.  Also you will never get the night crowd if most of your waitstaff at night are men.  It's sexist to say it I know, but this is reality.  Zipps is crowded for a reason.  It's not that they have the best food in the world but they have a nice looking waitstaff.  

Atmosphere:  That Jukebox needs, I stress NEEDS to be on at all times. Music is the key to conversations, mood, and attitude.  Without it, it will suck the life out of your bar.  One of my visits there were with 3 people at the bar and no music playing.  No one was talking. No one looked happy.  I threw in a couple of dollars in the jukebox and saw a transformation that you wouldn't believe unless you were there.  All of a sudden you have people talking, laughing and when other people came in you could instantly see them digging the vibe.   Flanny's is pretty big concrete and airy.  Meaning there isn't much to deaden the sound.  So if there isn't any music playing it's awkwardly silent and all you hear is a sports game on the speakers.  I guess you could say, well put some money in the jukebox then.  Most people are not confident enough to be that first person to enter in their song selection.  So in reality by not having the jukebox playing you are actually losing commissions on your jukebox sales.  Assuming they are getting commissions.  Either way people will leave when they are bored.

I will keep going back to Flanny's for sure. But it would be nice to see them continue to listen to their visitors.I jumped out of a plane once so going zip lining was not hard at all. Only thing hard was the harness being strapped so tight leaving my balls scrunched up and allowing my Ass to consume my boxers. Talk about major wedgie! 

Went in. Stepped on the scale. (147lbs of lean muscle! ) Put my initials on some form(maybe I should've read it.... ) paid the 15 bucks and I was good to go. 

First time going zip lining so that was exciting. 30 secs of excitement, not so exciting. (That's what she said... oh wait what!?? ) Ride was over as soon as it started.  I ended up riding backwards so I could not see where I was headed.  Next thing you know, I'm stopped with some force. End of the ride buddy. 

Wasn't the greatest but I guess it's not the worse zip line ride in the world. Imagine having to do this everyday.....

This is one of those Vegas experiences you need to try at least ONCE. (along with all those other experiences that they say should stay in Vegas!)Maybe it was an off day we visited. The food, particularly the noodles was not authentic to me, some dishes from another take-out place. Cold appetizer dishes are excellent. Service is great.So I have a friend who loves this place so we decided go.
SERVICE:We were seated right away but waited awhile before we go any service. The hostess came back and took our drink order. Eventually the server came out, had no idea about our drinks and we ended up waiting awhile for them. We were still waiting for one more person so I guess the server figured she wouldn't check back until the last person was there. So finally our drinks come out and we rush to tell her about our appetizer. But even when the last person joined us, the service still moved slowly. 
FOOD AND DRINKS- we had margaritas. The white peach and guava margaritas were awesome! We also had the blood orange which I found to be a little too bitter for me. We started with the buffalo nachos which were good. I really liked the queso sauce they used. I had the fajita salad: the meat was well seasoned but there was too much dressing which made everything soggy :(
My friends had the daddy's cob salad and their vegetarian mango tacos. Both were really good.I went here with the family for some "amazing" nachos as advertised. The ambiance is that of a bar, with additional tables for families. TVs everywhere and the place is LOUD. We ordered the cheeseburger nachos and the BBQ pulled pork nachos. Our waitress was nice and attentive, and we did not have to wait for drinks or refills.

When the food came out I was a little surprised. A large pile of nachos covered in about everything you can think of. The cheeseburger nachos were really quite good, even my picky 7 year old liked them. The plating is something to be desired, on an oval skillet-type platter that is too small for the amount of food, and many a nacho ended up in the laps of my kids. The BBQ pulled pork nachos were not that great, but only because it was WAY too much. You need a gallon of water to swallow five bites, and the BBQ sauce and cheese are overwhelming to the palate.

Overall, not bad, but not spectacular. I would go again if I absolutely had to.Came here one night because "In-N-Out" was PACKED(like always)! The place was empty and the owner was maning the restaurants FOH by himself. I told him I wanted an order "to go" and he gave me some recommendations. One of the suggestions was his slow cooked Brisket, which was the best out of all we ordered, and amazing to any standards. Tender, full of flavor, and definitely left a great, lasting impression. 

When going over what I wanted to order, he tried to stray me away from some of the options, which was a bit odd, but I was starving and didn't care. I should have listened. The chicken he tried steering us away from was DRY and the sauce for it didn't compliment or help it go down one bit. By far, the Brisket was the best choice and would go back solely for that one item. 

Our food was ready in almost no time, and the bill was pretty inexpensive. I caught some quick glimpses of the dining room, and it wasn't anything exciting. Next time I go i'll have to sit in and get the full experience.Found it okay okay. The menu items were more or less what you expect from a Thai place.This was my 2nd time eating here, both times were for take out.  The setup is a little strange when you walk in but it's to be expected I supposed when they converted an old Wendy's drive through (pretty sure it was Wendy's). Anyways, this trip I ordered the tom yum soup and papaya salad.  The soup was eh, mediocre at best.  Tom yum should be a clear hot and sour soup, should be spicy but this was very thick with chili, hard to describe but I only ate half of the small or bowl size serving because it wasn't very good.  The green papaya salad is definitely NOT authentic in flavor but I found it strangely addictive. It almost had a parmesan cheesey flavor to the dressing, I really hope there wasn't any cheese in there but it's the best way I can describe it. I would only order this again if I wasn't wanting a normal salad, but it tasted nothing like an authentic green papaya salad should.Very comfortable way to get out of the AZ heat.  Not so happy that for some reason we had an upcharge of $2 to see "Bridesmaids".  I'm still not clear why there was an upcharge...but since I guess I have no choice...fine, whatever.  

Seats are really comfortable, and not too close to each other.  I sat in it thinking it should really recline and that would make it even better.  Popcorn was good, but I love all movie popcorn.  Paid 600% markup on bottled water, as usual at a movie theater.  I really need to start smuggling drinks in with me.I like this place.  I really do.  But I like hot dogs and popcorn when I go to the movies, too.  The seats are comfortable, the place is clean and there's lots of theatres.  The problem:  every time I go to get a hot dog it's more like a Slim Jim.  They're hard and overcooked and it forces me to have them make me a fresh one which takes lots of time.  And the popcorn is almost always stale.  If they could get those two things right, this place would get five stars from me.Great atmosphere. Great service. Good prices. Massages were very routine but not bad. Staff was very gracious, so that left a good feeling for me. I was hoping for a better massage on my feet, so for a foot spa, it left something to be desired. Giving 3 stars for the atmosphere and the friendliness of the staff.The spa is definitely worth it, $22/hr! Its not the cleanest but the massage was good; you get what you pay for. Do not have high expectations here**

The spa is a large room with semi private open rooms in it, where you can hear everything from the room next door. The bathrooms are not the cleanest so if you dont have to go, just wait. 
They greet you with a large bucket of warm water with a plastic bag wrapped around it to soak your feet in. When the man massaged my feet he applied just the right pressure, very relaxing. 

Overall, I would go again! It's worth the price; I will just use the bathroom before going inside.There are times when people have referred to another person's review and said, "So-and-So said it all, I really have nothing to add." 

Well, in this case, it is literally literal. 

Daren C said pretty much what I would have said, as far as an objective description of the place and what went down.

However, I have to part from my wise brother in my rating. Although I believe we felt the same about the fact that the meat had a really good, smokey flavor, it was too greasy for me to enjoy that flavor. The bottom of the bun sponged up so much that it was soaked, and a light squeeze produced a stream and puddle. Eww. 

The meat and sauce had good flavor, so there's potential, but the grease just overpowered it so much, and I fear the repercussions that may be to come.Ive been told this place is like Smashburger.  I gotta tell ya.  I like Smashburger better.   Not to say this place isn't good.  it was delicious, really it was.  But for me it was just another burger with fries and nothing that amazing.

Would I go again? Sure..  but only if friends wanted to go and I didn't feel like whining about going somewhere else. 

Do get their cheese curds.  Those were yummy.french toast was good and the scramble was good but overall it was good but nothing to tweet about, wait staff was friendly but get here early it gets packedFriendly advice to the ladies - don't come here if you plan on going to the clubs after .. you probably won't fit into your dress.

On the brighter side, the burgers and appetizers are derrish. The fried pickles and kimchee quesadilla (large portioned enough to be an entree) is a must try. Oh, and lets not forget the bull-gogi burger (add cheddar cheese).

 However, the famous lobster mac&cheese is up for debate. It was served cold, watery, and rarely any lobster pieces. Bummer..

Lastly, the service lacks and you wait so long for your food, you start seeing stars.Trendy, overrated.

I had the Gold Standard with sweet potato fries. I had a Sam Adams Octoberfest and Franziskaner Hefe Weisse.

Burger was definitely good, but not a whole lot better than a burger you get from any ol' pub. It really wasn't that special.  Sweet potato fries also good, but again nothing special. 

Tourists and people who don't know any better will rate this place highly.

Very good, but far from "must try."  If you want an overpriced burger, it's not bad.See my post on Bachi Burger. In a nutshell, this place is overhyped in my opinion. Food is good but not worth the price. Adult shakes were probably the best thing here.Note: this review pertains to their reverse happy hour.

The Skinny: Truly the food here is comme ci, comme ca (as the French say "so-so") (3), service: friendly and pretty efficient (3), value: holy smokes, the serving sizes here are ridiculously large. For the quality and quantity, it's a good value even though there are issues with execution(3.5).

We came here because of their excellent deal on their reverse happy hour (1/2 price on their bar menu which starts at 10 pm). We ordered the Comme ca burger, the Provence Country Salad, the Charcuterie plate and the Roasted Bone Marrow with oxtail jam.

I want to say something to start - the serving sizes are massive, certainly worth every penny on that criteria alone. Our order could have easily fed 4 more people. The salad came in a large bowl the size of a small washbasin. My hubby couldn't even get his mouth around the burger (trust me, it's a rare thing). 

Normally that would be a great thing if the food was good. Unfortunately, due to execution issues, it just doesn't make the cut.

The much lauded Comme Ca burger was a huge disappointment. Sporting a thicker good quality patty, the beef was terribly underseasoned (ie, lacking enough salt for one). The addition of a rather goopy, oddly sour slaw on top of the already bland meat added insult on top of injury. The fries were lackluster texturally (not crispy!) although the garlic aioli was okay.

The bone marrow with fleur de sel was great - very rich and decadent. However the accompanying oxtail jam was overly salty.  Definitely stuck between a rock and a hard place with the bread - you need bread to mellow out the richness of the bone marrow, but the bread you're served is a dentist's wet dream (ie, too hard by far).

The charcuterie plate was faired better  - a large serving of interesting rich house pates and meats.However, it was again served with that terrible bread which definitely a big minus in my book.

Finally, the salad. The salad was large and filling. There was perhaps a little too much acidity with the dressing and could have used a tinge more sweetness to mellow it out.

I am definitely conflicted about the meal at Comme Ca. On the one hand, it's a fantastic deal given the portion sizes and the quality of the ingredients. But on the other, execution issues mar the value of the coming here. Overall, it evens out to a three starred review.The view is great. The food is pretty good.. We had a groupon and got the french onion soup and steak frites. The soup was far too sweet, I didn't like it at all. The fries were amazing!! And their garlic dip they served with it was awesome too. The steak however tasted like a cheap cut to me, and it was slightly over cooked because I ordered it medium rare. The waitress noticed and asked if I wanted them to throw on a new one without me even asking - but I didn't feel like waiting or doing that to the kitchen so I just dealt with it. So the service is good!! The cocktails were pretty good but very pricey. Ouch!! Strip pricing of course. The bread and butter was awesome but I don't think I would go back. With our groupon we still spent $130 - ouch!! It probably would have cost the same price without it.Stumbled upon Merchant and thought it looked stylish & trendy. Good atmosphere with reasonably priced, strong drinks. Very busy on a Friday night.

At 10pm, DJ took over playing great 80's & 90's music. Lots of college kids getting their groove on.  Enjoyed people watching!

Really fun time, but skip the shrimp tacos. :)Everytime I passed by this place there was always a big line of people out front (appx 30 minute wait), so I figured I'd give it a shot. It was tasty and cheap, but keep in mind you get what you pay for... It was good though the portions were small. It was decorated cute and the waitress was such a sweet heart. I may return if the lines ever start to die down, I don't wait for food.A 3 1/2 stars to be more precise.

Be prepared...be very prepared...for a friggin' long line!  Especially on weekends!  Line seems to always be out the door and the tables crammed with diners.  It's like being in like for Black Friday!  Thank goodness it's in the middle of the South Point casino close to the sports book instead in the freezing desert!  It does get kind of ridiculous.
We were in line for a good 45 minutes before being seated.

The inside is cool, very reminiscent of old 70's diners with the nostalgia feel.  Like the red, white and chrome all around...almost like a classic tricked out lil' GTO!  But enough about the ambiance, let's get to the food!

Honestly, I've had a better burger.  I was kinda expecting to be WOW!  But it was more of a, uh...wow.  Got my balloon a little deflated there.  The shakes are fatty good, and the burgers are A-OK but overall I was just...OK.  This is what I wasted all my time and gas for?  An OK burger.  Not disappointed, but not 'I gotta eat here every week' either.  For what it was it was pretty good.  Decent food for decent prices.  With the line outside always there you would figure this place gave out free kisses from pre-Seal Heidi Klum (yes, for arguments sake she was way hotter back then).

The menu was good and the prices were very reasonable, especially the 4 meals under $4 each that caught my eye.  This is what I stuck with since it was our first time there.  Your 4 choices were:  a bacon cheeseburger, a double cheeseburger, a triple burger (no cheese), and chicken fingers.  Each meal was served with thin-cut fries.  The fries were awesome (ask for em' cooked well) with lots of ketchup.  My double cheeseburger?  Meh, it was ok.  I mean, seriously...WHERE'S THE BEEF?  My lack of 'steak' made my head 'shake'.  No quarter pounder here?  I loved the charred edges but damn, no juicy beef in the middle?  So of course, my burger ended up a little on the dry side.  There was no re-creation of a Carl's Jr. sloppy burger commercial with Kate Upton in little clothing.  It left me a bit disappointed.

The shakes are great though (but cost almost as much as a burger).  The cookies and cream one was a fav of mine.  But not for my hips, my glorious hips!  They are definitely on the full flavor side...the shakes, not my hips.

The service was good but very rushed, you get the feeling like they want you to order, enjoy your meal quickly, then pay and leave for the next folks in the gargantuan line.  I would come here again, but only if I was already on that side of town and it was late night.This place isn't bad! My friend works here so I decided to come in and visit. The staff is friendly and helpful. Burgers are good, but I feel like they're a little too expensive. I'd probably go back - but with my parents so I wouldn't have to pay for anything (haha). The tater tots are good, but saaaaalty which was kinda lame. I wanna try some of the other burgers since the last time I went I just got a standard burger. I had a bite of the salmon burger though and it was pretty good. 
However I will say this: nothing compares to a burger from the Counter. If I had to choose between this place and the Counter, I would still choose the Counter. 
I do like that they have free wifi though!I think that this buffet has a good idea/style, but the food doesn't live up to the name of the hotel. 

First of all, I think this hotel has a horrible system because of the fact that they have you pay in one area, and wait to get seated in another. Since you're paying first, you are tipping for service that you haven't received. That was my biggest thing.

A lot of people have brought up that this buffet provides a lot of choices, Asian, Italian, meat carving, salads, and a mac and cheese bar. They pre portion a lot of the food so theres less waste/people don't over grab the food they are providing. I think it has a really cute idea, but some of the portions are still too big. The quality of the food I would say was just average; I left this place with nothing to rave about.

The desert is a whole different story. Almost everything is edible! Cups of chocolate inside chocolate mousse with fresh fruit on top. They had a variety of bread pudding, gelato, and different types of pudding and baked goods.The best thing I had was the chocolate covered strawberries ( plain chocolate covered strawberries, chocolate covered strawberries with crushed oreos, and chocolate covered strawberries with toffee)

For the price ($35 for dinner) I was expecting a little more variety (sushi and salads), but it was definitely worth trying.3.5 rounded down.

I went to the Bacchanal first,  and the Wicked Spoon is no Bacchanal, but still quite good compared to most hotels around town (Did you know the one near the entrance of the Rio is actually quite good?). 

They have a decent selection of food - I actually really like their cheese selection and salad bar. There's even a make-your-own-macaroni section, and the dessert gelatos are more eccentric than other places. Also, the service was nice - the waitress was actually friendly, which is rare to encounter at any buffet.

I don't really remember the price tag, but it's cheaper than Bacchanal.Drove to Vegas for the weekend with my friends and got here Friday night. After checking in to our hotel and dropping off our bags, we decided to inaugurate our Vegas trip with dinner at Wicked Spoon because we had all heard pretty good reviews online and through friends that had been here before. We didn't get in too late (maybe around 9ish), but it was already pretty empty. I'm used to spending a bit of money for a good buffet at Vegas, but $50 was still a bit of a surprise to me. 

In terms of service, it's a buffet, so the most I expect is that someone come by to take our drinks order, keep the drinks refilled, and then clear the empty plates are necessary. I'm not a big drinker of liquids (especially at a buffet where the focus of all my stomach space is on food to consume), but my friends waited too long to have their water glasses refilled. I was also kind of taken aback that, for $50, we had to have more than 50% of our dishware traded out because there was still crusted on food from other people's meals still on our glasses, plates, and silverware. Um, ew. There was also a lot of plates in the buffet area that still had food coating on them. What is going on with their dishwashers??

In terms of the food: I usually like going to the carving station and getting the carved meats there. The prime rib was, imo, just "meh". The first cut I got was good, but the second cut was a bit dry and overdone. The chef manning the station looked like he was on something. He was away half the time, and at one point there was a crowd of people waiting, he opened the door from the back kitchen, looked at us, and then disappeared for another 5min. When he did come back, I asked for medium-rare, and he cut me whatever was there on hand (hint: it wasn't medium-rare). My friend really liked the marinated Korean short ribs, but I thought they were just average. The marinade was good, but I can get the same quality meat at my local Korean supermarket which also pre-marinades it for me. The bone marrow (first time I tried it) was delicious, if you could find any bones with the marrow cooked well enough. Not all of the bone marrow was cooked to the right consistency, and they didn't seem keen on refilling. The shepherd's pie was amazing and awesome. I loved that dish! The crab legs are pre-halved (always a plus for a Vegas buffet), and were also pretty delicious. I saw the mac n cheese station, but the line was too intense, so I passed on that... maybe next time if there is a next time. I did enjoy the various dessert options - varied, visually pleasing, and the flavors were pretty yum. 

Overall, I don't think that the food was terrible. In fact, when I could actually eat, the food was pretty decent. I'm just turned off that for $50 I had to deal with some really unappetizing dirty dishware and a head carver who was MIA more than half the time. Seriously, a lady in front of me thought maybe it was "self-serve". If I were to chance coming back here again I would need some heavy incentive to do so. Otherwise, there are some really yummy alternatives for less of the cost.After hearing only excellent things about Wicked Spoon, I knew that if I ate anything at all in Vegas, this had to be it. With this in mind, hours after stepping off the plane, we headed over to Wicked Spoon with high expectations and empty bellies. 

I guess it might have been a combination of things---perhaps the bar was set too high in my mind, maybe I should have reserved it for dinner rather than lunch, or perhaps it was just a bad day. I'm not sure. While the buffet wasn't terrible, I definitely don't think that it lives up to its hype. 

We paid around ~$30/pp for lunch on a Friday. This constitutes as weekday lunch, and prices get jacked up dinner and on the weekends. We also added about ~$8 for unlimited mimosas/champagne/bloody marys. Lines, as with most good buffets in Vegas, are to be expected. We spent about 20 minutes in line for the cashier, and then another 10 minutes waiting to be seated. 

Okayyy, so before we get to the nitty gritty of what I didn't like...  It's not completely negative around here, there are a few things that did stand out to me in a most positive light:
-Though I'm not too impressed by the small/individual portions because I found out the next day that Bacchanal Buffet does the same, BUT... I did love the little Chinese takeout boxes for the Asian food. SO. ADORABLE.
-Bone marrow was something that I had been told about beforehand, so I was looking forward to it. Though the sizes are a little bit smaller than what I expected (that day, anyways), the thought alone to include bone marrow in the buffet line is spectacular. Props for whoever thought of it!
-Eggs freakin' benedict---So good, and I could eat these all day! That and the cocktail shrimp, ohh yeeaaah, drop them off to my table by the bucket, please! 
-If bottomless drinks are ever even a question, my answer will ALWAYS, be yes! I was able to try all three that they offer, and my favorite by far has to be the mimosa. I have to say, it was pretty strong. They were pretty busy at the time, so our amazing waiter brought our drinks by the doubles---definitely brunching it, Vegas style! 

Now, I knew that the spread wouldn't be as big during lunch compared to dinner. But even with this in mind, I was kind of disappointed with the selections, aside from the two items I mentioned above. If I can't have seafood then the backup to my standby becomes the meats. The roast pork I had was mostly roasted fat. The pork loin I tried was beyond overcooked, and the running joke of lunch was that beef from the carving station was so hard it was almost like eating the ass part of the cow! I tried bits and pieces of other items on the buffet line, and while nothing was particularly bad, nothing blew my mind either---just like my star rating, it was just OK. Most stuff was standard buffet fare. Heavy on the starch items. No macarons that day too, boo! 

If you come here, do it for the mimosas and the eggs benedict. Do all you can to avoid the ass part of the beef!Decent GC, just like the others I suppose.  Went into the Platinum room and looked at a $24K Telecaster...don't see that every day.  Friendly staff offered to plug in guitars for me multiple times.Marquee is the new nightlife hot spot in Vegas right now. Word of Kanye, Jay-Z and some other celebs have already ventured through its doors. Suit up, throw some rubbers in your pockets, and prepare for a night of chaos. You may even get lucky by the end of the night.

Where does it begin? The lines to enter that is. Tables, guestlists, VIP, ticket holders, general admission. There are lines everywhere. If you're trying your luck in the regular line, look for the longest. It wraps longer than Dirk Diggler's goods and it is slower than your grandma's driving. Pre partying in line? You better make it quick. The men in black suits will jump on it if they see you boozing in line. Ultimatum given: kill your drink in front of him on the spot or toss it out. BTW, there's not too many trash cans around. Chances are, you're going to litter and the poor girl behind you is going to kick it.

It gets stuffy as hell in the lines. There's absolutely zero ventilation while you're waiting. No fresh air, constant cigarette smoke, booze in your system, and no water is an inevitable disaster waiting to happen. Possibly even a lawsuit. People getting dizzy and light headed, yack is already found on the ground, people slipping in that yack, and NO, you may not leave the lines even if you're about to piss in your pants. Too bad the suits says, leave and try to re-enter where your friends are and you will be asked to go to the end of the line.

When you finally get in, you are ushered into a bunch of elevators like cattle. The door opens and the elevator man yells out, "WELCOME TO MARQUEE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN." At this point you don't know it yet, but you've been put into a scientific experiment that you didn't know you signed up for. Ever wonder what rats thought about when they were put into mazes? You will soon find out. No table service you say, good luck hanging onto all your friends. You might as well say good bye because the only time you'll see them again is when you randomly run into them an hour after you lose them. Ladies this is especially true for you because you girls don't carry your cell phones with you & dudes are constantly trying to break up your pack so their chances increases (baiting club chicks 101).

The place is incredibly packed. Shoulder to shoulder, toe to toe. Don't wear your Louboutins because some drunk tard is going to spill their drink and/or step all over them. Besides, I would recommend comfortable foot wear for men and women. This place houses a billion steps. There are steps EVERYWHERE and you can't access the elevators. By the end of the night, you'll be crying for a $15 Chinese foot massage in Alhambra.

Everyone is dressed to impress. It's like prom but what do you expect from a Vegas club such as this? No one cares about your douchey $300 Ed Hardy sneakers. Throw on some nice leather, even albino aligator skinned kicks, then maybe you won't look like such a fool when the bouncer doesn't deny your entry.

Bars here are a mission. There's 50+ of you for every bartender they have. When you venture for a drink, order an extra drink for yourself. Chances are you won't want to wait another 30 minutes for another drink. Take orders from your friends too, save them the trouble. You might as well take the entire crew up there and whoever gets served first can order for everyone. Don't act appalled when you find out one drink is about $14. You're in Vegas and it's the most happening club right now, not one of your typical hipster Downtown LA dive bars.

Marquee is also a daytime pool hot spot. I think they're going to do very well with that during the summer. It's almost as if they geared their outdoor areas just for that. Cabanas, private jacuzzis, pools, everytthing is top notched, uber grand, and classy.

Music varies depending on the different rooms & which level you're on. The main room started blasting house/electro at one point while the downstairs smaller room had classic hip-hop/rap which is more of my forte, ya dig? Every inch of this place was filled with bodies, there's no escaping it except maybe far outside. There's plenty of eye candy as well as that little thing called a "venereal disease." So play it safe tonight, actually every night.

Bring your credit cards or a wad of dead US presidents (preferably Benjamin Franklin) because it's going to be an expensive night at Marquee. 

Did I fail to mention that it took forever to get out of this rat trap? Good luck all.Dear Marquee bouncers, instead of checking our IDs, how about you check your inflated egos at the door? There's nothing better I'd like to say to you that hasn't already been put perfectly by Ralphie from WTTD: "You think you're hot sh-, but you're really just cold diarrhea!"

Seriously, the bouncers/security are the rudest ones I've ever encountered in all of Vegas. They go around acting like they're curing cancer or guarding Obama or something. As a result, they're condescending, smug, pushy, hostile. It's one thing to have to be stern with overly drunk patrons who are making a scene - but these guys are just d-bags by nature. Every time I've tried talking to them, I've been taken aback by the type of responses I get. My polite and friendly questions are always rebuffed; they smirk and talk down to me like I'm stupid. I half-expect them to pat me on the head and laugh in my face sometimes.

They walk into the girls' restrooms on the regular. They say it's to check for drunk girls. I say it's a weird and creepy invasion of privacy.

They kick out people like it's going out of style. My friend was crouching down to make a phone call so she could hear better, and they kicked her out because they insisted she was peeing in public. I swear the guards get some kind of sick satisfaction with each person they kick out. 
 
They don't let you stand in the aisles. That makes sense, sure - but sometimes I feel like you literally aren't allowed to stop moving for more than 3 seconds before a guard pops up in your face with a flashlight, herding you along, "Can't stop here. Move it along, keep it moving." Are we sheep being herded? Are we cars on the freeway? Can I just catch my breath for a second?

The stairs. Oh, the infamous Marquee stairs. Can we just have a moment of silence for the brilliant architect who designed a club (where half the patrons will be wearing short, tight fabric and high heels) with dark, winding stairs?? Insert confused Jackie Chan meme face.

Sure, Marquee is a gorgeous place, really new and hip. I love the pool on the roof, and I like the idea of different music on different floors. Plus, they get really big names to DJ there, so they must be doing something right. It's a decent space, eons bigger than clubs I've been to in LA or SD (but then again, this IS Vegas, so...) The experience is just completely ruined by the people who work there. 

Overall, I'd go to Marquee again if I had to (maybe for the dayclub; I've never been), but I'd pick XS or Surrender over it anyday.Came here for a girls weekend and Marquee was on our to-do list. We bought tickets in advance to see Sander van Doorn and thank god we did! The line to get in was easy, breezy. Just go upstairs if you have tickets, instead of braving the hordes of people waiting downstairs.

Drinks here are Vegas priced, which translates to hella expensive! I think a round of shots for 4 was $55? And, it was so disgusting. I ended up pouring my vodka shot into some juice. Call me a puss, but I'm too old to down nasty shots. Now, if it's a good tasting shot, sure, bring it on!

It was a pain in the ass getting from the outside to the inside of the club. We had to stand in line just to get back in, instead of just going back in through the open patio. 

It's prettier outside, but the music doesn't sound as good. Be careful of the pools, you don't want to fall in. The music was kinda eh till around 1 am when Sander came on. Then, it got ten times better! We ended up dancing inside, since we wanted to be part of the energy, but it was super annoying getting told to move by security every 5 seconds. Geez! 

We ended up dancing over by the back patio. Whateves. I danced so hard that I broke my heels! And, my feet hurt for 2 days after. 

Beware of the 5 million stairs you'll have to endure on your way out. 

I like XS better though. Better music and better venue. Marquee, you're just average.You really have to look to find this place.  I ended up asking a security guard where it was, and even then I had a little trouble finding it.  I thought the pizza was only okay, but I wasn't really ordering their top notch stuff I guess.  I got the vegetarian pizza, which only tasted okay.  The crust was really good though.  At $6 a slice, its not cheap, but nothing is cheap at the Cosmopolitan.I had the BBQ sampler for lunch, which contains BBQ chicken and BBQ beef. The beef had a great taste but was a bit tough. The chicken reminded me of the chicken you get at a Chinese buffet. Not so good. The rice and mac sides were ho hum. If I was back in town and ate here again, I would go for the BBQ beef and maybe try the fish and shrimp.Everyone is pretty 'meh' on the food.   Took way way too long to serve.   And strangely it's low end soy sauce.  Everyone is confused by that.   My friend got a piece of metal in his food.   I wanted to give it a 2 but my friend said I was being harsh.    Oh last thing --- so pricey!!  Ridiculous pricey.    Don't come here.It is a pricey restaurant and the food is alright. The sushi, however, are super fresh. The atmosphere is kind of rowdy, not a place for a romantic dinner. Definitely try their scallop sashimi, super fresh!This place is alright. Its not the best but its not bad. I think what i hate the most is when the staff harasses you about getting a trainer. Its like, damn not everyone can afford one, or sometimes people just wanna do their own thing. Anyway its not too crowded and its pretty spacious. Love the classes and the machines are new and up to date. As long as you know how to avoid the harassment of getting a trainer, this place is pretty good.Not bad, I had the vegetarian cheesesteak and it was quite delicious. I substituted fruit for the fries and the fruit was pretty fresh and quite tasty too.  O, the cheesesteak was only 15 bucks which wasn't bad considering I paid 30 bucks for fish and chips at Gordan Ramsay Pub & Grill and it was total shit.Meh all around except for ambiance. We had a group of 6 so we really ordered a lot of different dishes and I didn't find any particularly great. Most were okay. T

he thin crust pizzas I've def had a lot better elsewhere and would not consider this an exceptional place for it. The ones here were burnt, I.e the fresh basil on one of the pizzas was actually completely black not just slightly smoky. And the combinations of ingredients looked classic with a twist but something was always a bit off, as in you expect it to be really good like classic flavors but with a nice bite of edge but these were never as good as the classic flavors. Actually we ordered their special pizza of the night, which was a spicy mushroom and sundried tomato pizza, sounded amazing but it was way too spicy like I've never had a pizza in my life, no one could have more than a piece and the mushrooms were really tough. 

We also had plenty of appetizers like calamari and their caprese salad with beet both were okay, just good enough. 

So would not highly recommend this restaurant.  I think it's very average and I don't get the good reviews, but if you're just stopping by for convenience why not.Wanted to take cousin for "high tea," served between 12p and 4p, but Narcisse was closed when we arrived around 130'ish.  Checked online and found high tea is only served "by reservation only."  Shoot.  So, we ended up in Tanzy, instead.

Will update soon, I hope!I won't return.  The service was quite embarrassing---the waiter requesting that we pass our plates down, pass down our water glasses, et cetera.  The food was alright, but not fantastic.The food is delicious but service is slow. The pieces of lettuce are large. When I take my food home I have to chop up my lettuce some more because it's too large for my mouth. The portion of meat is a hit or miss. When employees are close to their leaving times and there is a long line, they have no problem complaining about it in front of customers. I suggest calling in before and picking up food. Wish the manager would address the customer service issues.I really wanted to like Citizen Public House because the reviews are so amazing, I thought it was ok.  It always bothers me when I sit down at a table in a nice restaurant and the table cloth is dirty and my plate was not clean...  On the plus side, the service was good.  It was a nice surprise to have the chopped salad, that's a favorite.  I had duck and it was good - it came with sweet potato hash and greens - both good also, could use a little kick - but I like really spicy food!It's not like I could ever afford anything in this mall (it's almost entirely high-end designer shops), but I do find myself walking through here a LOT when in Vegas, because it's the quickest and most air-conditioned route from where I usually stay up to the Bellagio. 

I do sometimes wistfully gaze at Nanette Lapore, Dolce & Gabbana or Prada - but c'mon people. Those clothes cost more than I make in like, 2 or 3 months! So off limits. I mainly go here to escape the heat, play with the toys at FAO, or pay $16.99 for gelato (NEVER AGAIN!), watch the rays swim in the aquarium, or see the cheesy talking statues. 

But! Here's my confession: 
Every time I walk by Versace, I quote Showgirls. 

"LOVE your dress, darlin'"
"Thanks. It's VER-SAAASE". 

:)I seriously come here just for H&M.

Yes, it is a mall but with a Roman twist. Any similar store that targets a market segment are located closely (i.e. luxury: Dior, Louis Vuitton, Prada all located in the middle), there are no fast food restaurants like McDonald's or Wendys but there are some pricey ones located on the street facing area. 

Do expect lots of tourists stopping in the middle of their walk to take pictures.Very friendly & helpful staff, plus good food. The free soup was very tasty, it could have been a meal in itself. The bulgogi was marinated perfectly and tender when grilled. The side dishes were a little lacking and not what I have come to expect from dining in Korean restaurants in Chicago, New York and Seoul. However, it was a good experience and we left full and satisfied.I first came to Grimaldi's on a third date, where I was an innocent victim, not realizing I walked into the crossfire of two boys and their pizza food fight.   One boy tried to hit the other boy with the pizza as it mistakenly came flying over to hit me in the arm.  Covered with sauce, their father came to my "rescue" with his filthy napkin and wiped my saucy arm.......clean???   

Great start to a date hey!  haha  

I loved the pizza so much this became one of my favorite places and favorite stories to tell.   The decor is always nice, the brick walls and wine bottle light fixtures are a great touch.  For the most part, Grimaldi's has been excellent at all of their locations.  For some reason, the Scottsdale Quarter location has been quite disappointing.  I usually order a large pizza with pepperoni, sausage, and extra basil and I love it!  However, it has been burnt the last few times and I don't mean a little burnt.  I mean where you bite into the pizza and it is really dry and crunchy kinda burnt.  Not sure if they have been overcooking the pizza or not putting enough sauce on it, but it has been exceptionally dry.  

My favorite locations are Old Town Scottsdale and DC Ranch.Scale of 1-10 (multiple visits):

CityScape is deservedly notorious for really shitty design with regard to its (lack of) integration with the rest of downtown, but the Arrogant Butcher portion of it is pretty spectacular in how it makes love to the corner for all pedestrians to gape at.

And I really like the interior environment of AB, too.  The service is also really crisp.

Everything I've ordered has been average-to-very good, but the menu doesn't excite me much -- which could very well just be a matter of taste.  Dishes that I have particularly enjoyed, though, are the Italian Grinder sandwich, and the pretzel fondue (which i love love love).

In my experience, the drinks read better than they actually taste, but I am a big fan of the Streetfighter (which isn't on the menu anymore, but I hope they can still make it next time I'm in).

To sum it all up, I definitely enjoy Arrogant Butcher, but usually only when I find myself nearby.This is a really fund concept. Buy a few drinks and watch a movie, and if the movie is in french (a language i don't know) just get some more drinks and it wont matter what language they are speaking. I heard this place had food, but when we went they notified us that their kitchen was no more. Sad day, food would have made this place that much better. Some people brought a meal in and ate outside in the lounge. 

The lounge is very hookah bar esque, and i am surprised they don't have hookah there.. This is a fun little place. I don't know if i'd go back, unless they had a really good documentary i want to see...Came here a few weeks ago with my friend who said it's pretty good.  She had gone a few times and since we recently went to Dom Demarco's, we wanted to compare the two since she said they were the two best in the greater Las Vegas area.

We ended up going with a salad as an appetizer.  She picked the spinach salad that was so-so.  It was a bit dry and didn't really have too much flavor to it.

The pizza was actually pretty good though.  I chose the Bianca Al Prosciutto Cotto.  It features cooked ham, fontina, caramelized onions, oregano, and aged balsamic.  I don't get pizza featuring prosciutto often but this one was pretty good.  The caramelized onions was a nice touch.  

This spot is A-Ok.  If you're in the Summerlin area, I'd recommend it!Too bad they closed this location.After reading all the positive reviews, I decided to give them a try. As far as food quality and taste: excellent and worth every penny. 
My reason for only three stars is that the flow of my visit was clunky. 
(1) When I arrived at the restaurant, the hostess opened the door for me, which I didn't expect and I thought that she was going to say they were closed or that I had to go through another entrance or something...It doesn't help that the doors open outward and she has to PUSH the doors instead of PULLING the doors and remaining inside the establishment.
(2) When I went to the bar to place my takeout order, I felt like an obstacle to the employees since the computer screen where they clock in was where the to-go customers place the orders and in the five minutes I stood there two employees had to apologize for squeezing in to clock in. Why isn't that computer screen placed somewhere only the employees have access to?
(3) While waiting for my order, I couldn't help but scope out the venue (I love the decor, and the outdoor space looks great!), but my eyes fell on the hostess stand. An employee who appears to be the manager was speaking with the hostess (the one who opened the door). Some customers were coming toward the entrance and she went to open the door for them, and of course, since the door opens outward, the hostess ended up outside. The employee at the hostess stand was standing there, and asked, "Dinner for two?" The customers confirmed, then the "manager" gave the hostess major stinkeye to hurry up and seat them while she was still outside holding the door! As fellow employees, he should watch her back. He could of done things very differently: (a) be a gentleman and open the door, (b) say "welcome to Grimaldi's, the hostess will be right with you" or (c) sit the customers himself (he was hanging out behind the stand long enough to see the next section to seat). Instead, he made the hostess look incompetent. 
(4) The same "manager" carried out my order from the kitchen but HAD to go back to the hostess stand and stood and talked for a WHOLE MINUTE with my pizza in his hand. What should have been piping hot and fresh from the oven turned to two minutes sitting in a cardboard box, then placed in my hands. 
These are super simple fixes! All they have to do is:
(1) Install the computer somewhere only the employees have access to. 
(2) Keep the front entrance doors open during business hours and don't make the hostess open doors as part of her duties, it's hella awkward... 
(3) Teach that particular employee about "teamwork"; his dawdling around slowed the bar's service, the hostess's service and wasted the cook's speedy effort.I think 3.5 stars had green chili burger no bun, salad instead of fries - great taste! Pablano peppers had touch oh cold probably cooked in advance than added to burger. Manager spent time everywhere but visiting with the guest.My wife and I stopped in at the Capri Cafe, and we weren't sure what to expect.  We had picked up a copy of the menu beforehand, and were very impressed with the price of the sandwiches.  We got the ham and pimiento sandwich, the heart of palm sandwich, and a tiny chocolate dessert pastry.  Upon receiving our food, we realized that you actually only get a half of a sandwich per order; this was fine -- we weren't that hungry-- but we felt a little deceived.  

As for the quality of the food, the sandwiches were both a little heavier on the mayonnaise than we cared for them to be, but were fairly tasty.  We plan on stopping by to try their empanadas, as those are probably what the restaurant will come to be known for.Waffles infused with bacon bits!!! OMG! They are the best, I will say they are a bit pricey at 8.00 for 1 waffle, but a girls got to have her bacon! They also make their own Margaritas and they are on tap! Whoaaa, they are fantastic!!!

Heading this week for Yelp eats! New update then!Gotta say, I was a bit disappointed.  All my friends seem to rave about this place but I wasn't a huge fan. The food was a bit pricey but  you do get a lot of it.  I shouldn't sacrifice taste because I'm getting a large portion.   I had the fried chicken which came with mashed potatoes and it was around $15.  I think the real clincher was the service.  I realize this can be hit or miss but our service was not good at all.  The gal seemed like she really didn't want to be there and you felt bad asking for the basics such as a glass of water.  We did order drinks with our dinner as well.  

Maybe we will try it out for breakfast sometime or lunch, I hear the mac and cheese is delicious.  I really doubt I will go back for dinner though.Met up with the International Supper Club UYE at Reathrey Sekong for the monthly pick of November, we were a party of 12, and it was suggested to us that since we were a larger party that we should order dishes family style.  I get the reasoning behind it, 1 cook in the kitchen, not everyone would be eating at the same time, I'm just not that big on seafood dishes and eating family style wasn't going to work for me, so I broke the rules and ordered for myself

I have to say our waiter was amazing, he was working the entire place by himself, did an outstanding job! Everyone was also enjoying the dishes they were trying too. The restaurant is nicely decorated and cozy, I have to say I enjoyed out time where conversing with everyone.

I don't remember the name of the item I ordered, but it was a beef sandwich on a french roll with like a carrot slaw pickles and cilantro, the sandwich itself was on the sweet side, which was shocking, I was thinking more savory since it was beef, but I did quite enjoy it!

Another fun International Supper Club UYE meet up!Since they opened in Vegas, I've been wanting to see what all the hype was about, I've been hearing about it across the country; how its the best burger.
Since it was my first experience I like to go with a plain cheeseburger, if it can stand alone without a bunch of toppings, that will bump you up on my "best" list.
What I initially didn't like was the greasy smell in the restaurant, when we left I smelled like I just got done a shift there. YUCK!
Well the burger was good, lots of hot gooey cheese, the bun was soft and fresh. Tasted a little bland, so I doubt they season their meat, so it tasted like a burger you may get at a family barbecue or an amusement park. I'd eat it again, but I would choose Smashburger over 5 Guys any day. We got the plain fries, which were pretty gross, they were brown and greasy not crisp at all, we ate maybe 10 fries and threw the rest away.
I liked that they had a bucket of peanut to snack on while waiting for your burger. Staff was nice and helpful, andswered all my "firsttimer" questions.Here are the issues I have with cox.  
My internet connection is "lost" at least twice each week:  Our home has 3 laptops with wireless internet connections.  About twice each week, the internet connection is lost, which requires unplugging the modem and router, waiting a minute, and plugging them back in.  I had to do this yesterday and today, so hopefully I won't have to do this for another 6 days. 

Unbelievably slow email:  I no longer use cox email because it is so incredibly slow:  it takes so long to load, that by the time the inbox appears, I've forgotten what I'm looking for.  Same problem with the search:  I search for something and by the time emails appear, I can't remember what I wanted to review.  I switched to gmail, but I can't stand this either because I can't sort, but it least it's fast.  I gave up using cox when I couldn't access an email containing a forgotten username for the umpteenth time.

Don't under any circumstances use the virus software that they provide for free.  If you do, you'll regret it.  I installed the software and had so many issues with my pc not running correctly.  As soon as this was uninstalled, all was well again.  Try superantispyware - not only is this FREE, but it's one of the best programs that will ferret out all types of garbage that gets installed on your pc.  I've never had a real issue because i'm so careful, but this finds hundreds of items each week on my pc that it doesn't like.

The reason I'm writing this review is because the option to color code movies on the tv listings on their website hasn't been working correctly for months:
1.  I have to type in my zip code every time I access this site, which can be several times a day.  
2. I basically only watch movies - which I want to see in pink in the listings.  Even though the box is checked, the listings aren't pink.  When I uncheck the box, then they're pink.   Is it possible that I'm the only person in Arizona that uses this feature on their website?  It's  a simple fix:  a cookie should remember my zip code, and the web page needs to recognize that a checkbox with a checkmark is "on" - show the color.Stumbled upon this place in search for a late brunch (a drunken night provided false intel that there was a Hash House in the Cosmopolitan, when in reality its in Imperial Palace) and realized this was a ManVFood Location.

First off, the ambiance is nice, but what I got a kick out of the most was there were workers outside flashing the menu, trying to get people to enter... lol... taking a cue from those non-english speaking "stripper" promoters eh?

Their menu is, for lack of a better way to put it... too expansive for its own good!  Haha, there were just so many choices, including desert, which they are famous for.

I ordered the Bacon Club Sandwhich, my friend the open faced tuna melt, another got a french dip, and another a burger.  We also split deep-fried macaroni.

The club was pretty good...nothing spectacular, as was the tuna melt.  The French Dip was pretty tender, and the burger pretty tasty... but nothng to go crazy over.  The Fried Macaroni appetizer was pretty good. Hot, fresh, crispy on the outside, gooey on the inside.  However, $9 for 3 golf-ball sized clumps? Wow.  The fries (shoe string style) were cooked well, very crispy and tasty.

Their deserts are really good though.  My friend got the Nutella Cream Crepe... and it was so awesomely sweet, I went staight into 3rd stage Diabetes.  I wouldn't call it overly sweet, since it is called the Sugar factory afterall.

Waiters are pretty attentive, and service pretty quick.  The attached candy store next door has a lot of choices, so b prepared!  Gelato, cookes, cupcakes, and even discontinued, rare types of candy r found here (Bazooka Joe!)Fiance and I finally got to try Kyara last Friday.  There have been so many great reviews, we just never really in that side of town for date night.  

Anywho, we were there and I was reading through my trusted yelpers' reviews.  We ordered grilled squid, butter squid, the chicken skin skewer, pork belly skewer, chicken thigh skewer, gizzard skewer, eggplant with meat miso, green tea, orion beer and a pour of the yamazaki 18 yr.

Grilled squid was pretty good.  I had to ask for a side of sriracha to eat with it.  Then, everything else was pretty mediocre.  The end of our meal, we asked ourselves, "Did we come on a bad  night?" Maybe...but we agreed that this place is A-OK.I got two types of spring rolls here: tofu and shrimp. Delicious! However the peanut sauce was disappointing so I round it to 3.5 stars.

I do want to come back and try some different things on the menu, then I'll reconsider my rating.I have two reviews in one, but I will start with tonight's. All I have to say is, it seems, from other reviews, that this place needs a new delivery guy.

I call to ask to get a pizza delivered - I chose mellow mushroom because they have vegan pizza (I am severely lactose intolerant) because last time I had their vegan pizza in-house, I liked it a LOT and had a craving. Due to some issues that don't need to be gotten into, I cannot go there myself and get it, so I asked for delivery. 

When I told the girl where I lived (on Guadalupe), she said she thought they stopped delivery at Baseline but would go ask. The girl (who was very nice) comes back on the phone and says the delivery guy is "in a bad mood tonight" and said no and when she explained that I am (apparently) only 2 miles out of their zone, he said "I don't answer to you." I asked to speak to the manager and she said "he was standing right there when I asked." 


REALLY? What the heck kind of place is this? What kind of boss stands around and lets employees talk to each other like that (from what I hear, the delivery jerk is related to the boss, so maybe that's it?)

My second review, from 2 times of actually being at this restaurant, is the same. The food, except for the vegan pizza (which is SO GOOD, but kind of on the expensive side...) isn't very good. I ordered the cinnamon honey pretzels and they were so dry they weren't edible. The garlic/cheese bread is also incredibly dry. 

If they would have been willing to work with me on the delivery, I *might* have given them 3 stars, but for the bad attitude this place seems to constantly have, they only get 2. Which is really a bummer, because their vegan pizza is so good.

EDIT!!: Alright, so a few hours after I wrote this review, the general manager, Jason, called me about my review to apologize and talk with me about what happened. He apologized multiple times for the awkward situation that went down, and while he was not present when it happened, he obviously took my review seriously. He then offered to deliver a free pizza to me himself, and that if I didn't want it this evening, he would bring it any other time. I took him up on his offer and he brought me a pizza. 

Being in a manager position myself, I understand sometimes what managers have to go through, and his choice to call me and try to make it right is commendable and I really appreciated it. Sometimes businesses or employees mess up, but what matters is what they do to FIX it. Jason went the extra mile. 

Thanks to this, I changed my review to 3 stars. Also, this vegan pizza is amazing as always.This place has a nice selection of Shoes. The customer service here or lack thereof was what put them at 3 stars. I was in the store for about 20 minutes and not once, out of the 20 employees working the store was I acknowledged even once.

I did end up buying 2 clearance shoes that were really comfortable.You know, after reading all the reviews I was really excited to try this sushi joint. It was packed when I got there which is always a good sign you know they are moving a lot of product and everything was FRESH FRESH FRESH. So why three stars? To begin, the sushi its self was cut and prepared right, but I felt constantly harassed to order my next item and could never relax and savor the experience.
The rice was the right texture, and I felt the portion was good. Hot dishes take quite a bit of time to come out so be sure to order them in advance. The conch special was incredible, but I did't care for their saba or hamachi, I've had much better at other establishments. 
In my experience they are a good sushi restaurant, but I'm not sure about all the hype? I'll have to try it again.I love the design, layout, lighting, etc. The ambiance is truly stellar. It's always packed with people every time I go, which makes this feel like a real city eatery and social drinking depot. The drinks - well prepared. No. 63 was lip smackin' good. The food - pleasantly passable. It somewhat flirts with the palate and does just the trick to soak up a sip or two of bourbon. I wish I had no more to say...

[She bites her knuckles and hesitates] Boy does it pain me to knock off stars for service. Mistake me not, this feedback isn't impulsive retribution after one sour puss waiter. Time after time, I leave thinking "why couldn't they just be nicer?" I don't need to be spoon fed, have my napkin tucked under my chin or showered with compliments I wasn't fishing for. I also don't mind if you are cooler, more hipster or read more Kerouac than me.

I just don't want to feel like I'm inconveniencing someone for a meal that comes out of my wallet in the end. Inattentive and unresponsive. Regardless of the other positive traits Windsor has going for it, there is still something very unsatisfying when you leave feeling like you were just another annoyance in a sea of demanding diners.I know everybody loves this place and it does have a nice charm. I really appreciated that in December they were not playing Christmas music during my meal!
I have eaten here a few times and while I enjoy my meal for me it's nothing spectacular. Even the loaded chips everyone recommended were only so so to me. The menu does have a variety of unique choices which is worth giving a try and I'm sure I will be back with friends again but this is not someplace that I would pick on my own.My husband and I had a college reunion with friends --- and we all stayed at the Trump Hotel in Las Vegas. After everyone arrived, we all met up at the downstairs lobby bar for some drinks and chillaxin'.

What was great was the relaxing vibe, LIVE MUSIC playing, and the prompt service. 
Happy Hour was 5-8 pm, with cocktails at only $5 each. I ordered a light drink, called the Framboise Fizz (raspberry flavor w/ some gin?).

My husband had a Corona light at $7. Reasonable prices, and good way to hang out with friends before we all head out to dinner! Seats were comfortable, and liked how they had live music up until a certain hour!Why I came here? 

Because I was staying at the Vdara. I was too lazy to go out and get breakfast somewhere else. I really didn't wanna pay the room service price. 

So if you've got the same reasons to go, then go. 

Food was pretty good, but definitely not the price I paid for it. Service is friendly and as I was waiting for my to-go order, I had people constantly asking me if I needed anything or if I've been helped. 

They have cheese and wine and other grocery store items as well if you'd like. I'm sure they're overpriced too, but hey...people gotta make money somehow right? They just like to make a lot.Insert Credit Card, max it out.  

Mixed feelings about this spot.  On one hand, rad idea, concept, large space, and something different to do than surrounding bars are offering.  Cool deep benches/booths along one side.  A bajillion games and shiny blinking things to look at all over the place.  On the other hand, I just can't stand getting hosed on drink cost.  

I ordered a simple bubbly cocktail off of their cocktail menu (no prices listed) but I was prepared to pay about $12-13 for it.  Right?  Vegas pricing, it was a specialty cocktail, whatevs.  After some delay, they said they were opening the bubbly... hang tight... ok... watch some football on the screens above the bar for several minutes before figuring out it was a video game, not television...  thirsty... 

Drink in hand, good time, not bad, but teensy tiny (maybe 3 oz?), then the bill came.  They charged me $5 extra for the bubbly, saying they were out of the cheaper one used in the cocktail so they'd substituted another!  What the effing eff?  I was ready to drop a pretty penny in this joint on lotsa drinks but that rubbed me the wrong way.  

So... it was fun, but it could have been much more fun.  Ron T and I still ran some shenanz in that place anyway, and I sneaked in some p-ball while no one was looking.  My $18 sip of a cocktail just turned me off too much to stay there for more drinks, even if I'd switched to cheaper ones.  Cha-ching.  

If you're into video games, don't miss it, and it's good for a large group.  But if you're just roaming and want to make sure you have some coins left at the end of the night, don't do what I did and blindly order without knowing the cost.Yummy hummus, tasty salad, flavorful chicken shawarma.  And the bread is more like naan, rather than pita from the bag that was sliced into pretty little triangles. 

Went for dinner carryout. Wish I would have went for lunch I would have saved a few bucks. I think my chicken shawarma came out to 14 bucks (ouch!).  My sister ordered the a vegetarian dish, falafel, hummus and baba ghanoush - from her empty plate, I imagine she liked it. I'll go for the lunch next time, hoping it will be cheaper yet filling for my tummy.The atmosphere was nice. Got in free with my girlfriend, since a club promoter was passing out wristbands. I have to say, the music was so-so. Everyone was pretty chill, not really dancing except for a few cougars. I have to say, there is a lot of cougars in this joint lol. I stayed for an hour or so, and I had to call it a night. Too be honest, I'm not really a "club" type person.Been coming here on and off since it opened and found that it is a sports bar. It is a smaller version of what is in the valley and be kinda cramped. The capacity is def not like the one on Indian School. They have a good section of drinks and beer, it has consistent food and it has speedy service. Alot of regulars for sure and good mix of people can be found on game day, from families with small kids, to 20 somethings. The place can get packed, but have never had to wait. Will continue to come back.A decent Mexican food option if you're in the area. I sat at the bar and had the carne asada tacos with rice and black beans. I thought the seasonings and heat level were good.  Friendly service.I had the pleasure of stopping at this restaurant by chance after doing some bumping around in FH.  This is a pretty cool establishment.  When you walk in, there is a feel of a country western establishment.  At about 4pm on a Saturday, the place wasn't packed, but it certainly wasn't empty.  There were quite a few people in there.  

My friend and I were quickly seated in the bar area at one of the high tops.  I quickly noticed the selection of beer on tap and ordered a yummmmy Kilt Lifter from 4 Peaks. 

For dinner, my friend ordered the Buzzard Wings.  I ordered the Patty Melt.  When our food came out, I immediately saw that the Patty Melt was on Rye bread.  I dislike Rye Bread.  I realized I didn't look at the description of the sandwhich.  Before I could even get out that I didn't see it on the menu, the server said, we can do it over with whatever bread you want.  Of course,  I thanked her for quickly getting me out Patty Melt on sourdough bread instead.  Both of these items on the menu were yummy to me.  The wings cooked in the broaster have a delicious unique taste to them.  I highl recommend these wings to anyone.  My Patty melt was also very delicious and savory.

I enjoyed myself at this restaurant even though it is in F.H.  I would see myself going back to this place.  I'm a fan!This review is past due. We tried Ben's BBQ at Streats. We sampled the ribs and pulled pork. The meats had a nice smoke. It was a shame the ribs were very fatty, there wasn't much meat. The pork was the better choice, though I wish the bread was better. The spicy sauce lacked the kick we hoped for, but it wasn't total weak sauce.

This is one of those instances I wish there were half-stars. It wasn't quite an A-OK experience, there was room for improvement.Have to say that their service has improved a lot. Order has been correct and they seem to take pride that they are the spot on Baja Arcadia for doughnuts. Haven't been hard selling the up sale and polite and courteous over the past 4 months. Kudos, keep up the good work.Pizza was good, but the price was to much for a pizza. I do like that there's lactose free, gluten free options but $20 dollars for a pizza is too much.The Mint was an awesome place and great party atmosphere. Theres a bunch of older people than younger. The bartenders were friendly and attentive! I would go back.I would say the best way to describe The Habit is a place that offers tasty burgers at a good price. The burgers are't top of the line, but definitely better than traditional fast food. If your looking for a decent burger without having to shell out $$, this is your place. On the plus side, they also offer sweet potato fries and carry chicken, tuna and veggie burgers - but there aren't really any combo deals...everything is pretty much a la carte. The place is clean and the service is good with a short wait for your food because they make everything fresh = fries are always hot and crisp...yum!We live close by and its the only food spot close traveling North on Cave Creek that kids like. Their kids burgers have literally nothing in them, besides a meat patty and 2 buns... the kids were like " Wheres our lettuce and tomatoes, mama?" The regular burgers are greasy because the bread gets buttered up. If you are really starving you can stop by, otherwise dont waist your calories and appetite on this!Nice enough folks, no street bikes or street gear, so if that is your genre skip this place.  On the other hand, if you are into motocross and 4 wheelers, you will find plenty to choose from.Chips and salsa were great! The margaritas were decent and the food was yummy! This is probably the closest to authentic that we've gotten since we got down to Arizona.Well, it is the MVD. Plan to spend an hour waiting in line to get a ticket that will tell you how long you have to wait in line. Pretty sure there should be an MVD drinking game- Kid screams, take a drink. Same number called twice in a row, take a drink. Told to come back with additional paperwork, finish your drink (and go home to search your files). Judging from the website where you can see average wait times, this is one of the faster locations in the West Valley.

The ONE bright spot in this (and the reason for the third star) was that the woman who helped us transfer the title on a car was fantastic. She was fast, friendly, helpful, and knew her stuff. I can imagine that working for the MVD is not a pleasant job, but she made the experience as positive as humanly possible. Because I believe excellent customer service should be commended, I asked to talk to her manager and told the manager our service was great. The manager was on the phone, but I do hope that employee got an extra pat on the back for a job well done.i don't know hooow this place got such high reviews... i think it's over hyped.

nevertheless, i wouldn't mind stopping by again when i'm staying at Wynn or Encore.  the tacos are SO much cheaper than what they got in the hotel!! totally worth the short walk from Encore lol

their salsa is fantastic! it makes chipotle's look like a joke.  don't underestimate it though, it's hella spicy! i'm from east coast so i was loving the authenticity of mexican food from southern west coast.  the steak taco is recommended-- i couldn't get myself to try those cow brains and w/e strangeness they were offering.. 

just a quick note about their quesadillas.. they're not your typical american quesadillas.. it looks something like between a sandwich and a salad.. bottomline--  it's really hard to eat! 

but yeah, i wouldn't go out of my way for this place even if you love nothing but tacos.I will not lie, Lisa L. has it right to come here to people watch. The mixture  of risque, Jersey Shore, Ed Hardy type, and frat boys leads to some mighty entertaining sights.

The Boulevard Pool is a lounge and entertainment center by all means and less of a pool. The shallow large foot pool is enough to dip your feet in and recreate a scene from Bay Watch, but not for actual swimming. The other pool and hot tubs are nice for wadding and lightly submerging oneself, but yet again not good for even doggy paddling. 

The bar and pool are staffed with friendly individuals that are quick to meet the guests needs. 

The lounge chairs were comfortable. 

The four pool tables, one ping pong table, and shuffleboard allows for some good fun.I have had the veggie burger and sweet potato fries a few times and they are pretty decent.  I actually like the unique soda flavors it's a bit of a break from the Coke / Pepsi war.  I had a gellato shake and I'm not sure that's the best ice cream to make a shake with. It's way sweet so it tastes like frozen sugar more than anything.

Try:
- Veggie Burger
- Sodas
- Sweet Potato FriesI must be tainted with magic as I only thought the show was average.  Jans seems like a really nice and personable guy, but his magic was a bit sub-par when compared to what you see with David Copperfield or Criss Angel.  I guess all the illusionists have the same premise with people disappearing and reappearing, but Copperfield and Angel just seem a lot more "polished" and entertaining, but I guess you pay for what you get.

What I did like is that at the end, Jans comes out and takes pictures with his audience.  Also, the theater at the Clarion was small, so no matter where you sit, you're going to get a decent seat.  However, I must warn you that he did say he's moving to the Riviera in a few weeks, so I'm not sure how their theater is set-up.

Overall, the show was decent considering we got privileged (I think that's what they called it) tickets, so the price was half with a buy one get two tickets admission which you can find in the Las Vegas show magazines you get for free at hotels.  With the privileged tickets, you get seated before the general admission ticket holders and if you get the tickets with the buy one get two coupon, it's pretty much the same price, so you might as well get this deal for better seats.  Oh, and the buy one get two coupon doesn't work for general admission tickets, so...

Overall, it was good to see a magic show for cheap, but there are probably better ones out there.Two visits in two days, but in different locations. The food court choices all looked bad, but I had remembered hearing about this Taco Shop and since I'm a huge carne asada fan, here we go. The carne in my burrito was tasty, had some crunch too it and from what I can tell no fatty pieces were involved. The $6 small burrito had carmelized onions and guac and a tasty spicy salsa was served on the side. Might be the best carne in this mall, but I went to another location the next day and didn't have the best breakfast burro. That burrito was from the University Drive restaurant and the carne did have some fatty pieces here and the potatoes they used for the breakfast burros were too small and chopped up and the whole thing just didn't come together well. KInd of greasy and just average. Hopefully, the mall court comes through again on my next visit because good carne is tough to find.Ok... Let's be honest, it's a desert. If you're like my fiance, then you think that because it has 3 leaves of spinach and some acai in it, then it's a "healthy meal"... I disagree. It may be naturally occurring sugar but it's got lots of it. Topped with honey and granola. Yum, yes. Healthy, debatable.

Also, the prices are way too high, and the wait was ridiculous. I really thought it was delicious (Go Green Bowl) but I don't think I'll pay or wait for it again. Sorry! Not super impressed.I liked the pizza alot but the people I spoke to were really rude. They seemed annoyed I called and that tends to put a bad taste in my mouth. Maybe I'll come back.We called for delivery and were told that they couldn't deliver because the delivery guys truck was broke down. We really wanted to try this place out so we went ahead and drove over to pick up. We were told the pizza would be ready in about 25 mins. We got there 30 mins after calling. When we tried to pay the CC machine wasnt working and we had to pay cash. Again, not a huge deal- just another inconvenience. We then waited at least another 15 mins for our pizza to be ready. 

With all that said, the pizza was AMAZINGLY good. Wings were mediocre- could have been crispier- but the pizza---- seriously awesome.  We got the meatlovers and a pepperoni/sausage/mushroom...both larges. They were huge and fed our family of 6 with pizza left over. The entire family loved the pizza. 

Please fix your customer service issues. We will give you a pass on them and try again simply because the food was so great. But if the customer service stuff doesnt get better we wont keep coming back.Sorry but this place should not be called a ballroom just because there is one disco ball inside. It is a more casual place kind of hipster. I would change the name to something else because crescent ballroom sounds too glamorous for what it actually is.Everything tasted fresh and well seasoned. Service is friendly too. Definitely worth going back for more!Cravin Cajun is a normal place to eat. Well, what does that mean? It means that while nothing stands out, nothing was bad.

So the layout is well done with both bench and booth seating. The only complaint is the glaring lightbulb that is right at eye level but on request, it can be dimmed.

The food was good but not very spicy, so that really depends on your individual preference as to why you chose to go to a Cajun themed place in the first place. The sweet potato tots were good, as was the calamari appetizer. The dish, a mix of catfish and prawns, was good as well.
 
The service, you guessed it, normal. I noticed a few others citing poor service. 

I was surprised at the small menu selection and a noticeable lack of 'here is the main entree area' from which to choose. 

The price was normal as well but it correlated with the portion size, normal.

So, try it and see if there is a normal item that you may like.Wow! I haven't been to IHOP in years! I think I got bougie due to all the trendy brunch spots I've been exposed to.  I like how bright, shiny and new it is!  Even though I don't eat meat, I love how they now have turkey sausage.  The fruit was really fresh and thank you to our waitress for letting us sample some to check.  She was a fantastic waitress!  I ordered the Spinach & Mushroom Omelette with egg substitute and pancakes.  My friends ordered the Garden Omelette and Eggs and Turkey Sausage.  Everything was fine, but I definitely see how my palette has matured, lol.  I miss the country griddle pancakes IHOP used to have!I've never been to the actual building, but a girl brought half a dozen of these to my BIL when he was visiting. Some of the most BEAUTIFUL cupcakes I've ever seen; but also some of the most disgusting. Too dry and the frosting was way too sugary. If they hadn't been a gift none of us would have touched them.Decent place to stop by for lunch outside of the strip. It was raining cats and dogs yesterday so their Make It 2 Combo of a half sandwich and bowl of soup was the perfect item to order! The broccoli and cheddar soup was creamy with the right ratio of broccoli to cheese. The Brookyln is a standard pastrami with coleslaw sandwich that is a local version of the Langer's #19 in Los Angeles. Portion size is perfect to fight hunger yet not cause and food coma. Success!The restaurant has a nice homey feel to it as soon as you walk in. Not sure if this place really gets busy. There was only one other table and they looked like they were studying. The menu isn't very extensive, but they have daily specials.

It was my first time coming here and I didn't know what a lot of the items were, but the waiter was very helpful. We ended up ordering the karaage chicken, tororin omelet rice, and garlic green beans. My friend said the wait was a bit long, and boy he wasn't kidding. The garlic green beans came out first.. I wish they were a bit more garlicy ]: The omelet rice was decent. I liked that the tomato sauce was homemade. My favorite was the karaage chicken. Lots of flavor in little bite size pieces fried to perfection.

I want to come back to try their drinks and hopefully their other specials.Wanted to really like this place. It's quaint, well appointed, and I like the idea of fusion French/Italian/Japanese. Problem is the food is just so-so, but worse, it's expensive for the small portion size (I guess the French influence). Service is also just so-so, especially not being busy at all. Service was not so friendly but could be a language thing.I'm sorry, I just cannot get into many Asian foods, Japanese included. I rarely, very, very rarely eat Chinese, Thai, Japanese, etc. With the exception of sushi. I don't know, call me a white-bread-eatin' American? The thing is I am excited to try new culinary cuisines, but Asian-inspired dishes just are not my cup of tea for some reason. The spices, the tastes... they just don't hit my palette like Italian and Mexican dishes do.

With that being said I think Cafe de Japon is A-OK. It would probably be bumped to 4 stars if I truly enjoyed Japanese food. On my trip here I had the Pre-Fixe lunch menu. It came with a small salad - very good and fresh. Next was the agedashi tofu appetizer, which I thought was okay. I'm not a huge tofu fan, and even this hearty dish failed to get me super excited about it. For my main course I had the tororin omelet with rice. It was hearty and rich, plus the ketchup gave it a taste as though it had been cooked in a kitchen at a home. 

Lastly I had the siphon coffee, which was FABULOUS. I would come back for the coffee, but probably not anything else. 

Overall I think those who really love Japanese food will love Cafe de Japon, but for me I will probably stick to doing a full-out meal elsewhere.Always clean and the have a blockbuster blue box rental in the back by the bathrooms.I was taken here by a friend who is a Vegas local. Although I never eat this LARGE. I thought the idea was very cute. 

I ordered the bacon stuffed waffle with fried chicken breast. And it was HUGE. lol. See my pic. The waffle was delicious. Can't wait to try it at home. 

But the chicken breast not so much. My chicken breast kind of bled....!!! How? I can't really say. But it was not cooked through. Maybe the slice was to BIG but after seeing a little blood I was done. 

He waiter (I forgot his name) but he was kinda blunt and didn't really care that often times we were trying to signal him. He joked about the water being from some local lake. I didn't find it too funny because it tasted like it was from the toilet!!! 

I would MAYBE try them again just for the sake of changing this review.This place is ok. Although this is my first ramen restaurant I have been to so I cannot compare it to any other spots. 

I like the decor and the theme in general. Didn't care for the food.Food was actually pretty darn good.  The turn off was the whole time we were trying to eat , they were walking around killing flies. Not the most appetizing thing in the world.Only reviewing this with regards to it's Christmas party nights.
Decent terrine but could have done with some biscuits, turkey was cold and sprouts hard so hardly touched the main course, cheese board was fine but the bread and butter pudding was excellent.


 £27 for what I take it is the house rose was extortionate though and the DJ was pretty rubbish on the whole (playing an Abba mega-mix twice doesn't really make for a great night). No idea how much a pint was as expected it to be over-priced so took my own supply.This place is a unique combo...

The place is 3 stories, and there is a rooftop bar that overlooks Scottsdale Olde  town.  That is cool.  The food is bar food, but also has things like Alligator Tail and Crawfish.  That is pretty cool. Not necessarily my thing but still different.  That is the Good. Also Chad K. is bartending there and that is great as he is completely quality and usually any place he is at becomes a party in itself.  

The Bad is that the place is new, and doesn't quite have its customer service down pat yet.  Our waitress seemed like she was a Gneub.  It wasn't that busy and she couldn't get stuff right.  It very well could have been a bad day for her though. She was still nice. 

I think it could be a cool place of happy hour and a fun place to rock football on Sundays.We became acquainted with Zingers because it's a hop away from the Polo Towers, where we stayed over President's Day weekend. They serve breakfast, as well as giant plastic souvenier guitars and lava lamps for all your carry-along booze needs. $12 for the first one, $6 for refills no matter how many times you stop by.

They do karaoke at night, which wasn't exactly hopping when we were there. But to be fair, it was a frio night when we went with no space-heaters on. The die-hards were out there though, belting out 80s classics. I give them an A for effort, F for sobriety.

Good bartenders. I'm already missing my plastic guitar full of Green Sneaker.Living in Tucson, this is the gas station I always stop at before returning home when I'm in the Phoenix area.  Usually, it's just to grab a snack, something to drink, and a little gas.  I like it's location as one of the last places to stop before leaving the Phoenix area if you are traveling Eastbound on I-10.   It is very close to the on and off ramp.  Bathrooms aren't that large or spectacular.Had wings for lunch today. The garlic parmesan is definitely the favorite out of the three flavors we tried. It was really just average on the food and service. The waitress was kind enough but they were slow in seating and serving. The prices are pretty good.. not as expensive as payton's place but I don't see them making it unless they create a little more excitement.Pleasant place.  None of the table's dishes shouted Thai; seemed more fusion.  I give special chops to the staff and the hostess in particular.  They were quite pleasant to all the diners while dealing with a lot of drunk tourists in a very small area.

If your wanting Thai food you might try another place but if you're happy with Asian then LT is your ticket.I live nearby the #2 location near Carefree Hwy and have eaten in the place several times since it opened last fall.   Not as busy inside with diners as it used to be when it first opened but they do a fair amount of carry out orders.  The restaurant is clean but the place is kind of weird with too many TV's and just one big space.  The wall appliques of various people are strange too, rather stereotypical, if you ask me.

Now to the food, it's good and you get a lot for your $.  I would actually rate it 3 1/2 stars but Yelp won't let you do 1/2 stars. Not the best Chinese I have ever had but reliable and the wait staff is attentive and the food comes out quick  They were smart to open where they did because there is a lack of Asian choices in the area.  They even wrap up your leftovers for you, which is a nice touch.
 
Ordered carryout last night and got the Gen. Taos Chicken and Orange Beef, good tastes and the food held up well getting home (not too soggy!).  Like most Chinese food it was too salty.

Looks like a new Chinese place is coming near the Albertson's on Carefree Hwy.. Moon something?, So let's see what a little competition does.  Maybe one of them will start delivery (hint, hint!)

I will return!i've always thought that it would be great for a wahoo's to open up in vegas.  they finally did!

if your in the mood for some fish tacos, this is a nice spot.  they don't have the fried kind (which i prefer), but the fish they do have is a good as its a mild fish taste and meaty.  the other kinds of meats, like the beef and chicken, are good - but nothing out of the ordinary.  in my opinion, they could use a little bit more kick.  this is a good option if your eating healthy as you could substitute for brown rice.  brown rice and fish = a meal to not feel guilty about.

the portions are really large and the prices are decent.  i love their white rice..its seasoned nicely. not a big fan of the white beans though.  i'll like to stick with the normal black.

its brand new and clean so the ambience is great.  theres also a bar with happy hour and i think they even have some slots (only in vegas!).  its kind of hard to find since its not on the main road.  keep on the look out for it near rainbow and sunset.Overall, the singing and dancing were great. The star singer/performer Ms. Reeves sounded fantastic, but was WAY over the top with her mannerisms as she tried to mimic Tina Tuner and Diana Ross. It was practically mockery.  If it had not been for her buffoonery, I'd have given this show a 4.The atmosphere was the only good thing about this restaurant. The sushi was bland and the proportion were small. They do have a good deal on groupon that might be worth checking out though.Overall, it was good but it wasn't the best burger I've ever had.  It's a good option at Town Square, and I hope that it will stick around since it seems like it's particular location has a hard time.  (It was previously a pizza joint.)

It was pricey for what seemed like an average burger, i.e., the normal toppings/condiments.  I'm not a fan of super fried stuff (other than french fries) so the menu seemed a bit limited to me.  (My husband, on the other hand, had trouble choosing between the different burgers.)

I like that they offer beer, and I believe they have happy hour.  They also have free wi-fi  and were showing various sports games on tv's.

I'll probably go back but it's not a must try or die type of place.Old Town Whiskey is closed.The restaurant is in such a cool spot. Yes the strip line does interfere with the view. Try to go after dark to see lights. The service was excellent. The food was awful. I didn't even eat mine. I tried four menu items. My boyfriend ate his steak but agreed it wasn't very good. I hope something changes in regards to the food. I would love to go back if I knew the food was better.Still just average in terms of drinks...but this is a review for the night time crowd.  Very young, as in teenager/high school kids hanging out.....so if you are an adult...you may want to find a different location for socializing in the evening time.On the upside, the place is really nice! A bit of a gem, even. Indoor and outdoor seating it looks like. Well done. And the happy hour everyone praises? Really - it is that good. Very inexpensive and I'd say it makes a visit worth it.

On the downside, there is nothing remarkable about the pizza. I mean, it isn't bad, but you won't be blown away. It's pizza. But like I said, at happy hour it's a great deal for a great experience.

I'll have to try other things on the menu and update my review later.Taste wise 4 star, as the food does taste good, service 4 star the guy working the counter was very nice. I would give an overall of a 4 star, but gave 3 due mainly 2 price, and as good as the food is, u really do not get very much meat with your food. They do give you plenty of rice/beans with your food, a decent amount of plantains, but very little chicken for what they charge. Overall if the price ever drops, I will absolutely go back for sure!Overall the food and service is average. We ordered 

Shrimp with scrambled eggs (shrimp is large, good portion however a little too salty)
String bean with garlic sauce (A-OK)
Preserved veg with pork hot pot (a little too sweet for me besides that it's good)

Con : They charge for steam rice. (My cousin who lived in Vegas says most Chinese restaurant do no charge for steam rice).I placed an order for pickup, but it took me 4-5 tries to get through. Parking is a beast during the week, carry out parking would be nice. 

The staff is friendly and the food is super fresh. The border bowl is big enough to share, so prepare yourself if you order solo.Really nice staff work right I front of this store I wish they had more things but other than that really nice place !This is the place to get cheap drinks while waiting to get into Thunder From Down Under next door. Their happy hour runs all day and includes $2 beer and $5 cocktails. There's hardly anyone here in the evenings too so service is fast. Load up ladies because you'll need it!Pretty interesting place, which has different tasting pancakes. The red velvet was whatevers, but the carrot cake was very unique and pretty good. I opted for the adobo fried rice omelet. It's not that bad.Very good food but i had a very rude waitress. Wish I new her name so I could put it on this review. No tip from meI'd say this 3 star is really more of a 3.5 star but, 1OAK is in Vegas and as such gets graded on a Vegas scale, and to that end, it's just mediocre. I've been here several times, with and without bottle service, and 1OAK  doesn't really stand out. As a club in Vegas, I understand that your drinks are going to be pricey, I accept it, I would however like some vodka in my screwdriver if it's not too much of a hassle. It's also the only club in Vegas where even when I have bottle service I get hassled. I'm paying specifically to not get hassled and to have my own area, but they put the tables so close to one another. This is good if the next group is fun, but sucks when they're buzzkills
The good part of this club though is that even though it's small, it certainly does try. I've seen several people perform here and haven't had any issues with getting in. They also have a semi residency with major lazer, and I love them almost as much as bacon
  The club is also open on Tuesdays, which I like because if I'm in a club mood on Tuesday, I have a place. 
The bottle service here also isn't as expensive as most on the strip and I have gotten a decent amount of comps here. 

My final say is that if this place wasn't in Vegas, like if it was in San Diego or Sacramento it would be the toast of the town, but since it's in Vegas, it becomes just another clubBoth the Shu Mai and Ha Gow had a very strange taste, not bad, just different from the norm. Nice place to eat, give it a shot.This is your typical sports bar. Nothing amazing worth mentioning, but nothing bad either. A good place to go if you want to watch some games or watch some UFC fights.Good food (nachos, sandwiches, appetizers ). Drinks are made decently good most times.. Good cheap shots. I like how they have a HH that starts an hour early (2:00) then the rest of the bars around (3:00). And everyone is always very nice.$5 for parking and located in downtown LV , easy to find and very historical location.

The 3 level museum is full of artifacts about the past! You take the elevator to the top floor and work your way down. It starts with how the Mobsters took over and than at the last level is how it was brought back to its norm. 
There were so much information all over the walls, so much detail everywhere that i understood then why people would buy memberships for the museum. I think it would take well over a whole day before you can fully understand EVERYthing ! 

We pretty much skimmed through this spot and partake in some photo opps and read through some pretty gruesome details of what they did when they "hacked" someone! At the end of it all there was the gift shop, pretty cool spot for some education and fun!This place is good.  We were staying at the Four Seasons and they recommended this place.  i have to say being a NYorker and american italian im pretty picky...and our dishes were  good!  We sat outside because it was a beautiful night..we sat near the outside fireplace...it was very nice!!   Also, the music was very fitting..nice authentic italian music!!  fried calamari..drinks..main dishes were good.  the dessert..cannoli(good for arizona..lol).  fruit dessert in a large martini glass was fantastic!!  Wait staff was excellent..our waiter Chris couldn't have been nicer.  They also gave us(on the house) a glass of Limoncello..which was nice touch!! I would also say dining in AZ is a little earlier so we had to get use to this.   we went around 9pm and it was winding down..so eastcoasters... get to this restaurant and start making it later dining!The place is jam packed with stuff I do not need, but fun to look over.Got Pho here once and it was good!  Also had some tasty chicken wings and eggrolls.

Not sure what's going on inside the restaurant itself, it looks like it used to be a sports bar/party bar and now they serve pho and sushi?  I don't think I'd try the sushi here.

Lots of beers on tap, looks like a great spot for happy hour if you're near the 202 and Scottsdale Road in Tempe.It's a beautiful restaurant. The decor is grade A, classy and dim and sexy. I only went here for lunch, but I'd imagine it's a great date place, especially if your date is shallow like me and gets excited about visually impressive places. You enter and behind the host's table is a whole wall lined with tequila bottles. Really gorgeous.

I can't remember what my husband ordered. I remember we got the mexican corn as an appetizer, and I got a lovely cocktail that had raspberries and champagne in it. Quite delicious. The corn was so so. Better mexican corn can be found at the Black Chile Grill in the Biltmore. It wasn't charred enough, and I think the amazing creaminess from slathered mayo wasn't there. Probably was healthier for you though! My fish tacos were good, but not outstanding. 

In short, a good restaurant, but nothing memorable. Don't go out of your way to enjoy the food there, but don't avoid it either. If you're there shopping, make sure to give it a shot!The taxi drivers don't even know this place changed names to "Elara."  It's still PH Westgate in everyone's minds.  The Hilton name came off of one hotel in Vegas, but they're back with their recent acquisition of Planet Hollywood's extra add-on.  Behold, the new "Hilton Grand Vacations" hotel.

Good things? 
-The hotel is non-smoking.
-The 1 bedroom suite was huge and has a pull-out bed in the living room couch.  We had 10 people in the room, and there was plenty of space. book it through a deal, not through the hilton site.
-DJ spins at the pool on the weekends during the summer, mostly Top 40.
-Central Location on the strip, next to Fat Tuesday and Marquee


Not So Good Things?
-Hard to initially find, parking garage sort of a walk from the front desk.
-Hilton must have some security standard, because they post a guard out by the elevators.  It's pretty useless, as one person having a key can bring in a huge throng of people.  This doesn't keep the partiers (like meeeee) out of your floor.
-Be prepared to shell out $$$ at the poolside bar, a beer is $7.  They conveniently tell you to dump all drinks before going in.  Hm...
-They seem to really be dealing with lots of small problems. Security bugged us to see if we were "doing ok" practically every hour on Saturday (go away, we're busy on vacation).  Calls to concierge desk sometimes do not get recorded.  It's not obvious how to turn your room onto "do not disturb" mode.  They said its because of the "recent switch in ownership," but come on...


Overall, it was whatever.  But really, it's vegas - and a definite step up from dumps like Polo Towers and Imperial Palace.

(DANG I ACTUALLY WROTE A USEFUL REVIEW, +1 ME)They deliver and that made me so happy, but not to be too excited.  My biggest disappointment is the delivery time and how the food appears cold once we receive it. Perhaps, it would be best to just dine it because the food is pretty good. They also totally messed up a food order for delivery, which left one of us with nothing to eat while we waited an additional 45 minutes for the driver to return with correct order.  Bummer!This place is great if you love antojitos Mexicanos  this is the place for you the ice cream is delicious my only pet peeve and why I gave three stars is that they only had two people working and there was a line out the door service just took a really long timeThe ability to sit on the square was really nice with a great view of the square.  The food was solid but not the best Indian I have had in Madison.  Garlic Naan was a bit flat and the dishes were not terribly aromatic or bursting with flavor.  I would come back for sure as it is a nice experience.  Perhaps it was a one off night.  I enjoyed myself and will return at some point.Wings were not bad,I had honey habenero(not hot at all,pass if you want heat) had Cajun hot (def packs some heat) the bad part about it they charge 50 cents to split flavors,wth????.try the fried okra and spicy tator tots awesome.The celery sticks??? went directly to the trash(not worth eating).The wait wasnt long on a thursday prob 15 minutes in and out of the door.Wont be going out of my way for this placeI went to London two summers ago and visited the topshop there. I love their clothing ,accessories and handbags - ALL they had to offer. 
When I came back to the US and realize that they were planning to open on in the west coast I got excited. I've been anticipating it since then. And when I saw that they had opened two weeks ago when I went to vegas I KNEW I had to go. I bugged the hell out of Darren to drive me there since we were staying at the four seasons and its like MILEs away - in vegas length. Darren said yes and hopping for joy I jumped into the car with a grin on my face....

When I got there...
I AM - disappointed. This location does not do the store any justice! This store seemed a little too overly-hipped out with neons and sparkles that it just seemed...not my cup of tea. I really missed the classic/timeless pieces that the one on oxford street had to offer. This was just another 'shop' for me, not the TOPshop I was looking forward to.  Price for things were the same so no difference there.
Walked out with nothing and went to Zara instead.

Maybe next month when I go to vegas again, I'll stop by and have another look.

Hopefully the one opening in the Grove next year will be better. *fingers crossed*Immediately upon entering the building, I was turned off by two things:  1. You have to go through a line with rails like an amusement park.  2.  As you approach the register..still in line.. you have to get your drink at the fountain.  It ends up the people drink what they initially filed up, then trying to go back you fill their cup again.  It was definitely annoying.

I was happy overall with the food.  A few highlights include the salad area & grill.  The salad area has tons of variety, and everything looked fresh.  I was also happy with the steak, as it was cooked to order on the grill.  

My  only problem with the food was the catfish.  While the taste was okay, it was thin & bone-in.  So by the time I pulled the meat away from the bones, there wasn't much left. So I felt it could've been served better.  

I agree with everyone on the cleanliness & service.   Getting refills on drinks and used plates cleared was a problem.  We could never seem to find out server; and other empty tables had plates stacked up for a while before they were cleared.

Food on the floor stayed there almost the entire time we were there, and the "clean" dishes & silverware had spots.  Sure, it's a buffet and I dint expect much, but for a place that is supposed to be a step up, I'd expect a step up.

Overall, I was happy & can see myself returning, but they can certainly improve on things.I really hate to say this. I really do. But the dinner experience I had at GRS was nothing short of underwhelming. 

I had been dying to check out this restaurant, so when a friend suggested a trip to Vegas, I was completely on board. 

For an appetizer, we ordered the main lobster and decided to share. Boy, was that a mistake. While the lobster was good, the portion was absolutely miniscule and in anticipation of a big expensive meal, had practically starved ourselves all day. Moving on. 

For a main course, I ordered the Beef Wellington ('cause obviously I had to). My husband got the epic American Kobe filet. The waiter does come by with a meat cart before you order so you can see the different cuts, which is a nice touch. We also ordered the mac and cheese, haricot vert, and asparagus as sides to share.  

My Beef Wellington? It was fine. Okay. Pretty good. When compared with the amazingness I was expecting (and the price point), "fine" isn't anywhere close to good enough. We got a bearnaise to go along with the Kobe steak, but the fact is, that was its saving grace. The steak itself was incredibly boring. Sure, it was pretty good. It was fine. Not bad. But.... this is a steakhouse. And that's a $75 steak. Seriously? Not good enough, my friend. 

On the other hand--- the sides. Oh my God. OH MY GOD. The mac and cheese was incredible, and I think I could have eaten two buckets of the tempura fried haricot vert. The asparagus was perfect, too. So for that bit of wonderfulness, I'm giving Gordon Ramsay Steak one star for each of those. When I start craving mac and cheese, that's the one I think of. So, so good. 

But guys.... it's a steakhouse. A STEAKHOUSE. With a super boring steak. Yes, it was well cooked. But I've had far better steaks at restaurants one would assume would be inferior. Overall, the meal was a lot of highs and lows. I had the sticky toffee pudding for dessert, since it's one of my favorite things on the planet, but I was really tempted to not order anything else. The toffee pudding I would say was quite good-- 4 out of 5 stars. I really wanted this to be the best meal of my life. It was certainly the most expensive (one appetizer, two entrees, three sides, one dessert, and the least expensive bottle of wine on the menu -- $300). But I refuse to get caught up in the I-paid-a-lot-for-this-so-it-better-be-five-stars trap and be completely honest. 

If you feel you must go to Gordon Ramsay Steak... just order the sides.To: Mr. Ramsay

I love your shows, Hell's Kitchen and Masterchef. You show passion in everything you do. 

Thank you,
Long
--------------------------------

   My wife and I celebrated our special day at Ramsay Steak House in Las Vegas.  First,  I want to say the steaks were amazing and your desserts were to die for( the desserts were free because what had happened).  The waitress who waited on us  was knowledgeable on the steaks  and she knew which beer would go with the dishes. 

   The dinner would have been GREAT, expect for the host who showed us to our table. She took us up in the elevator  to the second level then we walked across the floor.  She then walked us back to the elevator and told us to wait in front of the elevator.  After 2 minutes standing there, she came back and took us down stairs to our table. 

   Mr. Ramsay,  please understand, if I was at a 1 star or 2 stars restaurant I can understand about the miscommunication about where to seat your customers.  I was disappointed and sad for what happened on our special night. My wife and I were looking forward to your 5 stars restaurant but it fell short to our expectation.  I paid $615.65 for 3 people so I think I have the right to expect GREAT service ALL around service. Don't you think?

   I know you are a world class chef: restaurateur and television personality, awarded 15 Michelin stars in total and currently holds 14. Maybe you should slow down and check up on your restaurants... 

#1 - first impression is the front desk...
#2 - second is the table...
#3 - the food and service...A brewery in the Scottsdale/ Paradise Valley area? Surely you jest.

It's true! AND its kind of hidden in the middle of a ritzy strip mall. When you walk into this place, it looks nothing like a brewery- the decor is very bistro.

We enjoyed their beer, and their happy hour menu is different, but good.

The service was great at first. But the later it got, the busier it got, and it seemed like our waitress was the only one working. We spent about an hour trying to flag her down for our check.

The food was great. I had the chicken pesto sandwich, while tasty, gave me a bit of food poisoning. The rest of our group enjoyed their eats: the "famous" meatballs, burgers, and pizza. And they were all fine.

If you go, dont be surprised that its not your typical brewery, and stay AWAY from the chicken.Luke warm chai tea. Nothing special. Its like drinking steamed milk. Starbucks' is much better for the same price.Very nice staff and service. Very low key place. Never had pupusas before so decided to try it. I thought it was more like a flour tortilla. It seems more like a thick corn tortilla which I personally do not care for. We tried the mixed option. They were somewhat tasty but I just did not care for the corn texture. Beans were runny. They were also a bit on the greasy side but that may be how it is supposed to be.Service 4/5 - Lets start with the service. The service was decent. They checked on us on regular intervals. They were very polite and they asked to refill our drinks regularly.

Food 2/5 - I had ordered a tamago nigiri, beef carpaccio, one of their rolls, and stole some tempura off of a friend's boat. The rice on the roll felt underwhelming. The texture, and temperature of the rice didn't give me the impression of good craftsmanship. The flavor of the rice was okay. That being said, the sushi was okay. The beef carpaccio tasted pretty good. The texture didn't give me the impression of carpaccio though. Overall the food was okay for the price.

Drinks 5/5 - of the Drinks I wanted, the nigori sounded good and the calpico sounded fun, so I had both. Should have made it for happy hour because it seemed like it would have encouraged me to drink more. The drinks came chilled and they had a nice way of topping off my meal. Kudos to alcohol lol.For the time being, I need to adjust the rating here because of two issues which I have found to be uncommon here. First, I was waiting for about 7 minutes while the employees were busy in the middle of a conversation (in espinol) despite seeing me waiting to order at the counter. Second, both items I got were not fresh, the dessert item was actually stale and crusty and should have been discarded (tasted like refrigerated birthday cake from last week).Vegas pizza places can be broken down into 4 tiers. 
Tier 1: Settebello, Grimaldi's, Old School Pizzeria
Tier 2: Metro Pizza, Rosati's. 
Tier 3: Sunset Pizzeria, Papa Johns, Pizza Hut
Tier 4: Little Caesars or places that make DiGiorno Frozen Pizza look good.

After 1 visit to Bistro I'm having a hard time putting them in my Tier 2 category. For one thing when I called they were out of garlic knots and cheese sticks. I was told it would be 45 minutes to have new ones ready. I'm sorry but I call bs on this one. Case in point, Benny Blancos on Capitol Hill in Denver is open from 11 am to 3 am and has always, ALWAYS had garlic knots available. Old School Pizzeria in NLV on Craig Road: Chef Gio has NEVER been out of garlic knots. And these are places that do some hella business. In short, not buying the excuse, try again. 

We ordered mozzarella sticks for the kids, and two pizzas. Pizza #1 was a Pepperoni with one half having ham and pineapple. The crust was soft, kinda chewy. The ham had good flavor, but when the kids picked the pineapple off the slices we knew something was amiss. A quick taste had me wondering where they got their pineapple as it didn't taste anywhere close to fresh or even well packed in a can. 

My pizza had sausage, ham, tomatoes, and black olives. Bistro's sausage is definitely a cut above much of the stuff I've found in Vegas to date. The ham was great. Overall...not bad. 

Sauce wise everyone liked it...but we didn't get people raving over it like they do with Metro's stuff. And these pizzas were not overly greasy. Even with all the pepperoni it didn't look like it was swimming in grease like Metro's pizza's do. 

Service: Kind of aloof. It's hard to explain and maybe it was because I wasn't having a good day but the man I talked to at the counter was not the most friendly person. There was also the issue of he almost sent a pizza out the door with the sheet of wax paper sticking halfway out the side. He saw this and reboxed the pizza but do it right the first time and you won't be wasting boxes. 

Overall: 3 Stars. We will try them again but the garlic knots excuse flat out won't fly with me, ever. If other pizza places can get it done...I can't give Bistro a free pass on it.Food good, but lost a star when our unnamed server took our drink order and never delivered it. We were excited to try the beer flights, and he brought our wedge salads divided in half, as we had requested, and we finished and still did not have our beer flights.  Finally my wife got up and went to the bar and the bartender delivered the flights. I had the Study Abroad flight, which included the Belgians, and my wife had the Light of the Moon flight, which were lighter wheats.  Cute little muglets but we both felt they had been sitting for awhile because they were not cold.  Entrees came, and I had ordered Pork Two Ways, which included a delicious charred chop (I love charred pork!) and a generous helping of spicy chile verde pork stew, served with fried egg on top and buttered tortillas.  Stack was a little hard to manipulate.  My wife had the seared scallops with corn two ways with bacon and they were tasty. Food exceeded the brews.  Unnamed server (Jeff on the receipt) redeemed himself by comping the extremely tardy beers, but had to leave it at three stars after this unforgivable faux pas.This review will be short and sweet. The room has an intimate feel to it. You got small, round tables surrounded by 4 chairs spread all around the room. There is a bar at back for you alcoholics. The comedians they showcase are better than average. Everybody has their own brand of comedy and the audience is usually mixed. If you didnt come here to have a good time, then you're in the wrong place buddy. Go watch Criss Angel if you wanna waste your money and complain.The ambiance is good. Sangria was good too. But we were a big party and sitting on a big table. I asked for a salsa refil, the server picked one off our table, turned around and handed it over to me. I was thinking of giving 4 stars, but just 3 for now!Although it is a new convenient location for items, they mark up all the prices making their products a rip off. I would recommend going to the ABC store in Planet Hollywood. At least the ABC prices are still reasonable unless you don't care about being ripped off.Certainly decent place.

This place recently opened and its a 24 hour diner.  
This is a little Mom and Pop Cafe type feel. Reminds me of TTT in Tucson. 

The waitress was working by herself and there were about 4 other parties in there but it didn't stop her from paying attention to our party of 8. She did really well.

The food was good, it was diner quality. Nothing amazing but it was decent.

Certainly worth the stop if you are looking for a cheap, good meal. 
However do not mistake the quality of food for 5 star.We went here for a night out as a family, and let me start by saying that the chocolate fountain is amazing! We splurged and got 4 different flavors of Gelato - dulce de leche, creme brulee, oreo, and mint. The Gelato was truly delicious, however not the absolute best I have ever had. The service on the other hand was horrible... Truly the worst service I have had in a very long time. We are a friendly family and when we greeted the woman with a "Hello! How's your evening going?" we got a blank stare... Then when we asked if we could try a couple samples she genuinely rolled her eyes at us. May I add that we were the only people in line as this time. The only words she spoke to us were to tell us our total and even then we didn't get any eye contact. I hope that she was just having an "off night" but she made me feel like I was a terrible inconvenience on her evening.Patio seating was really nice for our reservation at 8. Not too hot. 

Took about 15 min before someone came and wiped down our table and took our drink orders, so that was a negative. 

The Mrs had the caprese and it was a little bland. Crabcakes were pretty solid. Didn't get an entree because of the appetizers. Desserts were really good. The creme puffs and chocolate ice cream with cocoa powder were both excellent. 

Didn't go into the Lam showroom. 

All in all a decent experience but nothing special.oh dear, i hope i'm not going to become hated by all the cake lovers and bakeries in edinburgh, but hear me out before i'm you start to boo me.

my visit here was due to a birthday cake afternoon celebration and it was lucky that the plan was only to come for cake because that was the only option.  seriously, they have no soup, sandwiches, salads, or other savoury delights that help take the edge off the sugar rush.  i was actually quite glad i'd eaten a quick lunch before going.  they did have one savoury scone, but that would hardly do if someone had come with the intention of having a small lunch with a slice of cake.  a bit disappointing and with a shop so large i'm not sure why they don't offer the savoury options....

so a bit disappointed by the lack of savoury options, but i have to say the cakes looked seriously impressive.  what i did like about this place was the variety of cake and brownie options that were a bit different than the normal.  they had a chocolate cake, but they also had an orange and rosemary cake and a ginger and rose cake.  they also had carmel chocolate brownies and parmesan and sundried tomato scones and some other delights that i fail to remember so many days later.

i was also rather impressed with their tea choices.  the normal breakfast blend but also a lovely violet black tea that was thoroughly enjoyable.  the tea was served in lovely tea cups with an extra flask of hot water for top ups.  very convenient and appreciated from a chain tea drinker like me!  seriously, i can never just have one cup...

now the cakes and this is where the three star rating was confirmed.  my orange and rosemary cake was delightlful.  it was orange-y and had a hit of rosemary but as i neared the end of the slice it got rather sugary.  i think this came from the frosting and it might have been nice if there was a bit more rosemary to cut through the sweetness.  i also tried a small forkful of the caramel chocolate brownie and oh dear, did someone accidently add an extra bag of sugar to this???  it was so incredibly sweet that my tiny forkful gave me a sugar rush and a bit of a tummy ache at the same time.  i also think the enamel on my teeth started to dissolve from the huge sugar hit.  poor Kelly F couldn't even finish it after passing it around for everyone to taste. 

i know people like cakes and brownies and other sweet things but the greatest disappointment of lovecrumbs was how overly sugary everything seemed.  i just can't eat cake that tastes like i'm only eating a bag of sugar with a tiny hint of another flavour.  so i don't think i'll be making a return visit unless i'm told things are less sugary....I am very excited to eat here because a friend told me how great it was, walked in and had high hopes. LOVED the ambiance of the decor, full bar, lots to choose from on the menu and the staff was super friendly, and they had diet coke which for us is a BIG deal.

They brought out bread and an olive oil/vinegar which was good, I ordered a pasta dish which was good but not amazing, I am not a big lover of tangy sauce but I ate it. My Boyfriend ordered a chicken and artichoke calzone which looked awesome when it came out but after cutting into it the cheese had not melted inside, so we sent it back. When the waitress came back, she apologized and handed him a clearly nuked in the microwave calzone which was now chewy and sad looking and said she had the cook make him another one to take with him. Although it was a nice thing to do, he didnt really care for this dish and after explaining that she offered him something else. Again, the staff was great so that wasnt the issue at all. They got him a spaghetti and meatball plate, he too ate it and felt the sauce was a bit tangy. 

When the bill came out, she did not charge us for his meal, and that impressed me, because I expected to pay for at least the spaghetti and meatballs for him as well as my dish. This showed me they want to make their customers happy and because of this I will give them another shot in the future.The food here is really good! Mitch our server was fantastic. However it's very loud and very crowded. All the employees were very nice but we were seated next to a table with unruly children that the parents didn't care to look after. I would definitely order take out though!A little pricier than where I am from but fast and efficient service. They also have tons of colors to choose from and are well staffed. This trip I only got a gel overlay on my nails, I'll definitely be back.I've been into the Ventoux a few times now and I'm pretty happy with it. I'm still not 100% sure what the bar is meant to be. Half of me wants it to turn into an apres-velo style bar where the road clubs will turn up to on a sunday, where I can head after a solid mash on the bike or at the gym and have some hearty food a pint and perhaps a espresso. However it's not that .... yet. ....

The beers are solid with a good selection of different beers from around germany and europe. They also have the classic Edinburgh selection of lagers and bitters with a few surprises. They have a decent selection of spirits. They also have crisps. 

One of the good things they've done since they took over from the illicit still is to get rid of the enormous TV which was the worst thing that had happened to bars in the last century.

The space in general REALLY works as a bar. I appreciate the tables, the standing space, the way it works as a bar. However it still feels like it's just not quite there yet. I think that in a few years it'll figure itself out and THAT it will be a better bar.This spot is great had a little trouble checking in as the system went down right when we got there, the free breakfast from 6-9am made up for the lost time will be checking out all the other spots that offer free breakfast for now on now that i know they exsistNeeds renovation for sure, especially given its history.  Gary Selesner, head of the hotel for 4 years now has virtually renovated everything.  He will get to this in time, and when he will, it will be the best in town. Because most people walk past it to get to the FORUM SHOPPS, its one of the strip's best spots for people watching, PERIOD. Bathrooms are close as is the poker room, and Munch Bar for food and snacks.  You can do better, and you can do worse. Lot of screens.First time in, the staff wasn't really very welcoming, didn't get a hello or anything and they both looked at me when I walked in.  The clothes are okay just way WAY overpriced and considering the lack of acknowledgement I wasn't really down to spend any money in the store.The coffees and frozen drinks are very good. The yogurt was premade, so the granola was mushy.I used to love this place. It had been a few months since I ate here before today. But today....
1. I couldn't have my eggs the way I wanted them on my plate "We don't substitute"
2. I get 1, ONE napkin. I finally have to ask if they can spare an extra napkin or two. 
3. I get charged for sour cream

Not sure if I'll come backI was excited upon seeing a lively rustic chic lounge/bar/dining room. Atmosphere and service were great all-around but there was a noticeable gap between appetizers and entrees.  Of the appetizers, the scallop (one) stood out and the tender squid was fantastic. I'd pass on the dry meatballs. The bacon sounded good but I didn't try it; I just heard the crisp from the other end of a large table. 

Entrees were meh. Portions were tiny for the price. My filet was overcooked and the meat was tough to cut into. Salmon portion was also laughable and I noticed four differently-sized pieces on four plates. I'm sure they go by weight over shape/size but still, perception trumps reality. The red velvet cake I had was dry and bland. Among the worst I've had for the price.  

Halfway through dinner, a live DJ starting spinning house tracks. I don't think it fit the restaurant vibe and average age of patrons. I found it slightly off-putting and made it difficult to hear my dinner party. Another tip: park next door at NM (one minute walk) for free and avoid the valet. 

Overall: another "celebrity"-chef hype failing to meet expectations. Avoid bedtime texts with dining partners about how hungry y'all still are. Spend the same amount elsewhere for a much more satisfying, and filling, meal.3 stars: A-OK.

It's thin crust pizza from a chain restaurant. 

Claim to fame is the coal burning oven.

This particular location is in the mall. 

If you've ever lived in NYC, you'll wonder what the fuss is about. 

If you've ever lived in Chicago, you'll complain that the pizza is paper thin. 

They have pizza and beer, how can you go wrong - so long as the pizza is hot and the beer is cold, it's just fine.

They have TVs inside, they email coupons for your birthday if you sign up on the website, they aim to please. 

You can't really go wrong.

If you think you're going to have life changing pizza inside fashion show mall, there's something wrong with you.Had never been to one of these places before.  Have to say the ambiance is like hooters with a rock climbing wall inside of it.  I guess anyone can climb it if they feel like it, we saw several people doing it. Different form of entertainment.  The waitress wear the minimum clothing requirement (which hubby loved of course).  Its got a lot of TV's for the sports fans and food was actually fresh and decent, although I think a bit pricey for a burger joint.As gyms go this one is ok.  What bugs me the most is the hidden fees.  There's an annual "maintenance" fee of $29.99 they collect automatically in June.  When you sign up they collect the last month and first month and "initiation fee", each at $10.00 for a total of $30.00 due at sign up.  If you cancel early (before your 1 yr contract automatically renews at $5.00 increase to $15.00/month), you will have to pay $25.00 "processing fee".  And you can ONLY cancel within 60 days of your auto renewal date.  Discount = hidden fees.  Sick of being nickel and dimed to death.Ate at this place a few days ago.  I ordered lasagna and my wife ordered a burger.  The food was good, but not great.  Although the lasagna was well priced at  $16 we felt the Burger $15 was a little much.  As was stated in an earlier review the interior was very spacious and has a bar.  We were there about  7pm on a Saturday and there were only three tables occupied  (including ours).  I did like that the menu was only one page long, so it wasn't like I was reading a bookUnder new management as of January 2014.  Sparse food menu (oatmeal was the pre-packaged, add-water-to-the-paper-cup).  Fruit plate was very generous for just $2: sliced half apple, half an orange, half a pear, 3 strawberries, and a handful of grapes.  I ordered a soy latte and it was strong - I hesitate to review as I'm trying to wean off sugary coffees so unfair to rate.  Ordered a tea and it was GIGANTIC and a bagged organic type out of a box.  WiFi was still available.  They left the shop doors open all morning which made it chilly inside.  Single staff person meant a wait if more than one customer at a time.  Very few power sources so bring a full battery.  It was a good place to kill time, but left me hungry.i forgot this place was here and drove by , decided to grab some breakfast i went with moms pancakes 2 ridiculously big cakes good item to split between 2/3 people and i also ordered the sausage side 2 unexciting pattys of sausage (pass)place is country quaint not my style of decor, service was goodI haven't been to a Sizzler in a long time. This review is for the Salad Bar only. The salad was fresh and ample variety of fixins. The hot dishes, chicken was dry...too long sitting out, not one single piece was eatable. Skimpy on the soups and tacos.  Overall at best 2.5 stars.....I would say try it out but be ready for a little more grease than necessary.  Basically the food is good but not if you are anywhere close to wanting to eat decent/healthy :).
This will be a place that we do not go frequently but maybe every once in awhile when we need a good burro/burrito.To be honest, if I didn't have a friend that tends bar here, I probably never would have gone. I'm not a huge fan of chain restaurants, and since its less than a mile from my home Pub (Tim Finnegan's) I have little reason to stop in.

When I did, it was exactly what I expected. Lots of TVs with sports on, decent beer selection and "meh" food. I will be honest, the wings at Tim Finnegan's are better, which is sad considering that is kind of Buffalo Wild Wing's staple menu item.

The other challenge is that this and the new Olive Garden building are in a... less nice part of Metrocenter circle, right next to 2 cheap motels. Good if you wanna score crack or a prostitute, bad if you want your car to be safe in the lot after dark. 

If you wanna watch a game in a chain restaurant, this is the place. If you wanna hang out in a bar with some personality, drive a mile south.I wanted to like this place more, but I think they are having some growing pains.  They were out of Dr. Pepper and Sprite, 2 of the 6 drinks on the fountain.  So, when I wanted a refill, but not of iced tea, I was annoyed to find the only 2 drinks on the fountain I like gone.  The owner was nice enough to give me a Dr. Pepper out of the chill case, but still.  Also, we were told that sandwiches were not available at all, as many others have noted.  We were there for mac n cheese anyway, but this is a further example of the growing pains.

My wife had the cheesy mac.  This was solid, but not great.  It was very sparse on the blue cheese flavor, which was the main reason she ordered it.  Overall, bland.  Did have a very nice crust on the top.

Mine was much better, I had the bayou.  The crab and crawfish flavor was really noticeable.  I could have used more spice, I added red pepper flakes at the table.  The top was nicely crusted, but the middle of my dish remained cool.  I had to take it up to get more heat on it.  I'm assuming this occurred because the seafood was cold, so it made getting the entire dish to temperature take longer.  They were really nice about it, and heated it quickly, so no harm no foul.

We'll give Mix n Mac another try, but hopefully they work out some of these issues sooner rather than later.  I think once they do, it will be a solid place.I'm an Northwest guy, having lived outside of Portland and Seattle for maybe nine years.  So when my brother got tired of the overcast skies and moved to the greater Phoenix area, I decided it was a great chance to get some sun myself.

We saw the review for Johnny Rockets and couldn't pass up the onion rings.  Don't get me wrong, they were good, but probably not good enough to deserve an extra star.  Call me a foodie, but I want something to really wow my taste buds.

On the overall, this place had an awesome atmosphere.  It was a bit early, maybe 10 or 11am, so not too many people.  At each table they have a small Jukebox, and when you sit down your waiter or waitress gives you five nickels so that you can pick some music (songs are only 5 a selection).

I ordered the Route 66 burger (mushroom burger) and my brother ordered some bacon burger.  I saw a sign in the restaurant that recommended my choice, but it was definitely a let down.  Not much flavor.  Sorta greasy, but lack of any flavor sorta killed it.  Actually, it was one of the worst mushroom burgers I've had, don't know how they screwed that one up.

Now my brother loved his bacon burger, and I had a bite.  It was really good.  I guess I should never underestimate the power of bacon.  We never got a chance for a milkshake though, as the burgers were pretty filling.

Last thing I should mention though is the dancing.  I think that everyone can agree two white boys getting down to Funky Town is hilarious, but for the whole song is a little much.  We felt so bad for them we left some extra tip.  Johnny Rockets, why can't you hire women to dance to music for our pleasure?  Why did it have to be men?  I probably would have added an extra star for female amusement.

And btw, I don't know what was wrong with our jukebox, cause I could not get Jimmy Buffet's Cheeseburger in Paradise to play.  They other songs worked, but why not Jimmy Buffet? :-)The menu is super exciting. The music sexy.  This would be a 5 star review. The food is effing amazing. I need a moment with my lamb. 
The service, well.....

1. I didn't order wine, please remove my glasses
2. Bubbly & a cocktails shouldn't take long. Did you go to France to get my bubbles? Are you growing the trees for the oranges?  Don't tell me that the bar got busy. The table sat after us got their drinks quickly. And they had wine & a cocktail. Hmmmm 
3. Don't try to give me bread plate to "prepare me for possible slow kitchen".  

Thankfully the excellent food was delivered promptly. Still service is lacking, except for the bus boy. He was prompt.Tried this place on the basis of one review (usually I prefer more) and liked it! Since I stopped by here before work I only had a chance to try a few things. I wound up picking the bag of macaroons and a chocolate and orange cake called the croqueline.

The cake was light and moist, the orange and chocolate paired well together as the powder on top of the cake added texture to the cake's softness. However I can't say I enjoyed the macaroons. I've only tried them at two other places (Bouchon and Patisserie Manon) and I was disappointed that theirs tasted similar to the cheap sugar cookies at the grocery stores. I bit into the orange and pistachio one inside the bag (there was also chocolate, but I didn't bite into that one yet) and the filling wasn't very rich in flavor. I expected the color to remind me of the flavor (orange=orange, mint green=pistachio). Next time I'll pass on the macaroons, but I'll try their other selections!The women who did my nails and pedicure were AWESOME!  However, I have not returned because the quality wasn't as good as I would have liked for the prices they charge.  The good:  they are open late, which is good for people who don't get off work before 7pm.  The ladies, as stated before, were super nice!  The pedicure I received was good, but nothing to write home about and at an average of $15 more than the average pedicure, I expected more.  There aren't massage chairs, but just a bench seat and while the view is cool at night (you can see the strip), it just wasn't comfortable. 

The girl who did my full set was super sweet and was admittedly "working on getting better" at doing nails.  I got gel and decorative rhinestones. I had to go back a couple days later and have another girl fix them because two of them didn't have the gel smooth finish (she forgot to put alcohol on them and I didnt know thats all I had to do) and then take the rhinestones off and paint another color because the stones had already fallen off.  The girl who did the fixing didn't charge me, which I thought was cool.

Overall the salon is clean and the decor is cute.  As another reviewer has stated, I want to LOVE LOVE LOVE this place, but the quality in relation to the cost will keep me from returning.Better than a solid burger, for sure-  I've been to a couple of Smash burgers, but this is first time for Smash Fries--Unbelievable!Good times, great beers, but again , the VIP section was lacking.
Seems like we paid extra to have access to clean bathrooms for the first hour.

The bands were excellent!!
Detailed update soon!!I got the bowl [which comes with guacamole, blak beans, rice, salsa, cilantro, chipotle crema] and for the meats I chose Barbacoa and carnitas. I wasn't expecting much for the quantity, the quality is average. Didn't have much meat in my bowl. If you're looking for airport food that'll satisfy your hunger for an hour or two, get what I got! Good for those who don't want to be on the plane with a full stomach. =]Pretty incredible for airport food.It was a bit of the good, the bad, and the ugly at this festival. There was wrestling, bounce houses, trash everywhere, lots of tacos, and lots of tequila sounds like one fun party to me.  As a first year event, I was impressed.  
The Good:
*The taco quality was impressive for a festival and the concept is fantastic.  My favorite that I tried was Barrio Cafe's spare rib taco.  My least favorite was the grasshopper taco but I was thrilled that I didn't spend a lot to try it and had the chance to try it. The side cart items like street corn fantastic!
*A portion of the proceeds benefit Waste Not a charity delivering food to 100 agencies.
*They had some kid activities. Face painter Daisy was fantastic.
*I left with a stack of coupons and a list of places I want to try.  
*The price was very fair, not sure how the VIP patrons felt.  We went average Joe and enjoyed the festival.
*People were having fun.
The Bad:
*The location of a dirt parking lot and little shade was not ideal.
*Pay another face painter the line was way too long.  She was very good but one more possibly two would have been great.
*The layout of the vendors needs more space between them and if you put them in a U make sure there is plenty of space between them!
The Ugly:
*Vendors ran out of food.
*Trash was everywhere b/c there wasn't enough trash cans.
*The "CONTEST" was lost.  I had no idea who, when, or where they were judging and that could have been entertaining.Remember in The Office when, in preparation for David Wallace's cocktail party, Michael Scott asked Pam to smell his breath but then Dwight volunteered and responded, "Good not great"?  Well that's exactly how I feel after eating here for lunch today.

Buttered calamari wasn't too bad, soft shell crab was par and the dipping sauce for it was delightful, but the main reason I came here was for the sushi Love Boat For Two for me.  The Love Boat sounded awesome because it's 9 pieces of sashimi, 8 pieces of nigiri, and a Hawaii roll (8 pieces) SERVED. ON. A. BOAT.

I'm on a boat!  I'm on a boat!  Take a good hard look at the mothafuckin boat!

The price is $30.95 which isn't bad, except for two things to consider:
1. The quality & taste isn't anywhere near as good as Sakana Sushi.
2. At Sakana, you can get 12 pieces sashimi for $12.45, which is a far superior deal since the pieces are cut larger.

I almost gave two stars because I was under the impression that I'd be getting dessert with the Love Boat but apparently the website is a fan of promoting LIES!  Not a total dealbreaker, but consider yourself warned.I purposely wait to go to new restaurants so they can work out the kinks, but I guess I didn't wait long enough.  I understand why there is a wait for tables.  Not because everyone has flocked there, but because they don't serve you once you get to the table.  We sat down and waited several minutes to be greeted, which was marginal.  After our waiter took our drink order, we didn't see him for more than 10 minutes.  After he took our food order, he never spoke to us again.  Random people brought us food, plates, our bill.  It was weird.  One friend described the wait as "hostile."  

We had the cheese pizza.  My daughter loved it.  It was okay.  I thought it was soggy in the middle.  We also got the corn coins.  I'm not sure corn on the cob is improved by putting a pound of cheese on it, but the corn was cooked awesome.  

It is a cool place and fun to hang out.  Just don't go if you are actually hungry or want to talk to a waiter.Giving this place 3 stars because the decor rocked, our server guy was sweet, and the cheese platter and wine was actually pretty good. Alas, I don't know if I can get myself to come back to a place that talks bad about its customers right in front of them. No wonder the place was empty. First of all, there is a bar and restaurant section, it was the middle of the day and we had our 6 months old daughter with us, naturally we sat in the restaurant section. The bartender girl had the nerve to give us the stink eye the entire time and say out loud "bringing a crying baby to a wine bar". Our child didn't cry once and I thought this area was nice enough for staff not to have ghetto attitude and manners towards their customers. Shame.I'm torn between 2 and 3 stars, but will give 3 since we probably just came at an "off" time. I bought a Groupon, $30 for $10, plus it was a weekend when Groupon had a $5 off promotion, so I only paid $5. 
We stopped by at 7:30pm and played pool at 1 of the 2 pool tables. Maybe there are more pool tables somewhere else, but when I think pool hall, I envision a room full of pool tables. Anyway, I think it was $12.99/hr. They had a couple of beer pong tables too.
We also had the nachos, which were ok, but nothing spectacular for $12. Add one Sprite and a water and that used up the $30. I guess that's not too bad. 
The whole time there were only a few other people in there, but as we were leaving there were a bunch of girls around the bar waiting for the male review. I would expect it to be a little more crowded on a Friday night, but like I said, we were there at 7:30 so we were probably early.
So I guess somewhere between meh and a-ok is fitting. This might be a fun place to go with a big group before heading somewhere else.
*Edit* I forgot to mention they offer bottle service! Uh, seriously? Someone's going to pay $150 for a bottle of vodka at this place? I don't think so. I know it's Vegas, but come on!!Best spot for beer pong and hanging out.  Kind of reminds me of a college bar.  Usually always empty, so better to bring a big group to start the fun.  Honestly, after O'sheas got knocked down this place is the only spot to go for BP.There has been so much hype about this place that I could not wait to try it out with my girlfriends for dinner.
The decor is adorable, very rustic chic. It's open and airy even when it got packed. One of my girlfriends and I arrived early for pre-dinner drinks at the bar. The service was a bit slow but very nice. I ordered a delicious vodka mint drink and she a strawberry prickly pear one. Mine was the better of the two by far. We were promptly seated at 7 and the waiter was quick to take our appetizer order. The table shared teh Charcuterie & Cheese platter and it was delicious if not a bit expensive at $21. The blue cheese with the honeycomb was divine and the marcona almonds were wonderful, a new favorite for sure. Service slowed at this point, while it was getting busy it was not so packed that we should have to wave down our waiter. My sister and I split the duck salad (called My Wife's favorite salad), it was delicious though the pieces of lettuce were a bit large in my opinion. We also split the waygu burger which was one of the specials. The burger was cooked perfectly and the bacon jam and egg really were a wonderful combination. The homemade chips were lovely and not too greasy. One of the girls in our party had the brick oven chicken and she was pleased with the chicken as well as the mac & cheese it was served with. By the time we were ready for dessert service had slowed considerably as the restaurant had filled up some more. It really seemed to get busy the later in the evening it got. We decided to get four different desserts and split them. The Brookie (a brownie cookie combination) was ok but I would not order it again. The triple layer cake was moist and had a really good flavor and the ganache was perfectly done. The two favorites were the apple pie in a bag which was devoured and the bread pudding. The best thing on the desserts however was the caramel salt ice cream, I wish I could have purchased a gallon to take home. 

I am only giving this restaurant three stars because it is so pricey for what you get. I have no problem spending money on good food and good it was but it was $30 good not $65 per person good.Great menu selection with both south and north Indian menu items.  Enjoyed the dosas we've had so far, and some of the curries are different than what you find at most Indian restaurants in town - for example I'm digging the Chana Saag.  

Service can be extremely slow sometimes which seems to be common at Indian restaurants.  Their spice levels are pathetically weak.  Hot is just not very hot.  Minor complaint I have concerns their plates because the artwork on them actually looks like dirty food stains until you take a closer look.  Can't get over it.The service was AMAZING!!!  The food is decent, however agree that if you want something exotic you will need to leave the confines of Gilbert ;)  The lunch portions are huge, and my husband and I paid approx $20 (including tip) for two lunch specials and two sodas.....really good value.

We will be back.I know it is opening weekend PLUS Memorial Day weekend but 3.5 hours to get inside even with a guest list??? You've got to be kidding me. There are a lot of kinks that need to be worked out to smooth out this whole waiting in line process. Hopefully all of the staff will just get better with time!

I enjoyed the huge LED back wall behind the DJ. I also enjoyed the Cirque du Soleli performers that were behind the DJ too. Sebastian Ingrosso was another plus. However, the overall layout of the club isn't the greatest, even with the huge dance floor on the bottom. Despite having this large main dance area, the club is still small, compared to Marquee and XS. I wish there was an outdoor area too!

Also, they really need to fix the bass because when my friends and I reached the front of the stage, our ear drums felt like they were going to fall off because it was overly intense!! Sure, we want to hear a good bass sound but this was way too much. Now I understand why no one was standing that close to the stage. Even standing a little further back in the crowd did not help. 

Overall, the club has some nice features inside and some really popular DJs on their line up, which would be the sole reason for my return. Otherwise, I think I would rather stick to Marquee or XS, my favorite clubs.This was a ridiculous experience from start to finish. And the only reason they get the third star is because we had absolutely the most fantastic adorable and aware cocktail waitress.  We went for Skrillex, who rocked!! And the cirque theme is suuuuuper fun and unique.  
However, the hosts are a bunch of professional scammers who take tips and tell you they will help you get a good deal on a table when they actually never do anything close to helping.  
And the club is full of cheap scandalous hoes who will loiter around table and then try to grab drinks off the table and run.Granted I went when it just opened up, I thought it was great but the parking situation sucks!About 10 days ago I gave Jenni a try.  
- I had the Pho Special, it was ok.  For what I got it seemed pricey compared to Pho at other Vegas places.
- I will give them props for having a nice decor/restaurant and cool, open-view kitchen that makes it easy to see the cooks in action.  Service was also excellent.
- I value food over ambiance so I'll probably stick with my tried-&-true Viet eateries or give other places a shot.Dear Chef Ramsay, are we not worthy?  

Gordon Ramsay's pub features tasty Americanized pub grub.  It's too bad because the British classics are so much better.

The food.  Fish and chips.   Perfectly cooked, moist cod encased in a crisp crust.  Win!  The chips?  Excessively large, like fried baked potatoes.  They are fluffy and delicate in the middle.  Feminine chips!  A good, vegetal but sweet mushy peas complete the dish.

The Sheppard pie, Americanized.  The addition of beef to the traditional lamb mellows flavor.  The dish is no longer rustic and earthy.  The fat and grease (hey, its flavor) in the stew is gone.  It's been  replaced with a buttery potato crust.  Either way, it goes to your butt.  Tasty yes, but it leaves you yearning.

The pork belly roll is total pork heaven although much less fatty than the British counterpart.  Served simply in its own jus with roasted carrots and pea pure.  Done.

Finally, the beef short rib and cheek sandwich; TRY THIS!  Juicy, tender short rib is combined with the sweet goodness of braised beef cheeks.  Served on sourdough, accented by the very earthy flavors from the horseradish aioli, roasted pepper jam and onion marmalade. Win!

Passable selection of British beers that share space with butt wiper and the like.  High Vegas resort prices.

The dining space is contemporary with a Disneyland feel.  It's a pub by décor not by the vibe of the guest you expect from a crowded, boisterous, friendly pub.  

If you're wearing a t-shirt that says "I love Las Vegas" go right on in.  This is your kind of place.Food was 4 stars, service a paltry 1 star. I ate lightly, just a bowl of English Onion soup which was fantastic and a side of the mac & cheese which was above average, but not the best I've ever had. Main problem was the service. Even though we had 3 different servers waiting on us, they were all incompetent. Splitting a bill 3 ways shouldn't take 30 minutes which it took for them because they kept screwing it up. Improve the service and you might be looking at a 4 star restaurant.Good location but needs better signage for sure... came here during HH, nice $5 wine list, the worst calamari plate I've ever had... it was basically a plate of deep fried bread crumbs with nothing in & way too much olive oil drizzled on the veggies.
Ordered some pasta from the dinner menu... super blend, didn't even finish 1/3 of the plate. Nice, cozy place tho, just don't come here with an empty stomach.Definitely heard great things! Decided to check it out. To my surprise.. It wasn't as good as people had said. Fries were SUPER salty.. And not
To mention the burger as well. Ordered the jalapeño poppers and surprise surprise
ALL of them had seeds in them! (Only one Is suppose to have seeds according to what the server told us). They did get our drink order wrong but we were approached by the manager which was concerned about our experience. Overall, good place. But I've had better.I think it was a good burger, but as is the case for all restaurants in LV, way overpriced. Given all the new burger places popping up around the country, its just not worth it. Shake Shack is better, cheaper, and more fun. But when in Vegas, you have little choice. Service was quick and pleasant.Saturday brunch is around $45 with fees.  For $45 in vegas the food better be special.  While the selection is vast and the service is excellent, the food wasn't as good as I expected.  
The good:  the fried chicken, prime rib and lobster bisque were great.  The gelato was also very, very good.   

The bad:  the sushi was tastless and dry, the Chinese offerings seemed to be over heated, maybe warmed up too long because no one was eating it.  Eggs benedict was dry the muffin tough.

The ugly:  the snow crab is served both steamed and chilled (nice) but the crab pieces were very scrawny, a really skinny legs without much meat.  I haven't ever seen such skinny offerings ever at a buffet.

Special note: there is a selection of all you can drink alcoholic beverages(beer /wine) but if you don't drink a lot it's a non-benefit.

Overall, not worth the $45 price point.  Something in the mid to low $30s would have been reasonable, even cutting out the alcohol. It might be a fair deal for a weekday lunch.Got the berry mimosa...yummm...and the wolfpack with goat cheese, eggs ever easy and country gravy...seriously delicious. Huge portions so be prepared to share! Cute diner feel and the staff was very friendly :) Will need to come back to sample the rest of the menu!Nice option in the area for light, quick meal options. Portions are on the small side while they don't skimp on the price. Taste is unremarkable but the ingredients seem quite fresh.The music outside is loud and plays constantly it finally stopped late in the night. Bed is clean, linens are white, with down alternative filling. Not centralized air, unit in the room functions well though. Tub/shower has shelves for your products. For the most part, at this time, most of the decisions and furniture are old from the Imperial Palace era. But there is obvious construction happening throughout the hotel/casino. I have high hopes for vast improvements. The signs within the resort to find valet, are confusing and the staff further exacerbated the confusion because they too, didn't know where the valet was. Check in line was long and slow. Took 40 minutes to get a room key card. For now, until the re-vamp is done, I give this place a 6.5/10. But it was a very affordable rate on NASCAR weekend. (I didn't attend that)Hmmm, this one is difficult, parts impressed, parts just fell flat, descent burger, not so good fries, not a place I would go out of my way for.I tried the Longhorn Steakhouse for the first time recently and had a very uneven experience. Being a steakhouse you would think the steaks would be their strong point, but instead it was their weakness.

First off I will say the service was excellent. Very attentive waiter, the manager came by to check on us (although he did so before we got our food) and the hostess was very nice and accommodating as well.

For an appetizer we had the Wild West Shrimp. It was stellar! Deep fried popcorn shrimp with sliced banana peppers and garlic served with homemade ranch dressing. Definitely the highlight of the meal!

My dinner came with a salad that was nothing special, but definitely not bad. I wasn't there for a side salad though and it was perfectly acceptable.

For dinner I ordered the bacon wrapped filet and asked for it to be cooked medium. It came medium rare, bordering on rare. It was also the second worst cut of filet that I have ever had (the worst coming on a cruise ship). It was chewy and had two big strings of gristle. 

For dessert I had the s'mores brownie which was very good.

So basically, go there for appetizers and dessert and skip the steak.

Oh, but they do make their own steak sauce at your table that was quite good. Too bad the steak sucked.i bought a Groupon to check out this eatery. it is very close to my house. we ordered: Eggplant rolitini w/angel hair and cream sauce, "Big Tuna" Sub Sandwich with onion rings, and Calzone with mushrooms, blk olives, onions,&bell pepper mix. total : $33.50 w/tax.the eggplant rolitini is not the best. very rubbery,stuffed with ricotta cheese, smothered in red sauce to mask the blandness. the angel hair with cream sauce is edible.the Calzone is about the size of a folded Pizza Hut personal pizza. the ingredients inside were plenty and very good. it is good;but, not the best. Sicily's Pizza on Durango has the biggest(12" !!) and best Veggie Calzones . the "Big Tuna" did not really have much tuna salad in it at all to warrant "Big Tuna".  it was mostly bread. the winner was the onion rings that came with the sub... WOW!! the onion rings were HUGE, very smoothly dipped in beer battery, and fried to a gorgeous and crunchy golden brown . it is straight up exactly the onion rings i used to get from a local Brooklyn pizza joint. it was a large serving too. i love that! no joke , the rings were so big, i could have worn it as a bracelet. they were not soggy at all. whomever is cooking it knew what they were doing. the restaurant is very clean, great atmosphere, nicely furnished, and very welcoming. i would come back for the onion rings.My wife and I visited Iceberg Drive Inn for the first time and I did not love it.  We both ordered milk shakes and Iceberg offers "thick" milkshakes.  I did not realize that "thick" meant ice cream in a cup.  I commented to my wife that, when you serve a milk shake without a straw there is a fundamental problem.

The "regular" milkshake that I ordered was gigantic and I would not have ordered one that large had I known it would not be a drink.  My wife ordered a "mini" and it came out the exact same size as my regular.  We clarified that they had given her a mini and they said that it was.  Her cup was red and mine was blue and her cup was about half-an-inch shorter than mine - but, like I said, her ice cream was as tall as mine so I felt like a chump for paying more.

My chocolate milkshake didn't have much flavor.  I love chocolate milk and when I ordered the shake I was really looking forward to a good chocolaty shake, but it was really just cold with a hint of chocolate.

Iceberg Drive Inn wasn't a bad experience, it just wasn't good enough for me to go back to.Went there for lunch during a week day.  The place was pretty empty.  While the restaurant was dressed to the 9's, it didn't give off confident vibes about serving good cuisine.  Restaurant looked more like a night club than a restaurant. Waitress didn't know what I was talking about when I ordered a hefeweizen.  Once I received my beer in a tiny glass, I asked for a lemon wedge (I know people, should be oranges but I was trying not to be too difficult), the waitress looked at me like I asked for a chicken leg to garnish my beer.  She served me the lemon wedge on a soggy napkin.  Not inspiring too much confidence.  I ordered the edamame and chicken wings.  Edamame came in a tiny portion and was way too greasy. Chicken wings was good but not spicy enough.  My friend ordered the sliders and they were the size of quarters.  I heard the mahi mahi was really good and tried to order it but was told they ran out (which I'm not sure how since the restaurant was empty).  But I shall go back once they have their act more together.  Need to go back to check out the cool indoor/outdoor bar.  Hopefully they'll increase their menu items and more people will find out about the place.It seems like every restaurant and bar concept has been tried at this location but nothing has ever stuck for one reason or another.  This building has been several different bars, several different restaurants, and most recently a Dillon's BBQ restaurant.  Will the newest concept stick?  Well, if it does, they'll need to improve on the quality of the food in my opinion.

My brother and I came here by chance while driving north on Central Avenue.  The place bumps right up against the canal midway between Northern and Dunlap.  The namesake is very much geared toward the many bikers and runners who traverse the historic Murphy Bridle Path from Bethany Home road to where the Path ends right here.  They even give discounts to folks to ride their bike here instead of their cars.  Great way to get patrons in the door.

The interior is pretty roomy (bordering on cavernous) with booths against the wall, a bar, and tables in the middle.  The patio in the back is right up against the canal on one side and Central Ave on the other.  There were flat screen TVs at every booth tuned to football so we went with a booth.

None of the main entrees appealed to me at the time so I actually went with the sausage and soft pretzel platter.  I love sausage and I love pretzels, so why not.  It was served with two different Schreiner's sausages, two small pretzel rolls, a cheese dip and potatoes.  The sausages were very good, though I was disappointed with the portion sizes.  The platter is meant to serve two but I easily took the sausages myself as the portion size was relatively small.  The potatoes I got with the platter were also super dry and tasted like they'd been stuck under a heat lamp for awhile.  The cheese dip was pretty good and was a decent compliment to the pretzel rolls, but not necessarily the sausages.

Overall, the place was sort of meh.  The food was acceptable, but didn't wow me.  The vibe of the restaurant didn't excite me, though this place would work very well as a place to watch the NFL on Sundays with all the TVs they have in there.  And I like the concept of catering to the neighborhood bridle path crowd.  But if my dish was any indication of the rest of their menu, they should focus their improvement efforts on the food.Before I placed my order, I asked the girl at the register what Greens and Proteins specialties are and she said make your own plate, and the BBQ chicken pizza. I decided on the pizza. 

My order came about 20 min later maybe even a bit longer which I think is too long for a fast casual restaurant. When I took the first bite of the pizza all I could taste was the BBQ sauce. While the BBQ sauce did grow on me after a few bites, I almost thought it tasted a little too unique. Additionally, if a "traditional" BBQ sauce is not used, the menu should specify the type of BBQ sauce being used (citrus BBQ sauce). Now on to the chicken, I did not like the spice on the chicken and it was a little dry. The positives were that the pizza is low calorie so you can finish the whole thing; the fat free ranch is delicious; the lavash bread gave the pizza a nice crunch.

Towards the end of my meal, I called over the manager to give him some feedback. While I appreciated him sitting down with me and having an open conversation, I did not like the fact that he said normally I would offer a refund but in this case I don't think we did anything wrong. I wasn't asking for a refund just offering my honest feedback. 

Overall, I like the concept of the restaurant and I am willing to come back to try more items on the menu.Take the East's love of hearty Americanized Italian, merge it with the Midwest's love of even heartier portions of meat and potatoes and you have Detroit's Joe Vicari's.  Get ready to mix it up and eat!

Located in the D in DTLV, it delivers a Strip like experience at off Strip prices.

Straight to it, starters.  The giant meatball is very good.  Huge, flavorful, juicy, topped with a tart ricotta and swimming in a acidic tomato sauce.  The carpaccio (everyday shaved beef topped with arugula, an excess of Parmesan and tangy mustard vinaigrette), OK.  The calamari, crisp on the outside, tender on the inside also just OK.

Next up, salads.  The caprese is as fresh and vibrant as any but it's a non Italian salad that steels the show. The table side Caesar is excellent.  Coddled egg, anchovies, freshly grated Parmesan; a classic.

It's not Italian without pasta. All freshly made in house.  The Pappardelle with veal ragu is excellent.  Flavorful and tasting like hours of low simmering created it.  

The main event, meat.  Standard steakhouse cuts.  Decently trimmed, with a mild 30 day dry aged flavor. A tomahawk and porterhouse were well seared, slightly over temp, tender, with only the lightest bleu cheese, nutty flavor.  OK naked but when paired with Detroit's famed Zip Sauce (a concoction of butter, mustard, garlic, Worcestershire sauce, thyme, rosemary, and cayenne), the flavors of the steak explode.

Standard steakhouse sides.  Good, simply grilled asparagus or roasted potatoes.  

OK wine list.  Focus on Italy.  Prices are fair.  Good service but lacking the energy you would expect from an Italian eatery.

A welcome addition to town.A review for parents with tweens and who may be beer drinkers. First of all they don't have beer. Which is fine, it really is, if you are going for your kids. We took our boys 9 & 12 and their friends for the 12 year old's birthday. We didn't hold the party there we just went after a movie, dinner and cake. I think the boys had fun. We bought a card for each boy with maybe five attractions and $3 worth of game that came to about $15 each. The boys could use the bumper cars, laser tag, laser maze, and the jungle gym (they were too old). They liked the laser tag but said Stratum was better. They enjoyed the bumper cars but only chose to do it once. They did the laser maze more than once, they could go in together and it was a challenge. The only problem was the confusion getting in. They use their card to access the attractions if the attendant moved, like went to go flirt with the girls at the counter which he did every chance he got, the kids would walk up and swipe their card and try and get in. The attendant would notice get them out but then they were out an attraction. Our birthday boy did this, we had he card refilled but the girl didn't do enough and it was a hassle. They have high school kids working everything and need more adults or better training. 

They have good games about $1 or more each play and you get tickets to get cheap toys like at Peter Piper etc. 

All in all, it was a good experience and very pretty by the bowling alley, looks exactly like a cool bar without the booze. Lots of tv's, places to sit, bowling lanes and a coffee shop. It's nice but fairly  pricey for an hour of fun for the kids. I want them to succeed just because they are local folks but they need something else to get us there more often.Preface:  my mother is from Louisiana and I spent much time all over the state growing up and later as an adult.  I LOVE and actively seek out Cajun cuisine where ever I go.
I visited this establishment while in the area for business.  I looked up some reviews and decided to give it a try.

I ordered catfish and red beans w rice.  The fish looked great but was very tough and chewy.   Had a good taste but weird texture.
I did not care for the red beans as they were watery and had little spice.
I may come again to try the gumbo but not anytime soon.I was definitely excited to try this place for a girls dinner party. When I arrived, I was greater by (who I assume) was the manager. Very friendly and helped me find my group. Once I sat down, it was nearly impossible to get a drink order in since all had already done so. Finally when we ordered din, I got a drink too. Our table had two waiters, which was confusing. You'd think by having two we'd have prompt service. Not the case. Wrong order, app brought out early when it was asked to be an entree, again took for ever to get my second drink... Oh and my entree came 15 minutes after everyone else's even though we ordered together. We asked twice about it... Then it popped up. They offered to spilt our checks, which was nice (we were prepared to pay cash). And when we got out checks, half were messed up. Then one of the waiters accused two of us for not paying for our drinks... When we explained they were on others tabs and we straightened it out, he never apologized. I realize group outings can be difficult for restaurants but we were a considerably easy table with a lot of blunders. Service, 2 stars (with the exception of the initial greeter/manager?)

I ordered the red sangria which was great! Tastes like grape juice, much sweeter than your average sangria. So may be a no-go for some. And the baja fish tacos with chips. A fresh mango salsa topping the tacos was definitely above par! My food was a solid 4.5 stars. 

I'll return but most likely will hit the bar area.Wife and I dined last night.  Server was horrible.. saved only by the outstanding sushi chefs.  Had they not been as attentive, available, and enthusiastic as they were I would have left 2 stars.

The  food:  

Outlaw Roll: Horrible. tastes like cardboard.

GOOD:

Jalepeno Tail:  AWESOME!!! no rice on this one., fresh fish (forgot what exactly and I don't see it on the online menu), layered over fesh avacado,  pickled jalepeno and more.  SURPRISINGLY good.  I would come back for this and I consider myself a sushi snob.
Hamachi Kama FREAKING AWESOME!!!   Baked Hamachi Collar.  Well seasoned, nice garnish of roe atop. Large portion. FREAKING AWESOME and an great value.  I suggest a side of rice with this one. I'll be back for this one too.


My first visit at Sushi Brokers Scottsdale years ago was less than pleasing.  I would return for the two dishes above for sure. 

Bad:

Service: As mentioned our server two thumbs down. After taking my wifes drink order he disappeared.   Dropped off the glass of wine 10 minutes later and was gone again.  I had to put the order in with the sushi chefs otherwise it would have been another 10 minutes till he reappeared.  I had to wave him down behind the counter to order a beer.  Only showed up again once we were done.   I would've tipped him 5% but I don;t think two wrongs make a right si I left the standard 20%.   I tipped the Sushi Chefs 20$, had they not been so attentive our experience would have been intolerable.  So that's a 50% tip total out of fairness.    Our server spent way too much time behind the counter lollygagging, looking confused with nothing to do. 

We could have spent a lot more..How: .Had he asked about the Jalepeno Tail and listened to our delight he would have had a window to suggest another dish.   Had he come by sooner and noticed my wifes glass of wine empty we would have ordered another one.. seems reasonable considering I had a Huge bottle of Orion in front of me.. I ended up sharing it with my wife at the end.  Common sense serving goes a long way.. not only does it make a better experience but makes more $ for both the servers and the house.  Our bill was 53$ PRIOR to the extra 30$ combined tip.  We could have easily spent twice that had he taken initiative and been somewhat attentive.

One more suggestion: Management:  That mirror in th elongated middle corner behind the Sushi station, it reflects into the area ABOVE the station.  Since exposed tot eh diners it would be a good idea to at least have it functionally organized or fill it up and merchandise it so at least it looks esthetically pleasing.This is another 3.5 star situation for me. But because of a few things, it just feels more like a 3 than a 4. 

My girlfriend and I went here for their happy hour (3-7 daily), and since I love margaritas and very infrequently get them, I was excited about their margarita on happy hour. We got there and we ordered a margarita, a daiquiri, the quesadilla, and the nachos. 

On the happy hour menu, they have a bunch of apps which looked good, but we were sticking to cheap and the nachos and quesadillas were listed as 3.99. 

My margarita was... Bad. It was a house margarita, and weirdly enough I had the exact same experience at a NYC restaurant with their happy hour margarita. It tasted like toilet cleaner. I guess when they pre mix a huge batch for happy hour, it's easy to mess it up. I told the bartender and he switched it out immediately, I don't know if it was because it was good service or because this happens a lot. I barely finished my sentence and he was making me a new fresh one. 

The quesadillas were very very good, and we had agreed to get chicken on it instead of just cheese. I figured ok. At 3.99 we could take the upcharge for chicken right? Well unfortunately he failed to mention that by adding chicken it was no longer the happy hour menu item, so it was $7 dollars. Not a big deal, but was expecting a little bit less. 

The nachos were... Very bland. They had way to much bean on it and it honestly canceled out the cheese taste. It was covered with cheese but you barely tasted it, and nachos without cheesiness are a waste IMO. 

Overall, I liked my second margarita a lot, the daiquiri was pretty good, and the quesadilla was delicious. The manager also checked with us as did the bartender multiple times to make sure things were OK, so clearly they care about service. However, with that bad first margarita and very mediocre nachos, I just can't give this place a four at the moment. Will go back to try again!Kinda scared our first time...Wednesday night at 8pm, only 2 people when we walked in.  Great fish, chips and hush puppies. Onion rings too.  Fries were the bomb,  fresh cut,  great seasoning! We sat at the bar; the bartender was great.  Felt like high school with the 80's music playing.  Reasonable prices. Not sure about the guy/employee/mgr at hostess station wearing gym shorts. I recommend some sort of uniform for the staff...even just matching tshirt...oh and no gym shorts. :-/  However,  we will go back for Friday night fish fry... all you can eat.  Worth a try.Just moved here from Colo Spgs and had been to the Big Fat Greek there many times, it was one of our favorites. We always ordered the Big meat platter. We were disappointed when we came here and the items were different than what we were used to and also the portion size was also smaller. They hook you up In Colo Spgs, CO location, It was good, just not what were used to from our past experiences at MY BIG FAT GREEK. Service was good, restaurant was nice and clean. We may return for items that cant be found at a normal greek cafe, but found another yummy place if you want a juicy delicious gyro sandwich, Phoenicia is delicious!!This is more of a 3.5 for me at this point, but could bump it up in the future. I've been coming here on Tuesday nights which is open mic night. The service is friendly and there are a surprising number of people there for a Tuesday night. Kind of an older crowd. Most of the bands play classic rock, which I can get into. So the open mic night is fun and adds to the atmosphere so that is more of the 4-star-I'm-a-fan category, and I'd like to see what the place is like on the weekend too, so I'll be back. And it's a unique bar and hangout for the neighborhood so it gets points there.

The beer and food is more in the 3-star-A-OK category. I've tried a few different beers and all were pretty good but nothing to write home about. Their beers can't compete with the other more established local breweries like Four Peaks or San Tan, at least not yet. North Mountain seems to rotate out their beers so I could see them eventually brewing up a beer that become their signature just like Kiltlifter is for Four Peaks. 

I only got food this last time I was there. I had a grilled chicken sandwich. As my friends even pointed out, the chicken breast on my sandwich was quite small. The chipotle mayo didn't have much of a kick, and I could have done without the bacon jam. I had overlooked the jam when I ordered the sandwich so next time I'll know to ask them to hold that, but I don't really get that condiment when you already have chipotle mayo. And if you want bacon, then you can just order actual bacon and not bacon in jam form, amirght? All that aside it really wasn't a bad grilled chix, and I will add that my friend liked her french onion soup very much.Great food..... Ridiculous prices.....i cant in my right mind fork over 30.00 for 2 adults to eat at a fast food joint.
Sorry 5 guys..... I'm out and eating elsewhere ..Overhyped in my opinion. I understand this part of the strip has been pretty dead and they've been trying to bring some life back into this part of town but they could have spent a bit more time looking at other clubs and seeing how they could have one upped them. 

Went pre-opening weekend to see Hardwell and it was awesome. Lights and sound were awesome along with the endless amount of confetti. That air thingy though sucks. I mean I can barely feel it.

Went a bit early to get in and that took forever. I mean it was SLOW and after I went in, it was still empty. Stairs weren't was bad as Marquee but dark enough for a drunk person to eat it. Dance floors are a bit bigger which is nice. Did I mention there's a large abundance of restrooms?

I'll be back depending on DJ and because of my friends but this place lacked a lot of things such as an open area to sit down. I mean other clubs offer crappy seating but at least that's something instead of nothing. Tables aren't really going to cut it especially when you can't even sell out all the tables. Oh did I mention drinks are bit pricier here?This place was pretty standard for a night club, I thought. There were some impressive pros and some major NOs. 

First $110 for male entry - wtf? Who would pay that? Thank god we were on the list because there's no way I would ever dish up that kinda cash. 

We went into the lounge part of the club, which was nice and not overly loud. We could hear our group talking and we had a nice time. The bartenders (at the bar) in this  section were SUPER professional. He realized that we were a large group and introduced himself by name. Unlike other Vegas nightclub bartenders, he actually seemed to care that we were there spending $20/drink. Nice touch. 

My friend and I took a tour of the rest of the  club and it was impressive in a lose-yourself-in-a-sea-of-flesh/noise/smoke sorta way. Each level had a different feel and vibe... Pretty cool.We went in for a light dinner and drinks. So ok, the food was ok. Nothing to write home about but i enjoyed my meal. Price of the burger was fair. 

Drinks.....Ummm $7 for a beer. RIDICULOUS. I will never be back just on the principle. Any owner that thinks it is ok to charge $7 for a beer doesn't deserve my business. Good bye.This Monta is slightly bigger than the one on Spring Mountain, and seems to have a bit more items on their menu (They have pork bao! I might try that next time). However, the taste/flavor of their ramen doesn't meet my expectations after being a regular at Monta Spring Mountain. 

Don't get me wrong, it was still good, but not great. I would've given this place 4 stars... but, during my quest to devour all the ramen, i bit into something hard. Upon further inspection, it seemed to be a wood chip? It was dark brown in color, so it couldn't have come from my chopsticks (your typical wooden tan disposable chopsticks). My best guess is it was from a wooden ladle when they were dishing out the broth? I guess I shall never know. It was towards the end of my meal, so I just left it as is.Overall food was tasty.  Fish and chips were fried nicely.  Two portions of fish were tasty if a bit small.  Mahi over rice again was tasty and nciely grilled.  Over all prices are a little high for lunch.  It was basically $24 for 2 for lunch.  

Were it's a little strange is the setup.  You walk up to the front counter order your food and pay at the register.  Then you sit down and they bring you the food, but it's not a waiter/waitress setup.  So it's a little confusing if you tip or not.  They say it's not necessary but you almost feel like you should tip because of the way they have it setup, but if you've already paid for the food by credit card, and have no cash, then what?

Over all, food was tasty, but a little pricey and there's the situation above.  Will come back again, but probably not as often.For them jus opening up I expect for them to be busy. I didn't have to wait to long. But the thing that disappointed me was that cut back on the plate size. I figured that they probably was doing that cause maybe they had limited supply and  wanted to make sure they were able to feed everybody. I don't know, but that kinda disappointed me. Cause I been 2 several locations and this is the first. Overall the food was still great, but i just hope they go back to their regular portion sizes. Like getting a bowl of Gnocci soup with no chicken or dumplings lol Really!"You eat your Gyros at a gas station?"

Yes I do, but only because of the outdoor seating.The Place is a nice place. Joe and I visited here last Saturday afternoon for a quick drink. I had a glass of prosecco and he had a JD and diet coke, both were nice and fairly reasonably priced.

Reasons why I like it include: table service, lots of nice and comfy seats, fairly decent cocktail menu (if a little pricey).

However, it is lacking a bit of atmosphere and the food menu doesn't contain anything special that makes me want to go back and eat there.

It is a pleasant location for a drink.Parking is horrendous. Here they are sitting on countless acres of empty desert scrub land and some genius has devised a parking lot so needlessly complex it is a maze of one-way streets.  Ridiculous considering there is nothing but the casino for miles in any direction.  WTF?Wing's up is a very solid option for Wings in Waterloo, they have a number of different flavours to choose from and different options for how they prepare the wings. They do have other menu options but lets me honest, who goes to a place called Wings Up and orders a wrap?  The fries however are very good; crispy potato wedges seasoned to perfection.  My only complaint are the take-out containers,  they use a very cheap cardboard container with printed graphics on the outside.  It is kind of like wrapping your chicken wings in a freshly printed magazine, the wings heat up the cardboard and soak into it leaving you with a cancerous smelling, soggy box when you get home.   I'd recommend pouring the contents of the take-out box onto a plate as soon as possible.  Another concern is the price, a pound of wings and fries runs about $15.  Which at a nice sit-down restaurant makes sense, but at a take-out place It is hard to justify. Other than that, great wings.At the end of the day I think I would have liked this place better if I would have stopped in for HH...or brunch...or a weeknight...or w/just a few friends. Basically, I just think coming here w/14 other girls on a Saturday night for a bachelorette party, although super fun, is also kind of a chore. 

I really do like the place itself. It's a really big area, and I like that the bar wraps around like a square and that there's plenty of bartenders. If dancing's your thing the dance floor seems pretty big as well.

Like I said, we came for a bachelorette party, and although I didn't personally take care of any of the details, there were a couple small snafus. First, when we called to book a table (this I was actually present for) we were told that we didn't "have" to get bottle service, but would probably have to pay some sort of minimum on drinks. They would contact my friend who personally spoke to someone "soon" to go over the details. It took somebody a couple weeks to get back to her, but when they did they did inform her we would in fact have to get the "minimum" bottle service. Honestly, it really wasn't that big a deal. Like I said, there was 14 of us, and the minimum bottle service was $200 (we got Grey Goose), plus they would throw in a round of shots. 

We got the table for 10 o'clock. However, when we showed up we were told we didn't have it until 10:45. Again, I didn't personally take care of this detail, but they did scramble to get us a table ASAP (it took about 20 min). 

Overall, we had no major issues, and I thought this place was fun. When we left the line to get in was around the corner, and if I were to just randomly come here on a Saturday night I don't think waiting in a long line to get in would be worth it. 

I'd like to come back sometime to try the taps at the tables.This Auntie Anne's is located inside the food court at Red Rock Station. It opened a few months back and received some good reviews so hubby and I stopped by to try for ourselves. For a tiny pretzel shop they had a a nice variety of things on the menu, including vegan-friendly options. 

When it comes to pretzels they offer the following:
Plain
Garlic
Jalapeno
Cinnamon Sugar
Pepperoni
Raisin
Sesame
Sweet Almond
Honey Whole Grain
Sour Cream and Onion

Pretzel Stix and Pretzel Nuggets come either salted or in cinnamon sugar. They also have Pretzel Dogs that come in sizes mini, regular and jumbo.

Dipping Sauces:
Cheese 
Melted Cheese 
Hot Salsa Cheese
Marinara
Caramel 
Sweet Mustard
Light Cream Cheese
Sweet Glaze

I ordered a "Sour Cream and Onion" and "Jalapeno" pretzel. They were priced at $3.49 each. I also ordered 2 melted cheese dips priced at 75 cents each. The cashier was very friendly and they had samples out on the counter. One thing I did like is the cashier asked if I wanted my pretzels salted or unsalted. I don't like salt on my pretzel and some places have it already on the pretzel and I get stuck picking it off, at least here I had the option to have it with or without. The sour cream and onion pretzel was just ok. It wasn't as soft and warm like I'm used to and it could have used more of the sour cream and onion on it. The jalapeno pretzel was pretty good, but again on the dry side. They weren't stingy with the jalapenos which was nice, but it seemed like the pretzel wasn't as fresh as it could have been. The melted cheese dip wasn't melted at all. I think she gave me the regular cheese dips instead. I didn't mind the regular cheese dip however the cheese being warm would have been more to my liking. Since I get coupons for Auntie Anne's I will be back, but I can't see paying full price again if it isn't going to be hot and fresher.Great selection but their fees make the guns WAY overpriced.  They charge 12% on top of the price you win the bid for then you pay taxes on everything.  I am not sure why people keep bidding on these guns when you can sometimes buy them new for less.  The place here is huge and if you do not come to inspect a day early you can miss your chance to bid since the line to pay the $200 deposit to bid is long....then you have to collect your $200 at the end if you don't buy and I am sure that line is long also. They sell almost everything here and you can bid online also if you don't mind paying 20% fee on top of your bid price....you getting the picture yet?  I think Sierra does a great job with what they are dealing with but I would save the trip.I had heard and read about how great this place was. Reality didn't match the hype. I had the calamari. It was okay and for $9, I expected a larger portion. The cod tacos were okay as well. A little too much breading. I will say the clam chowder was very good. My son had the fish and chips. He really liked it. Overall experience was okay; food was average and service was good. Id go back and try it again, but it is a bit over hyped.Much lower than the competition.   Friendly customer service.

We had the sweet chili chicken wrap for $3.99 (without the meal) and 2 apple pies which were on sale for $1.

This is the best option at this food court.  Everything else is so overpriced.Service is too slow!!! It seems that the manager it's the only one working. 
Food and drinks are good.Like Mike said affordable bbq. I got two generously piled sandwiches on toasted hamburger buns and a side for $5.50. This is designed to feed the masses not a bbq lovers dream. 
It wasn't bad and I would go in again but I did not fall in Luv with Luv me Tender. I ordered the beef brisket and pulled pork. Two classic bbq sandwiches so I was more than happy with the price. The problem is the meat though good quality(not excessively fatty or greasy) didnt have a lot of flavor. The bbq sauce on the table tasted like grocery store generic brand product. Mike M. below said more sauces existed but I was in a rush assumed it was a house sauce and it would be pretty good. It took a goof 10-15 minutes for my food. No one else was inside and you ordered at a sliding window similar to Filbertos. So if you live in a dale or  farEast Valley dont drive here for it but if you are nearby give it a chance.  

The potatoes was also a decent sized portion and no complaints. Not exactly bbq style...it was more au gratin vibe with garlic. 

oh yeah they are closed sunday and tuesday. open till about 7 most nights. no fountain drinks visible but possibly behind the sliding window. owned by same people as long wongs. in the same parking lot. much smaller than long wongs. Possibly swamp cooler type cooling. not traditional a/c Tables could seat15-20 at most.BEER is great here. Tons of selection so you never get bored. The service is great on some nights but on some nights it sucks. Unless you sit at the bar. Food is actually pretty good for being a bar. Also, Alicia worst server NA.The Harrahs is not bad, but there are much better hotels on the strip for much better rates. The Casino is relatively old and needs partly some renovation. 
The machines pay good, I hab some luck. There's a pool on the roof of the second level.They say to try everything once right?  Finally made it over to Sweets Raku with a few of my buddies to check out what the "red carpet" out front was all about.  First off, I like the decor of the place.  You are immediately greeted by a wall of wine, which looks fantastic peering in from the outside, and a few pieces of novel art work on the wall (and in the bathroom.. very neat) that sets the tone of the evening: relaxed and inviting.  It was a little warm for my taste but they were baking stuff right in front of you so I quickly disregarded.

Now, the food.  I like the concept of the menu in that once you order off of it, you can eat it.  They even provide some dipping sauce (raspberry on this occasion, I believe) for you to dip and munch.  Pretty cool in my book.  Opted for a cheese place because we came from an edomae place before we hit up sweets and I wasn't ready to grub anything too big.  Also divulged in a few glasses Sav Blanc to keep the party going and for pairing purposes as well.  Not too shabby and the cheese plate was a pretty good way to keep me at bay over casual conversation.  The part I liked most about the cheese plate actually wasn't the cheese.. it was the spiced pastry sticks that came with it.  I would've just snacked on that for the evening if I could order just that!  Easily the highlight of the culinary venture here.  I also tasted some pistachio ice cream, mango and yuzu marshmallows, and a little bit of the Red Rock cake to get in on a few of the flavors that they had to offer.  Everything was alright but nothing to write home (or Yelp) about.  I definitely liked the fact that it wasn't super sweet as I am not really a fan of overly sweet desserts, but, again, it was an ok experience with nothing that really stood out.

Service was good and I liked the fact that I can see the staff divvy up some dishes right in front of me.  I think the prices are reasonable and probably worth the experience but with everything factored in, I just wasn't feeling it.  Note: I'm a bit more partial to the other "face" of Raku around the corner but just couldn't hang with this place.  Probably would bring my wife to try it out and see if she would like it but it's just not enough to coax me back for any other outings.Think of it as a Taco Bell that serves beer. Had the cheese enchiladas, not bad at all. Rice was meh, beans okay. Service at the counter was friendly. Atmosphere much cooler than the Bell.i tried three times at this restaurant, the short ribs noodle soup is pretty good.  but today, i tried again, the soup base changed, noodle feels not the same as i previous had, and the short ribs..is tough.  hope it could keep up with the quality of the food...it is unique in town..More like A-NOT ok! I 'm sorry to see another business has closed in this area and another persons dream crushed. The owner was so excited and proud of her product and new venture when she first took my order. I was impressed that this young lady was able to start a business in this tough economy. It was evident she poured her heart and soul into it.

When I did my initial review, it wasnt a glowing one. I came in the second time around,  the owner obviously knew who I was and she couldn't look me in the eye, she clearly was hurt. I kinda felt bad cause there were a lot of negative reviews. But the review I did was constructive criticism for the most part. Cant speak for the others. 

She did listen to her customers, I was pleasantly surprised with all the changes she made. I was happy to update my review to reflect the improvements.  But I guess you cant please everybody. I noticed a sign last week that advertised they sold tacos and made a mental note to swing by and give it a try. When I drove up  the lights were out and the place is closed for good. How sad. Now all I can picture was that hurt look she had. I never would wish that on anyone. My best wishes and good luck on your future ventures Angelica and your sweet abuela too.it's just ok ,  wait so longCame out for a intimate gathering of friends night out and decided to come to this new spot for drinks and bar food. 

I split chicarron bulaklak and sisig with a few people. The chicarron was decent, but I prefer smaller cuts so you get better crisp to the fatty center ratio. The sisig is fairly decent. I think maybe we should have ordered a bit differently only because it was greasy pork bits overload, specially since I was just at a taco crawl event earlier. 

They had live entertainment, a band and a DJ during their intermissions. There is a stage if you want to dance. My biggest complaint was the volume. We left after a bit because we could not hold any conversation. I tried and ended up a bit hoarse and gave up. There is a happy medium as I've been to bar hangouts where a seat in the back meant you can have both. Most of the people really into it anyways will be dancing, right in front of the band so you don't need it to blare. 

Just a note that they offer happy hour specials daily of 50% off appetizers and $5 drink specials (7-10pm) but do not while there is live entertainment. You may want to call and ask if you're coming there for happy hour on a weekend. 

It's not a bad Filipino bar though. It's typical vibe of the bar-staurants in Philippines.Nice hotel and very clean interior. Staff were polite and professional.

Main problem was that the walls were paper thin, you could easily hear conversation in the next room easily!!!

Otherwise, a solid choice.I wish Yelp didn't have a rating system.  Heritage Tavern is an excellent establishment, but for me personally it was just okay.  Maybe I just wasn't feeling the atmosphere.  

I went there as a four top and despite having made reservations, there was some wait for our table.  Their bar was super crowded, which made standing around holding onto our coats and not bumping into people super awkward.  I found the bartenders incredibly attentive though.  Despite the crowded bar, one of the bartenders saw us enter the bar area and immediately made eye contact and asked if we wanted drink menus, despite us not being right up at the bar.  

Their drinks were yummy and well made.  

Unfortunately, the dining area was also small and crowded and it took some work to get seated and around the waiters.  It was also too loud for me as I had trouble hearing my fellow diners across the table.  

We had the deviled eggs, charcuterie, pork belly with tuna sashimi, grilled octopus salad, ribeye, and whitefish.  We shared everything so we were able to sample lots of different things.  We enjoyed the creativity with the deviled eggs, but we found the eggs themselves rubbery.  The charcuterie was good but I prefer Osteria Papavero's charcuterie plate.  My fellow diners loved the wagyu ribeye best, but I personally perferred the sweet and saltiness of the pork belly.  I found the tuna sashimi with the pork belly unnecessary though and would've preferred they made the pork belly a larger portion and made it into an entree dish. 

In summary, it was evident there was care and attention to each dish, but there just wasn't anything in particular that made a strong impression on me.We came here for dinner about 6pm. The place was pretty easy to find. It's in the hood so becareful. When we arrived, we were the only costumer. The place was very warm and cozy. They had a karaoke system so I'm guessing they get down on certain nights. Plus the place was clean.  I went ahead and order the tonkatsu shoryu ramen bowl. It came with corn, bamboo shoots, pork, eggs and green onions. The food came out at a decent time. The soup was good. But the ramen noodles remind me of top ramen. Like a side we were the only costumer inside and out waiter didn't come by once to see how were doing. We had to wave her down when we were finished. Hmm not sure if I'll be back. But I like to give a second try.Have tried this place twice, probably won't return until they work out the kinks. The menu in the wall is big so you can't miss it. The problem is that it's only a part of what they offer. Their REAL menu is on the counter by the cash register and if you're lucky you'll notice it on your own because they don't draw your attention to it. There was only one counter menu and when I asked for another I was given an 'old' menu with different prices and food choices. What?

It took way too long to get our food and it wasn't hot when it finally arrived. The owners  seem not interested to correct these easily correctable situations.I came here for two reasons: 1. As a great addition to the coffee tour of Phoenix! and 2. because I had time to kill in scottsdale. I really didn't think it was anything special (sorry guys!). I know they roast their own coffee, which is nice, but the coffee was very ordinary. It was fine, but nothing spectacular. Additionally, they have only one size of coffee in mugs (I wanted 16 oz, but could only get 12 unless I wanted a to-go cup... odd). The atmosphere was fine and the owner (possibly?) said they have karaoke, which is kind of neat. Seating inside is a little limited, but I easily got a spot at the window bar. If I were in the neighborhood, I would consider going back, but I think Press is a better choice for the area, and several downtown coffee bars would beat it hands down. Anyway, it was ok, but I won't be rushing back.This place is mediocre but Downtown, it's the perfect little spot to grab a treat and people watch! The set up is your normal fro-yo type of place. Lots of flavors, that you can sample. The toppings bar is generous. The night I went in, there was one girl basically just sitting there reading a magazine, but it's not like you really need a lot of service. They are open until 11 pm which is great if you are Downtown for late dinner or movie! Cute new place, I hope it stays for a while.Just ok. Ambiance..3. Prices...3. Burger...3. Fries...4. Service...4. Parking...5. Coleslaw...4.

No kobe or Angus burger available. 
First time at this restaurant just ok not much to rave about or complain about. Will be about 5th on our list of good burger places. May visit again but prob. not anytime soon.This place is ok, not great, and I'm afraid does not set itself apart from the other great burger places in the Valley. First off, the good: almost everything we ordered was tasty, from the calamari to the burgers to the milkshakes. Good selection of wine and draft beer. Overall we thought the food and drink was about what we expected at this price point. Now, the not so good: it feels like this place opened a few weeks before it was ready. Hosts and service were harried, disorganized, a little confused about the menu, and though they appeared to be trying their best they left something to be desired. The kitchen doesn't seem to get the menu yet, as more often than not the food that came did not match the description. 

And finally, the biggest issue: the space. Other reviewers called the atmosphere nice, or trendy, or classy. We do not get that at all. The space is a very cheap makeover from the previous tenant McCormick & Schmicks. It kind of feels like it was thrown together with little regard for how the room flows or atmosphere. There's no music or what is being played is too low for the cavernous space and loud diners. Frankly, it seems like a fake restaurant built for a commercial where they "surprise" diners with a menu item being switched with something downmarket (e.g. "see what diners said when we switched notorious burgers for Carl's Jr's Six Dollar Burger"). Throw in a mafia "theme" that has you ordering food using infamous mobsters' names and it just seems cheesy for a place where you're looking at $25-30 per person for an a la carte meal with a drink.

Overall, while there were some service/kitchen problems and the atmosphere was non-existent, the food was good enough thst we'd give the place another shot in a couple months and see if the kinks have been worked out.

UPDATE: after posting this review I received a message from the owner asking about my complaints about the atmosphere and and asking if I was in his shoes, what changes would address the issues I raised. I told him what I thought, and who knows if the suggestions will go anywhere. But I do have to respect a business that listens to feedback, good or bad. I'm definitely going back and I hope when I do, I can add a star or two.I am writing only because I do like the atmposphere and any patio in AZ is beautiful.  The problem with the patio setting and being at a brewery, is the want to drink!  The beers are about $7.00 each so you can imagine the bill after a few drinks.  When drinking great beer, you naturally want great food.  The food was not worth the prices at all!  I got a chicken ceasar salad ($10) and the chicken was cubed and cold (yuk!) and the dressing was not ceasar, it was cilantrol something, and there was no parmesan shavings as described, and no croutons!  How is that a ceasar?!  Also, the burger as described was cooked medium-well and was described as being 80% chuck, 20% pork shoulder.  It tasted frozen, looked frozen, and might as well had been frozen because it was cold when I got it!  

My bill of 4 guests was over $100.00 I will not be going back!  It wasn't worth it after the overpriced atmosphere.Pro- service was good. Athena omelet was very good. Seasoned potatoes were ok. A little too salty for me.
Con- Decor is cold. Not hip diner vibe they may have been trying for. The AC was not working too well that day.As someone that lived in the NYC area for many years my "bar" for good pizza is very high!  

I found the pizza to be good.  The slices are very large and the sausage was good Italian sausage. 

I actually enjoyed their buffalo wings the most .  Slightly crispy and not drowned in too much sauce.   You have a choice of ranch or blue cheese dressing which isn't always the case in AZ.Decided to give this place a try and I honestly left without the most important thing.. a full stomach. This was my first time going here and I ordered 3 pounds of crawfish which were 10.99/pound. I ordered two of the Hot N Juicy flavors and 1 pound of Louisiana. The crawfish were large and it was messy and everything I thought when it came to eating them. Only one of my bags had a piece of corn while the other two pounds just had crawfish. I ate them the traditional way where I ate the tail meat and sucked the heads. I ordered butter which was 1 dollar extra. The problem I guess I have is the amount of meat that come from crawfish and the amount of money that will be spent on the amount it takes at least me to get "full" is not worth the price of admission. Other than that the main thing the crawfish were actually good and you come for those.. so give it a try .. but make sure you get those bags filled with more corn.Only ramen place in the University of Waterloo. their ramen is a bit expensive but their takoyaki was definitely overpriced. I had the shoyu ramen and I enjoyed the taste. I liked their takoyaki but I personally dont think it was worth the price.

I didnt like going in the winter time because some tables were right beside the door and a lot of cold air would go through.Great concept, and pretty good seafood. 
We tried the Clams, Shrimp, and crawfish - added in some sausage as well.
We got 2 different seasonings and both were very good
Shrimp were LARGE and definitely worth the money.
Clams / razor clams were also VERY good.
Crawfish, were borderline Med Rare, the tails were cooked but the tiny claws were a little underdone.. 

Next trip will be Shim n Clams only, and maybe try a Po'boy... 

This place is WORTH the $$  
You figure, 11 bucks for Shrimp,, Go to the local grocery store or LeeLee and you are paying 11.99 a pound, RAW.... and again, Its Seafood... Will definitely be backMy friends and I have had a chance to eat through the entire menu. If 3.5 stars were available, I'd surely award that many to Bootleggers. 

Bootleggers would have done a heckuva lot better had they NOT included some rather large chunks of fat in their pulled pork servings. On the other hand, their brisket presents well, nice smoke ring and good bark on the outside. I'm still confused by the warm tortillas served with the pulled pork. That said, both these meats are somewhat bland with no sauce offered to flavor things up 

The Bacon Board is a nice hook and a pleasant appetizer. But, the REAL reason to eat at Bootleggers is their St Louis-style ribs. Succulent, moist and meat-falling-off-the-bone good, these ribs present well with a discernible smoke ring and real nice rub. They compete favorable with Bobby-Q and Pork On A Fork. The Apple Pie Moonshine deserves an honorable mention.

The service for our visits was excellent and the prices were reasonable.Really slow service, despite lots of servers standing around. Burgers were ok, but better at the Public HouseHad lunch today while a car show was going on. Ordered soup and sandwich. Soup of the day was chili, which was very good. The grilled cheese (which was supposed to be on Texas Toast) was not. Came out plain, a small half sandwich with blah cheese. No presentation. The topper was they charged us 4.25 for a bottle of Bud. No  bar in Ftn. hills charges that much. Might give them one more try-but will hesitate to have a drink.Let's begin with addressing that Panda is NOT a Cirque show. Imagine going to Circus Circus and watching one those every 15-to-the-hour shows they have upstairs in the arcade area, however, much more advanced and 90 minutes of it. 

Yes-the Panda costumes were not the best but every other costume in this show was great. The decor, sound effects, and lighting was phenomenal. The theatre was small, comfy and nice. The performs kept the crowd entertained and some of the stunts have you at the edge of your seat. 

With the exception of a couple scenes, this show was fun and exciting. Great show for kids! Perhaps this act would do better at a different casino, not Palazzo. Maybe Luxor, Excalibur or Circus Circus would be a better home for them?...

Anyone debating on going, should go. People have high expectations of this because of where it's located and have tainted the show but it's actually a cool/ cute act. See it before it's gone!Maybe I had my hopes too high going into this place due to the glowing reviews, but this place was just ok to me. We got there right at 11 when they open and there was a hefty line. Why is the line so long and moves so slowly? The owner individually cuts meat for each person...this is nice and all... but maybe during the summer he may want to consider streamlining the process? Just a thought. And yes, the owner's dad was charming and took us on the tour of the smoker... which we enjoyed, but caused a little stress as our spots in line inched towards the door... we had been waiting in the heat for a long time and didn't want to lose our spot. Anyway, we made it back to our spots as we entered the door. Great. We sampled the brisket.. it was very tasty and tender. Get up to the counter... Our plan was that we would get a 2 meat plate and a sandwich to share with our two meats being the brisket and the (special) beef short rib. Ordered and was informed that the beef short rib didn't come on the plates.... umm, maybe you should disclose this prior? Maybe I missed it, I dunno. The owner said 'Look how big this is, it can't go on the plate!' I guess, but most of its bulk was the bone... the actual amount of meat was not that large. Regardless, we ended up getting the two meat plate with pork rib and brisket (sides: grits and beans), the pulled pork Jefe sandwich (pulled pork, sausage, pickles... we got it without slaw), and a beef short rib (that's why we came, right?). The total? 40$! Whoa... that's some expensive BBQ. Some of the food was very good and others did not live up to expectation. The short rib was good, but had a bit of a burnt flavor. The pork ribs were pretty boring... no sauce... the sauce they have on the table was not very flavorful and the meat didn't fall off the bone... kind of a meh dish. The brisket was good, as previously stated, very tender, but a bit peppery. The grits were gluey and not spicy enough for being billed as 'jalapeno' and the beans were nothing special either. The sandwich was the stand out dish. The pulled pork was very good, I didn't love the sausage, but the pork and the pickles with some sauce made for a tasty sandwich. I don't know that I would be back anytime soon, but if I did, I would get the pork sandwich and be done. 

PS I ate so much meat at this place, I'm pretty sure I got the meat sweats, so be careful! Haha. 

Happy eating Yelpers!

PPS - I got this response from the owner here, which I think is really awesome. Nice to know some owners can look at their business and make small changes to improve! Thanks Scott!

'Thanks for coming in to check out our little barbecue place and for posting a Yelp review. I'll be honest, three stars isn't what I like to see but after reading your review I get it and we are going to change a few things. This week we are going to make sure that it's easy to see on the menu that the beef rib isn't included with the plate. I wish we could add them to the plates but my cost on each one is around $12. I'm also going to tweak my cooking method tonight to hopefully not have them get that burnt taste. For some reason, they took forever to cook and I think it dried out the meat a little and gave them too much smoke.  Right now we have tons of people ordering very large orders right when we open and the line stands still while that happens. We are adding another smoker in the next two months and will advertise that we take bulk meat to go orders for pick up prior to open. Our hope is that it will alleviate the wait when we are putting together those orders. I'm sorry about the grits, every now and then they get a little dry and become gummy. We now have a little cup of water nearby to make sure that that doesn't happen.  

Once again, thanks for coming in and thanks for your input. It has been beneficial.'We walk past here almost everyday on the way to play poker and it seems strange that it would only be open until 3pm considering the amount of people currently at this location. Finally we got to try it on a day off! 

The portion sizes are huge, I guess for the price of the meals they should be. I ordered the Andy's special which was melted cheese with scrambled egg, fried chicken, bacon spinach, tomato, biscuit on griddled potato mash thing and chipotle cream on the side. Oh and a wedge of watermelon and a strawberry. When It arrived at the table I thought they had brought the wrong thing over it was that huge. I attempted to dismantle it so I could start eating it but it was piled up so high the fried chicken fell off the top and knocked my full large glass of orange juice over onto my meal. I think the orange juice actually helped the potato thing because that was pretty dry. I still managed to get through most of it (except the biscuit and potato..trying to watch my waistline hahaha). It was all just ok. Not overly tasty not overly anything.. Just big and edible... 

The service was good as well. The lady replaced my OJ. 

Everyone else's meals were pretty much the same.. Nothing wrong with it just nothing fabulous.. Yet to find a decent breakfast place in Vegas!!! 
Would I come back here? Only if I was desperate..I first heard of this place on the news.  As a retro gamer myself, I had to check it out.

The place is a Super Mario Bros. theme'd restaurant.  They have TVs mainly for Super Mario Bros games but I did see some Sega Genesis consoles that had NBA JAM playing.  Me and my nephew stuck around to play Smash Bros on the Wii.  

The staff was cool and friendly.  They helped us out in deciding what we would like to have.  We ended up getting their special of Pizza and Wings.

The restaurant screams nostalgia.  They have tons of choices of what to play while you wait for your food.

When the food came in.... 

The wings were ok.  We ordered the BBQ sauce on top and it tasted normal, just like any hole in the wall restaurant with a deep fryer and the ability to put sauce on their food.  The wings were crisp and cooked but nothing special.

The pizza however wasn't up to par to what I expected.  The dough was still white and the ingredients did taste like it came straight out of a grocery store brand can.  It's not terrible food however in a place like this, I expected a different recipe or exclusive taste.  Without the concept of video games and geek culture surrounding the tables, its just another pizza spot.

The place is still a new establishment so I can't be too harsh with a review.  They are still cool people and have lots of room for improvement.  Can't wait to see what lies ahead in the future of this business.Corporate... Juice... PIMPS!!! 
I lurve me some corporate pimp juice! I've been a fan of Jamba's juices for quite a few years... but over time, I had forgotten about the joys of Jamba until my sister (Reylynne W.) We went and I got something with oranges and strawberries in it... i unno what it had... but damnit it was good! :) Nice, clean and fresh, I loved every thick sip. :)We stopped here because the kids really wanted pizza before going on the high roller. The food itself was good, I just think it was overpriced for what it was. Being locals I could not honestly see ourselves making an effort to come back but to be honest we are probably not the crowd they are after.Went there on opening day but too busy and too long of a line and we left.

Today my husband bought me some chocolate mousse, brownie and crumble bun. 

Chocolate mousse was divine but @ $10/pc, it was a little hefty,

Brownie was moist and super cholatey- $5 
Crumble is about $4

Overall, great tasting pastries but a little too high on the price which is expected specially from Carlos bakery. It was all divine, would definitely indulge once in a while! 

Cute place and a must see bakery, lots of different pastries to choose from!I have been wanting to try this place out for awhile. So went here with a few friends. I ordered the sashimi tacos. Its basically 4 mini tacos from the appetizers. They were good but just needed a little bit more flavor. I thought if they added 1 more taco then it would be worth spending $14 for it. The sashimi was fresh and the shells are a soft crisp. They broke apart pretty easily. Also tried the chicken wraps. Its only enough for 3 people. They give you only 3 pieces of lettuce and assorted chicken. Its ground chicken, skewered chicken and chicken egg rolls. My friends had a regular burger and and a turkey burger. Both dishes came with 3 or 4 assorted fries. It had good sized portions.

For a drink, I got the Java Guava. Really good. It had a little spice to it. It came with a jalapeno on the side. Dessert, we ordered a simple mint chocolate chip ice cream with oreos. Nothing too special. It was just drizzled in fudge and oreos. Also a good portion. Its enough for 3-4 people.

Overall, its an ok place. The location of the restaurant is facing the street. It also has outdoor seating. So people watching can be interesting.Just average to okay food.  I would agree with a previous reviewer who said the place is noisy due its construction and layout.  The fries were not that great and mostly small and stubby.  I'm neither impressed nor do I care about the whole "local" foods aspect about this place.  I want a good burger and just because the beef is local doesn't mean its the best.  

Oh and one last suggestion:  they had four television sets, three of which had a soccer game and one which had the Brewers game. If you want to keep it local, put the Brewers baseball game on most of the TVs and leave the soccer for the late night ESPN 3 crowd.Ordered food to go...crab puffs (or whatever they call them...in any event when I got home I ended up with egg rolls...or whatever they call them).  Also ordered pad thai and yellow curry.

Egg rolls were ok.  Although I would have liked to have got what I ordered (crab puffs).

Pad thai was good.  Not overly sweet like others I've had.  The curry was also good.  I asked for both dishes mild.  Unlike most thai places I've been to, mild actually means mild.  There was a time I could eat spicy food, but that time has passed, so actually getting mild when you order mild is a good thing.I have been to Squeeze once, and my initial impression is that it's something that will work well in the Linq strip of shops and eateries. You can get fresh squeezed juices and smoothies made from fresh fruits and vegetables while you wait.. and to many of them you can add a little bit of booze if you like. ...from my perspective, it's just a little bit of booze. 

I really like the concept of this place, though.. and they also offer gluten free products including baked items and sandwiches. That's a nice feature that people think they want these days. All sandwiches and salads and whatnot that I noticed were $8+ before tax. All 4 drinks we ordered were $14 each . that's allot for cocktails and juices, even on the strip. 

That included a small green smoothie I ordered called  "the cleanse," to which I had Hendricks Cucumber Gin added.. it was good... But pricey for what it was. Green tasting, lots of un-pureed bits.. which I actually didn't mind at first, but then chewing my drink became interfering of actually drinking the smoothie. Tons of ice too.. so it was a little watered  down tasting. 

I actually give it 3.5 stars, because the concept is good and I think it'll do descent business, being located where it is. However, $14 is waaaay too much for a smoothie that's 12-16 oz. .. and honestly I think the recipes need some tweaking. 

I'll be back to check it out again soon, I'm sure! Happy Eating to you !WEnt to get takeout.
They forgot to put my meal in the bag.
When I discovered this later, they offered to replace and refund, so kudos for that, but
the cake was flavorless.
PROS:
samosas had a good flavor, seemed to be possible homemade.
Meal had good flavor too, 

will give them another chance
