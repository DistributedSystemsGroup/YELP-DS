I think some of the best Chinese food in Madison.  A little pricey but a few dishes always feeds me for at least two additional meals.Louisianne's has seared it's place inside of my restaurant experience. The food is so good, that every time my girlfriend and I consider going to any other restuarant, we would have to consider the huge opportunity cost of not going to Louisianne's.

The place is dungeon-esque, but not in a bad way. It's dimly lit, underground, but often times has a pianist setting the New Orleans mood.

The food is incredible. Every time we go there we try to get something different, and we're floored by how good the meals are, and how much of it you get. The appetizers were delicious (we've had the platter for two, and the pulled pork crepes), the soup we've had with our entrees were amazing each time, with an intense flavor.

Their specials change every time we've been there, and if they don't interest you, their regular menu is always exceptional. We've had the roasted shrimp, the tasso and shrimp fettucine, the maple-cured duck, the steak, the seafood au gratin, and each time not only did we get one delicious meal, but enough to have an amazing lunch the next day.

The only con I can give Louisianne's is that they give you so much good food that you can never get to the desserts. This restaurant is the one that my girlfriend and I benchmark all other restaurants by, and before we go out to eat anywhere else, we have to strongly consider the consequences of NOT going to Louisianne's.Great old-school barber shop. I'm in and out in 20 minutes and the price is right. Ka and Lisa both do a great job every time.B.E.S.T. brunch in Madison. 
Brunch at airport  - "huh" right? Right.

The restaurant is located with in the Wisconsin Aviation building, which is across the field from where the commercial flights are housed.  You can eat the fantastic food while plane watch for your pleasure. If you haven't been here already, you're missing out - A. Lot. 

The airy pancakes that I ordered were fluffy, and really the best I've had in Madison. It sounds like a "guilty pleasure," but the pancakes are truly airy that it doesn't feel heavy on the stomach after clearing the plate. The three eggs omelet was equally spectacular. Plus the solid cordial service seals the 5-stars deal.

The scene is a clean diner, but as my friend put it, "it's an actual diner with good food, and not like the other wanna-bes." Absolutely correct. And there's no need to do too much flare on the decor when they got the fantastic view of the private planes against the blue sky. I will be back for more for sure! Maybe a sunset dinner for the next time?First of all, this is Culvers.  I love the mushroom and swiss burger, delicious, I crave it and I am not a fast food person!   They custards are to die for and I am glad that I do not live by a culvers because I would probably try to eat there every day!  I love their food, service has always been great here!I've been taking my car here since moving to Phoenix a year ago.  Three things really stand out about this shop:
1. Everyone is professional and very nice.  That's not a given at every auto shop.
2. Honest service - Several times, I've asked them to look at something and to do the service only if it needs it (for example, if my car's manual suggests something at a certain mileage).  Many shops would just take the opportunity to do the service and charge you.  However, Virginia Auto has come back to me several times and said that things look fine now and that they'll check it again at my next oil change.  
3. Burgie will give you a ride back to your work/home!If you are looking for local culture, this is it. As a recent transplant to Phoenix, I really enjoyed my visit to the museum and learned a lot about the local Native American cultures. This is also a must visit when people visit you in Phoenix. What I especially love about this museum is that it presents the Native American cultures as living, breathing peoples and not in a museum/"under glass" sort of manner. There is a lot of information here, and it is presented clearly and coherently.I'm not familiar with the theater, but this was a really nice experience for me and my family. The stage is kind of small and intimate, but the balcony is really roomy and nice. The exterior is really pretty and old and full of character.I was extremely happy with my meal here.  The salsa with the chips was nicely spicy.  I had the shrimp and octopus a la Diavolo.  The Diavolo sauce was delicious and also spicy in a different way than the salsa for the chips.  I was given a large flour tortilla and couldn't resist dipping and redipping.  The sides of salad (standard shredded lettuce, etc., but very fresh and crunchy), rice and refried beans were substantial.  After the chips, main course, salad rice and tortilla I couldn't do more than scratch the surface of the refried beans.  

I was equally happy with the atmosphere and service.  I showed up near 1pm on Sunday as a single diner.  Most of the other people were family groups, many apparently regulars.  I was nonetheless given a decent table normally seating four after the promised 10-15 minute wait and no sense of being rushed or treated differently by any of the staff.  Next time I'm in Phoenix I will be eager to come back (bringing family and/or friends) and have the same thing again and/or explore the rest of the menu.Ever just want excellent Mexican food for your party, just like Mama used to make but without the days of preparation and cooking?  We ordered from Comedor's catering menu:  green chicken enchiladas, chicken flautas (substitution of their tacos) and rice for our Halloween party.  Surprisingly, Comedor also included a quart size of guacamole, salsa, sour cream and two big bags of tortilla chips.  Prices were extremely reasonable and the food was amazing!  I'm not a big green chili fan but I am now!  Chunks of fresh green chili on the enchiladas and boy, were the enchiladas plump full of chicken!  

I've decided that I'll never slave over a kitchen stove to prep for a party or get together.  El Comedor's catering menu saved me tons of time and headache AND it was extremely affordable.  I got to enjoy our party and everyone couldn't say enough great things about the food!First time here, and I devoured the teriyaki chicken plate w/spring rolls! SO MUCH FOOD -- and I only ordered the lunch special! It could have easily fed two people, but if it is that good, why share? I love places like this. Simple restaurant specializing in something they do best, and this is the place to come for teriyaki. My food arrived at my patio table in less than 10 minutes. The salad had a delicious citrusy/sesame tasting dressing that mixed well with the rice and chicken. Chicken was so tender, and the teriyaki was neither too sweet or salty! Perfect taste. Since I like super spicy food, my only regret was not squirting Sriracha sauce all over it. However, I didn't realize that until AFTER I was half way done with my meal. It was so flavorful my spicy craving didn't even kick in I was way too full to continue on. 

Good for lunch or early dinner since this place closes early. Drive-up window if you are in a rush!First time today!  What was I thinking and why did I wait so long to head down here?  Seriously, $16.99 (with coupon) for a hand wash of SUV, glass cleaned, mats cleaned, vacuum and tire dressing!  It was busy, hot and the wait was long, but totally worth it!  I usually wash and detail my vehicles myself, but just couldn't get to it this weekend.  Anytime I can't wash my own vehicles, I'm bringing them to Los Olivos.  And, the employees are so nice...bonus!Went to go see the Grand Canyon IMAX show.  It was so good!  3D and everything.  I keep telling all my friends to go check it out!We used to have a membership here, and we loved it then. We would bring the kids, and although they don't have a TON of stuff for little ones, it was a very happy medium for us fact-hungry parents. We had passes and would bring friends with us all the time who loved it.

We went again, just the two of us, for the Yelp event. And it was amazing. I loved the little hands on exhibit that they had, and the way they have the exhibits set up is just so perfect. We are now DYING to try out the bike ride, cable thing. And the planetarium is just... breathtaking. Loved it. The staff is always great, and they are so knowledgeable!

The one downside is that not only are they kinda pricey for the whole family, but then they charge for the extra exhibits on top of it. If me and my little family of 4 wanted to check out everything, it would easily cost us a hundred bucks. 

But even with that, the planetarium and staff pull my rating all the way up to 5 stars. You can see the prices online, and it's not geared to very small children. But if you want something specifically for them, try the children's museum. All in all, what a great addition to our blossoming city!Van Gogh Alive...amazing!  This was such a great way to view Van Gogh's art and be immersed in the music of that time.  $25 is a lot for an art exhibit, but upon leaving I felt it was entirely worth it.  I hope this is a trend to view other artist's work.My absolutely most favorite-est place for lunch.  I'm not really into wraps - so that's not what I eat here.  But it's the best Greek salad (get it with chicken) I have ever had, and when I worked down there, I used to get it 2-3 times per week, split it in half, and have the second half for lunch the next day. Oh, and the other thing.... I am WAY picky about chicken. I usually end up picking off half the chicken from any salad, because I'm a purist.  If you're anything like me, you'll have no problem here.  Not to mention, this is the only place I know that carries Zevia - soft drinks made with the herb stevia - no sugar, no artificial MS, cancer-causing crapola.This place rocks!! It's all about empowering women...non-profit service all about women..check it out!This big, busy, authentic, smoky, banged up place is a combination bakery, meat market, grocery, deli, & restaurant!  The restaurant serves ala carte items as well as breakfast, lunch & dinner combinations from an extensive menu up over the counter.  On top of that, I asked them to customize my meal, & it was no problemo.

You order & pay at the counter, & they call you when it's ready for you to take to the table of your choice in their big, comfortable dining room.  I asked them to make me up a combination plate with a chile relleno, a beef tamale, plus beans & rice.  They also offered me flour or corn tortillas, & I chose corn.  

Pretty soon my number was called, & here they gave me FIVE roasting hot tortillas wrapped up in aluminum foil!  You help yourself to the salsa bar, & I had the salsa verde, which was so good I didn't even sample any of the others.  In fact, everything was terrific, & the whole meal was amazingly inexpensive at $6.48!

If you want a place that "looks clean", this isn't that.  If you want generous portions of really good Mexican food, hop in your Chivy & whip over here ahorita!  This place has tons of character, & the food is very, very good!If I could give Dr. Stock and his staff 10 stars, I would.  Dr. Stock at the Dobson location is professional, knowledgeable, thorough, compassionate, and spends a great deal of time with his patients.  His staff including Lynn, and ultrasound technician, Mary, are so kind and attentive.  If your child has a heart defect, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend Dr. Stock.  We have the utmost confidence in him.I live a couple blocks from this place and I would literally eat here every day if I could afford to.  Though I'd probably end up with a few extra pounds to go with my empty bank account.  But every day when they post their daily special up on their Facebook page, I just sit and drool over it.  I've eaten here a handful of times and everything is so freaking good.  Its comfort food at its best.  And the staff is super friendly and helpful.  They treat you like a regular even if its your first time.  I love the fact that they source all their ingredients from local farmers and purveyors.  I initially thought the prices were a bit on the high side, but once I realized just how well the locally sourced ingredients were prepared, I now feel like its a bargain.  And I also love that they are open until midnight every day (except Monday).  This is just the coolest little place to grab some great food, a good drink, and chill with really friendly people.  I hope this place is around for a very long time.This place is awesome.
The Traditional restaurant as well as the deli style restaurant inside.
The assortment of food items is amazing, too many good things to choose from. And the prices are great.
It is a great experience, if you like Mexican food you must go and check it out. This is the closest thing to Mexico without being there. 
After eating it is great to explore the rich colors and products in the market.
And don't forget the Sunday brunch with tons of choices and lots of traditional entertainment.I went here yesterday which was fantastic! These markets are huge and the inside is ridiculously fun! 
So I am just going to do a recap on my experience.
*Great prices on authentic products, the cheese counter was insane as was the meat counter!
*The agua counter was really fun and I did love the horchata!
*The area to eat lunch was fun I enjoyed my street tacos and the al pastor tacos were amazing! Yummy plus very inexpensive seriously!
*The bakery well lets just say I just kept staring at it wishing I could have it but I splurged on the tacos and horchata! Though my daughter loved it! :)
*Hehehe I saw a cow's head and it was amazing---kind of creepy but let me just say I want to try cabeza now!
*Jewelry!

Oh gosh there is everything this is a fun place to go especially if you are wanting to try to find some key ingredients to create a great authentic Mexican meal!  Will definitely go again next time I need to take my fiance and son so they can experience it as well!

Definitely a must go in Phoenix it is unique and very large.great place and atmosphere, great ice cream and malts.I was kind of turned off when I pulled into the parking lot, but I decided to try this place after researching and it got amazing reviews on Yelp and other websites.  Although the outside is a little unappealing, the food was so so so good!  The salsa was very spicy, and tastey!  I would definately go back for some good Mexican seafood!We love this restaurant!  The food is simply too wonderful to describe.  Our goal is to sample every item on the menu.  They all sound wonderful.  If you love seafood prepared with style and imagination, you should check out this place.LOVE this place. The balance of quality, quantity and cost is perfected. This particular Mariscos location is a great date spot. It is right off the freeway, and very close to Cityscape for a night out. The interior is very colorful. Every once in a while you can even catch a mariachi band playing some live music.I had NO idea there were THAT many varieties of cactus!

This is a great place to go during the day, when you are awaiting for your red eye flight back to the East Coast, you won't see anything like it east of I-95!

Tips:

1. Try to go as early as you can, before the full desert sun comes out. 

2. Bring water, a hat or an umbrella (parasol)..it gets hot (see #1)
 
3. Admission is $18, and an AAA discount is available.

4. Bring a camera!Five star, times more stars.  

I visited during the Spring bloom.  This is officially the next check on my bucket list for seeing Unbelievable Floral Displays of the Natural World.  

Footpaths were wide and plant specimens were well marked and tended.  Outside, a triad of Chihuly glass greets visitors.  http://www.blurb.com/b/4224563-scottsdale-arizona-april-2013

I could have spent another day exploring, but time was short.  The Garden was rich with visting huming birds, lizards, and other footed friends.  

At $18 PP, entry pricing is comparable to other horticultural sites around the country.  It certainly goes to the good cause of preserving and protecting regional flora.The Chihuly Exhibit was simply beautiful and amazing! I have never seen anything like it. Thank you for the opportunity to see such great beauty!I must start by saying I only order from this place and have never sat down to eat, but I have been here several times. So if you are looking for a service review you won;t find it here, this is simply on the food itself.

I love this pizza. It is one of my favorite pizzas in town. They are not close to me but I always make the drive to get it. What I love the most about it is the crust. I am a chewy yet crispy kind or crust gal. I love the chewyness of the crust. I love to get a side of ranch and a side of the hot wing sause and dip this pizza in. Mmmmm my mouth is watering just writing this. The wings are damn good too. I always get the hot cause I like the hot ones. They are fried not baked and taste oh so good. I have also had the bbq ones and they are tasty as well.Costco is a magical place. You can prepare for armagedan, buy a hotdog, or get a case of red vines, all in one place. Some sad uninformed people think Costco and Sam's Club are the same, but for the initiated, we know that is like saying Disneyland, and the State Fair are the same. Yikes.

You really cannot go wrong with Costco. I love buying everything here, because their customer service is so strong. If something goes wrong with a product, you simply return it. Done. Have you tried that at BestBuy? Holy shit, it's easier to escape Alcatraz then deal with those blue shirted nimrods.

Costco also has some cool online exclusives, where you can buy patio furnature, food, you name it. Check it out, and enjoy.I love, love, love AJ's!!! Jason, the bakery manager, is a miracle worker! He made the perfect cake for my mom's 60th birthday party! We ordered a carrot cake with REAL cream cheese frosting and walnuts with blue & yellow writing and little sugar butterflies. And GLITTER!!! Yah, they have eatable glitter! And my mom the pickiest person I have ever met loved it! All I can conclude from this is that Jason must be an angel because I still cant figure out how to please my mom but Jason did it with just one cake! Anything I needed Jason was there like our own personal cake concierge. I would absolutely order from them again.

They also have Barb's Bakery cookies and Tammie Coe Cupcakes. I love that they support local small businesses. They are a little pricey but everything you get in return is well worth it!

P.S. Did I mention the cake was amazing? The absolute moistest carrot cake I have ever had and the cream cheese frosting... I mean it was real homemade cream cheese frosting not from a plastic tub. Sooooo yummy! I still dream about it... Yes, I know I have a problem.Super nice staff, very cute decor.  A hip, cool place.  Not too crowded at lunchGreat service, quick, and friendly. One of the audio techs at Frys Electronics recommended this place to me. My car iPod adapter stopped working and I needed to get it fixed so I stopped by Frys one day. One of the techs told me that they only did installs so he couldn't fix the adapter for me. However, he did recommend this place to me. I went there and I can't remember the kids name but he was a young guy who worked there. He fixed my iPod in a matter of minutes. He said that all somehow the adapter was disconnected and it just needed to be plugged back in at no charge. I gave him some cash anyway for his honesty and great service. I will be back for any future audio needs. This place is highly recommended!I haven't had any problems with the office staff or the docs. They've all been quite prompt which is hard for a lot of docs to accomplish. I see Dr.Spieker and have seen a NP Kim a few times and they've been fine. I go for pregnancy care. I've always thought the office looked nice. 
They are often pretty terrible at keeping the bathroom stocked with urine cups, those cleaning wipes, and TP... Annoying for a place that makes you give them a urine sample every time!
I have friends who have seen the other 2 docs and they liked them and recommended all 3. (They're all women docs.)
Yes it is on ~12th St & Osborn; I'm not sure if the map on yelp is for another location or an old location but be careful! 
The building is not well-marked from the Osborn side so go a bit early the 1st time.How can I not give them 5 stars? How? I ask you how people? I mean, these people MAKE candy. Blocks from my house. Lots of parking. Clean. Clean. Clean. You could make smores on their floor. Wow, that even rhymes. I'm thinking bumper sticker here people. Create your own box. With the nicest of nice ladies to help you. I mean really, they have to be amped up on sugar. What else is their to nibble on? Great service. Great candy. Great location. But where was the See's Candy professional to slap that 14th piece of candy out of my hand last night as I slipped into my my milk chocolate coma on my 600 thread count sheets, nearly drowning in my 1/2 inch pool of drool? I don't care. Five stars. Five stars I say!So yummy & so fast! House special chicken & orange chicken are my favorites. Plus they use all white chicken breasts. I love that "spicy" dishes can be ordered a little more mild; satisfies the entire lunch group dining together.Great service, delicous food, wish I had found it sooner :)I love the local brew scene in Phoenix, it has grown so much over the last couple of years. SunUp is right in the middle of it all. With a wonderful selection of beers brewed right on property its really hard to go wrong. If you not sure which one to get you can always try a sampler and pick any 4. The food is really good as well, I have already tried the Shepherd Pie and the Kobe burger, both were really good. You can go for happy hour and get any appetizer for $5.00. Like beer and good food, I would definitely recommend this place!My very first visit to AZ Ayesha took me to Oreganos for some pizza and a beer after we hiked up and down a Mountain. It seemed like a good way to reward ourselves for the hard work.  As I prepared to return for a quick valentimes whistle stop return, my one request was to sit outside again in the warmth of the desert and drink a beer at Oreganos.

I didn't quite get my wish, as we decided on dinner rather than lunch, and at that point it was even too cold to sit outside for this Michigander.  But all that melted away as we ordered the Picasso.  A finer, tastier deep dish pizza you will never have.  Not Chicago, not anywhere. Yes it takes 45 minutes, but we were surrounded with fantastic company and drinking delicious beers, so the wait flew by.

So while I normally eschew the chains, I make a large exception for this local AZ wonder.  Can't wait to return Oreganos - next time we dine al fresco.I must say an absolute gem. Love the assorted menu, from Japanese to Italian.

The waitress was very attentive and friendly. 

I definitely recommend the shrimp tempura for appetizer. Crispy and tender, the sauce to accompany, exquisite.

I would recommend this to anyone who loves great tasting international cuisine.Amazing chicken parm. I was told by my Brother i need to try it. I was hesitant at first because its a Japanese rest. It is fantastic. I have ordered it 2-3 times a week for past month. I am as picky as they get with Italian food. Good Italian food. Was born and raised in NYC and found this to be some of the best chicken parm in AZ. Portion is filling especially for $12.This is THE place to go. Always busy, lunch or dinner, and their food is always superior. I've eaten here many times and I'm never disappointed. Their sushi is wonderful (I wish you guys would serve halibut!!) and their noodles are out of this world. Love the soba, chicken Parmesan, and especially the Salmon Cream Sauce.

Looking upon the menu, a newcomer would think that the owners are crazy; this place offers cuisine from Thailand, Korea, Japan...and ITALY...but they do it well. I cannot rave enough about their kitchen and the guys scurrying like madmen at the grill. Bravo.

Bravo goes out to Yuka, who is the real star of the show. She's a fantastic server. After knowing her for a couple of years, she now greets me with a hug and an ever-present loud and genuinely warm greeting. 

I will never tire of this place. Cherry Blossom Noodle Cafe sets the bar high and keeps it there.Love the food, prices and service although sometimes slow during busy times but worth the wait.Im always bringing everyone here!! I love it so much I highly recommend rainbow roll and crunchy rolls
Happy hour is a great time to try new things and great deals
They have more than just sushiLove this place.  Been going for over 10 years.  Heart-centered yoga taught by heart-centered teachers.  It's a spiritual place for me as well as a place for me to work my body and mind.  Mary Beth, as owner, walks her talk and is as genuine as they come.  Mary has an excellent kids class that my little ones absolutely love.  Evon's prenatal rocks.  Ellen's Saturday morning is an inspiration.Back to wearing glasses after 11 years and all I have to say is "Thank You" to Central Phoenix Eye Care. You made the experience the best possible. And Dr. Stephanie Mastores is incredible. I can see clearly now and am looking fashionable as well. This is the only optometrist I will ever recommend. Thanks again and Go Buckeyes!!Our car needed an oil change... and then, suddenly, the air would only blow warm.  Never good in June!  We made the mistake of taking it to the VW dealership, and was told that the relay (whatever that is...) needed to be replaced and that it would cost me $360.  Ugh.

Soooo... the Husband (much more knowledgeable about car stuff) gave Precision Imports a call.  They told him to bring the car in to them and they'd make sure it was less.  No kidding!! They got the work done asap, and only charged us $125.   Savings of OVER $200!  Now, THAT is good service!  They just made loyal customers out of us... no more dealerships for our car!If your looking for a import mechanic in central phoenix talk to Frank. He will always tell you how it is and give you a fair price and they will leave you feeling all warm and fuzzy inside after leaving. You can't say that about any other mechanic in the valley.

Thanks again guys!
-TonyJust had carry out from these guys but DANG! If I had to rate Pizza in Phoenix, I would go 1. Pizza Bianca 2. Pizza Heaven. Yes, its that good in my opinion.This place was, in a word, AWESOME. For those who don't know, one of my favorite places in THE WORLD is Sammy's Roumanian Steakhouse in Manhattan.  This place actually reminds me a LOT of that place, which is great to have right in my neighborhood (not to mention right next to my favorite strip club, but that's another review).

Came here with a group of ladies on Saturday night, and we had so much fun. I mean, how many items need to be delivered to your table ON FIRE before you start having a good time?  Hint: It doesn't take many. However, our mid-twenties asses were put to shame by the biggest party animal of the night, 90 Year old Mildred. This chick was celebrating her birthday with 75 of her closest friends and was scooting around that place with a vengeance. It was incredible. According to the wonderful owners we chatted with, she E-VITED her guests.  Yes, a 90 year old woman learned how to E-VITE specifically to invite 75 friends to Bacchanal.  That may not be entirely accurate, but I wouldn't doubt it.

I had the Veal Bacchanal, Aimee H. had the lamb skewer, and our two friends had the Greek Lasagna and the Lamb Shank.  My veal was very good, but the Lamb Shank that I tried was incredible! Like fall off the bone tender. But it was huge, and I was filling up on wine and ouzo, so I was satisfied with my bites.

Really though, the experience itself is worth five stars. Yes, the food isn't inexpensive (around $15-$20 for an entree...but they have a gyro plate for $10 as well), but they could have charged $5 at the door for the entertainment alone. Belly dancers, a live band, freaking throwing plates on the ground! Obviously, the way to any girl's heart is condoned destruction of property, so they did a great job recognizing that.

Okay this is a long review, but go when they have the belly dancers and band, get the lamb and some ouzo shots, and throw some plates on the ground. If you don't have a good time, you should maybe re-evaluate your definition of "good time". That is all.I love this place. Easily the best and most authentic Greek food in Phoenix. Their best dish is the arni(lamb shank) but you have to call ahead and request it. Every time I come I feel like I am back in the village in Greece!This place has long been one of my favs, whether getting take out or dining at the restaurant.  The cedar planked salmon, pot roast and griddle corn cakes never fail to satisfy. 

Last night, however, made me fall in love all over again!  The croissant bread pudding with the Jack Daniels sauce and the pumpkin cheesecake completely stopped the normally frenzied conversation at our table.  My dining companions and I sheepishly looked at each other as if we had been caught doing something illegal or immoral!  It was almost embarrassing how good these two items were!!!

The luxurious textures, the perfectly balanced flavors, the butter infusions!  Trying to figure out how I can go back in tonight and just do the deserts...Their Geek Squad department gives excellent customer service! They fixed my computer in less than 2 days even though I was quoted 5! Not only were they quick and reliable, but very helpful and charming. I would recommend this location to anyone who needs a computer fixed. I had a new macbook pro that I bought at the Apple store. You want to talk about long lines!? I had to make an appointment THREE days in advance just to get it looked at. I took my problem to this Best Buy on the way back on a lark. Not only was I diagnosed and checked in in under 15 minutes, but they treated me very well too. Their store is very clean and organized now, I think they remodeled. 5 Stars all the way for this location!Went through the drive thru to get some coffee and water today. It was a rather long wait, but when we finally got to the window they gave us our drinks for FREE! Such a nice and pleasant surprise. Thanks Starbucks!Sure it isn't cheap.  You pay for service and selection from a specialty store.  

I'm always surprised at how few good specialty shops of any kind there are in Phoenix.  As far as I can tell Runner's Den is THE specialty running store in the Valley - and thank the gods its a great one.

It can be crowded on weekends, and the wait for assistance can be maddening, but it is worth it.  The only way they could afford more floor space and staff would be to broaden their focus and then they would just be another Champs or Big 5.

Want to get fitted for shoes by someone who knows what they are doing and can recommend the best shoe for you?  Maybe analyze the wear pattern on your present clogs and suggest a replacement?  Or would you prefer going to the mall, saving $15 bucks and having a pimply-faced teenager who spends most of his life on Xbox take care of you?  It's your choice!

I was a serious - meaning top 20 nationally in my age-group - multi-sport guy when I lived in SoCal, so I think I know a good running store when I see one.  And trust me, Runner's Den is LEGIT!  The folks working there are all runners and pretty serious about what they do.  Excellent selection of shoes, socks and toys for foot massage and other devices.  Things you might find at Tribal Multi-sport but otherwise nowhere else in the Valley that I know of.

You will not be disappointed.  Oh yeah, parking is a bitch at this place.  On the weekend, you may wait for a spot.  Skip the Suburban and take the Mini-cooper.The staff at this shop is outstanding. They make you walk barefoot before they bring out shoes for you and take you outside to jog in each pair you try on. They are dedicated to making sure you get shoes that fit your feet and your needs. This is my go-to place whenever I need running shoes. 

The staff are more than clerks. They are runners themselves and very knowledgeable about running.

Did I mention you get a discount on apparel when you buy shoes? These guys are freakin' awesome!

You might have to pay a little extra here compared to other sporting good stores, but the service more than makes up for the price. Other stores make you fend for yourself.My friend and I decided last minute that we wanted to go out to eat last night instead of staying in. Since it was a holiday we didn't want to try our luck at any of the restaurants nearby so we headed over to Flavors of India which is right down the street. 

The place was a lot cuter and nicer inside than expected. We were seated right away at a large booth and the hostess gave me a rose for the holiday. They had a special of a large plate of grilled meats for $13.95 which our waiter said was enough for 2. So we split that and also ordered our usuals, Paneek Pakor and Naan. Our waiter also suggested Indian Beer, and I can't remember the name of it, but it was very good. 

The food was all very, very good. The naan was much better than the other Indian restaurant we frequent. I can't wait to go back to try my favorites (butter chicken and tikka masala) although everything they had looked so, so good. 

I was really impressed overall and I love supporting local businesses like this one.Flavors is easily my favorite Indian restaurant in the Valley. With friendly wait staff, good prices and fantastic food you can't go wrong. Don't be fooled by it's humble exterior; it's the food you're there to enjoy. I prefer to skip the buffet as I like my food XXXX-Indian-hot, but I have never been disappointed at dinner. In fact, the staff recognize me and my daughter and often ask if we'll have our regular, even if it's been months since our last visit. 
My absolute favorite is the lamb vindaloo while my husband has chicken korma and my daughter goes for the chicken tikka masala and a mango lassi. Don't forget the rice pudding (kheer) for dessert. You won't be disappointed!!!Honestly, one of the most amazing and delicious sandwiches I have ever had!! That dressing is garlic heaven, the sandwich was LOADED with meat but balanced with the other ingredients well, the bread was perfect! My eleven year old just freaked out at how amazing his sandwich was, he wants to eat it everyday now.  I had a turkey and prov, the kido had an Italian.  

The sandwich alone is five tons of trillions stars, but the owners are one hundred million, billion, infinity....  I enjoyed the kind and simple conversation we had so much! They made my day! 

I can't wait to some back!Cheap drinks, cheap pool. AMAZING bar food... best in town. I don't know which chef they have locked up back there, but they bring out some amazing food. Certainly unexpected... but it keeps me coming back.WOW!! What an amazing establishment.  I had the pleasure of sitting downstairs, as I entered through the kitchen.  This is my second time dining here, and since I entered this way the first time, I ended up doing it again. The martinis are absolutly amazing and the food is spectacular.  I had a dirty martini with amazing blue cheese stuffed olives, shaken violently, with that frothy layer of ice on top - outstanding.  Then I ordered up the enchiladas and tamales - which came with both red and green sauce.  Let me warn you the red sauce is NO JOKE! WHOA! Hot, but super yummy.  Everything was prepared perfectly and I could not be happier.  My date had the sliders and scallops - I don't think I have had a better prepared scallop.  The service is perfect, staff is happy, food is amazing and I will dine there again!NYPD has Always been a Fave & now they're nearing the very top of our list (as long as they don't do away w/ their Veganizza & Pizza Blanca 4 us Veg~heads) & GLUTEN FREE is a MAJOR + !!! Thank U 4 having/offering these #1Derful options 4 those of us who r'nt carnivores as there wouldn't b much 4 us 2 order 2 patronize ur eatery!!

   I'm not a fan of pizza dough but their's is on another scale that I actually eat the crust 2 (which I don't do w/ other pizza). We had/shared between us Spinach salad (sans the bacon), Caprese, Spinach/Artichoke dip, & Zucchini sticks were all Absolutely AHHhmazing as usual but our main reason 4 coming: Veganizza & Pizza Bianca we had r PERFECTION 2 die 4... seriously Exceptional in flavors & texture!!!

   On previous visits we've had the Soho salad pizza, greek salads, Eggplant & the Chelsea chopped salad (minus the bacon)... all So Delicious & especially luv the salad pizza concept, pls keep this 2!! 

   We usually like 2 sit in the outside section because my guilty pleasure is watching any of the birds flitting around the bushes & scavenging 4 crumbs which I someXs 'accidentally' drop in my occasional clumsiness. Also the service has always been impeccable whenever we've gone which is truly appreci8ed & a very integral part of the dining experience!

   We luv the cannolis/kisses & we've had the tiramisu in the past which was AWESOME 2 (but not offered on menu anymore)? We have yet 2 try the limoncello cake but will save that in anticip8ion 4 our next visit. NYPD ROCKS & really hope they keep these Veg~head/Gluten~Free faves of ours so we can continue our business w/ this establishment!!!Love the ambiance of this bar, it truly feels like you've left phoenix and arrived in NYC... however, be prepared to pay NYC prices here. Very cool inventive cocktails, comfortable lounge setting, elcectic menu, and music to match the mood! Hands down my favorite bar in Phoenix! If you feel like getting dressed up and not having to deal with your typical Scottsdale crowd, check this place out!! And try a dirty martini!!On the East side of Phoenix, there are 2 options for Home Improvement - Home Depot ( Thomas Rd & 36th St)  or this location for Ace Hardware.  Honestly, I go to HD often for their pricing, large selection, rental equipment, landscaping needs, and much more.  

I recently replaced an old 1950's toilet with a Toto Dual Flush and installed a new gas range in my home.  After consulting with Travis from Strong Home Improvement, he said that Ace is the Place.  They will answer your questions, point you towards the right fixtures and are ALWAYS Helpful.  He was right-on-the-money.  Each and every visit (4x), the staff knew what I was asking for and knew EXACTLY where the parts where located in the store.  

If you are tackling a project at home, ACE is your PLACE!Me and my lady friend went here for dinner last night. We were a little underdressed but no one seemed to mind. We were promptly greeted and seated. Even though this was our first time dinning here, the waitstaff made us feel like we were regulars. The food was amazing. The fried calamari was cooked perfectly and paired with a great tasting spicy marinara. The salads were average but good, and the entrees really stood out. I had the Veal Marsala, which was off the charts. After 35 years these guys know how to cook veal. It was pounded very thin and melted in my mouth. The lady had the salmon, which was parmesean crusted and very good. It was mild and wonderful. The tiramisu for dessert was also great. Next time though i will get the pasta as the were making it fresh in the restauraunt. I have to give that a try. The ambiance was great. I don't think they have changed anything since it opened in 1974. It's not trendy or chic but it is classy and takes you back in time. It does seem like it attracts an older generation, but if more people try this food they will flock there in droves. I can not wait to go back.Love Jerry's! Have been coming here for the last 20 yrs. Had my usual this morning, 222. Two eggs, two bacon and two pancakes. 
Oh... Coffee :-)An absolute must for all Orthodox Christians or for those fascinated by monastic life. This is the only Greek Orthodox monastery in North America and founded by a living saint, Father Ephraim. I drove from Los Angeles, but people come from all over the world to stay as a pilgrim at this monastery. The 45 or so monks living here run a tight ship keeping the holly grounds in tip top shape. It's immaculate, with lush gardens, fountains, and gazebos. They've turned the place into an oasis in the middle of a hot ,dry cacti ridden desert. 

There are several chapels within the monastery and one major church where most of the magic takes place. Most of the furniture and icons are brought in from Mt. Athos, considered one of the most holly places for Greek Orthodoxies. Sadly, no women are allowed on Mt. Athos. But that's besides the point. Women must wear long skirts and wear a mandili or scarf to cover their hair, basically do not show any skin. Men must wear long sleeve shirts and pants. 

You can visit for the day or stay overnight as a pilgrim. If you are a pilgrim you can stay from 1 -10 days. You must attend all services, which means the big one from 1:45 AM to 4:00 AM every night. The first night I went at 1 AM and was able to kiss Father Ephraim's hand. After the night morning service, there is a breakfast of freshly baked bread (the monks bake like crazy), large and small bitter green olives from the olive orchards grown on the grounds, 2 types of halva, jam, nuts, fresh fruit from their orchards and coffee. This is a typical fasting breakfast (no animal products). After breakfast you go back to bed for another 3 hours of quiet time. Walking back to my room at 5 AM was beautiful. The desert stars and moon are bright, casting shadows on the cacti and the air is cool and fresh. In the day you are pretty much free to roam. Lunch is served at 11:30 AM and there is no talking aloud, except for a monk reading a chosen bible passage in Greek. When they ring the bell, you are allowed to pour water. A typical fasting lunch that I had consisted of braised green beans with calamari, fresh bread, olive, salad, and Greek macaroni. After lunch you can try to get a blessing from Father Ephraim, go to the book store, talk to some monks or other pilgrims. Another mandatory service is Vespers at 3:30 PM - 4:30 PM and afterwards dinner is served. After dinner is the last mandatory service. And then you are ready to go to bed at 7:30. No joke. I fell asleep before quiet hours even - I was feeling extremely peaceful and happy, yet exhausted. 

I will be back to the monastery with my dad. I was lucky to stay two nights with profoundly holly people and have an incredible experience.One of my vendors uses this bakery a lot for gifts. I have had several of their sugar cookies and let me say, they are THE BEST sugar cookies I've ever had, ever. They're moist, sweet, and simply melt in your mouth with goodness.Consistently great food and service. Went for lunch yesterday. Ordered the peel and eat shrimp (which came out 10 minutes late and got comp'd) and the sashimi tuna salad- sooooo good. And if you are in the mood for a buzz, they make the BEST cosmopolitan. Really strong and really good.My wife and I stopped in at Hillstone on Christmas Eve for lunch. The food was great, I had the prime rib. I was impressed with the service and the professional staff. The atmosphere was great. We will be back!normally, i love/hate going to the home depot. everytime i go, i get so many ideas of what i want to do to my home and yard, buy a bunch of stuff, then spend the next 8 weekends cursing wildly in the yard for starting yet another project. 

also, going to home depot has always been stressful. i pretty much know how to do most anything, but i still need help finding the right pieces and parts (because i often overlook small details like measurements and sizes and thus wind up going back several times to get the right thing). it would be so much easier if a depot employee would just help me out a little. 

well, this time i got lucky. gardening. not a strong suit but i'm tenacious and damnit, i will get it to grow one way or the other. still, this time, i didn't need help with my choices, but while loading a bag of sand into the truck, those darn paper bags...one of them burst. luckily Gabriel, one of the associates in the garden center must have overheard my F-bomb and came out with a shovel and broom. he first offered to go get me another bag, but it was my fault, so i would've felt guilty. when i declined, he helped me refill the bag almost down to the very last grain, duct taped the hell out of it, and all of it with a smile. 

i'll have to change my regular depot to this one if that's the kind of service they offer!What a wonderful way to spend Mother's Day! It was a delicious brunch with a wonderful spread. It was nice that we could immediately enjoy the top notch buffet and also enjoy a made to order entree. Our waiter Paul was absolutely amazing. He paid extra attention to make sure my mimosas were replaced as needed  we had our newborn, toddler and 9 year old with us so he had his hands full and he was just amazing throughout out service. Hoping  this is our new Mother's Day tradition.Got married here three years ago and now back from our anniversary and it's still as beautiful as ever. Mona and her team of personal concierge were amazing and helped us book out weekend! Even suggesting a hot air balloon ride, which I can't wait to do! Very private, got a great deal on a casita and everyone gives amazing service! The pool bar is the best! Try the hummus plate and the bloody Mary's!My daughter and I chose the 4 hour ATV ride.  Our guide, Chad made the trip fun for people of all ability levels.  This is a first class operation.  Great tour, lots of fun, I highly recommend it!My fav breakfast place in Phoenix!

You get: great food, great atmosphere, good service (parking a little bit of a challenge, but I live right across the street so I just walk).  They even have drive up take out service!

I mostly eat the breakfast there but have had sandwiches as well as the pizza at the Pizzeria next door.  Delicious!  Anyone who gives LGO negative reviews has just fallen into the usual boring Phoenix restaurant style type eating.  LGO is something different...order and serve yourself....kinda' like fast food (but you have to wait a little bit because all the food is made fresh), but seat yourself and don't have to worry about waiting for a server to bring your drinks/food!  Coffee is great (and strong). Daybreaker is my favorite healthy breakfast choice (egg white with turkey slices, avacado, tomato and salsa....get with a side of fruit or potato...fantastic!)

Yes, prices are a little higher than average in Phoenix....but you get what you pay for.

We love coming here after a good hike at Squak Peak or Camelback! Fresh squeed OJ is great and fresh made english muffines are yummy.My visiting daughter from Montana took us here following a hike up Echo Canyon at Camelback Mtn. We were completely impressed. Had the cubano panini and it was delicious!  Very hipster location with a nostalgic candy section, interesting books ala Urban Outfitters, and wonderful freshly squeezed lemonade. We'll definitely be back! Great value and incredible food.Frequent customer. Love this place. Great neighborhood spot with good food, beer, and wine selection.  Customer service is great and a fun and inviting ambiance.  Try the bruchetta and the picnic salad.I've been to Postino a few times, but as we all know it is a violation of Yelp TOS to review an establishment until you've been drunk there. What? It's not? Well, I would consider it in poor taste.

I got drunk at Postino last night and had a wonderful time. The $20 Bruschetta Board and Bottle of Wine promotion they have Mondays and Tuesdays is a ridiculous steal. I didn't want to be the alcey to ask if that deal was limited to one-per-table as I was fully planning on consuming my own bottle of wine and possibly my own board of bruschetta. Luckily the guys across the bar had the same plan, so I didn't have to. FYI: It is illegal for restaurants to serve you your own bottle of wine. Don't ask how I know. I just know. However, you can split 3 or 4 with one other person and nobody says anything. Don't ask how I know this either. I just know. 

All of the different bruschetta options are fantastic. The Prosciutto one tasted like Cinnamon Toast to me. That may have been the booze talking. Considering I kept referring to it as "Cinnamon Toast Crunch", I'm going to go ahead and say it was. The roasted red pepper & goat cheese and the apple & brie were equally delicious. Sorry, I don't have a breakfast cereal comparison for them. 

To top it off, the service is fan-freaking-tastic. Everyone is extremely helpful and seems genuinely HAPPY  that you are there spending money. Clearly, from a business standpoint, this should be a given, but more often than not it isn't. Once I was there with a girl whose recently adopted Greyhound was somehow prompted to dart across the patio like a bat out of hell, knocking over chairs and wine glasses along the way. Not only was the staff RIDICULOUSLY nice about it, a few of the valet guys actually CHASED AFTER this greyhound and I'm pretty sure one of them got into his car to find it. The staff literally organized an impromptu search party for a dog that could run upwards of 60 MPH. That is some damn good service. And, we found the dog.I've been craving to wine and dine here for so long, since my friends rave about it. So I finally got my opportunity to experience Postinos yesterday... Sunday Funday. It definitely felt like summer w/  the live reggae band that actually sounded more like Jack Johnson... enjoyed the music either way... while drinking amazingly refreshing sangrias. I was eager to order from their impressive wine list (definitely next time), but my friend influenced me to taste the sangria... which I'm normally not a big fan of... But it wasn't overly sweet at all.  We of course ate their infamous bruschettas... delicious!  Service was super friendly and attentive.I love this place!!! Amazing wine list that changes frequently, great food, fun atmosphere - what more could you ask for??? The bruschetta are to die for!!! Prosciutto, marscapone cheese and figs are Camille H's favorite. I could eat an entire plate of the salmon pesto bruschetta. The artichoke was amazing as was the roasted pepper and goat cheese. My mouth is watering, just thinking about it!!! Camille H and I have been here a few times and always do bruschettta and share the picnic salad - goat cheese, beets, bacon.....so so wonderful. 

This place is loud - not necessarily a good place for a  first date if you want to get to know each other, unless yelling is your thing. Although, if you are both very hot, and love to see and be seen, this is a great spot for that!

I would NOT recommend bringing a child here. It's too loud and the food has too many "adult" ingredients.

OH and I learned (the $3 way) that you always say to the Valet that you are going to Le Grand Orange, and not Postino because then you don't have to pay for the valet service.Postino's is a great place for a date or evening out with friends.  The Arcadia location is in a cool neighborhood and the building opens up on one side to an outdoor patio... which is awesome on an evening with nice weather.

I have to admit, I haven't tried very much from the menu.  Every time I come, the rest of the table and I order bruschetta to share and some wine.  Although I'm sure the rest of the food is great, I really do recommend bruschetta.  There are 12 different varieties to choose from, with everything from the classic tomato, mozzarella and basil to brie with apple slices to prosciutto.  Every single one is delicious.  They work well for one order for two people, so order accordingly.  For our group of 4, we got 2 orders.  With four varieties each, we got to try 8 of the 12 available.  It was easiest to say that we'd try one of everything, with the exception of the ones that had an ingredient someone at the table would prefer to skip.

We also split a bottle of wine, which complimented the meal very well.  Our server was knowledgeable enough to recommend a bottle based on what we were in the mood for, and he really hit the mark.  We were amused that the woman whose job it was to fill water glasses would come around so often that the glass never got below half empty.  It was almost too much, but hey, we stayed well hydrated.

The atmosphere is very "cool" with dim lighting, modern decor, and a definite wine theme throughout.  Service has been excellent each time I've dined here.  Those are perks for sure, but the bruschetta would keep me coming back anyway!  Check out any of the Postino's that may be near you!  If you go in on Monday or Tuesday after 8, their date night special is a bruschetta platter and a bottle of wine for $20.  Can't beat that!

Keep in mind that Postino Arcadia is valet parking only ;)Best dive bar. Ever.  Go see Beth and order yourself a "Clint Black." You can thank me later.I've been here a few times for informal meetings, and have gotten various drinks such as iced teas and smoothies.  The staff here gives exemplary service, and drinks are always filled promptly as needed.  When I've ordered smoothies, they've been very good, refreshing, and have come with a huge carafe that 2 people can easily share.  I'd love to try their food here someday when I'm not there for a meeting!What a wonderful experience!  These days it is a miracle to even get 2 minutes with the doctor.  Here I was able to ask questions and actually get some insightful answers.  I never felt uncomfortable or rushed.  I highly recommend this office.  The PAs are wonderful and Dr. Romine was very attentive!*********** THE VALLEY'S GREATEST  ************

                       More Than One Star .....  HAS TO BE EARNED

The Food is Right On .... never a negative experience.
     The service is outstanding.
         The entire staff, has a great attitude.
               The only problem ......... their way to busy.Best Thai in town. I've been eating here since 1994 or so.We have been using Kachina Dry Cleaners for the past 7 years and have never been disappointed.  Service is excellent, and they will expedite if requested.  We had tried the discount cleaners down the street, and while the shirts weren't bad, the dry cleaning was horrible.  Stella and her son, Stacey, are great!I have been going to FPS for several years.  The first Doctor I saw was Dr Marvin Schneider who sets the standard high in healthcare.  In my opinion, Dr Schneider is a living legend in the healthcare profession.  I have continued to go back to FPS and my Dr is now Dr David Francyk and Nurse Sara.  They are wonderful people amd extremely caring.  The front office/receptionist area staff are also very sincere and extremely nice.  I love FPS!  Added bonus... blood lab, and xray lab are actually in the office for easy access when my Doctor needs me to get testing results.  FPS is better than the television shows General Hospital, The Doctors, and ER combined!  If ever Dr Francyk's schedule is fully booked or he is on vacation, when needed I can sometime get in to see one of the other several Doctors on staff at FPS.Before I got to wear scrubs to work, which is probably the greatest thing ever, this was my go to dry cleaner.  Everything is $2.25, and if you have it in before 9, it's done by 3:30.  The staff was friendly, and everything is basic and simple, the way it should be.  I kind of miss having to get my work clothes dry cleaned.  They only accept debit cards (w/ a .50 fee) or cash.They found "it". There are only a handful of places in this town that know how to make pizza. Anyone who would find a problem with this pie needs to get back to their Digiorno's.......They get 5-stars because they have gluten-free pizza!! I usually get their Mamma Spinato's signature pizza. It's wonderful! Like nothing I have ever tasted before.

Their wait staff is always good and very efficient. It's always crowded so try not to go at peak times.I bought my girlfriend's engagement ring from store in LA and it was too big... Schmitt resized it for a very reasonable price same day because they could tell my fiancé didn't want to be without the ring. Ann, our sales associate, couldn't have been more helpful. Thank you!I've loved doing business with this UPS store for many years now. You get the feeling that there will be no problems with your packages when shipped. The owners are on site 99% of the time and they make it quick and easy to ship or do any other service. Sometimes I walk in with things half done and they act like it's no big deal and finish it up for me. They don't even charge for their tape like another local UPS store does. Anyway always courteous and professional in the services they provide.I have been visiting this restaurant for many years and have been present for the changing of the menu almost 4 times! I remember the food being better, so I have been upset with some of the changes, however, I will still make this a once a week stop.  The chips and salsa are AWARD WINNING and for GOOD REASON.  Ask for the flour chips only.  They are the reason to visit this restaurant.  Their chicken quesadilla is amazing and their food is decent, but definitely go for the chips & salsa.  You'll pay a bit much for the food, but it is definitely worth it.  Just remember to come for dinner early if you are visiting on a Wednesday or a Friday or there's only street parking available.  The bar gets to be pretty packed on these nights.i love, love, love the high level of customer service that paul and his staff provide at central car care.  i recommend them to all my friends.  good service, nice people, great prices, reliable.....  what more can you ask for?The pizza here is delicious! Not as greasy like other places. The cheesy bread sticks with marinara sauce is so amazing. This is one of my favorite places to have pizza. Service is great.New management has put together a vast menu.  Three of us greatly enjoyed our meals (yui shan shrimp, shrimp w vegs, sweet sour pork).  All delicious. Dining room looks cleaner.   Restrooms better too. We will be back. Hopefully they'll have a little more help.Recently had a chance to check this place out. Buddy of mine and I drove by this place and didn't know anything about it. We just finishing some home remodeling, so
we thought we would at least have a few drinks and unwind. 

Whata Whata Whooyee. Nailanation Doabrit! 

This place runs circles around some of the high end places you'd find in Vegas! Seriously, I don't frequent these places cause that's just me. but this place is clean, comfortable, fun, quality models and a great entertainment value!I was in this Beauty Brands location back in October 2010 buying some nail polish. I ended up getting my makeup done, which was great (forget the esthetician's name).  While getting my makeup done, I met Carissa, a hair stylist there.  I had a long consultation with her, and went back three days later for a haircut.  I went from long to mid-length layered, and was nervous about it but I was ready.  

Carissa is an amazing hair stylist.  She is friendly, helpful, takes her time, knows what she is doing, does an excellent job.  I went back for a trim 2 days ago and she did another excellent job on my cut.  I couldn't be happier.  Her cuts are quite reasonably priced, too.

Beauty Brands also has a guarantee that if a product doesn't work for you, you can obtain a store credit to get something else.  The people there are very helpful and friendly, and help you find the product that is right for you.  Easy parking in a convenient location. (Trader Joe's/Whole Foods shopping center.)  The nail/massage area is quite nice - private and quiet.I always book the basic pedicure. Be sure to ask for Hope. My nails have never looked this nice. She does all the service that none of the others have. My toenails are beautiful and the service was fantastic!Correcting some gross Misconceptions on Yelp regarding Michelina's.... PART 1

   My review will be overwhelmingly thorough, to aid others I will post in a 'bullet point' format for ease of reference (I have enjoyed this restaurant approximately 10 times in the last year (I am a foodie what can I say)...

History- Michelina immigrated approximately 29 years ago and opened her wonderful "Ristorante"(more on what this means later) and blessed Phoenix approximately 27 years ago...

Food- Excellent! Italian food from the area of NAPLES (this is where Michelina is from)... Food from this region is a blend, "Campania is one of the largest producers and consumers of pasta in Italy, especially spaghetti. In the regional cuisine, pasta is prepared in various styles that can feature tomato sauce, cheese, clams and shellfish.(Wikipedia)" PUTNESCA IS A POPULAR SAUCE from Naples...

Recommendations for food: One SHOULD attempt to incorporate seafood/shellfish as a choice; however, Michelina's has many excellent 'Turf' options (osso bucco, veal, eggplant, etc...)...

Appetizers: Escargots (dip the bread for garlic and butter lovers, this is the best)

Oysters Michelina-fantastic

SALAD IS OFFERED COMPLIMENTARY (FYI)

The bread is exquisite (with butter how its meant to be churned)

Entrees:
Surf: Many fresh fish specials usually served ala Putnesca (fantastic)
Turf: Osso Bucco (frequent special, this meat will fall off the shank and is incredibly tender, flavorful, and moist), Veal Saltimbucco, Veal Piccata


Dessert-  zabaione (with fresh berries) by far the best!!!!
Tiramasu- not bad but do yourself a favor and get the Zabione

A complimentary cordial is provided (fyi)

REAL ITALIAN MASCULINE COFFEE (go espresso or Cappuccino and you will be pleased (don't expect fu fu starbucks)


Dining EXPERIENCE- In Italy one enjoys the 'TABLE' for the evening (i.e. it is not a rushed affair, rather something to be savored and relished in)....(Notice it is an Italian named Restaurant (not Michelina's Restaurant) but rather "Michelina's Ristorante Costa Campagnia" which means, "Michelina's [exquisite/higher end] Italian restaurant featuring food from Campagnia".... 

Service- Brad is a wonderful and exceptional server... Request him if possible... Additionally, as inferred from "Dining Experience" above, this is an Experience to be savored... IF YOU HAVE TIME CONSTRAINTS, IMMEDIATELY INFORM BRAD, they will be accommodated (i.e. opera, symphony, movie, or just want a wonderful meal at a heightened pace).... The service WILL NOT HOVER over you as an American Restaurant will!!!!!! The exceptional service staff wants you to enjoy and relish the evening, as is done in Italy...

Ambiance- The restaurant is classically subtle and expresses the 'family and regional' values of Michelina's experiences in Naples as a young woman.... Some may call it dated, others may suggest classically influenced, and yet those that appreciate the Italian cuisine and experience might suggest that it is "Old School" in a "Marlon Brando"-esque way... For those of you unfamiliar with Marlon, Michelina's IS HOW A NAPLES RESTAURANT IS?WAS?AND SHOULD ALWAYS BE....

TO CORRECT SOME GROSS MISCONCEPTIONS OF OTHERS I WILL ADDRESS them below...

           "There is nothing eye catching about the business front at all.  It's in a strip mall and looks old.  At night, they turn on strands of tacky Christmas lights that only attract attention to the fact that the lights are so poorly hung."

- The restaurant is 'Unassuming' from the outside, this is a treasure, not to be shared with just anyone... It also looks old because it is, she has been in this location for 20+ years....

"When we arrived for dinner we were greeted by an empty corridor, no host station and no host.  We could see what looked to be a bar but it wasn't a bar that I'd want to eat, drink and socialize at."

-Michelina's is not a bar, they have excellent drinks however. Additionally, Michelina's is family run AND the expectation (once you have been their more than once) is to walk in and introduce yourself to Brad or Michelina's son (as you will become friends to dine with)....

"To pass the time until we were finally greeted we browsed the many framed publications touting how incredible the place was.  I'm already here...I don't need any more persuasion.  It's time for the Chef/owner to take down the "look how good I was" trophy wall and go with a more inviting modern look."

-See Ambiance section above... Michelina is a remarkable woman and created this restaurant from LITERALLY NOTHING 27 years ago... She has won best Italian in AZ/Phx many times and would continue to win (however the same restaurant winning does not sell reviews/publications)...

...To be continued..Thank you Creations In Cuisine for adding to my dream wedding! We did a fajita buffet with amazing appetizers to match and everything was SO delicious!!!!! My guests couldn't stop raving about how this was the best wedding food they had ever tasted. Me and my husband were completely was blown away by all the flavors! Our guests had more than enough to eat and we left with leftovers even! We also hired Tara Gray as our coordinator and she was our breath of fresh air. I HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend investing into her services. She is super professional, insanely organized and flat out amazing at what she does. Without her...we would have never been able to have our dream wedding. From set up to tear down she made sure everything ran smoothly so we wouldn't have to stress. It is SUCH an amazing feeling being able to walk into your wedding without a care in the world. She was worth every dime we invested into her services and truly deserved more than what we paid. Thank you Tara and Creations in Cuisine!!!!!!!!!!!!My son just bought his first paintball gun, hopper, mask, etc from these guys.  Their prices are the same as online, so why not establish a relationship with a store where you will need to go to get stuff serviced.

The team here is very patient and has amazing knowledge.  They really know their stuff and take the time to walk you through everyting.

The store is clean and well organized.  This will be our go to spot for all paintball.I dropped a Chanel tote and shoes off for repair and reconditioning and all I can say is WOW. The bag and shoes came back looking almost new. The repair was done quickly and at a fair price. I cannot recommend this place enough.I've used this location on quite a few occasions.  They're open 24 hours, and the staff is always friendly (even at 2 in the morning).  I've been extremely pleased with the quality of print services I've received.  This place is great if you procrastinate on a school or work project and need something printed up real spiffy-like in a hurry.Arrive around 7:00 PM on a Wednesday evening. Wasn't too busy. Sat in the bar area. Service was quick. Enjoyed some bread and a nice glass of Malbec while waiting on my order. Took about 15 minutes.    Meal was hot and tasted great. Had the gnocchi with sausage and meat sauce.  Would recommend it. Great atmosphere.Did a great job at my home. They showed up on time, did excatly what I asked and finsished in a timely manner. Totally recommend them to otheres.I have been going to Shogun for over 10 years and I'm a huge fan. The service is always very friendly and the food does not disappoint. Get the godzilla tails or chicken over udon noodles.

Best time to go: HAPPY HOUR. You can get godzilla tails for 5$ also the sushi is half off. The beer and sake are next to nothing. GO!!!!!!Dang good sub, the best of everything is awesome. I also like pasta salad that came with it. The servers are friendly and help with good knowledge of the menu. Nice cozy atmosphere. The meat balls are my usual on a sub or spaghetti.  Good tasty meat balls.Best printer in North Phoenix. Friendly people, excellent service.This place is totally awesome. Hubby found it on Yelp this morning and so glad we gave it a try! It is located in a sleepy stripmall behind a Starbucks and Gelado Spot, so I am guessing a lot of people don't know its there.

It is small but they are big on friendliness. The waitresses are the fun no-nonsense type with great senses of humor and are very attentive. We were poured cup after cup of hot fresh coffee and they were very sweet to our little boy. Even the other patrons were sweet, saying hello to him and giving him a smile.

The food was out of this world- we got a nice big pancake, scrambled egg and sausage patty for our son who ate the WHOLE thing! I got the machaca and eggs and it was one of the best breakfasts I've ever had. The machaca was seasoned perfectly and had nice big pieces of bell pepper and onions, and was covered with eggs and chunky salsa. It also came with nice big chunks of chargrilled new potato homefries! So good!

It was so much food, I had to take half of it home, but it wound up being my lunch. Most of the dishes range from $6-$9 and they offer lunch and dinner all day long. This is a great place to bring your family, they are great with kids and we were in and out of there in under an hour. Highly recommended!Love this place, great service indoor/outdoor seating.  THE BEST FISH TACOS ever.  Prices are reasonalbe I just love this placeGreat place right in the middle of town.  All types of wood for any purpose.  This place has wood for smoking meat, wood for the fire pit, wood for camping, and wood for the fireplace.  I bought an outdoor fireplace and was tired of the crap they sell at QT and the like.  Found Berry Bros online, drove in, loaded the truck myself, done.  I will never buy wood anywhere else.Recently, I had Banker Insulation upgrade the insulation in my attic and was extremely pleased with the positive results it has had on keeping the heat inside my home throughout the past colder months. These guys had a great eye for detail and completely treated my home as if they were working on their own. I will definitely recommend Banker Insulation to anyone who is looking for an established reputable company that stands behind the quality of their work!Victoria for pre-race briefing is a necessity! That girl will shave seconds off of your lap time...... This place is fun, pints, real speed, plus Race Podium sick !!!!Glen at Total Forms Management is absolutely amazing. He has made shirts for me and my crew on many occasions. He even created a baby onesie with a logo for a good friend of mine. Creativity and quality are what Glen provides. Don't use someone on the internet you have never met, give glen a shot and he will personally handle your printing project. Thanks Glen!!!So, this place is like my family's tradition, yet today was the first time I've ever tried it (or the first time I remember trying it...) Anyways, it was great! We sat and ate in the bar, which at first looked kinda dingy, but it actually has pretty decent decoration. We were served right when we got there (we came when it opened up) and our server was really nice! She deserves to be mentioned by name, but I don't remember it.... sorry! Anyways, the menu was big but not-too-big, of you know what I mean. I ended up getting the shredded chicken chimichanga, and I also tried some of the Pollo Fundido (spelling?) and both were DELICIOUS! Yes, the portions are HUGE! It is imminent that you will fall into a food coma, even if you have a full box of leftovers to take home. It was a tad greasy, but it's fried mexican food, what do you expect? In conclusion, I say that it's my new favorite mexican restaurant.Every time I have visited dr Yocham and his staff, I have had a wonderful experience this will be my 5th visit soon. They are always upfront with my cost and how much something may cost before doing it. From shots to X-rays I highly recommend these guys!I was a preschool teacher at Awakening Seed for 25 years. The director, Mary Glover, promotes a sense of community among students and staff alike. This sense of community can be readily seen in each classroom. As children form bonds of friendship with each other they are also encouraged to include children who are new, or less gregarious socially, in their play. 
The curriculum is child-centered, and students frequently decide for themselves what their main unit of study will be. Other aspects of the curriculum (math, science, literature, writing...) are based as much as possible on the general study unit.
Awakening Seed students tend to assume a sense of ownership and responsibility for their school. In many cases I have seen this sense of ownership extend into adulthood. Former students often return to the school to reconnect with their former teachers. A sentiment I have frequently heard from both former students and their parents who return for visits is that their favorite school years were those spent at Awakening Seed. A more nurturing environment would be hard to find.After a frustrating experience at Lowe's, I drove over to Ace hoping for better service. 

I was in luck. The employees were very helpful, even for an unusual request like mine. I received personal service, and the cashier was very friendly and chatty. 

Ace earned my business, I absolutely recommend them over the Depot or Lowe's.We have been going to Sakana since around we moved to Tempe in 1995.  It has been consistent over the years; great, fresh sushi, generous portions, reasonable prices.Amazing as always! I been going here for years and I love it. I had a friend that worked there and told me the fish is flown in daily. Not surprised as it always tastes fresh and mouth watering. I suggest ordering one of the sashimi bowls and this amazing roll wrapped in cucumber (forgot name).  The best thing about this place is the delicious food at a great price.  I have been to a lot of places in the surrounding areas and I ALWAYS go back to Sakana.  Also they have a ton of daily specials and wait for it............. HALF SHELL OYSTERS!! Yummy! Ok now I'm hungry!I just wanted to say these guys are great with their Tire sales and services.  I have gotten both of my vehicles worked on here in the past 12 months, and decided to buy my tires direct from them rather than an online seller.  Their prices are not much higher than Internet prices and their service has been great.  Give them a chance to earn your business!After enjoying happy hour a couple years ago, I finally had a chance to eat at My Wine Cellar a couple weeks ago and had a wonderful time!  We were greeted by the staff immediately, and were offered a seat on the patio as there was live music.  The musician was fantastic and added the perfect ambiance for a nice dinner.

Our waitress was Sharon, and she had good knowledge of the menu suggesting a great red wine for myself and a beer for my boyfriend.  We decided to order a cheese plate, and I have to admit this was the one thing we were disappointed by.  The cheese was good, however it was a small portion.  The prosciutto was a bit too sweet and neither of us chose to finish the portion we were served.

Onto the entrees...we decided to go with the flat breads and share so we could sample two.  The boy chose the classic, no mushroom.  It was very flavorful and generous on the toppings.  The second was absolutely delicious!  I went with the Bacon and Squash and was impressed by the richness of the toppings without being overpowering.  Definitely a must try!

Next time we will probably go with the bruschetta to start, as we saw a few being served and they looked tasty.  Our waitress suggested dessert, however the meal was filling and we did not save room.

Overall the experience was wonderful for a date night!  The live music was not overpowering, and there was even a large birthday party going on that did not take over our experience.   The restaurant itself was nice, very open and accommodating for happy hour, however the patio really hit home for us and I am glad we sat outside.  4.5 stars for food and drink, bumped up a notch for the live music.  

Definitely a must try if you like personal attention from the wait staff, good wine, and a beautiful patio to enjoy your meal on.First time here and it was outstanding. Great atmosphere and service. The food was delicious. We will come back and also visit there other location.We had a great experience!  This is a really nice place to go for special occasions.  The booths are so private with the curtains and the service is excellent!  The food is amazing and the experience is unique.Note to self: Do NOT go mountain biking without a spare inner tube ... or at least a tire patch kit that actually works.

Too bad I didn't get my own memo until I was X miles along Desert Classic Trail at South Mountain Park this past weekend. In fact, nobody in my party was equipped with a spare. And much to my surprise, none of the other hikers/bikers whose paths we crossed along the way were giving away inner tubes. So walk with my bike, I did. After short-cutting through a wash, we ended up pseudo-trespassing through an affluent gated community and emerging deep in the 'Tuk along Ray Road. (And let it be known to all the rich folks who were mean-muggin' us through the ginormous windows of their gihugeous custom homes as we strolled the streets of their enclave trying to find our way out ... we didn't want to be in there any more than you wanted us in there, so relax. Oh ... and thanks for your offers of help. NOT. Besides, I don't think my bike would fit in the back of your Bentley had your conscience got the better of you anyway.)

After finding our way back to the real world, I used the handy dandy Yelp app on my phone to find that we were only about a mile away from a bike shop ... South Mountain Cycles. Sweetness! I can buy a new tube, maybe grab some lunch nearby, and then ride home along the arterials, getting there just in time to shower and then head to Brad E's Parka Pool Party in CenPho. Right on!

And then I get to SMC only to realize that I am sans wallet. That's right. No cash, no debit cards, no wampum for which to trade for the giant rubber donut I need in order to salvage my Saturday. But the awesome gal who greeted me said not to worry. She empathized with my sorry plight and offered to, on behalf of all of the fine folks at South Mountain Cycles, "lend" me a tube so I could get home. I love this place! I took the opportunity to look around, as this was my first visit, and quickly discovered that this was a serious bike shop. The place was immaculately clean, the other reps I overheard helping customers were very friendly and seemed quite knowledgeable, and the place was jammed with a robust inventory of road bikes, mountain bikes, gear and accessories. It's a great shop; it really is.

Back to Lindsey (I believe that was her name), my savior. She said that they were open until 6pm, and that if I couldn't get back that day to settle my debt, to try to make it in the next day by 3pm, as they were closing early in observance of the Super Bowl. My kind of place. All she asked was that I write down my name and number on a Post-it, so she had some recourse if I flaked out.

It may not seem like much, but it was a tremendous gesture of customer service; the kind that will make me return to SMC when, in the not-too-distant future, I'm in the market for my next bike.

I made it back before closing that day to clear my tab. I also purchased a few additional spares and had another look around the shop. Yep. It's solid. Well worth the trek to Ahwatukee if you're a true enthusiast.

And truth be told, I actually wrote down Brad E's name and contact info on that Post-it note. Not so I could stick him with my $10 inner tube bill, rather, I was hoping that my incredible wit and charm would render it impossible for Lindsey not to pick up the phone and call. (I'm just looking out for a brother).

But since Lindsey was conspicuously absent from Brad's pool party that night, and since I've yet to hear that Brad has received a mysterious call from a bike shop hottie, I am left to assume that my game is not what I thought it was. Brad, I am sorry. Just know that I had good intentions and that there are people out there who care, buddy.
 
And there is a killer bike shop in the 'Tuk that must be checked out if you're in the market.My parents have gone to Ganem for years and when I moved to Arizona, so did I.  even though we live in east Mesa, it is worth the drive!  The service has been excellent going over and above.  Jason, the Co-owner, is always helpful. He designed a couple of my moms rings incorporating some gems she already owned (and thus had sentimental value as well).  They jewelry turned out beautifully.... Maintaining the past and yet beautiful and uptodate. Luckily, they will get passed down. :). We could not recommend them more.I take all of my cats here. I've never had a problem with the staff. Everyone has always been really friendly and helpful and they make your pet feel safe and at ease. Anytime my husband and I take our cat Oliver in there he is in such a panic, but after a few minutes he is cuddling up to the vet techs and the vet.A favorite of mine. I had discovered Nello's back when I lived in Ahwatukee during my college days. I would dine in and take out. It was that good. The atmosphere is great. The service is great. The food is great. 

I dropped in there today, for old times sake, and it was still just as good. I had the lunch special which was a house salad with their signature tomato basil based vinagrette, an 8" pizza with homemade sausage and mushrooms, and a Diet Coke. All for $9.95! What a deal!

If you want quality pizza, go to Nello's.Good service, good price, good food, and sexy waitresses. Safe to say ill be back.These guys are amazing.  They do all the work on-site in a mobile "factory" and will even give you loaners if you need them while they work.  Outstanding service.  They use diamond-edged equipment and the blades stay sharp a long time.  They restore my blades to even better than the day I bought them.  They also sell knives -- really nice international brands that chefs use.  If every business was as good as this one I'd be a happy camper :-). Great value, reasonable.Went back to Phoenix to visit family and was intent on getting a pastrami sandwich from one of the other deli's but never found the time to go. On the way back home my daughter suggested Capriotti's and I figured it was worth trying it out. When I got there I was dead set on the pastrami, called the "Capastrami", but notice a picture of the "The Bobbie" which is real pulled turkey, stuffing, cranberry, and mayo. I couldn't make up my mind so i ordered both. They were nice enough to give me half of each to eat there, and wrapped the other halves up to take with me, making the 5 hour drive back to SD so much more tolerable. They were both awesome, but I now crave the Bobbie and am making my daughter bring me one out when she comes to visit. :)I have an extensive series of interactions with this clinic and there hasn't been a time where I haven't been pleased with the service.

Initially our dog had some serious issues after we got him from the shelter. We wound up having to go through chemotherapeutic treatments with the doctor. Dr. Mackenzie was incredibly helpful. The oncologist in Gilbert was going to charge us roughly 500 dollars per treatment over a prolonged course and Dr. Mackenzie offered to do the same treatment for significantly less. Over a 9 treatment course this was incredibly expensive. I don't feel as though we were nickled and dimed and I felt like the quality of care from the support staff and the veterinarians was top-notch.

Our most recent check up, shots and skin work-up cost ~$160, which is somewhat costly, but I truly value their expertise and care.  I would highly recommend this business to all pet owners.The 5 stars is for my regular stylist, Sarah. She's warm, pleasant, remembers details about my personal life, and ALWAYS does a fantastic job on my cut and my highlights. I even let her chop about 10 inches off last October, and she made me love even that. If you are looking for a new stylist in the area, I highly recommend her! 

Unfortunately, my accolades for Ulta end with Sarah. I made the grave mistake of going to see someone else at the salon one day when I was having a hair emergency and Sarah couldn't squeeze me in. First of all, they booked me with a "master stylist" and failed to mention that I would be charged significantly more for her services. That's a MAJOR no-no in my book; I don't mind ponying up the extra cash, but I'd like to be made aware that I'm about to do it. Second of all, this "master stylist" charged me $25 for a toning treatment that I didn't ask for, nor was I consulted about it; yes, I typically do get toner in my hair after my highlights, but I have never, to my knowledge, been charged $25 for it. Maybe this is me just being silly, but if I stylist does something to my hair without asking if I want it done, I automatically assume said thing is included in the cost of the treatment. Silly me. And finally, this "master stylist" did a mediocre job at best - nowhere near the quality I've come to expect from Sarah. My cut was pretty blah from the get-go, and just continued to get worse and worse as I neared the time for my next salon visit. Even my highlights just seemed dull and faded - they looked months old by week #2. If this experience had been my first at the salon, I would have made this a thoroughly ONE star review and would never have returned. 

As it stands, I guess I learned my lesson & will stick with my Sarah from this point forward, no matter how long I have to wait for an appointment :)

P.S. You'll have to excuse the somewhat excessive use of quotation marks around "master stylist' in my second paragraph... I just can't bring myself to truly refer to a stylist that did such a lackluster job as a "master" anything.I've been going to Dr. Roderick for years. Him and his staff have always been awesome! No complaints here.Needed a cut and my usual stylist of 13 years at another salon was booked solid. I fortunately found this place and couldn't be happier with the experience. Master Stylist, Dennis O'keefe, was amazing. I am certainly going back. Great service, atmosphere, and style! Awesome, well done!Yes, I am a fan of Roy's. You can never go wrong with Roy's Canoe Appetizer for Two - Grilled Szechuan Pork Ribs, Kalua Pork Dim Sum, Seared Tiger Shrimp Sticks, Lobster Potstickers & Crispy Spicy Tuna - all of which are simply fabulous. For my entree on this visit I had the Roy's Original Hawaiian Blackened Island Ahi - and the Spicy Soy Mustard Butter Sauce was absolutely amazing.

On top of the food, however, the service was amazing. There was a hockey fan at our table who was interested in the final Kings game (where, yes, they beat the Devils) and since there was zero cell reception where we were sitting a trip to the bar to see the TVs was the only fix available. Of course the game end was coming as the main course was being delivered and who I assume was the manager asked us almost immediately if we needed it placed under the heat lamps for a bit. To extend this good gesture it was brought back at the same moment the game was over and they were ready to enjoy the meal -- without even asking for it.

Then, if you have never been to a resort before in the Phoenix area get ready to leave the desert for a brief moment while you take in the surroundings of the Marriott location.I recently purchased my new 2013 Hyundai Elantra from this dealer.  Rob Rossi made the process quick and painless, chatting with me online about the car and helping me apply for loan approval online before even visiting the dealership.  I was able to show up with all the paperwork (no hassling with running back and forth between the dealership and home) I needed to walk out the door with my new car.  I was initially a little nervous going to a luxury dealership that sells such expensive high end cars but was quickly put at ease by everyone's friendly non jugemental attitudes, even though I showed up an hour before the lot closed.  The thing I was most impressed by was the honesty I got from Rob about everything from the value of my trade in to making sure he explained that my tags were only good for six months (I'm new to the state).  I got a great car and a great price and will certainly be returning to do business with Rob and all the other staff at North Scottsdale Land Rover!Best pizza in anthem! I ordered a large pep with garlic herb crust. The lady up front was nice and told me it would ready in 10 minutes. This was great because I only have a small lunch break. Food came out fast and hot. I will be coming back again!I was born in the valley and I was introduced to Buonos about 15 years ago.  It is the best new york style pizza in the valley!  They have since changed owners and I really like the new beer selection and menu.  I also recommend the meatball sub.I'm giving this place 5 stars because I'm a sucker for mom-and-pop places. An elder Japanese couple runs this restaurant (apparently since 1983!!), with no help. Just the two of them bussing and cooking and taking orders. 

For all the previous reviews who complain about the lack of fawning service....REALLY? The elder man handles all the tables by himself. The wife stays in the back. This couple works side by side, all day every day. They make straightforward good food. No frills. Don't nitpick--try to do what they do all year round and see where your priorities are. 

Anyways, on to the food:

Gyoza: Very good! Perfectly pan-fried, flavorful, and not too oily.

Curry Katsu over Rice: Delicious! I wish they put the pork katsu on top of the curry so that it doesn't lose some of the crisp sitting in the sauce. But it was delicious! The curry was thick and the proportion to the rice was perfect. 

Tonkotsu Ramen: Definitely did not come with the typical ramen toppings like wakame, charsiu and bamboo. It came topped with Chinese cabbage and chicken. It was almost more like Chinese noodle soup haha. If I were to judge it as a ramen, it wouldn't be good. But as a noodle/soup dish, it was good.

Soft Shell Crab roll: Okay, sushi is definitely not their strength. I would not order another roll from here. There was too much mayo (the presence of mayo was already odd), the sushi rice was not the right consistency, and the nori was soggy.  The inari that came with my tonkotsu ramen tasted a little odd as well. It's ok, they have plenty of other things I need to try on the menu!

If this review was based purely on food, I'd give it 3.5 stars. But I really appreciated how hard-working the couple works! So 5 stars all the way!I was sooooo happy with my experience at this vet. First off they are open 7 days a week and they do payment plans. My puppy just got really sick and I needed to take her in and am short on cash so that is why I took her there. I did not have any high expectations, but just wanted to know what was going on with her. It ends up she has parvo and Dr. Barnard and the vet tech (forgot her name, but wish i could mention her on here) were extremely thorough, took extra time to give me detailed instructions for at-home care, did not pressure me into trying to do anything out of my price range, and were just amazing. I am used to vets that push me to spend extra every time I go even when I tell them I can barely afford what I am there for, and having half-hearted service. This was not the case here!!!last night was my first time at this restaurant that my sweetheart, Matt,  has been coming to since he was about 3.  he did mention the no windows thing, which initially bothered me, but that was before we went inside.  it's a small restaurant with a fish tank/weird stick fountain thing that i found pretty, maybe 25 tables MAYBE, the ONLY thing i didn't like about this place was that the bathrooms were smack in the middle of the dining floor. never have seen that before.

ANYHOW, i mentioned Matt has been eating here most of his life, he told me that the owner knew him well. i was skeptical, but WRONG. she gave him a playful jest and was very nice, even bringing us some complimentary crab angels.

they bring you wonton chips before you order, like chips and salsa at a mexican food place! i was immediately ecstatic, as i have a fondness for anything deep-fried. we ordered appetizers, crab angels and egg roll. for the entree, i ordered the beef with onions which was phenomenal, although it was listed as a spicy dish all they did was put  some dried red chile peppers in which i had to bite into for any spice.  Matt got garlic beef, which had delicious flavor, but i found it a bit dry.  the portions are enormous, by the way. we both have another full meal. they bring you a tasty sweet wonton treat at the end of your meal that has mashed banana inside. i could do without the powdered sugar though.

i am sad that i've lived my life without this place for so long. definitely going back.Purchased the Discover Scuba course via Groupon, and had a total blast!  Wasn't sure I'd be able to convince myself to actually breathe under water, but was pleasantly surprised when I did.

If you'd like to see if scuba is for you, the price is very reasonable.  Only $25 for a course that runs about 3 hours.  Tell em Swoop sent ya.OMG There is no one greater, Tyler, especially (my little pal) and these guys made life so much kinder to me! I can ALWAYS trust them to keep their word... They ALWAYS stand not only behind their tires, but all the crappy tires you take to them to replace. They literally put a new tire on my car because I was in danger, and knew I had no money. They didn't care. They didn't charge me. 

Honest, kind, there is no word I could even create to convey their professionalism and courtesy. They just are...well, good. The values by which Discount Tire does business should be the standard by which ALL OTHER COMPANIES strive to emulate. Truly, I never expect this level of good (in any place of business) but you find only good here. 

I had a picture too of two of them both bending over at the same time, and from where I was sitting, it looked like their bums were touching, but I got my phone stolen, so I can't post it. 

They are so funny! Go there! Nice guys! Thanks, Tyler! 

I'll be back for those tires and wheels, kid!   :)This store has been easy to sell books at. They have a pretty good selections of books as well. The employees seem later back and easy going for the most part.As far as car dealerships go, I think this has to be one of my favorites.  I trust the employees and have always gotten very good service there.  My advisor is Chris West and I like him.  I bought my Jeep here and always get great service.  Fast too (I always wait).Dr. Randy Leavitt is the best Doctor ever.

Not only did Gilbert Pediatrics provide the greatest level of care to my newborn, they went the extra mile with their compliments and customer service.

I actually owe many thanks to Dr. Leavitt and the people of Gilbert Pediatrics for taking a thoughtful moment and giving a very considerate and well thought recommendation for my wife as to which OBGYN she should see. Turned out to be one of the greatest suggestions as he discovered certain things early which allowed us to resolve a medical condition that would have become much worse.

Thanks again Gilbert Pediatrics and I highly recommend this as the primary choice for those of you in Gilbert.I've had to bring two of my dogs to 1st Emergency Pet Care hospital several times and cannot recommend it highly enough.  Two of the times the dogs each had to stay for a few days.  I received regular calls from the vets to let me know how they were doing and was encouraged to call and drop by anytime to visit my dogs without needing an appointment.  One of my dogs had to go there for a severe ear infection when my regular vet was closed and another time for acute pancreatitis (which was life-threatening) after eating some tainted Chinese dog jerky.  My other dog was bleeding to death after routine neutering and it was discovered he has hemophilia, necessitating blood transfusions.  I believe both of my sweet dogs are alive today because of this facility.  Compassion and excellent follow up is the norm here.  The nighttime receptionist is especially nice and very concerned.  Highly recommend.Still using these guys.  On my third property with them and wouldn't think of using anyone else.  Thanks, Bob and Ben!!!Very easy going style in this shop.  You will not find any up sale.  Service is exceptional my husband has been a customer since it opened.  Don't let the bad review fool you.  They have great wrenches that work there.  Could have been a bad day.  But will all the years of service we have had we have never had a problem.  I love yelp and am an elite but some customers who are angry never give people the opportunity to make things right....before they blast someone. 

If you are in the biking community you find they have an outstanding reputation based just on referrals alone.Wow, I'm now into my SEVENTH TAX YEAR of using Michael Gallacher & Co. to do my taxes since I discovered them right here on Yelp and read the glowing review by John S.  All this time their service to me has been absolutely 5 Stars too!  My filings are complicated (to me, anyway) but these super nice folks answer any questions I have along the way through the year, followed by properly and quickly doing my IRS and State of Arizona submissions each time they come due.

I have dealt mostly with Michael Gallacher but once when I had some mid-year business with the IRS MIke Bosen here helped me take care of that and he was great to work with too!

Now if they would just have a bowl of free chocolates sitting out in the office...

Wow, what's that over there?     :-))These guys are the best.  If you are looking for advice or a problem solved, have them come out and tell you all about the problems and solutions for your a/c or heater.  Ask for Brett.  We really enjoyed working with him.  He is very knowledgeable and down to earth.  He sealed our ducts with Aeroseal.  Awesome job!  Get your ducts sealed and you won't have to keep cleaning them.  They are bringing in dust and insulation from your attic.  They can solve that problem, especially if you have asthma or allergies.  You won't be disappointed with this business.

-Jason ManningMy family has been coming here since I was a little girl. For over 20 years now...

Ray, the owner, feels like a family member. I love that he chats it up with his customers. The guy is hilarious and makes you feel like a valued customer.

On to the food...did I mention I've been coming here for at least 20 years? I have had EVERYTHING on the menu and LOVE it all! It is authentic and delicious. I lived in Hawaii for a few years after college and whenever I'm missing the islands I head over to Aloha for some ono kine grindz :)

Simple place, casual, no frills. Classic plate lunch style. 

The best Hawaiian food in AZ, no question. You need to go.Aloha Kitchen is damn good Hawaiian. After mourning the loss of my favorite Hawaiian haunt in Tempe, my wife suggested we try Aloha Kitchen. They've been there forever, but I hadn't ever made it over.

They're fantastic. Great teriyaki chicken: perfect tender and fresh and a great sauce, great macaroni/potato salad (the combo is nicely balanced, and no celery or relish, which are dealbreakers for me). They also whip up some mean bulkogi and have a great kalbi special pretty often. 

Overall, they're exceptionally tasty, well-priced, and even the mini plates are more than enough food for me, and I can put away a lot of food.Just tried this place for the first time for a girls luncheon.  Really enjoyed the atmosphere and quaint surroundings.  It was packed when we arrived, but we had a reservation (highly recommend this).  We stayed well past closing, and they were very polite and did not attempt to kick us out. 

Service was excellent, our waiter was patient with the 2 high protein, 1 full on vegetarian, and one new mommy. We probably had one no dieter in the whole group, so our order was complex, and the waiter just went with it.  Plus he was very entertaining. Always back to the table to top off drinks etc. 

Food is large quantities for what you pay for, very fresh and delicious.  A thoroughly enjoyable outing!!!This has been my primary care office for about 5 years now. They have an MD (Dr. Allen) and several physician assitants. I have over the years seen almost everyone in the office and have never had a complaint. There is almost always an appointment available quickly if you are willing to see anyone in an emergency. They always are very friendly and take more than 30 seconds with you. They listen and refer when necessary and have always interacted well with the insurance companies to get referals done. 

The offices are always clean and bright. Great support staff as well.Since Serrano ' s Mexican Restaurant chain ...quality and food plummeted  downhill ..
 This has to be what Mexican food is supposed to taste like. HOMEMADE SALSA.....Fantastic.. A bit of a wait at times...but quality food takes time.Second visit this month.  This time we brought very good friends and you know how that usually goes.    Not this time.  Absolutely 5 stars.  The service was fantastic.  The setting so comfortable.  And the food - excellent.  Four people in our party, three different dinners, all perfect.  Price is right too.Wow this place is really special! We tried a nice variety of breakfast food, all was 5 stars. 

chorizo and eggs: we are chorizo and eggs enthusiast but like it mexican style. Asked the waitress if that is how they are served here and she said yes. And they were amazing! Even better than other real Mexican restaurants

french toast: looks like when you get it is gonna be nasty too thin. But the dip they use on it of "french" or whatever you wanna call it has a tasty cinnamon / vanilla flavor. Really good, and the maple syrup they give you is tasty.

biscuits and gravy: wonderful, perfect biscuits and delicious sauce. Not greasy at all.

cookies: tried the chocolate chip and chocolate cookies. Both were nice and fresh and not too cooked and not under cooked either.Love this place, I get the chicken tacos every time.  Rice and beans are great, and the hot sauce is homemade.My favorite place to treat being sick, hungover or just really hungry. The menu is good size without being overwhelming like other places. My personal favorites are the spring rolls, the fresh sliced beef rice noodle pho and the basil fried rice.Great price for excellent service. Not the most upscale shop, but the staff is always friendly and remembers you.Best calzone around.  Great lunch menu.  Able to support large groups well.  This is a locally owned community friendly restaurant.  Did I mention the calzone?  Nom. Nom. Nom.  

Awesome to see fixes to large group service.  Have had multiple large groups on busiest times recently and the service has been FLAWLESS!The best coffee shop in the valley. Good coffee, great people that run it. Free wifi and ducks!Don't come here if you ever want to be able to go to a Jamba Juice or Orange Julius again.  The smoothies are a-freaking-mazing...I mean, I didn't think a smoothie could taste THAT good.  My friend and I were getting our nails done at the place a block or so over and she wanted to stop here because she said it was one of her favorites.  Not being one to turn down a good smoothie I agreed to go with.

She ordered a Tropical something (had coconut, pineapple and I think apple and banana?  I could be wrong but I know the first two were in it for sure) and added protein powder to it.  I ordered a Strawberry Tropical something (had strawberries, pineapple, oranges and banana).  She let me try hers first and I basically did the taste test equivalent of a double look.  What I mean by that is that I took a first sip and it was so good I had to immediately go back for another to assure myself it was real and take it all in.  This smoothie tasted like some kind of ice cream/smoothie/pina colada/heaven in my mouth!  Normally I don't like adding protein to smoothies because it adds a flavor that throws it off but you couldn't even tell in this bad boy.  It was so good I was nervous to try my own drink because I didn't think it would live up to hers.  Much to my surprise and delight, it was just as good!

I straight up told the manager/owner (?)  that I will never go anywhere else for smoothies again.  Nothing will ever be able to compare.  So like I said, if you want to be able to go elsewhere, don't try this place.  However if you're ready and willing to try the best smoothie of your life then you better get some before I drink them out of business!When the pregnant wife wants a smoothie, she's getting a smoothie.  I can't say that I'm all that familiar with smoothie shops around the valley, so I checked out the Yelp app, and found Paradise Juice.  It wasn't the closest place, but when 50+ reviewers give it 4.5 star average, we decided we should drive the extra mile or two to give it a try.  We're happy we did.

What really sticks out about the smoothies at Paradise Juice is that they're actually smooth.  A lot of places I've been too either blend them down to a juice or make them way too icy like a slurpee.  At Paradise Juice, the smoothie actually tastes like thick fruit, yogurt, and juice.  If there were any artificial ingredients in this drink, I sure couldn't tell.We have been in search of a good sushi restaurant. We finally found it! Delicious fresh sashimi and nicely crafted rolls! We will definitely be back!THE BEST Orange Beef on the planet.  Guaranteed.After reading some of the reviews about Cylco I had to come back to write my own. Cyclo was highly recommended by several colleagues and I had to try it for myself to see what the buzz is about. 

First off, for all you who come from somewhere else...Like "The Bay" or "New York" or wherever you come from...? Just as a reminder you currently live in Arizona! I'm from Louisiana where there are also a lot of great Vietnamese restaurants, but who cares...I live here. 

My most cherished dish here is the X.L. Beef Noodle Pho Soup. It includes braised brisket, rare sirloin, rice noodles and all the fixings so be prepared with a huge bowl if you get this to-go. If you think 12 bucks is too much for this bowl, go to some fast food franchise. The location is relatively small and intimate with ambient lighting in the evening. Additionally this is a BYOB establishment so feel free to bring your own wine or spirits...Try that at other Vietnamese restaurants!

Justine is mind-blowing and awesome in her own way! She's the owner and also works at the establishment. She's straight forward and not afraid to speak her mind so she's not for the weak hearted. When dining in, she makes her way to every table to ensure your dish suits your desire. 

I hope this was informative and most importantly...Enjoy your meal.Awesome place!! I rarely get my nails done because I use to bite them but now that I'm letting them grow out I would definitely be back. The husband who runs the shop was super nice, very talkative, and really professional. Made me feel like he knew me my whole life. I will recommend this place to friends and will be going back when I need my nails trim.I really liked staying here in Dec 2008. It was very reasonable, $100 per night, with no cancellation penalty. I got a suite, with small kitchen, living room, bedroom. It was quite spacious. The breakfast was OK, just stick to the bread and fruit and yogurt, the omelettes taste like the egg powder that they came from.

Best of all, it was very QUIET. That is very important to me.

Only some minor quibbles: 

It was cold the second night of my stay, and I had to spend some time trying to get the thermostat to work. The pimply teenager at the front desk said he had no idea how the thermostat worked, and said the only thing he could do was to switch me to another room. That is bad training, the front desk should know how to solve these little problems.

When coming down the street, the entrance to their parking lot is not clearly marked, which leads to confusion.

I also wish they had covered parking.I first had this Thai food in flagstaff and was in love! I figured I would try this location and it did not disappoint! 

The tofu is always cooked perfectly and I've heard the chicken is great too.

I usually get either the yellow curry or the pad thai. Both of them come in epic preportions and I have lunch for the next day. The tom kha soup is delicious!

Go for the lunch special, it's cheap and the portions are still huge. 

The service is fast and you won't get stuck waiting for food for too long!So, Andrea and I decided to head to Cheesecake Factory for my birthday celebration on Friday night.  I've always loved Cheesecake factory for a lot of reasons, and have yet to find a reason to NOT love it here.  They have such a great menu selection, the decor is always nice, and I love how theres tons of space to dine, socialize and hang out.

Anyways, I got there first so we could get a seat.  It was busy, but thats not a surprise since it was a Friday night.  The girls at the counter were nice and friendly, and told me the wait was only going to be about 15 minutes.  (not bad!)  They gave me a buzzer and I waited in the lobby area for Andrea.

Anyways, I was seating rather quickly, which was nice!  Our server was friendly and cool, and immediately asked what we would like to drink. I got some water, and Andrea got some Iced Tea.

We studied the menu for  a minute, and I ended up getting the shepards pie.  I could really have almost any one of thier dinners here, and find that I will like what they serve me regardless.  I love the variety!  

Anyways, I was happy becuase I felt like our server was available, and even tho it was busy, she didnt make me feel like that, and that was awesome!

Anyways, I still love this place and its just awesome.  Great place to bring anyone! Parents, dates, friends, whatever.   I really don't think you can go wrong here.I really like this Cheesecake Factory compared to some other locations I have been to in California.  I have had excellent experiences both with to-go and dine-in.  Kaitlin is the best to-go specialist!  She always makes sure I have what I ordered and makes sure to go through my order before I leave with it.  Joe is the server I had the last time I dined in the restaurant and he was wonderful.  I recently had to adopt a special diet and Joe really took the time to review what would work best for me.  After being a corporate trainer in the restaurant industry for several years I can honestly say both Kaitlin and Joe are great representatives of why this place is so good.  The food can only take you so far, but having a staff who does a great job and treats the customers well will bring people back for a long time to come.Best enchiladas ever. The service is just great. Maybe too efficient. But I love the place. Really among the beat Mexican I've ever had.Food was excellent! I had their Ti Risto Enchilada's and they had a great kick and flavor to them. Look forward to having them again.I come here a lot either dine in or take out. The service is always great either way. My favorite usuals here are Waldorf chicken salad (full-size), jambalaya fettuccini, and spaghetti Kung pow (chicken & shrimp). I often get the gift cards from costco whenever they have available $80 for $100 worth of gc. Even without that deal, I'd still eat here.Went in to get some ramekins, while holding a toddler in my arms, possibly not the best scenario, but it had to be done. The staff quickly asked if I needed any assitance. They happily found the size and amount I needed. They even asked what I would be making with them, gave me tips and suggestions, etc. Overall wonderful experience. Next time I will bring a stroller to look at all the awesome gadgets.Christine's service was top notch, my first visit ever was a fantastic experience because of it. Great live lobster, great shrimp cocktail, great Billie miner pie!!!Wow!  What a great steakhouse with such a nice ambiance.

The wait staff is superb, very professional and taught very well.  They use technology and everyone is welcoming. They educate on each wine that they offer.

We had such a fun experience with Moscato and Moscow Mules but got down to business with the wonderfully enjoyable food they served.

I had the peppercorn steak with chipotle mac and cheese and sauteed mushrooms.  The dish was well done and its actually making me salivate as I remember how tasty it was. 

Worth every dime.got to see furious 6 here this past weekend. 
i like harkens theaters because they're comfortable and clean. the quality of the picture and sound is also very good.

staff was nice at the box office. the girl taking our ticket after we walked in look bored out of her mind and could learn to smile, but, hey, whatever! hahaI love the fact that you can check your child into a very fun and safe play area while you go watch a movie. Kids have fun and adults have fun!!! Plus love the loyalty program and the theater is super clean and nice.Originally I chose this establishment because of it's convenience. I continue to come here over other places because of their fair pricing and excellent customer service. Not once has anyone been rude to me. I can only recall one time out of the last year when there was a glitch in my order, and it was rectified promptly. Franchise or not, this place has always felt "mom and pop" to me.Amazing Service. Great Food.It's been a few months since my first review, so I thought I'd drop a quick line and let you know that Liberty Market is a good place.  The owners are awesome and caring - and the staff (called "the brigade") and really nice, too.

Food portions are beyond generous.  Prices as low as $1.66 for an espresso or you can get a full sized, All American breakfast for $8.00.   

The environment is welcoming and great for groups. No stress or worries about being rushed out.  

Just an overall really nice "third place"Mmmmmm, I went back here last night to try their lattes as I haven't tried them yet and my friend and I are on a coffee tour of Phoenix. They were delicious! The coffee was not too acidic and the barista even made a design in the foam.... I felt like I was back in Seattle. My friends also got some dinner, but I was going out later so I passed (begrudgingly). I tried a bite of theirs, though. The roasted chicken pasta was delicious, the chicken was so flavorful and the sauce was creamy, yet light. My other friend got mashed potatoes and hummus (weird dinner). The potatoes were really good, but the hummus wasn't anything special. We also shared a bread pudding. Wow.... this was super yummy.... it has a mountain of cinnamon -y whipped cream on top..... *drool*

So Liberty market continues to be one of my fave restaurants in the valley.... everything is just so good!Love this place! First, big props to Mr. Johnston for renovating an old (for Gilbert) buidling instead of doing a tear-down which is more common in the Valley. My architect cousin was seriously impressed with the structure. I remember Liberty Market when it was a ghetto liquor store that sold some decent chorizo. It's wonderful to have this space turned into a great restaurant where you can meet up with friends for breakfast, lunch or dinner.

Breakfast is yummy. I always get the veggie scramble being a vegetarian. It's loaded with goat cheese so what's not to love? Biscuits, cinnamon buns, and sticky buns are fantastic.

For lunch and dinner, I stick with the caprese salad or sandwich. Their thin crust pizza is very good, but the caprese is exceptional so it's hard to venture from it. I've had this dish all over town and while some places may have better bread (pane bianco), the actual fillings are so much better at Liberty Market. The other item I have a hard time straying from is the sweet potato salad. It's unreal! No mayo here, instead it's tossed with chipotle (i think) flavored oil, craisins, and pecans. On a side note, I would love it if Liberty would over some veggie meat option a la Capriotti's so that I could try their other sandwiches.

Desserts all kick ass. I've had the red velvet and carrot cakes here, both some of the best I've had. If you're only going to get one dessert, make it the bread pudding. A friend of mine who lived in France for two years said it was the best in the world. It totally is! It's a great value two considering you can share it among 3+ adults.

If you come here for nothing else, you must have some coffee. As a coffee drinker, it would be an abomination for me to visit Liberty and not get something from the E61 bar. The last time I went I got an iced latte, and I was actually mad because it was *so* good. Mad, as in "Why isn't all espresso this good?" and "Why don't I drink this every day?"Need a great sandwich and excellent wait staff.    Great desserts.    Go there at least once a week.    Highly recommend Flancer's.    You will not be disappointed.Holy Pork! 

Yeah I said it. Because there are no cow products or beef here that I have seen.  I love the snack sticks, the only one I did not like were the jalapeno cream cheese, it had a mushy consistency on the inside. The snap when you bite is awesome, but the inside was just off.  Loved the spiceyness just dont care for the cream cheese part. Even though I love cream cheese.  What I do love is the Green chili ones! Those are absolutely amazing.  I also bought some bacon, that was amazing, and still have yet to get my grill working to try out the brats! will update this when I try everything else that I had bought.  :)

So far I am in Love with this place just hate how far it is from me in chandler :(Best Sushi in Arizona! The staff is friendly and they are reasonably priced. Try the seaweed salad its amazing!I have been to this store several times over the last few years, Sami and his guys are the best!  I expected all Sprint Stores to give the same sort of customer service that the guys at Queen Creek & Alma give.  Boy, was I mistaken.  The corporate store at Chandler blvd. & price freeway is the extreme oposite of how good the service is at Queen Creek & Alma School.    I was "educated" on the difference between the 2 stores by 3 employees at the corporate store.  They "corporate store" should be embarassed at the lack of customer service.   I think that the lackluster employees at the corp store, need to be "educated" by Sami and his staff of how to help a customer!I only wish I took a before and after photo to add to this post because you almost wouldn't believe it.  They turned my pitted, broken wedding ring into an amazing showpiece.  I am totally impressed with their level of service, professionalism and sheer talent.  Their estimate was 1/2 of what another jeweler wanted to charge me and I am confident that it was much better workmanship here.  Be patient and allow them the time to work on your item (it is a small family-run business) and I am certain you will be amazed and glad you did!  Thank you Rakhman Jewelers!I love this place.  This is exactly what I expect from a taco shop.  Good food, nice friendly staff and a decent price.  The burritos are huge and so flavorful.  I love the Rami Burrito; Carne Asada, Shrimp, Bacon with cheese, pico and fries!Scale of 1-10 (single visit):

I was here for an alumni event.  Fixed, catered meal.  It was amazingly delicious.  I had the Filet Mignon.  The other two choices were fish or veggies.  The veggie plate, one might think, "oh that won't be enough food".  It was a fucking mountain of veggies!  Even with my great steak, I was jealous when I saw the veggie plate.  The starter salad, sides, and finishing creme brule sealed the deal.  Even the meet & greet h'orderves at the beginning kept me centered around the food table.

It wasn't the perfect place for a speaker with awesome pictures of Mars b/c the projector situation was meh, but otherwise this was a great venue!this place was great. but they are now closed.Awesome lunch specials, Fresh, delicious sushi and sashimi.  This place is the bomb.I was very sad to see this restaurant go. I wish Anthony the best and hope he opens up somewhere else!i have yet to order something that i have disliked. 
my favorite is the thai steak noodle salad- it's a must order. the only time i was disappointed was when i discovered their salsa was just Pace from a jar. 

AND the service is ALWAYS great. They stand behind the quality of their food and if it's below standard, they will take care of you! I always look forward to going to Houston's.This place is AMAZING!!  The owner himself delivered our catered request.  The presentation was wonderful and the food was so delicious!!  I will definitely be using them for future meetings.  I highly recommend.  Thank you Romancing The Bean for a seamless and delicious experience :)This family owned business has been in the same location for nearly 40 years.  The food is amazing, the service rocks and I love the casual feel of the place.  A big plus for me is that they use real cheese, not "whiz"!Old school. Delicious. Family owned. Talk to Joe! You'll especially appreciate this place if your from back East. Philly cheese steak and chicken salad are winners.Love this place. Whenever I'm back home, I get my dry cleaning done here. Their prices aren't the lowest in town, but this place reaffirms the aphorism: You get what you pay for.  Really, really friendly staff. If you're like me you just want your dry cleaning done right and fast without the person behind the counter snarling at you.Faster than getting a burger at In-N-Out!  They got me an after-hours appointment too, so I didn't have to miss work.  Quick and seamless ... my doctor was extremely accommodating, and the staff was energetic and smiley.  This *will* be my doctor's office as long as I live in Phoenix.Krista is seriously a nail artist! I love how I can tell her a completely random nail design and she can replicate just what I was wanting if not even better! I always get many many compliments after my manicures! But most importantly I am always thrilled at the work she does and enjoy it myself! She is also very patient which is essential to a fabulous manicure! 

Krista, thank you!I love House of Yang! Their orange chicken and low mein are fantastic.Wedding Ceremony and Reception

I wouldn't change a single thing about Orange Tree Golf Resort for our wedding ceremony location and reception.  JOYCE HARWOOD-- she is your gal, a fun loving gal from Long Island and she has you covered for all wedding needs.  She even does flowers too!  No fuss, beautiful and reasonably priced. 

Here's the deal with weddings-- all things related to weddings, everyone tries to rip you off.  Not Orange Tree-- seriously, this was the best money I have ever spent.  And you can't ever say anything is affordable b/c weddings just aren't affordable, but they can be REASONABLE.

Orange Tree took good care of us and our guests.  I give everyone from the catering staff, the valet, the coordinators, the check-in desk-- the bartenders, everyone.... 5 stars!

Thanks for the memories!

PS. they have a kick ass bar too with a live band every Saturday night., well, you know as kick ass as a hotel lobby bar can be.... Lots of dancing!Why do birds suddenly appear?  Every time you are near (in the garden room cause their waiting for you to feed them) Just like me they long to be close to you (especially when you start feeding them bits of fries)  This place is amazing especially the garden room.  I wish I had a better camera phone, but just one small shot of the place doesn't do it justice.  The Food is awesome - had me a Duck Confit sandwich and a side of fries.  Yum yum yum all the way (didn't feel right feeding the birdes duck so I didn't -- it's your cousin man!)  Service was top and on the ball.  They were there when I needed them and they were gone when they needed to be gone :) Zinc Bistro thumbs up! - EnjoyFRENCH BISTRO STYLE STRAIGHT FROM PARIS. FINEST QUALITY MODERN FRENCH TO BE HAD IN PHOENIX.

In the vast wasteland that is North Scottsdale, there are but few jewels among the cookie-cutter chains. Zinc Bistro stands in defiance of those mere reflections serving the most excellent of haute cuisine in its stalwart selections at lunch or dinner.

Whether it be TRUFFLE OMELET or the ZINC BURGER or the newly added TOMATO BISQUE or the perennial CRAB SALAD (ladies-who-lunch revolted when chef updated the presentation), combined with the fabulous bread (served on request), a glass of Chateau Greysac, and the heavenly CHOCOLATE CHOCOLATE SOUFFLE (don't forget to order it in advance), it's a meal fit for a proper two-hour French luncheon.

The daily specials never cease to amaze. Just be sure to arrive by 11:30 if you hope to get one; they go fast!

My other favorites include the scrumptiously delicate and rich SCALLOPS WITH LENTILS, the PRIME FLAT IRON STEAK with a delectable reduction and aromatic rosemary, and of course, the ONION SOUP GRATINEE.

Chef Carter's pedigree shows in his food, meticulously prepared: Cordon Bleu, Chef Christopher Gross (of Christopher's, now at the Biltmore Fashion Park), and Chef Dennis Keller

Not to be missed. Whether you find yourself in Kierland town or looking for an excuse to explore what used to be Frank Lloyd Wright's "desert view" turned city, Zinc Bistro is the crown jewel.I have fallen in love with World Market so much. I love going in here because every time I see something new I want. The whole store is perfect. It's so need and tidy and always put together every time I come in here. The employees are so sweet and nice and always ask if you need help finding something. I love the food section especially because of all the small little treats and snacks they have that you can't find at a regular grocery store. All of the home accents and decorations are so well made you can just see it by looking at it, I want to buy everything seriously every time I come in here.Very impressed with this course! Impeccable everything on the course from tee box to greens. I shoot about 100 and this course was very forgiving with its hugely sloped shoulders on each side of the fairway to channel all the stray drives back into play. 

It definitely was playable like a resort course but was by no means boring. The price is pretty steep which is good and bad. Good because it keeps the course fairly quiet and not too crowded. One downside is that there are a lot of old, slow players. We were on pace for about a 5 hour round and decided to skip hole nine and pass the foursome holding us up....Glad we did considering we ended up finishing in 3 hours and didn't see anyone on the entire back nine! 

I'll definitely be coming back here since I got a Troon card and it's well worth the $70 greens fees. I recommend you check this course out at least once! The view from Arcacia #9 makes it all worth it.We've had nothing but the best care from Dr. Gibson. We're able to get in quickly to see her whenever our terrier gets into something. She's professional yet relaxed, and doesn't talk down to us, and takes very practical approaches to solving problems. I heartily recommend her services for your furry friends.Let me just start off by stating my success with dentists in the past...AWFUL! I have such bad experiences that I put off going to the dentist for a cleaning for almost 2 years. When my wife told me to try another dentist, I did a lot of research, eventually leading me to Smile Concepts. 

WOW! I couldn't have found a better dentist! Dr. Robert is way cool! Very down to earth, and after I told him my past experiences, he made me feel very comfortable. 

I am proud to say that I have finally found a dentist that I can call my own. Thanks Dr. Robert!The guy who helped me out was super friendly.  It was a prepaid return so he probably didn't make any money on me but he made a great first impression.Authentic, excellent. Always at the top of their game, awesome people.Very consistent at this location. 
I hadn't been here in years and a friend recommended we stop in. 
The place looked very clean and obviously well cared for and properly updated. I was pleased to see that the quality level was still very high. I frequent the one off of Camelback in Phoenix and that one is always solid too. 
Unfortunately cant say that for the one off of 92nd Street. Its almost like that one has a different owner.
Anyway, this location is a solid place to get good quality Mexican food with excellent service too. we arrived about 10 minutes till close on a slow night and they were very accommodating about staying open for us. Didn't even flinch when we walked in the door and asked if they were still serving. We even walked out with the staff and they were all 'thank you' and smiles. Very genuine. 
Highly recommended.As a single female that knows NOTHING about cars, I can appreciate mechanics that get the job done honestly!  These mechanics always fix my car's problem promptly and at a fair price.  I've never had to wait for service either-- maybe it's luck or maybe they are just very accommodating!  Most recently the mechanics helped me turn off a service light that goes on every 10,000 miles.  Since there was nothing wrong with the car they turned it off and didn't even charge me :)  I promised them that I would come in (knock on wood) if and when there really is something wrong with the car................and I'm sticking to my word!  :)It took me two years to find someone who could tell me who recycles all kinds of stuff, not just batteries. It's amazing what these guys take off your hands. And it's sad that not every store does what they do. You name it, they recycle it. I just dumped 5 years worth of batteries into their store, 2 laptops, CFLs of all sizes and they also take ink cartridges and much more.

Get the Earth911 App for free from the App store and use it to find out where you can get rid of all the used stuff in your life. 90% of what people use is recyclable - be part of the world you want to see. Inspire your communities and schools to take advantage of this service. BTW, the store next door to them even refills all types of ink and laser cartridges, and their prices are unbeatable. For order over $100 they will even deliver. So come on small business and schools, save money and do the right thing.My girlfriend lives just a few blocks away from this place.  We eat here maybe 3-5 times a month.  Always great service and the food is a top notch.  If you've been to Zipps, well it's the same thing because Goldie's was the first!  You won't be disappointed.My BF decided to surprise me with The Melting Pot experience for our anniversary..I've always wanted to try it and have heard great things from friends.  The Melting Pot definitely did not disappoint! Our fondue aficionado, Kayla, was genuinely nice and made this special night one to remember.  We had the spinach & artichoke cheese to start...Yum!!! Especially on granny smith apples and the pumpernickel bread pieces. The California salad was pretty good, the dressing was REALLY good and the meat and veggie portions in round 3 were perfect. It doesn't LOOK like a lot of food, but trust me when I say your tummy knows the difference! Perfect portions. Last but not least...DESSERT! We had the turtle chocolate...O.M.G. it was heaven on a strawberry, rice krispie treat, pound cake and especially the brownie! The price wasn't too shabby as we did a special for about $40 per person, but heck you're paying for the ambient experience.  Thanks Kayla for making our anniversary one to remember.  We will be back!Far and away the best place to work out in the Phoenix area.

Amazing steam room, full court basketball court with space behind the baskets and a high ceiling, state-of-the-art basketball court, friendly staff, and CLEAN.  Seriously, this is the cleanest gym I have ever been in.

Most of their classes are phenomenal, led by great teachers such as Alex Austin, who has a reputation as being the most popular yoga teacher in the valley.

And the locker room is huge, spacious, with all the amenities that you can imagine.  Including towel service.  And did I mention that it's CLEAN?

Lastly, the gym is built in an interesting way, with a nice cafe in the middle, that leads to a lot of social interaction.  There is a warmer and friendlier environment than in most other gyms I belong to.Enjoyed my experience with Scott, Jill and all the others at Scottsdale Fine Jewelers. Everyone was very knowledgeable and easy to work with.  I needed to resize a few rings, update a few pieces and  also had a  custom piece of jewelry made for me.  Everything turned out just perfect. 
I will be back!My wife and I absolutely love these guys.  Dr Resnik has been our guy since day one and for a 3-year old to be happy to go to the Dr says a lot for him.  Maybe it is because they share a birthday, but I expect it to be for the level of care he provides, and to follow up at 8:00 pm with a call speaks volumes for Dr. Resnik.  We have another on the way and it is not even a question as to who the Dr will be.I love everything bagels, and Lox Stock & Bagel  has both a wheat and white everything bagel, which are both to die for.  The store is kind of tucked away in a shopping center, off of Hayden, but it is well worth the bagel shop is well-worth the time searching.I was overjoyed to find this place.I was stuck in a day long training and was looking for something to eat during my lunch break. Sweet! This place is so friendly and has such  nice vibe. The people who work here, (the owners?) were so nice and they seemed to have a lot of "regulars" from what I observed. I don't eat bagels very often, but, I was in definite need of some comfort food after a long morning and the anticipation  of a long afternoon. I ordered an egg and cheddar cheese bagel sandwich on a sesame bagel (I was jazzed I could get the breakfast sandwich at lunchtime) with a garden salad to go. When I got into my car I took a bite of my bagel sandwich........yum!! It was perfect and the best part of my day!
I will be back!Love all their bagels and fresh veggie cream cheese. Everything I have ever tried has been good. Owners are always working and are very friendly.Due to an unfortunate situation that left me without AC on one of the hottest days of 2008 (yesterday) I was forced to find a place to spend the night where I wouldn't wake up in drenched sheets.  Thanks to a low bid on Priceline that was somehow amazingly accepted, I ended up spending the evening at the lovely Hyatt Gainey Ranch - I'm not kidding, I bid $55 and they accepted!  I wasn't even trying to get into this hotel, just looking for a nice one, cheap - I'm frugal :)  Other people were paying upwards of $300 last night, and I got in for $69 after tax - AMAZING!

I went thinking I could get lots of work done on my laptop, but when I ventured downstairs to view the grounds I fell in love and decided that I must try out their pinot grigio (on a side note, I think I should make a list of best pinot in the city because all of my reviews have to do with it).  The lobby bar is beautiful, open and airy and there were even ducks venturing in to say hello.  The staff was very polite and helpful.  A friend decided to meet me there for dinner, so while I ventured outside for a cigarette (I know, I know) I examined the pool area (beautiful) and even found a lovely terrace area with string lights above it overlooking the lake - I am in love!  I think that I must get married here.  Now, for the pesky problem of the engagement ring...just a formality, at least I know where the nuptials will take place...but I digress.

There are so many lovely seating areas and the only thing that made me sad was that I could not be there to take advantage of the lovely pool area during the day.  There were some renovations going on, but it did not affect my stay in the least and I didn't hear a thing.  The only thing I found a bit weird was that I had a corner room so my balcony was connected to my neighbors, separated only by wood lattice-work that didn't have any vines on it and was so high that I could have ducked and walked below it.  Good thing my neighbors weren't crazy psycho killers.  However, it did make the idea of sitting on my balcony, eating my lox bagel and drinking my coffee this morning a little less appealing because I would have had to stare at, and share the space with my neighbor...kinda awkward.I love this place!  If you want to buzz in and shoot a few rounds of ammo and get in and out rapidly or stay a while this is the spot!

It's always busy but never too crowed to get in.  They have expert and helpful staff.  It always feels safe as they keep a close eye on people who don't know what they are doing or if you look crazy:)

Try it out...I enjoy it so much I became a member...it's the only way to go!I've been seeing Dr. Olson for 2 1/2 years and am so grateful that we found her. I've seen chiropractors my whole life and never has one actually made a difference in my neck. 

When I began seeing her I suffered from weekly migraines. Within the first year they decreased to minor headaches occasionally. This year I had to throw away all my Excedrin and Ibuprofen because it expired in my cabinet before I was ever able to use it! :)

Now my husband goes who never had any issues but notices a difference in how his back and neck feel better! He was skeptical about chiropractors even though he saw a difference in me and now that he goes himself he tells everyone about it! 

She knows so much about natural medicine too in addition to her expertise in chiropractic. We refer as many people we can and the ones who have gone have been so grateful they did! 

They do get busy yes but they won't rush you out to get caught up. They will spend the time with you they need. 

Front office staff is always very friendly, helpful and knowledgeable.Wow....I have been to Oreganos for many times in my life but this is my first review!  To start I truly believe this is the best pizza and maybe best local restaurant that we have in the Phoenix area. I love the Chicago stuffed crust pizzas we got it with Pineapple, ham, garlic last time, and I was truly in heaven. The crust is almost pie like and it's unreal. I've had deep dish in Chicago before and this is the closest too, but yet so Arizona. I actually prefer the way Oreganos has it. Only if they had a west valley location...hint...hint.

Anyways we had great service and shared a small stuffed crust pizza. Wow. We only ate 1 slice each and took most of it home and it lasted us at few more days.

We were too full to eat a pizza cookie, but I've had so many of them before and each were great.  We were really trying to save room but just couldn't squeeze anything else in because the pizza was so filling!My child is now a month old so I guess it is safe to write this review because he seems to be healthy and happy.  Having never been to an OBGYN before I didn't know quite what to expect.  From my (a guy's) perspective the whole process was very smooth and I couldn't be happier with Dr. Deka and almost the entire office staff.  The office is clean, runs on time, and everybody is very helpful and friendly.  I made it to every single one of the prenatal appointments and Dr. Deka was always on time, very knowledgeable, and was patient with me when I asked stupid questions.  On the big day she was there to deliver our new family member and made it look easy.  Dr. Deka is a birthing rockstar and the entire process was completely enjoyable (at least for me because I didn't pass out).  If I have another child I will definitely use Dr. Deka.I love this store!  Everyone is super helpful and nice.  They have the best products. The paint is high quality and I love that they carry metallic paint, hardly anyone carries it any more and most of our client love metallic finishes!I moved to AZ about 4 years ago and for the first couple of years I would fly back to TX to get my dental work done, because it is HARD to find a good dentist!  So after much research I found Dr.Miller at Aesthetic Dentistry and I am so happy I did.  The entire office staff is so friendly!  The hygienist takes her time with you and is very thorough and gentle.  Dr. Miller filled my cavity and when he gave me the injection to numb my gum I could barely feel it at all!  Which is good because I'm a sissy about needles.  The office is extremely nice and I can't stress enough how friendly and comfortable they make you feel.AMAZING. Really. 

I just saw Shay for a cut and she was absolutely fantastic. You must see her! My boyfriend also goes to Aura and sees Kelly and always loves his hair. But back to Shay. 

So, I met her and sat down she spent a good 15 minutes on my consultation. It was great and made me feel instantly comfortable and assured I was in good hands. I brought in a few pictures and we talked about what I saw and wanted and she gave me her opinion on if I wanted to tweak the picture a bit. 

Then Ally washed my hair and applied a conditioning treatment ($15 but SO worth it. My hair feels amazing). She gave me most relaxing scalp and neck massage. She was polite and made conversation but not fake. I ended up just wanting to sit and relax and not chat much and she totally picked up on that. Some places feel forced to make conversation and it ends up not being that relaxing. I really wanted to tip her but I didn't have any cash on me. The shampoo/conditioner treatment was THAT good. She also didn't ruin my make-up at all. 

Shay then cut my hair with precision and styled it perfectly. It is EXACTLY what I wanted. I mean 150%. It looks better than I expected. And I have never had that feeling leaving a salon after getting my hair done for 12+ years. Usually the cut is pretty close or the styling is off and I have to go home and flat iron my hair again because the stylist left pieces frizzy. I don't think I am that particular but I think some stylists try to rush after the cut to get to their next client or just to be done.  Nope. Shay did a perfect job. I felt like I could walk out and leave for a night out. 

She also did a dry cut on my hair (after styling) so she could make my hair even more perfect. She told me she dry cuts so that it looks exactly the way it should when styled the way I normally do. Makes sense, but no other stylists I've been to did that. (And I'm not talking a trim after a flat-ironing my hair, I mean she spent another 20 minutes going through it). 

She also does color and throughout the cut we talked about my color options and what I was unhappy with. I told her about a horrible experience I had with another salon in the area (who shall remain nameless but they only have one review this year and it's NOT good *hint hint*) She explained to me what probably went wrong at the other salon and what needs to be done in the future. She was understanding and empathetic about my experience and NOT FAKE. She also didn't talk about "next time we can fix the color..." it was nice because she wasn't being fake or pushy just to try to get me for more money. She was just giving me her opinion and I could do with it what I wanted. Much appreciated.

Even after the cut we spent another 5-10 minutes talking about the color (I kept bringing it up, they are SO not pushy on products and services) and she brought out swatches to show me. I have never done this before but I made my next appointment right then. 

PROS:

 - great location. there is a Chipotle, Aj's, Starbucks, nail salon, and Chinese restaurant all in the complex. So it has everything you need. It's also easy to get in and out of the parking lot (although if you make your appointment between 11am and 2pm it may be packed due to the lunch rush). 

 - great salon. it is small but you only notice it when you walk-in. i've been to other salons that are much bigger but once you're in the chair you have just as much space as other places. 

- NOT PUSHY. you can buy if you want, no one pushes products or services. they stock Kerastase and Bumble and Bumble. 

- Friendly. Everyone there was super nice and genuine. 

- Pricing is fair and reasonable. I spent over $400 for a cut/color and at the salon that shall remain nameless and usually spent about $250+ at places like Rolfs and Mane Attractions

CONS:
 - none!!

Recommendations:

See Shay. I think her cuts are a bit pricer (she's one of the top stylists) and it was like $70 for the cut. (I was referred to the salon by my bf so I saved $20). if someone else refers you you both get $20 off. 

If her prices are a bit too much see Kelly. I think she charges around $50 (that's what my boyfriend pays, not sure if men's haircuts are different but his hair always looks great). But you can always call and get pricing. They told me the price for my next appointment upfront ($150 for an allover color and cut).

Final Notes:

I've been to Dolce Salon & Spa (Yuck) , Rolfs (Meh) , Mane Attractions (Good), and Fate Image since I've moved to Arizona seven years ago and this was BY FAR the best experience I have ever had. Honestly, I had GIVEN UP on finding a good place. Rolfs is super expensive and super snobby. It's not even that relaxing. Mane Attractions was fine but I haven't been there in about 5 years and the Biltmore area is a pain to drive to. 

It was down to Aura or Jo Paris but I didn't want to drive to Old Town since I live 2 minutes for Aura. 

GO TO AURA.There I was...Sunday morning...fresh out of an awesome sleep. My three year old awakes, and immediately wants pancakes. I am ill prepared for this scenario. So, the logical choice is for us to head to McDonald's on Shea, just around the corner from our place.

But, it's FOOTBALL DAY!!! You know...the kind of day where you stay in your pajamas all day, and bum it up. There isn't a snowball's chance in hell that I'm going to be presentable to the public.

What do I do? I know...drive thru!

As we're in line waiting for our McDonald's breakfast to be ready, it dawns on me...we're out of beer...and it's 10:00 in the morning on a Sunday. NOW what do we do?

Lucky for me, Liquor Vault Drive-Thru is directly behind me, and they're already open for business!

The sheer convenience of this establishment is reason enough to give this place 5-stars. I mean, drive-thrus were invented for just these types of slothful situations.

When I pulled up to the drive-thru, I asked for a Miller Lite 18 pack of bottles. The attendant pulled away for a minute, checked the refrigerator, and then came back with a 12 pack and a 6 pack. He told me that they were out of the 18-pack, yet he still just charged me for the 18-pack price. 

That's the kind of customer service you want...the establishment is out of stock on the thing that you want, so they make concessions to make up for it.

The piece de resistance was that the gentleman was observant enough to notice that my daughter was along for this early morning party-planning-committee trip. He threw in a couple of lolipops for my co-pilot.

What a cool establishment, and an ingenious service idea!I can honestly say I've had 9 different dishes from their menu and each one was outstanding. My latest favorite is their salmon salad.I feel terrible that I forgot to do this sooner. My wife and I had dinner here sometime about a week ago and had THE BEST service possible, I hope I'm getting his name right but think his name was Aaron. This awesome server could not have possibly given us better service. Friendly, attentitive, and professional! We will continue to visit this location as everytime we go the food and service are awesome!Simply put its all about service and conversation when you're at a brewery.  I go here often for lunch and have a mix of bartenders between Jessie and Nicole.  Both gals are amazing and super friendly which is great for deciding whether its a luncheon or a dinner ordeal.  I also really admire the GM Marie for making the rounds and honstely didn't know she was the lead because she assimilates seamlessy into the normal operations until there is an issue that needs to be addressed.  The unsong heros are definately the bus boys because they are always on the watch for items that need to be taken away.  I go to both locations often but chose this one to review because I actually go here with the intent to eat and not just drink.  The Tempe location is more hipster and smoker oriented but its a place that you go with a group of peeps looking to fuel up on pitchers so I don't really scrutinize the service or atmosphere as often.  Service is always good and the staff are spot on.  If you live or up in the North Scottsdale area and are looking for either a casual business lunch or a casual evening 4 Peaks all the way.  The food specials are good and you can never go wrong with fresh brew...my favs are Oatmeal Stout, Peach Ale and the Pumpkin porter when its in!!!Yummy!!! This place has the best soup. I've ordered several of them and they are all so good. The prices are reasonable and they have great healthy options. And they put lavender in their salads which is suprisingly good!Shea has new seats!

They just re-vamped the theatre and its even better.  Service was always good, but now they have the same new-style seats they have at Scottsdale 101 & the cine capri.  They re-did a bunch of stuff - nice job, Harkins!

I love the seats & this theatre!Phillip Waring is a wedding pro. When you're having your first (and only!) wedding, it's incredibly reassuring to be in the hands of someone who knows what he's doing and can gently guide you from step to step. And incredibly, even though he has probably officiated a ton of weddings, he is still incredibly sincere and joyous, and treats you like you are the most important couple in the world. He will customize the ceremony according to your wishes, guide you through it, make sure your pictures are great, and even turn in the license for you!I love The Good Egg and especially this location.  The food and service is always consistent for my family and I.  They have an extensive menu of traditional American breakfast choices in addition to healthy options for the health conscious.  When you get sick of being served dessert for breakfast (aka PanCAKES), give this Good Egg location a try.Absolutely the best golf experience I've ever had (sorry Troon North). Played both courses and I prefer Saguaro. There's not much I really would need to say here. If you golf, you get it. Go here, you will not be disappointed.Remember that place "where everyone knows your name?" This is it. You can show up alone, with your love or with friends and if you are open to fun and new friends, you will find them here. The owners make sure that there is always a great roster of musicians. If you haven't heard Notes from Neptune, Kyle Phelan, Javier Garcia, Stephanie or Steve Krum, come on down. Sit on the patio, enjoy the beautiful fountain and sip  great glass of wine. Better yet, join the Wine Tasting Club and be sure to visit at least once a month. From pastas to gyros, to hummus, to salads and s'mores, you'll find a tasty and inexpensive meal -- and lots of reasons to smile and Just Enjoy Life!If your looking for the real deal Mexican food go to SeniorTaco.  If your looking for a place to eat late night go to SeniorTaco.  There's a reason these guys have been open since 1974.  Everything I get is good so I won't recommend anything in particular.Much better service than last time.
I'm going back to this Denny's. 
The places looks great too after the remodelwithout a doubt the best dentist I have ever used.  Beverley the receptionist is incredible and have never had an entire staff treat me so well.  I highly recommend Dr. Carr.Hands down one of my favorite sandwich shops in the Valley. I don't eat meat often but Dilly's is one of those places that I "cheat" for because it is so good. Never had a bad experience, will continue going for a long time.pretty cool mall. had a bunch of outlets shops... i wanted to stop by the cactus candy store before leaving Arizona, but we couldn't because of the time. so i was very excited when i spotted a candy store in the mall and made a mad dash to get the goods. i was so elated that i bought three boxes of cactus candy. the lady there was helpful in explaining the various types of cactus candy. after gabbing with her, she even recommend several places that served authentic indigenous Arizona/Phoenix cuisine to grab dinner...

ya have to try cactus candy if given an opportunity. it's an interesting treat!Breakfast. Go for Breakfast! -choose one of the innocuous seeming egg and potatoes breakfasts, w/ biscuits and a side order of gravy.  It's $6.75, and you may think it will all fit on one plate. However, you'll quickly note that there's twice as many hash-browns as anywhere else, and the food is incredibly fresh. Everything home-style. There's no way you'll finish it or find a place that tops.

...service and coffee is great too.I loved this place.  It's kinda tough to find but right next door to the d.e.s. building.  Food was good and the price was even better.  For some reason the price is listed as $$ but this was least expensive thai resaurant I've been to in the valley...My girlfriend and I had dinner and thai tea for under $20.  Great atmoshphere, excellent service.  Will definitly go there again.This is one if my favorite places to come, they have a great happy hour, even when it's not happy hour the drinks are very reasonable. The staff is friendly. This is a great place to gather with your friends to hangout and catch a few games on one of their many tvs. If a game isn't on you want to watch they're more than willing to put it on a tv for you unlike many other places.this was our favorite in Albuquerque and its here, soo glad and so good... the pizza is  awesome and the hot wings super spicy!We've been with Apollo Cleaners for 10 years and are consistently super pleased with the service and the delightful people we deal with.  Patrick and Cathy are committed to being green and sustainable in their business and it gives me peace of mind to know our clothing has been cleaned chemical-free!  The turn-around is fantastic!  And I am always impressed that Patrick remembers our names.  That's so important in building customer loyalty!  "Where everybody knows your name" as they sang in Cheers!I'd been to the chain pet stores getting fish for my son.  I got bad information or no information and ended up killing fish because of the bad information.  They sold me tropical fish but when asked if I needed a heater, thermometer or anything beyond the tank, food and gravel I was told "no, not with those types of tropical fish.".  Boy were they wrong (both Petsmart AND Petco employees told me similar stories).  Six dead fish later....

I finally remembered seeing Pets Inc over on Mill and Southern and stopped by the store to talk to someone about what had been going on with my freshwater fish.  

Pets Inc was FANTASTIC!  Not just one person, but every person that was working in the fresh water area that day was so very helpful.  They weren't just there to make a sale.  Matter of fact, they wouldn't LET me buy fish that day as they went through a protocol that I needed to follow with my tank to prepare it for new fish.  

They were extremely patient with my young son, even when he had tons of questions that many would find bothersome.  They took the time to really listen to both of us and to give us their time, great information and  a boost of confidence that we so desperately needed in the raising of fish.

I highly recommend Pets Inc. to anyone needing a great pet store run and staffed by people who have the knowledge to back up what they sell.

We won't be going anywhere else for any of our fish/reptile needs.This is by far the best Indian cuisine in the Valley -and I have been to several trying to find a good once since moving here 5 years ago!  They are hardly busy -so you get right in and sit to eat immediately -great for a work day lunch as it is quick!

I have only attended during the lunch buffet which is always phenomenal!  They always have the following on their lunch buffet menu (I frequent often!)

Chicken Tikka Masala -my fav. chunks of white meet in butter/tomato sauce
Tandoori Chicken -chicken grilled in a Kiln with onions -moist and yummy
Paneer Masala  -goat cheese cubed in the same great butter/tomato sauce
The fried veggie crips are delish! (can't remember the formal name)
Basmati Rice (so tasty you could eat it by itself!)
Kheer --best rice pudding ever! (besides moms! :-)
Gulab jamun -little donut hole type treat soaking in a light syrup -yum!
...and this is a small sampling of what is on the buffet!

Service is fabulous and they are very friendly -but beware...if you come in often enough -they treat you like family and will remember your fav. drink and offer to bring you one when they greet you!Thank god for Ted's Hot Dogs!  There is nothing better in life than a charbroiled hot dog with tasty onion rings and a soda.  My cohorts at work turned me onto Ted's and I kept it secret from my wife.  Yes, I'm that cruel.  Then one Sunday morning we were watching one of those Top 10 Hot Dog shows on the Food Network or Travel Channel.  She said to me, "I wish we could have a great hot dog today."  I broke down and wept, confessing my multiple sins of all the times I tip toed to Ted's to enjoy a chili footlong dog and an all beef dog with the works. She, loving me, immediately hit me a couple of times about the head, and said "Get dressed bitch - lunch is on you."  Now, if you ever meet Marie, you'll come to know that she is sweet and understanding, but on that day, I found one of her few limits.  Needless to say, we had a great experience at Ted's that Sunday.

REMEMBER:  They only take cash.  No debit cards, no credit cards, no bartering.Hot dogs dont get much better than this. The chili cheese is my favorite.I love reading about my yelp friends' vacation finds.  I always bookmark them because although I never know when I'll be in that part of the country, I do know those bookmarks will eventually become tourist destinations for me.  My yelp bud Tim S. knows his comfort foods.  When he raves about a pizza in New York, a cheesesteak in Philly, or a hot dog in Phoenix, I'm so there.  Wait a Hot Dog in Phoenix?  That can't be right.  This ain't Chicago or New York.  Or is it?  Ted's is a Buffalo, NY Hot Dog blooming right here in the middle of the desert, transplanted in 1983 from it's 1927 original wintery environment.  

Sometimes when you are a food tourist, it's ok to over order and try a few different things.  It's not ok for your waistline, but "Hey you're on vacation!"  At least that's what I tell myself.  And I got absolutely no judgement from Ted's when I ordered a Regular Hot Dog, a Jumbo All Beef dog, an Italian Sausage, and a Bratwurst.  Chased down with some Onion Rings and a Loganberry Milkshake.

So what makes Ted's so good, is the charcoal.  As I came in, they were adding a bunch of new charcoal to the grill.  It gives the dog a nice smokey flavor and a good snap.  Each of my 4 dogs/ sausages were excellent and it's tough to choose which one was best.  I actually think I preferred the basic hot dog, because of the soft grind of the wiener offset with the crunchy slightly charred casing.  It was texture heaven for sure, and I got this one dressed in classic Chicago style - chopped onions, relish, tomato, pickle, and yellow mustard.  I dressed the all beef with kraut and chopped onions - excellent dog although a little firmer in texture, as most beef dogs are.  

They have polish, bratwurst, italian, and a white hot under their sausage menu.  I read a couple of slightly negative reviews on the white hot, so while it sounded very interesting, I had no room to put one down on this visit.  Italian and Bratwurst it was for me and I got them dressed the same way with grilled onions and peppers.  I opted for the hot sauce on the side.  The hot sauce pairs perfectly with the Italian Sausage.  This is a nice and spicy Italian.  Adding the hot sauce seemed to just reinforce that same flavor, rather than cover it up.  Ted's has an interesting home made hot sauce.  If you made a salsa out of hot dog condiments, this is what you would get - relish, onions, in a ketchup vinegar base.  For the bratwurst I went straight up with some brown deli mustard.  Awesome!   Next visit, I'm trying a chili cheese dog for sure.

The onion rings taste like an onion loaf, but not super peppery.  They have a great batter here, but I like that you can still taste the onion and there isn't too much batter.  The Loganberry shake is a must order.  The perfect sweet creamy drink to offset the spicy Italian Sausage.  From what I understand loganberry is a Western NY flavor, because you don't see it around these here parts too much.  It's like a red blackberry.  I have no idea if it was loganberry flavored ice cream or vanilla ice cream with loganberry syrup.  Whatever it is, order it and you will be happy.  I can't wait until the next time I'm in Phoenix (or Buffalo) to get me a charcoal grilled dog at Ted's. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/teds-hot-dogs-tempe?select=HYh6Dv4htWxebTjRMwgh6g#OCLoB-p-pzUUNcCib8xK-QThe PV is the ultimate dive bar. It should get some sort of national award. It has the most lewd and original bathroom graffiti in the world. There's holes in the walls and the ceiling. There's always something unexpected on the TV. The last time I was there I was watching Titanic with subtitles and drinking double shots of absinthe. The drinks are made so stiff that if you drink more than 20 dollars worth you'll be dead. Avoid the scene certain nights. That one guy who walks around squawking like a parrot will probably get on your nerves. Sometimes hardcore bands take over and play so loud your ears might start bleeding.They get through a line of six or more customers in a couple minutes, prepare your order while you pay and wait.  In about five minutes they have your order packaged, call your name and then BRING it to you.  If you are eating your food here they bring it to your table.  
.  
I like this location, great service and friendly staff every time.Expensive but WAAAAAAY worth it!

Just the best fitness center bar none!I love this gym.  I decided to go to this gym because of its daycare.  They have a separate section for infants and only allow four babies per caregiver.  In addition to that they have tons of classes and a lot of different activities including rock climbing.  I love their indoor and outdoor pools.  I really appreciated that they don't do the hard sell when you go check out the gym.  Goodbye LAFitness!Great little Italian place in a random strip mall on Warner. When I used to live in that area I would go often but haven't made it out in a long time. The menu is not the heavy, cheesy, red-sauce laden type of Italian, but good, classic dishes made with fresh ingredients and light, delicate but perfectly flavored sauces. But they don't skimp at all and give you portions to leave you very satisfied. The focaccia bread served at every table is heaven.  And the daily specials are a sure bet for a great meal. Even their pizza is perfection - fluffy, perfect amount of mozzarella.  It's a comfortable and dimly lit restaurant with a bar, too, with drink specials, so it's not a "sleepy" restaurant and gives just enough buzz in the atmosphere.I used to be afraid to go to the dentist before Dr. Mathews worked on my mouth. I chose Dr. Mathews because he had great reviews and was willing to bill both my insurances, which not all dentist are willing to do. I got several fillings and he made me very comfortable. My husband also got some fillings and said he was happy with Dr. Mathews. We both think he's a great dentist.I am absolutely in love with the YAO. The food is huge and is the best Chinese I've had in the valley. Great bargain and the folks are most awesome. They do everything they can to make you feel at home and they made me feel like family and they're just being themselves. Just an awesome experience you'll keep coming to over and over again.After moving to Arizona 8 months ago, I wanted to find a vet for my cat. Nothing was wrong with him, just wanted to establish a relationship with a local vet for routine exams and in case anything major were to happen. I decided to try Gilbert Veterinary out and I'm glad I did! Everyone from the moment I walked in to the moment I walked out was super nice! The vet took her time and didn't rush me at all! I inquired about a couple of  products for my cat and they gave me pricing but also told me that I could buy the same thing at the local pet store or online and it might be cheaper. Wow! When I was checking out, I was sure they forgot to add something to the bill because the price was way cheaper than I expected, nothing was left off the bill and it was my correct total. What a bonus! Great vet!!My little mini dachshund Wendy unfortunately suffered a foot injury earlier this week. After some research I found Arrow Animal Hospital to be one of the only animal hospitals that takes monthly payments instead of requiring the whole payment up front.  I took my little Wendy in to get her foot checked out and after an X-Ray it was discovered that her foot was broken in 4 spots. Dr. Breeann Flores was so warm and caring toward my poor little dog and Emily was so kind and patient with all my questions - and I had a lot of them. They gave me 3 options to help my Wendy heal. The first two options were surgery or casting, at a cost of $1200 or $800. Unfortunately, even with a payment plan these were not options that I could afford. My 3rd option was to keep my little Wendy in a kennel at home for most of the day and keep her off her foot until she's healed up. They provided me with plenty of advice and pain medication and ani-inflammatories for Wendy. I really appreciated that even though I wasn't able to pay for an expensive procedure, they still reassured me that they were there to help Wendy heal and provide her with the pain killers she needs in order to be comfortable. They even let me keep Wendy there for a while so I could run to Walmart and get her a cage and a bed and some other comforts before I took her home to do her time :(   If I could give more than 5 stars I would. A big thank you to Dr. Flores and Emily for softening an upsetting situation.I've had an account with Arizona Central Credit Union for years and I love them.  They have excellent customer service and low fees.  The couple of times I've had account issues, one stolen card and one unauthorized debit, they took care of the matter immediately and credited my account for the missing funds.

I used to have another checking account with a different Valley credit union, and they were dismal to deal with and cost me so much in missing money (they let my husband at that time who was NOT on my account, access my account and he took all the money in there each time.)  Anyway, I've never had a single issue with AZCCU. 

Another big plus for AZCCU is, like other credit unions, I can make a deposit or withdrawl at any other credit union because they are all linked by something called shared branching.  That is very nice if I need to make a deposit to my account and I am miles away from a AZCCU branch.The only problem I've ever had here was one in October when they were out of pumpkin, but they said all Einsteins in the area were. Aside from that, I've always enjoyed this location, and this morning I even went in barefoot without incident :)This is my favorite gym in the valley. I've been a member here for like ever. Thier classes are the best. Cycle at 5:45am is the best. The kickboxking used to be the best but that one guy left and now I never go to kickboxing anymore. 
The equipment upstairs is great. I personally like the older version of elipicals seemingly meant for taller people. The pool at this location is also good because its away from most of the gym. 
I've never gotten weird perverted looks at this gym.
I like how they remodeled the locker rooms. The sauna is great.
My favorite gym :)We're not at Olive Garden anymore!!!!

Thank goodness!

My mom and I came in Wednesday night for dinner.  We wanted to go somewhere we don't usually go.  It was pretty busy around 6:30 pm and we were we seated right away in a booth.  Our server (sweet young girl) asked if we've been to Carrabas which we said "not in a while". She then mentioned everything is prepared fresh so you can easily omit ingredients from your dishes if you prefer.  Cool!

My mom started with a Riesling and I tried the peach sangria.  We were both happy campers when the yummy warm bread arrived with seasoned olive oil dip.  

We split the harvest salad which had beets, hazel nuts, carrots, goat cheese...pretty good! Not some bagged salad!  Wow that's nice for a change!

We also shared the spaghetti with italian sausage and oven pizza with mozzarella and pepperoni.  We enjoyed both dishes and ate it all!  Love how the mozzarella on the pizza was golden melted and well cooked throughout with a crisp bottom.

What a nice home cooked meal with quality and service. Our server was friendly and personable- truly taking the time to do it right! Kudos to the kitchen for serving up steaming hot fresh & flavorful italian!I have been coming here for a few years now for Vet needs an grooming excellent Dr an Staff always treating our dogs wonderfully.Rubio's currently has the Coastal Trio which includes the shrimp, fish, and tilapia tacos.  I recommend it to try all three taco types at once, very yummy!  For $8.49 it can be beat if you like seafood tacos.After a day of lousy customer service by Century Link it was quite refreshing to have an employee go out of their way to provide service! I had made a purchase at the store and ordered a desk. About a half hour after I left the store I received a phone call from Morgan, someone turned in my debit card and she remembered me and researched and called to tell me. Thank you Morgan!Great for lunch and dinner the freshest sushi huge servicesWhen it comes to going to a mall this is the one. I know most people complain that this mall has too many "kids" running around, which is true, but you'll get that with every mall. 

Metrocenter Mall is a cesspool of failing businesses that all moved away and Scottsdale Fashion Square hosts "beautiful" snobs who live off of their husbands credit cards. Arrowhead Towne Center has actual normal people.

Stores worth shopping at:
Macy's 
Dillard's
Dicks
Forever 21
Hot Topic
Puppies N' Love (how can you not love puppies?!?!)
Aeropostale 
American Eagle
Gamestop

I know many people would disagree but this really is a great mall to go to.I have taken my road and mountain bikes in for repair and Ted always offers a fair price. He is definitely passionate about what he does. Any time one of my bikes are down, I know I can have it fixed within a few days. Roadrunner is definitely worth taking your bike to.Being out of town visitors for a few days,we've eaten breakfast, lunch and dinner in this restaurant. The service was great every time, the food was really good and the servings extremely generous.  The "little less" tri-tip dinner was plenty of food and the tri-tip was done medium rare as requested.  This is one of our "go to" restaurants when we are in the area.the people are really friendly and prices are reasonable. My dog had a fox tail stuck in her paw, and they help me on the things i can try to fix it. this is a great place.I am a resident of Litchfield Park and the Wigwam is the perfect place to unwind. Whether your a resident or vacationer the amenities of the Wigwam are awesome.  The Wigwam bar inside the lobby is the perfect destination. Incredible service, great food, etc. Katy, Sandra, and Jaclyn are awesome examples of the "Wigwam experience."I've been to Old Pueblo more times than I can count. Hands down the best chips and salsa I've had. Ever. The staff is friendly and attentive and the food is fantastic. My favorite is the carne asada and I always have enough for lunch the next day.Definately worth the drive, although the new road you take isn't in my phones GPS so it thinks you are going the wrong way. 

Price is high but one of the best zoos I have been to. Highlights for my family including my 2 year old son include getting very close to animals, rhino and of course feeding the giraffe. Very clean. Went on a Thursday and many times we were the only people on sight. Almost felt like we owned the place. 

Would certainly recommend to anyone and will return again!I walked across the country for 250 and stayed at countless amounts of hotels. This was one of the best hotels I stayed at! The room was ridiculously clean, very comfortable beds and plenty of room. The staff was kind and made me very pleased. The breakfast topped it off for me as they had a full buffet with anything you would expect at a hotel and more. All together it was a wonderful hotel and I would recommend it to anyone.We first stopped into Arrowhead a couple weekends ago. My hubby knew he wanted a Harley, but we were not sure what model. We met Tanya and Stacy on the sales floor. They were both great answering all our questions (we had a lot!) Luckily for us they were having demo days the next weekend where we were able to ride the different models to help us pick exactly what we wanted. 
Demo days was awesome! It's a good thing to because we pretty much spent the whole weekend there. Neither of us felt any kind of pressure to buy and the entire staff went above and beyond to get us financed and into the exact bike we wanted. 
Thankfully this process was much different from our first motorcycle purchase experience.Through the entire process both Tanya and Stacy were there to help with anything we needed. I honestly feel like everyone working there was just as excited as we were when we finished the deal. We feel like we have a new family. If you are in the market for a new motorcycle you have to stop in and talk to the staff at Arrowhead Harley. They are great and the showroom is beautiful. That being said..Let's ride!Nice place, variety of food.  Excellent service.  The menu is a little long and several pages.  It was nice to see the managers making sure the food was going out correctly before the customer received it.this place is great.

hawaii cheap prices for good quality sashimi grade fish.  some of the cuts may be a little lower quality, but it's definitely worth it for the price.  12/lb for salmon, comparative to the 30/lb at whole foods.Always a great environment and amazing food!! Shrimp Scampi Pizza, Wings, and Stromboli...Thank you, Amy (Bartender)!Real good ! Big portions I mean huge. Great flavor, a must try if in the area.Ordered chicken noodle soup on a cold day just like mama use to make. Then followed up with a half beef brisket sandwich on rye, meat was lean and seasoned to perfection. 
This place I'd always busy and locals know this secret spot in green valley.
Definately worth going for that new York busy deli feel.You know when you really want a sandwich and you have that perfect image in your mind of this stacked up beauty of a creation?  It has that toasted bread, fresh colorful veggies and those perfect slices of cold cuts all stacked perfectly as if it's a tribute to the sammich gods?  That's exactly what they make here, it's the sandwich of my dreams a SILF if you will.  The consistency of quality here is amazing and I've never been disappointed by them at all.

The staff always makes you feel welcome and greets you as soon as the door is opened, almost too early... I mean they're not quite waving at you as you park but they notice you right away.  They always offer a slice of their fresh baked breads and ask if you want a little butter on it.   The breads are perfect and there is really not trick to them at all, their secret is they just made the bread the way people used to.  No additives, no flavor enhancers, nothing besides quality ingredients and a staff that knows what they are doing.  As the girls behind the counter have been there as long as I have been coming I think they have it down by now.

There is also an assortment of gift baskets, cookies, spreads and other nice touches that would be great for a gift or an office party.first off this was my first dealership purchase and i was looking for a used car in my price range and my first time here wasn't so good they tried to lease me a brand new car when I couldn't afford it and they told me I wasn't going to find a used car in my price range and that I was wasting my time... So I went in a week later and spoke to josh (Brillo) smith and he lined up 5 cars in my price range and he showed me every car, the car I chose also has a  bumper to bumper warranty, josh showed me just how a dealership experience should be and I urge anyone looking for a used car to get into contact with josh I won't regret it that's for sure! Thanx josh and ToyotaI will definitely be back whenever I'm in Vegas again. Found this place on yelp because I was craving a michelada to cure the alcohol withdrawal from punk rock bowling. 
My significant other and I shared oysters that were fresh, super clean and delicious. What I mean by clean is they did not taste like the ocean floor nor did they have any shell chips from being pried open. 
I had the shrimp cocktail which was ok-good but ok. My boyfriend had the camarones a la diabla which were perfect. Great flavor and not too spicy that he couldn't enjoy them. 
Micheladas were perfect! We also shared a shrimp empanada since the reviews on here all raved about them...they were not kidding. It was better than my cocktail. 

The restaurant was busy but service was good. They have a few televisions and even live music so it's also pretty loud; which if you're Hispanic you should be accustomed to that. LoLI have been flying with West Air Aviation for 2 years now and the people, planes, facilities are great.   They have a wide variety of planes to fly and you can get all your ratings at a great rate and in one place.  
Daryl Governale is the Chief Pilot and is always courtious, friendly, and a   good, patient trainer.  He provides all the necessary background you will need to learn to fly proficiently and safely.
Jim, the owner and his wife Jan always make you feel welcome and right at home.

They have an Army Trainer T-41, Cessna 182RG, Cessna 172R, and other 172's to get you flying right away.  They offer the 1937 Beechcraft Staggerwing for sight seeing and flying.  I have flown it several times, what a great vintage airplane!

I hightly recommend the place,people, so why wait, go and get your ratings now.This tasty Bacon Clubhouse Burger had a perfect zing of flavor that popped right after the first bite, and sent my taste buds on a first class trip to party city. As the box says, 'the different ingredients "mingle" on an artisan roll', and they form a flawless blend that puts a smile on your face. I would recommend it to anyone and everyone, as I find it is one of the most scrumptious things on McDonalds menu. They also provided fast, friendly, and accurate customer service. Definitely the best Mcdonalds out there!Went back again on a week day. There were about 3 other parties besides mine there, so service was amazing! I tried their special for the day: seafood linguini. Holy MOLY!! It was SOOOO DELICIOUS! There were lobster, crab, clams, muscles, shrimp, calamari, scallops, oh my is right! The flavor was perfect: not too fishy despite having the whole Atlantic in my meal, the sauce wasn't too rich so I could keep eating without getting tired of it, and the meal itself was ginormous. I ate for about 30 minutes straight and didn't make a dent in it. My leftovers fed my boyfriend and I for 2 days!! MmmMMmm =P Plus, I was able to watch the basketball game that was playing in the bar section. What a perfect dinner!

LOVE IT!They always do a good job.  Even when it is very busy, I haven't waited more than 20 minutes.  Plus, the hours are great; I love going early in the morning when there is no one out . . . :)

Note that I only go there 1-2 times a year, and I have been there maybe 4-5 times total (as I don't actually live in Vegas), which may not be a representative experience.Great prices for purchases, and even better then great for bulk purchases. The staff is friendly and the facilty is clean, which is something i always like to make a note of and share. Great place to pick up cleaning equipment and chemicals in large amounts.Clean, friendly staff, best gas station subs (10x better than subway) in townFor an Italian chain restaurant, this place is wonderful!  (Or maybe, I'm just not that high-brow)

I love Carrabba's food and this location is very nice.  I have never had any problems when dining here and I do love to come here fairly regularly.  This place kills Olive Garden for both being chains restaurants.  Yes, it is a fair bit more expensive though.

I love love the bread with the herbs and olive oil they serve here.  And my number one entree that literally beckons me back is the Spiedino Di Mare.  The way they cook the scallops is superb and the size of the scallops is very impressive for a place like this.  Just thinking of this dish makes my mouth water. 

They have good drinks too and the salads are fresh and crisp with interesting variations on dressings compared to other places I have eaten.  

Is this a mom and pop, hole in the wall Italian place?  No, but it is definitely one of my favorite chain restaurants and close to home.Newly remodeled very tastefully done, looks like more seating, partly blocked off the kitchen a good thing.  New menu with new items to pick from. Great food and friendly staff. This is not a tasteless 70s Olive Garden.I have been all over this lovely town of Las Vegas in search of a sushi place I can call home, and after nearly 5 years off and on, I have finally found it. I Love Sushi was AMAZING!!! From the two sided menu with endless amounts of creative goodness, to the hilarious names of the items (ex. Screaming Orgasm, The Threesome, etc.), to the timely and polite service from both the waitresses and sushi chef's, this place is great.

Enough seating that even when its busy, it shouldnt be too long of a way and the food comes out nearly as fast and fresh as when you order it.

Pricing is GREAT!

GO TO I LOVE SUSHI ASAP!!!I have never been to a sushi restaurant I love more than this place.  It's hands down my favorite sushi restaurant so far.  The ambiance is good, the food is fantastic, the prices are fair, the service is great.  I always try something new when I go and have yet to be disappointed but I always get the sweet shrimp- they serve it with the head fried.  Not all places do that, in particular sushi buffets, which I'm not very fond of.Great food, great atmosphere!  My favorite place for sushi in Vegas.This is my second time to visit this dental office for root canal. Everyone here is very friendly and welcoming. Dr Morris is a super nice guy. He made me feel comfortable and relax during the surgery. Office is very nice and clean. They also have very high tech equipment. This is definitely the best dental endodontics I would recommend it to all my family and friends.I go every week to see Charl for my weekly allergy shot.  Charl is very personable and professional.  
Dr. Scott Manthei and his staff are very customer service oriented.+ Really nice staff, especially the valet guys who run to get your car even in the hottest of heat!

+ Awesome, awesome, awesome pool parties! Last Saturday's included beach balls, squirt guns, pool noodles, pool mattresses, a super great DJ, poolside drinks and food, and a BBQ. The security guy was getting into the music with a handheld drum!

+ Our request for a later checkout (not the official late checkout where you have to pay) was granted so we  could finish watching one of the World Cup games in our room!

+ Every time we requested towels, etc, to the room, the staff brought it up quickly

+ I love the atmosphere! Every room is named after a different artist and everywhere inside (the lobby, the hallways, the dining room) are collaged with famous paintings. The lobby was dark and cold which was great because outside it was too bright and hot! Walking through the lobby felt like swimming. Love the big fountain in the middle, and the chess board table (even though my boyfriend beat me-- ugh!)

If you're looking for clean rooms, great staff, great parties, great amenities and at a much cheaper price than on-the-strip hotels, The Artisan is for you! 

Hint: free water bottles in the workout room! (consists of an eliptical machine and weights only).This is another one of our staples when we come to Vegas. After many Western meals in the hotel, we always need to venture off the strip and pick up some Ca Kho To and Canh Chua Ca. Put simply, it's just good food. They're open 24 hours and the Pho is pretty tasty too. We've been eating here with our family for years.I've been to this place probably half a dozen times now. It's the go to spot after a long night out or right before we go back to So Cal. I love the duck noodle soup and the calamari appetizer. The pho is also really good but the menu is so expansive with various Asian favorites, it's hard to just get pho. The service is quick even though it could get packed at times. Seems like both locals and vegas weekenders equally flock to this place. Portions are good and the price is right.My sisters columbian friend pointed us in this direction. I enjoyed this new ethnic experience. The moment I walked in, I was reminded of my my aunty's old restaurant shop. I do mean to say "restaurant shop" because that's exactly what it is. a restaurant and shelves of snacks, toys and other take-home things. I guess that's one reason why I love this place, for taking me back to a childhood I almost forgot.

I've never been to any other columbian eatery, but word is that the portions are huge. Which they were.. for me and my sister anyway. We shared this plate of "Tamal" which came with a side of rice. By the way, the rice was surprisingly sweet. Almost like sticky rice. It really complimented the spices in the tamal. I've also discovered the best made empanadas ever! probably even better than filipino empanadas =X. It's unique for it's crispy crust and its pasty potato & beef mix inside. And what set it in stone for me was the aji/ahji/ahhee (oh whatever the spelling is) sauce.

That place brought together family. Mainly because we realized we were sitting next to the family of my sisters friend. They also have a huge extended area. Cus the area we were in was the "restaurant shop" But the other side is specifically restaurant. It's good for big groups and such. Cus yeah, I'm all about rolling deep! I'll take my friends anywhere we can fit.One of the best Mani-Pedi's I've ever had. Very clean and professional.This is one of my my go-to restaurants when I have visitors. Nuff said!Best Korean I've had yet in Vegas. The Dumpling Tofu soup was divine. I asked for spicy and got it! The food arrived sizzling to the table. I love every single side they give complimentary. You can really fill up for $10. a person. The Short Ribs were the bomb! The staff is wonderful. I love the ambiance and decor, everything, even the simple wooden chairs. There's two sides to Tofu Hut, the BBQ table and regular. The late hours are a plus! I will come back frequently, now that I know of this gem. I will bring friends. I'm gonna try the BBQ next time.Just ate here last night for the first time; WOW is all I can say. We ordered a fantastic, semi spicy soup and were offered the Egg Drop right in front of you, definitely the way to go. There were three of us and we ordered some Beef Short Ribs and the spicy shredded beef (I forget the name of it). Both of those were stellar, as was the selection of Kimchi and other sides they brought out. For three of us, we had a feast of food for about $45 and it was amazing. They had a limited selection of Beer, Sake, and Soju, but good prices on what they did have. Great place to grub late night, will definitely be back soon.This location is the main Borders in the Las Vegas Valley.  They have the largest book selection and that is all they sell.  Don't expect a large music or DVD selection as this one primarily focuses on books.I love Fancy Nails. It is my GO-TO Nail place.

They shop is located in a shopping center near Sahara and Decatur. The owner's name is Jennifer and she is really sweet.

I like to keep my nails really short (so I can speed type my Yelps) and the aestheticians here never mind me asking if I can get them shorter. If I bump my nails or dent the polish (which is all the time) they fix it for free. I also like my acrylic thin and Yen does it right, every single time. And she's quick!

You can do walk-in or appointments.

They offer a full range of spa services at decent prices. Waxing, facials, pedis, manis, airbrush, and gel.

The shop is clean and tidy and had a nice Vietnamese flair. 

Whenever I leave here, my mind sings, you FANCY, HUH.

Wanna get Fancy, this is your one chance and they won't let you down (or Reba)!OH MY GAGA! This place is AWESOME! Scrumptiously delicious food and the owners are very friendly and pleasant! They have vegetarian/vegan menu items. A #MustTry recommendation! Will be back for sure!Thanks to all the friend staff at Nails for You. They surely made my day go very smoothly.

I was introduced to this place from a friend who is a Vegas resident. They do mani/pedi, as well as hair and waxing. Seems like they get lots of men very comfortable doing their hair. 

It might not look too glorious, and the chairs might seem a little outdated, but the skills of their staff was absoloutely fabulous. I don't remember the last time I had my nail surface smoothed out when I was getting pedicure, but they took care of it rightaway. The chairs are actually very nice as well.

The only downside of the place is that they don't do mani/pedi at the same time. They worked on the Pedicure first and as for Manicure, I had to move to sit at the table, which basically doubles the time of getting nails done. But with what kind of through job they do, it is definitely worth every single minute.

I wish they had this salon in LA. I won't go anywhere else if they had people who worked so well like them.

When I go back to Vegas, I want to come back here. So worth the trip. I refuse to pay expensive price for all those glamorous places that charge way more than what the service is really worth.i haven't had this in a long time!!! 

i went to aloha kitchen, yes two different locations all in the same day. anyways, i went to aloha kitchen and asked for 3 manapuas. they didn't have any that had been steamed already. so, they steamed 'em up for me right then and there. i was impressed. yes, i waited like 15-20 minutes. But, whatever!! they were the absolute freshest that i'd e ver had.Today is the last day this location will be opened.

We decided to pay a farewell visit to out favorite local burger spot because we will miss her sorely.

We ordered Sandwiches all around. I had the 5-Alarm, the wife had NEW Prime Rib Dip on Ciabatta bread and the boy had the classic Red Robin Burger.

The Prime Rib was so good I will be driving to Galleria Mall or Ann/95 to get another one.

We collected a souvenir glass and shaker of Red Robin Seasoning.

Farewell. You will be missed. And good luck to all the empoyees who served us well eVery visit.We're back in Vegas!  So, of course our first stop (well, second stop if you count picking up our rental car first) was Trader Joe's. 

First on the list: yogurt covered anything.  My girls like the yogurt stars (cookies).  The adults like the yogurt covered fruit. 

Next, all kinds of snacks:  mini chocolate chip cookies, ginger snaps, lemon crisps, english toffee, dried fruit, etc.

Our new favorite:  cookie butter!!!  Imagine a cookie (different flavors of cookies) smashed up and made into a yummy, spreadable form.

*** TIP:  If you buy the cookie butter, you need to put it in your checked bag.  TSA will confiscate it if it's in your carry on.  As the guy at the Trader Joe's checkout said, "TSA has more cookie butter than the state of Hawaii."  :-(I highly recommend this bakery/café. Their deserts are amazing and you can't beat their lunch menu! They also have the best customer service around!ive taken trips to vegas numerous times, and i really am getting sicking of dining on the strip, where food is most definitely overpriced. we went off the strip to "be local," and came to ichiza, which is apparently one of the best restaurants here. and boy, it IS good! i had the half size ramen, miso cod, and hamachi sashimi. all of it was fresh, all of it was good. and since ive heard so much about the honey toast, i got it, and its HUGE and realllyyyy good. GREAT place, and the next time i visit vegas, i'm coming back again.Came here twice in April, both late night while passing through the area on my Great Farewell West Coast tour.  The previous hostess was nowhere to be seen, which seems to be a good thing.  Had all my favorites and received great service so back to 5 star status.  Sadly I may not be back any time soon now that I relocated to Texas.AMazing love this place!!!! 

beef bowl, agedashi tofu my usual orders!

cant wait to go backThis is a one of a kind Japanese restaurant in Las Vegas. A lot of other Japanese restaurants offer sushi as their specialty. Here you will find many other unique items on the menu. Having been to Japan where freshness, presentation, and simplicity of the entrees (meaning they don't mix too many ingredients that it takes away from the main ingredient in the dish instead of complimenting it) are what is showcased, this place truly matches up.

Try the sauteed beef tongue (or just beef for the less adventurous), tofu steak, Jalapeno fried rice, and tofu mousse for dessert. There are so many other things on the menu or off the wall  that are great, that you can try a new dish every time you go and you wont be disappointed!I have been here 2x this month for surgery for my child and husband. Both times staff was amazing!! They are great at care and do an excellent surgery/ recovery care. Check in prior and blood work can be more timely and frustrating then the actual procedureMy coworkers and I go here for a nice dinner about once a month and it is our favorite place in Vegas, hands down!!! The service is incredible, the steaks are amazing and their wine selection is top notch (for those that wish to drink). Things to try: chilled seafood appetizer, filet, Caesar salad (prepared table side), filet and lobster, and the creme brûlée.I just love this place! I have been eating here since I was a wee little girl. I love taking people here who haven't been which is usually someone who has moved here from somewhere else because what true native hasn't eaten here?! When family comes to town this is my go-to place to go out for breakfast.

I can't go and not get an order of "Fried Zucchini Sticks". They are the best I have ever had! They come in a half or full order and you can get cheese sauce or ranch or both for dipping. If you haven't tried them yet please do! I always get the "Green Hornet". It has avocado and cheese and tomatoes. I am notorious for it and just can't change it but do take a bite off my families plates hehe!

Just so you know, the omelets are made with 6 eggs so if you don't think you can eat that much you can just ask for a "baby" and they will make it with 3 eggs. They also give you a little off the cost for using less eggs I think it is like 75 cents or something. The spuds are so good too. I usually ask for them with no salt and love to dip them in ranch dressing.

The lines can be long but you don't wait for long and the wait is more then worth it! This last visit we waited maybe 5 minutes. They are only open for breakfast & lunch. During the week it isn't as hectic as trying to eat at Omelet House on the weekends but still consistent.Well Yelpers, you've done it again!

After reading reviews and seeing the pictures, we had to give this place a try.  

The atmosphere is home-y and friendly, lots of knick knacks.  The staff was friendly and helpful.  They were pretty busy but the service didn't suffer at all.

The food was amazing.  We had the corned beef hash, chili verde omelet, and biscuits and gravy.  Everything was homemade, the banana bread was warm and delicious, and our coffee cups were never empty.

We will definitely be going back again!i don't know how to judge donuts.
they were good. 
didn't taste old.
there was a sweet old lady sitting there who hangs out there since "everyday."
added to the cute character to the place.
very happy with my donuts.EUREKA!!!  I've found more Capriotti's that are open later hours! 
F*'in AWESOME!!!Great food!! The staff was very friendly and helpful.  I ordered the Bobbie which was amazing!! I would definitely eat here again when we travel to Vegas.The best!!

We had a thee hour flight delay - no problem! They called from the baggage claim area within 5 minutes of us landing letting my group know there were there. We were greeted by a man in a tux who helped with our bags and walked us out to the air-conditioned limo. We lucked out and got an automatic upgrade since our flight time was messed up so we got the big mac daddy of limos! It was so fun and they had chilled champagne ready to go for us. 

Once we left the airport we turned on the beats, the flashing lights and drove down the strip. Even thought the airport is close to the hotels it took about 30 mins to get there, which we were happy about. It gave us time to enjoy the ride. 

This was honestly the best way to start out the trip and it was very affordable - especially if you split it between the group. They also have deals online that you should look out for and jump on. We took the limo roundtrip and both ways the drivers couldn't have been nicer. Thank you Christopher and David!! You made us feel like queens!Hands down the best limo service in Vegas and the only one I use whenever I'm there. In fact I'd say it's the best limo service I've used in the country! Prompt, courteous, friendly drivers and super clean cars, you can't go wrong!YUMM!  This place is hands down my favorite place to get local-style Hawaiian food in Vegas.  (I'm from Hawaii) I've been to Island Style three times and will definitely be back. I'm slowly working my way through the menu. haha. 

Ok for starters, the place looks sketchy from outside, but inside is bright and welcoming.  The owner/host is super friendly and makes you feel right at home.  First you get hot tea, warm boiled peanuts if they have any, kimchi, and a couple other korean appetizer munchies. ... and you get a LOT of it (and it's all free!). The owner is quick to notice if your little dishes get low, and will bring refills and send you home with more if you want.  

I have tried and recommend the eggs, rice, and portuguese sausage plate, the fried rice, and the meat jun plate.  happy eating :)Honest and fair.  Took in my car without an appointment and completed the service within the promised time.  As a guy who does most of his own car repairs, I know that I can trust them.  I knew the problem before heading in and they gave the same diagnosis.After I came back from my Vegas trip, I knew I was missing a review of this wonderful boba tea shop. I drank this same cup of tea for 6 hours. Yes, I was on the road for that long. Believe it or not, after the ice melted and when I only had a few pieces of boba left, this tea still tasted just as good.  The way I gauge my boba teas is by the quality of the boba's and this place definitely does a fantastic job of preparing them. I mean anyone can use condensed milk and mix up a good tea. It is the soft yet chewy tasty bobas that make the difference.

I didn't stay in the store long enough to notice if there were computers or not. I do have to say the service is very fast and if your order is not too complicated, you will get it ahead of others. I know where I will be stopping the next time I leave Vegas...Lastly, the prices are a dollar cheaper then Lollicrap and Pee Station.This place is so freaking good.  No way anyone can tell they vegan.  The people who work here are always so nice.  Cash only though.

I flew in for my oldest daughters graduation, I had two food wishes while in town, Spam Musabi, and Vegan Donuts from Ronald's.  I know, contradicting food forces pulling at me. ;)

The apple fritters are delicious, I carried them thru graduation then on plane, and now they are cleverly frozen and hidden at my fiancés house in her freezer.   

Seriously, there is no way to tell the donuts are vegan, they are delicious.    Just remember, CASH ONLY.  Also the lady who co owns it is incredibly nice and polite, a rarity in Las Vegas.One of my favorite places to eat at, especially for sushi! Their service is awesome and I love their tempura, miso soup, teriyaki chicken, japanese lasagna roll, etc. They also have great desserts! My favorite is the tiramisu. I know, you're thinking.. at a Japanese restaurant? Well, it's some of the best I've had & I've eaten tiramisu in Little Italy in NYC. Go check it out!Before heading down to Trader Joe's, I came here for a quick pick me up. I needed some more fuel to finish my Christmas shopping and all I could think of.. was Baja Fresh! 

This location is tucked in a corner behind Jack in a Box. Same complex side of Fedex, but further down. I walked in and was greeted by the cashier. I enjoy such vibrant lighting and it's really all from natural sunlight shining through to the inside. The whole place looked nice and all the stations from the drinks to the salsa bar was clean and well presented. I ordered the Baja Chicken and brought my refill "to-go" cup to use for 99 cents. It's so useful and I like the idea that I'm saving a cup every time I use it. :D Plus I refill it again before I head out, so I can replenish myself whenever I need it. It's definitely a win-win situation. I even brought half of my sweetened green tea home and put in the fridge for later and it was still so refreshing to drink it. Almost like a cold dessert! I also used a previous receipt survey coupon that gives me $2 off from spending $8. All you have to do to get this is go online and complete a quick survey on your dining experience. Then you are given a code at the end, which you use toward your next purchase. This can be done every time you dine there. Sweet deal right?!??! I like it A lot.

I went to the restroom to wash my hands after ordering and it was spotless clean. The salsa bar is the first thing I checkout and this time there was a new salsa of the season.... Cranberry Salsa!!! It had diced celery, onion, cranberry, and bits of cilantro.   When my order was ready, I cut the Baja Chicken Burrito in half and put some of this new salsa on top... took the first bite and the flavors exploded with freshness. It seriously had this perfect combination of a healthy meal. You start to understand why  their philosophy is "Live Fresh." The more I ate this scrumptious burrito, the more I tasted all the high quality ingredients and freshness from it. The soft flour tortilla tasted so delicious from having it slightly grilled and it's almost like they brushed it with rich light butter. It's like eating a butter cookie without all the sugar added to it. However they grilled this burrito, it tasted oh so yummy! The Cranberry Salsa gives this burrito the ultimate whammy of renewed vows of love. Eating this together and you have the Burrito of a Lifetime. I swear I went by to the salsa bar over six times to refill my cup!!! And it's not because I was a few steps away, but it was that good to keep going back for more. Simply the best tasting, healthy burrito I have devoured. I even licked my fingers to taste the salsa that was dripping down the burrito from over pouring. Can you imagine how fun this experience was?!! Keep imagining... Until you get down and dirty like me.. you really don't know what fun is at Baja Fresh. But you know it's good when it's messy and you don't even care. I even added a chunk of cilantro in the Cranberry Salsa and it was a swimming beautiful, green garden in that sauce. I am a Huge fan!!!

Even their complimentary tortilla chips were served in a paper bag and it wasn't even oily at all! No oil stain whatsoever on the paper bag and that's so great to see. Even the chips taste healthy and good!!! 

On their site, it's noted that all of their entrées are made with all natural, hormone free, fire-grilled Chicken, Steak, and slow-roasted Carnitas. And they serve only fresh guacamole and famous salsas made with locally grown, farm fresh produce!!! 

After I ate everything.. I felt like I could conquer the world!!! Energized and ready to get my shopping on. I was feeling so Alive and recharged! 

I'm having a real addiction to their fresh produce and you can tell that everything is made by hand. You know where I'll be on my day off.... spending a night here! :PI'm so relieved they have a Tea Station in Vegas, it just makes everything so much better! The Boba and Milk Tea here tastes just as good as any other one Tea Station in California so I give it a 5 star! 

Recommendations: LARGE Boba Milk Tea--plain and simple is the way to go! & large because you're going to want more!Rene saved the day!!!! Originally booked across the street but blech!! I stepped into the little white wedding chapel and it was like a breath of fresh air. They can do it all from a drive through quickie, to an elegant personalized ceremony. They even do the Las Vegas fave, an Elvis wedding!! 
Their level of customer service is amazing and they really came through in a pinch. I would 100% recommend them!!!I have been a customer of MTC for several years now after being disappointed and over charged by many of the other service centers in town. In the last month alone they have installed two sets of tires for me, serviced one of the bikes,  and are going through another. I can say I have been very pleased with their work and they have always come through for me. 

I am glad they ask questions about my bikes and the service I am getting, instead of just doing what I ask. They have found several other issues with my bikes that I did not know I had to include a cracked weld. 

My hats off to you guys Thanks for the honest and fair service and always taking it a step above for customer service.It is time to go back ... oh, how I miss Luv-It Frozen Custard. Been in this town longer than I ... Yummmmmm. OK, and if you are open minded, you can sit in the parking lot and watch in to the strip club next door.

Favorite item - Scotch Jimmie: butterscotch, sliced bananas, jimmies ... usually just get a junior size. 

Their new website lists out specific ordering instructions. No matter how you do it, you will not go wrong at Luv-It -  http://www.luvitfrozencustard.com/menu.htmlSooo good!!! Walk up window. Variety of  flavors to choose from. I went with the "luv it" special which consisted of a good portion of vanilla custard, fresh frozen strawberries with sauce and chopped nuts. I shared a size regular with my boyfriend. We both enjoyed our rich and creamy frozen treat on this hot day in june.  Definitely a must  try if you've never been.The Huntridge tavern seems difficult to find for most, so I'll explain it in detail here:
Its on maryland&charleston, on the same corner as the circle k. in fact its "behind" the circle k.  At night you'll see a neon light saying "bar" its two doors down from the Savers (same building)

I love going here on Wednesday night game night, usually I'll try to pick up a new $1 game from savers and add it to the growing collection. So far Apples to Apples and Catch phrase have been the most fun.

It's north of the Stratosphere and south of Downtown on Las Vegas Blvd, attached to the Howard Johnson Hotel (who knew these still existed?). There are lots of sex shops and wedding chapels in the area (apparently, the two things go hand in hand in Vegas - a more honest presentation if you ask me). You pull through the entry way and into the hotel courtyard/parking area and walk on into the lobby entry. Go into the Spanish style entry way off the lobby, and be prepared for the BEST breakfast in Vegas. The Desayuno Cubano is simply heaven. Eggs, Cuban Toast, fried plantains and stuffed potatoes, mashed potatoes that are filled with ground beef and some olive, shaped into balls then rolled in panko bread crumbs and fried, either served on a flat, plate sized piece of ham or not. Heaven! The staff is somewhat unattentive, but them's the breaks. You're at the friggin' Howard Johnson Hotel, not the Four Seasons. For the folks who say it's too expensive, I say go get your dollar hot dog at Slots of Fun or your average prime rib buffet, and pipe down. I, for one, would rather have an experience, and the Florida Cafe gives you that, and a delicious breakfast to boot!THE OLDEST GAY BAR IN LAS VEGAS ( since 1976)  --- and rumored to have the oldest patrons.

Come visit beautiful downtown!!!!  So this is it.....the gay bar you hear all the rumors about.

"Only old dude's hang out there."

"They lock the door and have orgies  late at night."

"If you wait in the bathroom for more than 3 minutes you'll totally score!"

Old dude's, late night orgies, and easy bathroom action.   In the 70's those were the things that kept the night life hoppin'.  So why complain now?

I have yet to witness any of these things happen at Snick's Place. (that doesn't mean they don't) It certainly adds to it's mystique though....I keep going hoping that something I've heard about would happen, but, alas it's like waiting for Sasqwatch or Nessie.

But what you will get is the friendliest bartenders in town, who are pretty heavy handed when it comes to the mixed drinks....WHOOO BABY!!!  Which is probably why they have pics of pink elephants on the walls......OH, and a really hot collage in the form of the bar's name (SNICK'S) made out of pics of dirty man meat.  

It is the definition of "DIVE BAR" and absolutely lovely.Excellent haircut and overall service. Randy did a great job, he uses metal high quality guards and is a really cool guy. I'd recommend Vicks Barber Shop to anyone who wants a great haircut at a very nice placeGreat place to get a cut. The gentlemen here are actual barbers with skill. This is an actual barber shop, not a place for hoodlums to hang out it. Great job guys!If this place doesn't have it, you probably can't buy it...  Staff is always friendly, selection is overwhelming (especially for a fairly small space) and prices are reasonable.   This is really the only place I go when I need parts for my RV (other than WalMart for TP and tank chemicals...)The heart of the growing local art scene and revitalization of downtown. For sure this building is the main stay of First Friday, but it also hosts an ongoing plethora of cultural events throughout the week such as poetry readings, live music, and movie viewings. Lest we forget it also has a bar and restaurant inside! There are both studios and galleries within the building and no doubt it is the perfect networking spot for working artists of all generas and lovers of the arts. Love this place!If you feel like giving back to the community this is a good way to do it. This organization does not have any government assistance so they are always grateful to have volunteers or donations.  I was able to volunteer and the experience was great. You can have the opportunity to help in their thrift store or serving food to their residents or homeless. I know some of the most busiest days are Tue and Thursdays, for more info please visit their website!My family and I love this place!! Service is always good, prices are reasonable, and the food is delicious!! We always order the shrimp pad thai, spicy chicken mint, and the one sun beef. Perfect meal every time and there are always leftovers for the next day!AWESOME!  Quickly made.. 
Super burrito or tacos, is my menu choices.Today I stopped in before closing to pick up a probe thermometer and had the most wonderful customer experience. The item I grabbed had been returned by someone that claimed they never opened it, but it was clearly used so I called the store to find out when they closed so I could get an exchange. They were closing in 3 minutes, but kept a register on and waited for me to come back to the store so I could exchange it, after closing time. Made my day.I collect old video game systems, and as you can guess, they're not as easy to come by these days.

Like an idiot, I followed a DIY (Do It Yourself) that I found online to clean the screen of an Atari Lynx, and it went bad.  It went really bad.

Their game repair is mostly in regards to the more current systems.  My 20+ year old system was out of their jurisdiction.  After admitting that they don't have the experience to work on such a piece, the owner paused for a moment, then asked me to bring it in anyway.  He would take a look at it.

The store itself is nice.  They have a ton of old gaming stuff, even if what I brought in was just on the cusp of what they didn't have.  But what they didn't have they tried anyway.  Let me reiterate that.  Even though my system wasn't in their realm of repair expertise, rather than turn me away, they made an effort to help me regardless.  That spoke volumes to me, and the repair job status become somewhat irrelevant (though I still wanted it fixed, mind you).

And for their so-called "lack of expertise", they did a fine job anyway.  Mind you, I really made a mess of my attempted repair job, but the level that they attempted to restore it was worlds better than what I accomplished.  At any rate, they made it functional again, which was greatly appreciated.

The place is small, but they have some things that I haven't seen in years.  The staff gave me (admittedly deserved) flack for my botching my system, but it was good-natured, and I enjoyed talking with them as they worked on it.  The price was right, and more than fair as well.  I walked out very happy, and will frequent them again.

For a "Mom 'N' Pop", this place is a classy little find with a lot of heart.  It's nice to see that places like this still exist.I've eaten here, and the other locations, many times. I've never ordered the French toast until today. OMG, so good. It tastes like a cinnamon roll, but it's just Texas toast with their special batter. I know what I'm having for breakfast when I return. 
*this is now called the Blue Skillet, same good food!*The food was so good. Pricing was really reasonable. It takes a while to get there from the strip but it's well worth the drive.James is AMAZING. Seriously. Not only was he able to give me honest, clear, layperson-terms advice PRE-purchase of a new-to-me used car, when I did make my decision he was my go-to guy for the *cough* awesome *cough* major work I needed only 600 miles into it.

Yeah, that.

I had made an appointment with him to have the timing belt (original, 105k on an '03 Tiburon) checked out and generally get her first real maintenance taken care of. Always the first thing I do if I buy a car used. Plus, I had another mechanic give me the deets on her before her purchase... Let's just say I should have gone to James.

That morning, on the way to work, I lost all ability to move forward. Being on the highway helped (inertia, baby!) so I had a little time to move over, get down an exit, and eventually stop. Ugh.

AAA. Tow truck. Car to Hondatronics while I go to work.

Antsy and anxious, I kept calling but they hadn't had a chance to really go over her yet. The next morning, I got the call.

"Are you sitting down?" 

Yeah, that.

It was not good news. The clutch and flywheel required replacement. I have the photos. It's not pretty. 

I can't lie. I cried. I *just* bought this car.

James was, as I said at the beginning, AMAZING. He talked me through all my options, explained everything in detail about the parts and labor involved, and even gave me advice on buying the parts myself and having them shipped to him. Sure, it saves a few bucks... but then I have no warranties. We looked at everything. In the end, he did it all - parts and labor - blazing fast (we talked at 3ish in the afternoon... I had my car back by 11am the next day). They worked into the evening and did everything they could to make me as happy as they could in this situation. The education didn't stop there. He showed me the old parts, discussed with me the hows and whys of what we did. It still hurt the pocketbook - not his fault by any means - but my head and heart were good.

Truly, truly, unlike any other shop I have ever been to. And, as long as he will have me as a customer, the only one I will go to here in Vegas.Some of my walls were water-damaged as a result of my upstairs neighbor's leakage and plumbing issues.  My neighbor hired Cassaro Construction to remedy the problem.  I don't know the amount of payment or Cassaro's hourly rate--my review is only for the services they provided.

First, I think there was a Project Manager, Tom J., because multiple units in the stack were affected by the water damage.  Tom was friendly, professional, and knowledgeable.  The workers cut out patches of the drywall where they suspected water damage.  Next, blowers were used for a day to dry the inside of the walls.  The next day, workers came back to put in new drywall, match the paint color, and paint the walls.  

The entire project took less than 5 days, and Tom popped in and out of my condo to supervise the progress.  Also, if I had any questions, Tom was always a phone call away.  When Tom noticed that the ceiling had imperfect seams (where the new drywall was attached), he rescheduled a worker to come back on a different day so the ceiling can be done to his high standards (even without me asking).

All workers were very courteous.  They taped off the work areas with painters plastic sheeting so the rooms would have minimum dust and paint splatters.  
Cassaro did not do plumbing in my unit--they fixed water-damaged walls, put in new drywalls and painted.  Overall, I am happy with the speed and quality of Cassaro's work, and I would recommend them to family and friends.This looks like a family run restaurant, you can watch the food being cooked because the kitchen is open. Fresh fresh fresh clean environment and tasty food!!I must say Sell-Abration Realty is as professional as they get.  I have been dealing with them for a long time, and I have found them to be very helpful and friendly.  They are straight up.  I have no problem recommending this company.I ordered pork fried rice. That's it and it was AMAZING!!! My girlfriend ordered the veggie fried rice and loved it also!!! The fried rice did not disappoint. Not one bit. I will be back to grab more of this delicious rice soon!!!This is by far the Best Capriottis in town. They are always nice, and make the best Sandwich's.  The best people there are the guys at night, before they close, its always worth the drive across town just to go to this one.

I'm a vegetarian, and its nice to go to a sandwich shop that not only is there a sandwich I can eat, but I have a selection.  I prefer to get the Vegan Cheese-steak with Coleslaw and Russian dressing, it takes just like a Caprastromi, and was told to me A VP of Capriottis on Twitter 2yrs ago.This is our favorite place. Food is always great and very reasonable.  Raul is the best!!!!  Even the customers make it a great place to hang out.I've been going to Village Pub locations since 2001, this is the closest one to me now, so I go here every now and again.

The food quality to price ratio is what bumps this joint up to five stars for me. If you want to compare this place to a fine steak house it might not fare so well, but when you can get a steak for under ten dollars that is just as good as Outback I think it's a score. The fish and chips are great and the best I have had in town by far (and I'm originally from Seattle). They come beer battered, crispy, and in a generous portion. Breakfast is great here too with lots of options.

Another thing I like is they have some lighter options on the menu if you're watching calories - not something you see too often at a pub/video poker place. They have some great salads for lunch and dinner, full meals with healthy side options, and egg white omelettes at breakfast time - and a lot of this stuff of under 10 bucks. Can't beat it.

As a bonus they have a selection of micro brews from Ellis Island Casino that are very good.

I've been here for breakfast, lunch, and dinner - and even for a late night meal on the graveyard shifts. The staff has always been good, friendly, and attentive. The best locals bar food for the price, and still great without factoring the price.For a home style weekend local breakfast joint, this places kills. Great friendly service. Potato slices are interesting and the large whole eggs are a beautiful bright orange color - showing their good quality. Avoid the steak though.I am not a gym person and I joined Golds so that I can get in great shape. The fitness manager Cary Gifis met with me for an assessment and was very thorough in providing me the information I needed so I can get my body where I want it to be. I'm very excited to start this new journey to a healthier life! Cary was easy to talk to and gave me the confidence I needed to achieve my goals!I probably should not say this out loud but I have to share that this is one of my favorite theaters due to the fact that I dont have to go through the casino and its never too busy especially during the week.  They also have starbucks!great church, I'm not into all the music that kicks off the service, it's typically a three song set 3- 5inutes a song, and I have bad knees and a surgically arthritic ankle and I would rather sit but everyone is standing and I would feel so guilty sitting. So my advise here is this is the time to show up 10-15 minutes after the service starts. I also love that they have services on Saturday (1600 and 1800 hours) Pastor Odor is great, prior to service he is always around for a quit chat either about Christ or the football scores. The services are not up-down-up-down-kneel-pray-bow- high-five. Very modern and up to date involving Christ with current day issues as well. If you believe in God and are the fence to start coming back to church I highly recommend coming here or Central Christian. You will fell welcome and get involve in the community outreach programs too.Ive been going to Canyon Ridge for a while now. Ive got to say I enjoy how they go through series to help you understand the word of God. There motto of Come As You Are is great. It makes me feel like they want me here because of who I am not what I wear. Canyon Ridge is excellent for children and young adults also. The word of God is strong here at Canyon Ridge and the spirit of Christ will uplift you through out the day. Come in and give it a try......remember come as you are. The next series is called "The Story"As a native of Las Vegas, I can say that El Burrito has the best Mexican food in the valley.  I've been going there for the past 31 years when the original location was on Fremont Street.  I live 30 miles from the location in Summerlin, but it is well worth the drive!!!!!  You won't be disappointed.They were very friendly and professional. Carrie was my massage therapist and she did an amazing job! She worked on the many knots I have in my shoulders and I left pain free, which is so rare for me. I will recommend Carrie to all of my friends who visit Las Vegas.I come here way too much and I love it way too much. 

This place has great Pho, Bun Bo hue, and Beef Stew with French bread. This place is constantly the best place for those items and maybe other stuff too but these are the things I go there for. 

I have been here at least 10+ times now and love it. It is my go to place because they are consistantly good. 

service: it's an asian restuarant, service is never good, it is always about how fresh and good the food is.Finally!  Great sushi in Vegas!  Thank you, Master Chef Ken, for indulging us half an hour before you close shop for the evening with your ono-licious dishes of fresh sashimi and artistic displays!  We'll be back!  :-)Favorite local pizza place for the taste, quality & price. Not pretentious. Just good classic taste. I love their combo pizza (about $20) with pepperoni, sausage, olives/onions, and we add ricotta. So creamy and perfectly seasonsed. We also ALWAYS get the side of sausage and large order of garlic knots. The real garlic drenching, the awesome marinara sauce and tasty sausage links are worth the trip.Yelpers saved the day!  got home last night and the heater was not working. found reviews for Dekes here on Yelp and gave them a call. Said their guy was on a call but would come here next. They called back 45 minutes later and Dan was here about an hour after our initial call.  so far, so good!

Dan quickly and skillfully found the problem (a bad capacitor), had a replacement in his truck, and the heat is back on for just over $100.  some other companies may have said it was a bad motor ($420 part) but that's now how Dekes works.

i highly recommend Dekes Refrigeration & Air Conditioning!Very tasty chicken and good selection of side dishes.  Please bring Nevada Chicken Cafe to the Henderson area!!I rolled up to the ticket window (I'll assume that's what they are referring to when they say "Thomas and Mack Center Ticket Information") with my ginger monkeys in tow to buy tickets for the Sesame Street Live show from May 6-7th. They were running around crazy, which was fine considering there was a lot of space for them to roam without going into the street (huge plus for parents). 

Sandra helped me out BIG time. I asked for the best seats that were available and she totally hooked me and the monkeys up. Thanks to her..we are going to be able to see Elmo's nose hair (we are sitting front row center). She also informed me that with the front row seats comes a voucher for the kids to get a picture with the cast of characters. I was almost in tears. Sandra totally made me and my monkeys year. 

Next time I have to get tickets for an UNLV event...I'm going to seek out Sandra. Thanks a lot girl!Had a Top End handcycle repaired here after it had sat in the weather for two seasons, they fixed it up perfectly - replaced a nonstandard chain, trued up the wheels and replaced skins, and even fixed a failing shimano shifter that had been badly abused to the point where it's working fine now after two more years. Total cost was very reasonable for what I needed done, I would definitely use their services again.Best chain ever.  Aware of their animals, a chain, healthy, easy to go, lemons and chipotle sauce are a nice touch.  Very good staff too, very efficient!MacTaggarts is the best. Enough said. 

The prices are a little steep, but that's understandable based on where they're located. They have pretty much everything you could ask out of a neighborhood market: cool tunes, great employees, and Boar's Head everything. 

They have an underrated selection of different micro-brews as well, which is (imho) a huge plus. 

Only thing you need to look out for is their half step coming up and down the stairs (if and when you're there, you'll know exactly what I'm talking about). 

Stay cool "tags"This store is a gem. It is so much fun to explore here.  Amazing products, both finished and unfinished.  The wire wrap jewelry is amazing too. A classic Madison tradition.  You guys rock!  :)This is one of my favorite places to eat in town. Love the collection of lamps in the ceiling. The lack of seating makes you have this huge adrenaline rush to wonder " will I be able to sit down or say my order super, super slow in hopes someone will stand up while I am still being served?  Exciting I tell you !
The food is so cheap it is amazing the mint tea is incredible strong and has so much sugar bring your insulin ( this is a traditional preparation real sugar no corn syrup/fake sweetners) all hand made food fresh..
Apricot chicken is usually on the specials now I am a vegetarian but I tell you I still would want to order it ..that is how good it is! They have plenty of vegi dishes..The salad is huge they serve on the side not an icebergy lettuce leaf to be found this is food like you make for yourself when you treat yourself right. Go there today! They close at 4 on Sat!Dr. Hazen and all staff are great! everyone is friendly and helpful! 
I reccomened Dr. Hazen to everyone!I love the wide variety of food that's always prepared (and delivered) quickly.  They use high quality ingredients and their menu expands beyond the average.  Their customer service is fantastic.  Over the years, they have become my go-to delivery choice.Fun, unique gifts and accessories of all sorts. Jewelry, sunglasses, handbags, knick knacks and much more.I stop here every time I go shopping on State Street.  They have a terrific selection of handbags and totes.  The Lug Travel line is a favorite of mine, and the prices at Little Luxuries are comprable with ones on the internet for these bags.  They also have a lot of colorful, eco-friendly reusable very portable shopping bags.  

There are always a bunch of cute hair accessories on display, along with unique gifts for children (with vintage flair) and home items. 

If you need a tin robot, new headband, sunglasses, a necklace to go with your date-night outfit, lavender hand lotion, an art glass switchplate for the kitchen or a sake set, this place has it.   A Madison original, I love going to shop at Little Luxuries.  I just wish I could afford to do so for myself, rather than just for gifts.Jackpot! I found so many great gifts at this store. They have a stylish selection of hair accessories, wallets, bags, mugs, plates, gadgets, kids-ware, books, gift paper, pillows and hats, among other items.

Located along State Street - the main shopping strip of downtown Madison, near the University of Wisconsin.This is one of my favorite stores, ever ever ever! Everything there is amazing and fun and wonderful! No, most of the stuff isn't the most useful, but it's useful in that way where it can make you feel happy. I miss Pop Deluxe so hard, especially their wide variety of Cram Cream products.Although Shawn is correct in describing the staff as "sexy," that's not why you should shop here. You should shop here because the staff will make sure YOU are sexy.

Every time I've come into The Jazzman, the staff have been very helpful and honest when creating different looks for me. They've been sure to sincerely listen to me as I describe my unique style, and then help me find clothing that fits that self-description. And they know just how far to stretch me beyond that self-assessment without going too far -- which is the key. Given enough time to sift through their merchandise, I could likely create the same "safe" looks that they did. But it's their uncanny ability to push the limits of my personal style that earns The Jazzman the top spot on my list of clothing stores in Madison.

Trust me. You will look good after shopping here. And people will notice.I've never eaten here during regular dinner hours, but they have a great Late-Night menu that starts around 10pm.  The steak sandwich is amazing, and it is a more affordable then forking over the dough for a whole steak - great for the frugal college student.  

On weeknights they also offer $2 off their specialty drinks.  Their key lime gimlets are nearly a dessert themselves, and the peach cosmos are yummy, too.WOW....can I just say we picked this restaurant for our anniversary while staying up in Madison.  The idea of an old supper club atmosphere sparked my interest and steak of course it our favorite.  We loved the selection of steaks and cuts,  the unique vegetable arrangement in a glass of ice was a refreshing and light start to our experience.
The drinks were very well prepared...my husband is a dirty martini connoisseur and was not disappointed.  The gin martini I had was unique and I don't remember the name but, have never had any thing like it...yum.

Dinner was truly amazing, flavorful and gave us both "food coma".  The shrimp cocktail was like no other...large and firm shrimp...great cocktail sauce!

Steak dishes we huge, flavorful and tasty.

The service was very nice...the waitress we had was a little over worked between our table and a few other bigger parties but, she had plenty of help getting water for us and anything we needed.

WE WILL be back....great meal and atmosphere!This is where my cousin got hitched and the whole reason why I was in Madison, to be perfectly honest. 

The MMoCA is a tres chic kind of building. All glass and see through with three flights of stairs leading out to a lovely roof garden, which is especially pretty when all the colored lights come on. 

It was a lovely evening for a wedding. Clear skies, warm temperatures. The only thing that put a funny twist on the ceremony was when the sirens from the emergency vehicles on the street below interrupted my cousin and her husband to be as they were giving their vows. 

After the I do's were done, rings exchanged, poems read including the Art of Marriage, and kisses swapped, it was time to par-tay! So, while the MMoCA catering staff was getting the roof garden ready for the reception, all the guests were invited to mingle in the lobby, where a cocktail reception took place. Huge cheese and fruit platters were put out for all to share while servers walked around with sangria, champagne, and red wine. I decided to go with the sangria and it was simply delicious. It was also at this time guests were allowed to wander around the museum itself and look at all the displays, which I thought was awesome! 

After the the introductions of the bride and groom and their entourage, and after all the toasts were given, it was time to go upstairs for the reception dinner. Back up the three flights of stairs we all went and out onto the roof garden where they had set up a tent, a dj, open bar stations, coffee stations and food stations. 

Oh my word, the food here was simply amazing and scrumptious! Pork tenderloin, beef tenderloin with horseradish sauce, gnocchi, scallops, and spicy peanut thai chicken. I couldn't refrain from trying it all and everything exceeded my expectations. Seriously. 

After dinner the tables were cleared, and drinking, dancing and conversations ensued. Around 9pm the announcement was made that it was time for dessert. Instead of the traditional wedding cake, they had wedding cupcakes and mini chocolate martini's, oh hell yeah! 

Then there was more drinking and dancing until 11pm and on our way out each person in attendance was allowed to take home a bottle of wine as a thank you gift. Really, a very nice gesture. 

All in all, this is one of the most fabulous places for a wedding and reception that I have ever been to, and as of late, I've been to a lot of them. 

Another plus is that the MMoCA is always a free museum when it's open.  Monday's are the one day they are closed. 

So, if you're in the area this is a stop you must make and enjoy a beverage or a sandwich on their roof top terrace cafe.My absolute go-to place for quality, high-end booze. Their selection cannot be beat. Prices are fair and on par with what you'll pay at 99% of the places around here. Parking is a pain, but the place is otherwise as solid as can be. A++++Have made a couple of purchases from Goodman's and have always enjoyed the experience. Never felt pressured to buy something more expensive than what I was looking for.  Great service, great value and great people.These guys are honestly the best.  I have taken my car there numerous times and Polly and Thad have done everything within their power to help me, get me in and out on time, and get my car fixed well.  Its so reassuring to know I can call there in a panic with car issues at any time and as long as they are open (extended hours on Monday nights as I found out with my car issue last night) they work their magic to get me in and get everything taken care of.  Just last night I took my car in and the shop on the West Side couldn't get it in until Thursday!  Thad from Goodyear called this morning after I left it there last night, gave me the run down (in lamens terms I could understand) and is now working with my warranty company to go through all the hoops to get me a reduced price.  I am so lucky to have them - and within walking distance of my house!If you want a real breakfast, then the Come Back cannot be denied.  We had a company Christmas party in downtown Madison Saturday night and beelined for the Come Back for breakfast on Sunday morning.  The breakfast menu is extensive and most items are cleverly created and satisfyingly greasy.  Don't get me wrong, though, this is not a greasy spoon.  

My husband and I got the classic eggs benedict.  It came with perfectly poached eggs and wonderful Rosemary hollandaise.  The fried potatoes were generous.  Of course, we partook in the $1 bloody marys.  OMG ... really?  I couldn't get enough.  

The best part of our breakfast was the service.  Our waitress was prompt and friendly without hovering.  She was always there to fill the coffee.

I can't believe it is so hard to find a good breakfast for under $10, but this is definitely the place to hit.  It seems to be a hidden gem among the urban crowd, but everyone is welcome at the Come Back In.  Apart from Mickey's, this is the only other breakfast place I will visit in Madison.

Don't let any of the bad reviews sway your enjoyment.  This place is a must try.  See it yourself.  I don't think you will be disappointed.Good Fresh Bagels at Great Prices!
Their bagel sandwiches are also very good and at very reasonable prices. A dozen bagels there are HALF of what you pay at the Panera down the street.  Service is generally pretty good too.
    It's nice to go into a place and get quality food without the feeling you're getting gouged on price and value.These are really good bagels made at the bakery here in Madison. I love the factory store flavors, which are much more exciting than what you can get at the grocery store, and you get to mix and match at their shop. Try the jalapeño cornbread for something unique. I love the maple and the pumpernickel, too!

Their sandwiches are really good, made with quality meats and fresh veggies. It's a good and healthy lunch stop.

I also like that these are appropriately-sized bagels, meaning you haven't eaten an entire loaf of bread when you've enjoyed one.Very helpful! They've done great, inexpensive repairs for us, and once walked us through a repair over the phone. Old school, but in the best sense.This is a place you have to go to if you're having a late night in downtown.  Everything is always delicious.This place is the best! I was having an argument with my boyfriend about how there was no way this place would be better than this little doughnut shop back in my hometown. The baker overheard and gave us each a free doughnut to help prove the point. I hate admitting it, but my boyfriend was right! This is the best doughnut place ever. All workers are amazingly nice. They don't even get impatient when I get indecisive about which doughnut to get (which I'm always super thankful about).Every business has what are known as "high maintenance customers." I get the sense that some reviewers below might fit that category.  After all, someone who reports that her service left her "sick to [her] stomach," as though she was "held at gunpoint" from a dining experience might have bigger problems than her waiter, and is probably not the best source for dining reviews. So I'll try to do this without resorting to such hyperbole.  I love the place, but it is still just a restaurant.  

You'll probably enjoy the Greenbush.  Its small and popular, so go there expecting a wait and a crowd.  Find your way to the bar, order a glass of wine for you and your guest, pay the bartender and have a conversation with the person you're with.  Before you know it, you'll have a table.  

Try the antipasto, spread some roasted garlic on some homemade bread, or some olivata or pesto.  Have a pizza, another glass of wine, then finish by splitting a creme carmel with a glass of cognac.  Thats what I usually do, and love it.

If you happen to like nice alcohol, this is your place.  Very few places have as extensive a scotch list, and no place is as reasonably priced ($5 for Macallan 12 year last time I was there!) Grappa, sherry, tequila, wines, good beer, it's all high quality at a great price in a non-assuming atmosphere.  

This is one of the gems that make Madison great.  And good news- the lady who felt she was held at gunpoint and is doing everything she can to get no one to eat there again?  She'll be in Middleton.I for one really enjoyed my experience here.

Maybe it's just because I am so used to having to arrive early at a doctor appointment, wait 30 minutes for my name to be called, fill out some forms, and then wait an additional 30 minutes before I can be seen.

The moment I entered their main entrance, I was ushered to their welcome kiosk where I was able to fill out some simple information and check myself in in less than 5 minutes. Then I was shown to the appropriate waiting room, waited less than 10 minutes before someone called me inside.

I had a dermatology appointment with Dr. Ann Rosin, and saw one of her residents first. She gave me an overview of my acne status and some informational and helpful advice on skin care. 

Then she brought in Dr. Ann Rosin, who asked me a few questions, and prescribed my treatment right then and there. 

The whole thing took less than 20 minutes, which might make some people feel like they haven't been given enough attention, but most initial examinations shouldn't take that long anyways. 

Dr. Ann Rosin really seemed to know what she was talking about, as she was able to actually tell me the why behind my prescription, instead of just the what. 

Now if only all of my doctor appointments could go as smoothly as this...After reading some positive reviews on Yelp, I thought I would try out Rocky's on my VW Golf.  It need some sprucing up, buffing out some scratches and polishing the headlights.  They did a really great job, paying a lot of attention to detail.  I dropped the car off the night before, and they called me in the early afternoon to tell me it was all set.  I had to get a ride back to the garage a bit later in the day, and the guy said he'd be around after closing for a little while in case I had any questions.  I was really pleased with the job they did.  Super clean, buffed out all the scratched bits I couldn't get out myself.  The headlights were too pitted to buff out with a standard polishing, but they looked better than before and they didn't charge me extra for the time they put in on it.  They also tried to keep my car inside most of the day while it rained so I could see it clean and sparkly when I arrived.  Stellar work, and I appreciated the great communication about time frame and expectations.  The total bill was also a lot less than I was expecting.  I will certainly be back!My boyfriend and I stopped in here on a Saturday to browse and try on some engagement rings to see what we liked and didn't like. We had first stopped in at the jewelry store next door (Jared-the Galleria of Diamonds) to The Diamond Center. However when we walked in we looked around the store for a little while before someone who worked there even acknowledged us. And when she did she told us someone be with us shortly... Which they were not and we walked out and went next door to The Diamond Center. We had planned on going to both but were glad we went to TDC. 
As soon as we walked into TDC we were greeted by Justin who asked what we were in for today. He sat down with us to get to know us better and what we thought we were interested in. He took us through each step in selecting a ring for us. And would ask us what liked and disliked about each ring we looked at so he knew better to what to narrow us down to. Jason, the store manager, also assisted us along with Justin. Since I am a nurse I had some special needs in my ring, like I needed a shorter shank on the ring so it would sit down more in my finger and not get caught on my gloves while I worked. We had 2 rings that we selected that we liked. We liked the above look of one and the side view and height of the other. Then the salesmen told us we'd be better off designing our own rather than buying a designer line ring. So we did, they took us back into their office and got onto a program that allowed us to change things about the rings to get them to be one ring that worked best for us. They really were helpful and kind to both of us. We spent about 2 hours there and ended up designed and purchasing my engagement ring. Now they just need to make it. We can't wait to see the finished result!! Will review again when the process is over!Best Indian in Madison.  I've been coming here for the past couple years - the food is superb and only surpassed by the service.  On just my second visit, the manager recognized me and took the effort to have a conversation, learn my name, etc.  He's friendly every time I come in, treats me like a regular even if I haven't been around in a couple months.  He truly makes sure we have a great dining experience - and it's not just me, all customers seem to get similar treatment.  The food itself, I could go on forever - just try it yourself.  My favorites are the lamb vindaloo, madras, goat malabar, chicken saag, you can't go wrong.  Oh and the weekend buffets are a great way to try a bunch of delicious things too.I've loved this place for years.  It's typical of chop suey houses in other major cities; authentic, perhaps short on style but absolutely outstanding food.  Great people.We have been to the art museum many times over the years, it always gets better.

The current cowboy exhibit is as usual good, even though it is not my cup of tea. One good thing, I saw an artist name that I recognize as being on one of our pieces at home. The difference between ours and the pieces in the museum is ours has no cowboys in it, just animals. But we will have to investigate. 

The exhibit we went to see for the most part was, Extending the Runway Tatiana Sorokko Style. It did not disappoint at all.

Of course we also enjoyed the rest of the exhibits and Phoenix should be very happy with this venue.O'Neil is a wonderful organization full of professional, passionate, dedicated employees. Each one is motivated to get you a high quality product within your price range. They listen to your needs and care deeply about exceeding your expectations.
HIGHLY Recommend them.It was my first experience going to a salon close by to where we lived, since our move from North Phoenix. I went over to this salon trusting the raving reviews about them and I am so glad I did. Not only is Noah an excellent hair stylist, he is very personable and didn't pressure me at all on purchasing products. He shows that he truly cares about the happiness of his clients. I am in love with my hair! I felt very relaxed and comfortable at VOLR. I loved the ambiance of the salon and the other staff were also friendly! For the level of customer service I received, the price was well worth it.  I am definitely going back!Even though I spent most of my formative years in the south, I have never in my life had fried chicken and waffles in one sitting.

I have been missing out!

The chicken was so good, I wanted more despite being totally full. The waffles were buttery, sweet, and yummy. Oh! And the macaroni cheese... *gasp* The sweet tea is VERY sweet. My friend was in the know, however, because he ordered half-regular and half-sweet which STILL tasted way too sweet for me.

The saltiness of the fried chicken mixed with the sweetness of the waffles is an unholy and remarkable combination.

Make sure you get there early because the line is long. However, the service is very good (even if she did serve me last because I was wearing a Steeler's jersey the day they played the Cardinals. It's why  I was in Phoenix). 

I could happily commit suicide by coronary here.My friend and I went here before a Suns game and waited 45 minutes to get in.  I knew this place was going to be good because all the famous sports players like Amare love to go there.  After the wait, we were allowed inside and we were starving.  We were instantly greeted by the owner/manager Larry White and he wasted no time getting us some sweet tea and Kool-Aide (I wish every place served Kool-Aide).  We both got the Lo Lo's plate which consisted of 3 pieces of chicken and 2 large waffles.  The food came out quickly and we didn't waste anytime chowing it down. The chicken was fantastically seasoned and breaded and the waffles were outstanding.  We were very satisfied with our meal and preceeded to the Suns game. Although the Suns lost by 30 points to the Pistons, the trip from Tucson was well worth it because of Lo Lo's.At first most of my noobie friends are very skeptical about the fusion of Chicken and Waffles.  but after taking them to this place and experiencing firsthand the divine taste of what they first believe was a anomalous combination, it made them change their Religion.

For lunch time I suggest that you get to this place as early 11AM since this place has a very limited sitting you can expect up to 2 hour wait. :(I'm sure this not the healthiest place you eat at, but closest you get to the perfect fried chicken.... While eating, the last thing i cared about was the healthy part of the food... Tried the 3 pc chicken smothered with gravy and onion and waffles (Not to mention the butter and syrup on the waffle), I know sounds absolutely crazy but an absolute heaven.... Have to try the gravy, always cooked right..love the hot sauce, great flavors.I'll admit, I was a little skeptical when I heard "chicken and waffles". It's just a curious combination, especially having grown up in the Northwest. This idea is all new to me.

Then my food arrived. I was no longer a skeptic. I could swear I had a full half of a chicken in my three pieces, and they were smothered in some delicious form of gravy, which I could have just as easily poured straight down my gullet. The chicken was cooked to perfection, as were the waffles. Even having everything mixed together on one plate which could barely contain all of that food didn't deter me one bit.

I do not have a single complaint about this place. Everything was amazing.I was really apprehensive to try LoLo's again after the big overhaul... afraid that it would lose the quality and charm that made it something special... Boy was I wrong!!!

The food is amazing.  Fried chicken perfectly seasoned, juicy and crispy! Mac & chee, waffles, green beans all cooked to southern perfection! 

A giant mason jar of blue kool-aid is the ultimate accompaniment  in my opinion, but they now have a wide range of alcoholic bevvies to wet your whistle if you prefer.

Chef Nicky stopped by our table twice to personally ask us about how we enjoyed our food - nice touch!  (And this is just one example of the spectacular service that we experienced the entire time we were at LoLo's!)

This place is rockin! I can't wait to show it off to out of town guests and local friends alike!I've been to Lo-Lo's (and catered another office luncheon) several times since my first review for them and it's always the same thing when I do patronize them; amazing, flavorful food cooked with love and served by gracious, friendly servers.  

The last time I went to their Phoenix location they had a special on an appetizer of fried green tomatoes and my husband and I tried them and were so impressed with them, delicious!  I definitely suggest you order them if they are offering them when you go!This is quite possibly the greatest place at which I have ever seen a show.  Beautiful old and restored theatre that oozes character and has fantastic acoustics. I hope to see many more shows here in the near future.You can't go wrong with pizza and wings from this joint!I was surprisingly blown away by the service. The staff was very friendly, the place was clean and even the manager came to each and every table to see how the food and service was. They were just really on the ball. 

The server was very friendly, even talked with my kids and laughed and made sure that she stayed on top of my older twos drink refills. 

It was really just a refreshing experience. They converted this "I avoid Denny's unless there is no other option" person to a "I will at least visit this Denny's when I am in the area." 

Food is responsibly priced, fun kid cups and food they will actually eat. :)I really like dive bars, there was good music, and cool people.When we arrived they got right to work.  We had a quarter size hole in the front windshield.  They were done in record time. You were all a great bunch, very attentive. Janie, who we made the appointment with was very nice.   The price was better than we expected.  Thanks for all your help.  If it happens again we will be back.I love you, NuTowne! The dirt lot. The endless array of amazing kitsch on the walls. The hella cool patio, some amazing legit metal sculpture. the mannequins. The Sunday beer bust, which is probably one of the most vibrant regular day drinking events in the region. The hugs from Daddy Ron.  The theme parties, including a luau and superhero party! The occasional blackout parties too! THIS is the coolest and most interesting gay bar in Phoenix. It's genuine, wacky, always fun. The location is perfect for me, as I'm in the East Valley.. I wish more people would migrate over from Central Phoenix more often to appreciate the awesome that is NuTowne!Excellent service.  Great piercer.  Would always recommend!!!!I am an ultimate lover of live music and jazz/blues... Char's has a live group everynight. Sometimes they have a dollar cover, but no worries about 4 quarters.  My favorite nights to go are Sunday nights. This hole in the wall jazz bar will bring you back to the olden days where the blues used to be hip on the streets. The music is great, and the performers are very experienced!!!! There is a little stage and dance floor in the middle of the club, tables and chairs all around.  I've had very fun nights there. The atmosphere is very dark, and lounge like, but the vibe is just so cool and relaxing where everyone is happy, accepting, and warm.  

The crowd is made up of people who appreciate jazz/blues, and just want to relax and a good time. Although there is a dance floor, it's not like a club in Old town Scotttsdale with 30 thousand dollar millionaires. haha

The last Sunday I went to char's, the whole group wore white, pimped out suits, and the women in white dresses. It took  me back to a jazz stage in the 1950's... Well what i've seen in movies... (I wasn't born in the 50's!!!)

They have one long full bar. The prices are decent to cheap for drinks these days... I am not sure if they have food though. I usually go around 10pm.

I say if you really want to experience something different, ar just love jazz/blues, check this place out.. You'll have a great time.These guys are the best! I came in with a dead battery, they realized my urgency (was on lunch beak and needed to get back to the office) and they had my truck done in 15 minutes. AND they gave me a discount since I work around the corner. Go out of your way to use this Firestone store!I got into my first accident EVER about 6 weeks ago, and wasn't quite sure what to do with my car, or where to go. Thankfully, my mother told me to run over to Select Auto Body to get an estimate on my car to turn into insurance, and the rest was history.

My mom and I stopped by without warning, and Bud was available right away to come look at my car. Without even going over to his computer, he quickly calculated a timeframe and price in his head, which was dead on according to the estimates he pulled up on his computer. Bud REALLY knows his stuff!

While on vacation, my mother took my car in for me. She picked my car up 4 days later, and it looked perfect! Bud and his team even put air in my tires because it showed they were low, AND they washed my car. Not just a quick wash on the outside, but a full on vacuum, clean and service. 

It makes me feel really good knowing that Bud and his team are out there, and I think it is great that clearly many others feel the way I do about them. Select Auto Body is an excellent business, and I hope that they do well for many, many more years. 

Thanks so much for fixing my car Bud!I went to Dr. Woodbury for 5 years before I moved (and it was hard to say goodbye).  Dr. Woodbury is gentle, caring and thorough when he works on your teeth.  I always felt as though I was listened to and also educated about how to take care of my teeth.  In addition, I never felt like I was being taken advantage of, as he suggested instead of filling in a small hole that could develop in to a cavity, he gave me tips as to how to deal with it so it did not turn in to a cavity (which it didn't)! 

The office staff is also extremely friendly, they remembered facts about my personal life, and also talked to me about their so I felt every time i went in there like a family.  

Thank you for five amazing years of healthy beautiful teeth! Fingers crossed I find a place like this in Chicago.Hi...I am Rico and I am an ice creamaholic!

This place is danger, danger, and danger!  Well, for me anyways, when a gram of sweet, creamy, frozen treat enters my body, 10 pounds are generated!

So I go here on metered visits, like an addict visiting a Swiss methodone clinic.  I go and binge and have my fix!

I love all the ice cream combos...orange sherbet and chocolate, cherry ice cream and vanilla, peanut butter and chocolate!  ahhhhgggg, how can I make just one, just one decision!  So in my desperation, like this place will be taken away from me, I always go for the super chocolate and peanut butter 7 scooper!  okay...not that big, but the 2 scoop sundaes are that big given different metrics.

Anyhoo...

my rec is to go if you have a calcium deficiency, go and reward yourself for waking up on time, go when you are having a bad day, go if you are having a good day, go when you don't know where to eat, go after you eat at your favorite place, go after sex, go before sex...just go!I've been with Dr. Cipolla for about two years; the staff is friendly, appointments are easy to book, many times within one or two days, and Dr. Cipolla is so nice!  
If you're uncomfortable with doctor visits, he's perfect for you.  He's soft spoken, caring, gentle, and best of all, very friendly.Biopsy observations were sent to various locations and physicians. Upon reflection, I have confidence in this group of Doctors. They are ultra thorough, and do extensive research before reaching a diagnosis. I would especially recommend Dr. Daniel Duick!After driving past this restaurant 5 days a week to and from school and noticing it always had a full lot, I decided to stop and get dinner.  I went with 2 dishes I have gotten often at other places, phad Thai with chicken and shrimp, and panang curry with beef.  Both dishes were absolutely delicious and the service was quick and friendly.  I will definitely be making this a place to stop at often.Fry Bread is really a lot like fried dough, but this restaurant takes it to a whole new level. My favorite is the beef and vegetable stew, but they have tacos and dessert stuff too. All centered around fry bread of course. The service is quick and the prices are reasonable. There is not wait staff. You order and they call your name.The night that I went most recently was a busy night because of a fair that was happening on 7th ave, so the food took about 10 minutes, but usually it's pretty prompt.Great Lunch Spot! Seriously if your downtown and in the mood for a sandwich you should hit up sacks. They really have turned sandwich making into an art. There salads are delicious as well.They are great with my two big dogs. We can't get them to stop squirming when we try to cut their nails, but the folks at Claws & Paws make it seem easy. Our dogs actually love coming here.If I could eat here every day I would. The staff is great, The food is good, The soda fountain has Mt. Dew. This is what a burger joint should be.I can't even tell you how much I love @BillJohnsonsAZ!

I have been going there since I was knee-high to a grasshopper, and they have never disappointed me.

Pulled pork, beef brisket, and hot links, is the perfect combination, to get a taste of everything that is wonderful about Big Apple.

The atmosphere alone would keep me coming back, time and again; sawdust on the floor, western decor (including miniature covered wagon lamps), and the waiters and waitresses are all packing heat, in the form of a .44 on their hips.

Used to be they could draw the guns, but now they're bolted to the holster. Sad reflection on the regression our society has gone through, that a prop must be secured "for the public safety".

They have a delicious apple pie dessert, that is properly served with american cheese. I personally prefer it with a scoop of vanilla.

And don't think they're only about lunch or dinner; they have a great breakfast menu. They also have M-F 6-11 AM specials, including a homemade cinnamon roll.

I have been to Big Apple more times than I can count, and I will return again.

And again.try the wings, ask for honey bbq! they are the bestI've been eating here since the mid 80's when it first opened. Always the best fajitas I've ever had.Well, O'Connor's is out of the loop for me since I live in TempE. I hate to even have a couple beers and drive that far home(-1). With the legal limit being lowered because they couldn't get enough convictions at .10, it's  sad, sad nation that continues to wage war with it's people on so many levels.
On to the good times. O'Connor's is a pretty nice pub right off the 17 at the Dunlap exit. All in All O'Connor's is a good place where, as the sign says, "You're only a Stranger Once" The long bar seats around 20 and there are tables, high top tables and booths also. There's a great mural on the wall listing the Counties of Ireland with a stage for live music in front of it. The standards: Pool table, Jukebox, Smoking Patio(with secret back door smoke spot) and some Bar Food in CrockPots(Free Food Baby). There's always a Rollins fan there and when I'm there, 2 of them. The bartender's have been pleasant enough and on weekends there is table service. 
They have a nice selection on tap, Guinness, Smithwick's (monk bear, yay), Samuel Adams ($3 bux all the time) and Bass, BASS? I once went in an Irish pub called The Pour House in Carnegie, PA and ordered a Bass and was admonished by the bartender "That's an English Beer and this is an Irish bar!" So I looked up at the bottles on the shelf and ordered a Corona :D

Even though I  took a star for distance, I will not hold that over their head. That's my own quirk, not drinking and driving, ha. They still get 5 stars.All Hail the "Cronut".  My buddy and I's cross Phoenix adventure to find cronuts lead us to Karl's.  They only had the chocolate one's left, but let me assure you they are delicious.  This love child of a croissant, donut, and eclair is amazing. You can tell they actually make the custard filling as it doesn't have that processed taste almost all creme filled donuts have here. I can't recommend them highly enough.  

The lady behind the counter was extremely nice and helpful always a good sign from a local bakery and much appreciated.  They do have a minimum credit card charge of $10 so keep that in mind. They had a ton of stuff from cakes, muffins, bread, etc. so there is plenty to try.

Great place I'll have to make another trek up there.

Try:
- French Donuts ( Cronut )This is one of my favorite restaurants period. They make everything fresh and even make their own chips. The mini tacos are super affordable at $1.20 a piece. I an a big fan of really authentic Mexican food and I have to say they excel at this. They have done of the best lengua I've ever tried and their tripas is always crispy. This is my favorite place to go when my work isn't serving something good for lunch (yes, I'm spoiled lol)

Also try the jamaica, they make their own and they do it very very well.I would like to just compliment this place again . There's been numerous times I done had over twenty bucks to three hundred dollars in my pocket that I left in there and this place would tell me when I come pick up my clothes . Trust me they didn't have to tell me and I wouldn't even known . Talk about honesty and loyalty . I will never ever go to another cleaner spot long as they exist !!Love this place! Can always find what I want here. The employees are always polite and friendly. I recently was helped by a young woman named gabby. She greeted me so politely and got me totally set up for my next camping trip! She knew so much about the outdoors and even explained to me how to use a Dutch oven! Something I never knew. I was surprised when she told me she was just an associate! I thought she was the manager of her department. I'll be coming back to her because she really went the extra mile to help me out. 5 outstanding stars for this place and the wonderful employees.Just had lunch here. Another great experience - you pretty much can't go wrong at Claim Jumper. I'm not a major salad buff by any stretch of the imagination, but I didn't want to fill up on anything so I went for one of their salads and man was I glad I did. I got the goat cheese and beet salad - walnuts, beets, mixed dark greens, papaya, cherry tomatoes in a citrus sauce with goat cheese. The cheese pretty much amounted to a tiny bit of sprinkles on top of the salad, but that didn't matter because it pretty much became my favourite salad of all time today after only having it once. Highest praise I can give to a dish basically. The Yelp app failed to lock my location so I couldn't do a checkin; apart from that, a five star visit.

No idea why the Yelp info shows this place as being in Scottsdale though. It's N Phoenix, at the 101 and I-17. Submitted biz change to have this corrected. (I was wondering why the CJ's didn't show up on my Yelp app on the cellphone for checkin; now I know..)Had breakfast there this morning and really enjoyed it. Great food, but a little hard to find.I purchased a firearm from this store. Great prices and friendly service. I will be a repeat customer. I like supporting small business like this. They are the backbone of  America.I was there last night, Monday night and this place is big!  If you are a native in town you can relate this place back to when we had The Golden 8 Ball in the Woolco shopping center off of 33rd ave & I.S. back before even Grand Central Station came in.   Anyway, this place is better because of the big horse shoe bar with very large areas all the way around it. I like that it feels more western than Scottsdaleish.  Karaoke on Sat,Sun& Mon.  The number of pool tables is amazing, along with all the dart and shuffle board, just to name a few.  There is a whole lot more to do in this place.  $2 draft beer during happy hour.   The decor and wood kinda reminded me of the bars that you see in old western movies.  Oh, and did I mention the killer outdoor patio....it too feels like you are still inside.  My server, Ruth, was really great coming around telling us all about the food and specials and finding us where ever we would move our party to.  Wish I had taken some pictures, next time I will.  Definately a place to take any out-of-towners for a "real' kinda bar.Awesome place!!! I keep coming here for the best chinese food with good portions. Yes it's not the best looking area or place, but you can't go wrong here. If your looking for looks go to P.F Changs. If your looking for amazing chinese food come here!!!I saw Christine's review and had to throw in my 2 cents.

I love the Humane Society.  I found my first dog at the 13th and Hatcher campus and couldn't have been happier with the service and the dog.

When we adopted our second dog from a sick friend, we knew that we had to get this little girl fixed.  When she was old enough, we took her to the Dobbins campus and had her spayed.  The employees were incredibly nice and comforting and our little Layla recovered pretty quickly from the surgery.  And it only cost $60 which is phenomenal if you check with private vets.  They do it all the time, so they are pros at it.They remodeled! Still great food, but now the place looks awesome inside, too!Just have to say how absolutely marvelous my overall experience was with Payne & Morrison! Deanna was recommended to me from a friend for my wedding day and I have to honestly say at first I was a little hesitant going to a smaller flower shop... but all I have to say is how happy I chose them because they were able to fulfill my needs more! From being able to fit everything into budget; getting exactly the flowers I always dreamed of, being able to make last minute changes and being able to meet one on one for advice - I knew my day was going to be perfect and it was!!! They showed up right on time and even added a personal touch in my bouquet (my Mother had passed away just a few Months before the wedding so they put a couple flowers of remembrance in it). I highly recommend them!! :))I love the food and enjoy dining here.  The staff is always friendly and professional.  I always tip greater than 20% because the food is always well prepared, the staff is professional and attentive, and I support local business.  The only negative  is that they do not provide a "salad plate" to diners to eat their chips and salsa off of.Rick is AWESOME! I called him Friday for a quote on Monday afternoon. He showed up and gave me a quick verbal quote which was very reasonable  and offered suggestions to help me save money. I asked him when he could do the work and he said let me go get some lunch and I'll be back. He was in a out in about 3 hrs for several issues that other handymen couldn't solve. He's very knowledgeable, personable and cleans up his workspace. Kudos to Rick, well worth every penny!This is a good store for your beauty needs. They are open until 8pm too which is nice.My favorite sub shop.  Great sandwiches friendly staff.  We stop there a couple times a week.I've been to this Bosa Donuts location many times, and they get pretty busy in the mornings. 

However, the best time to go is in the middle of the night! Whenever we have midnight cravings for something sweet, we head to Bosa Donuts! They always have a variety of donuts on stock and the taste and quality never falls short! 

Try the crumb donut, its the best!Loved this place!! Def something worth checking out. Great architecture, and the layout is very creative as well. There are 5 studios of art to check out and all of them were nice and very interesting.. and only $3.50 to get in and walk around! nice cheap way to beat the heat for an hr or two!The young hip mom that cuts my hair is AWESOME!! I always go to her. She been cutting my hair for the last 2 years. Her name is ANESSA!! Ask for her. She use to work at Steven Paul Salon in Scottsdale.

When you go inside it seems really BIG because of the mirrors that are plastered throughout the place. It's a good place to mingle, but most of the people their god there for a specific stylist, but I think they have walk-ins. 

Like what Aimee said "this place is a hidden gem".the service is a bit slow, but worth the wait the staff is helpful.  The wife and i go for Menudo on Sundays it is delicious.  can't rave enough about it.  go early because sitting is limited and it gets packed quick.I'm almost painfully straight-laced, and look quite out of place in a tattoo shop. That said, the staff was friendly and helpful and I didn't get so much as a funny look for walking in wearing business clothing.

The store is clean and none of the piercers (to my knowledge) use piercing guns.

Trevor, one of the piercers, is very knowledgeable, and I would strongly recommend his services.


Edit - I've gotten more piercings done at the same location, and always have a pleasant experience there. Samantha is typically working the front when I come in and she is invariably helpful. If you're looking for a tattoo or piercing parlor, Urban Art is the place to go.Blue Adobe is our meeting place for Abby Bella Dance Scottsdale. We meet new emloyees, have meetings and just have lunch and happy hour. Every day there is an amazing special for just $10, my favorite is the seafood enchiladas. Stuffed with shrimp, salmon and other delights from the sea combined in a blue corn tortilla and topped with sauce and cheese. Everything I have tried is great! 

The patio is a great place to meet with friends and wind down from your day. 

Great chips and salsa. The service is always good and Michael always stops by with a joke and/or a story.This is the place to get your fruits and veggies!  My friend Robyn N. had been telling me I should go and check it out so I finally did and I'm sure glad I did!  This reminds me of the vegatable stands I used to go to with my parents growing up in Northern California.  And the prices are amazing!  I walked away with two full bags of produce for $13!!  I got cauliflower, broccoli crowns, zucchini, apples, straberries, corn, croutons, popcorn (the unpopped kind), and mushrooms.  Everything is awesome!  The staff were friendly too.  I hear the cinnamon rolls are to die for and they get them fresh everyday.  I resisted this time but next time I don't think my willpower will be so great.  This is an awesome find!This little place just looks like a hole in the wall, and it is.  But the food, Amazing!!  We have been going for a couple years now and the sushi is always great, but just recently tried the calamari appetizer, SO good!  I don't know what the sauce they serve it with is but I think I could drink it straight from the cup.  We LOVE their salad dressing too and always ask for double salad instead of soup!Ryan the manager invited us back in tonight and Logan took great care of us. We had the seafood bruschetta it was amazing. We then had the margarita pizza it tasted like the old Vito's we know and love! Thank you Logan the server we had was also outstanding tonight!yOur 5 and 7 year old daughter's have been in this preschool for going on 2 years now. 

I can say that it by far one of the best decisions we have made. It is very structured (which our 5 year old was lacking with an in home care giver) 

They also have additional programs such as "phonics" where our 5 year old is progressing at great speed Thanks to miss Judy! 

The center director Nicole is fabulous,  she always makes time to listen to our needs, to stop and say hi or have a great night. 

Our 7yr old daughter is mildly Autistic and they do so much to help her understand and continue learning at her pace,  and the best way for her ability. 

Our 5yr old has mild Asthma, Nicole and the staff will remind me to tell them if she needs a breathing treatment,  and the best time per doctor's instruction to do so.  

All in all we find this Pre School wonderful! 

And don't ever call it a Day Care... It's not,  your child will actually learn here,  and be cared for.Rooms are being renovated at this historic hotel (1912) but the dining  and public rooms retain their olde-worlde ambience.  The all you can eat prime-rib buffet on Saturday evening is a delicious Chandler tradition. One of the main benefits of staying here, rather than an anonymous La Quinta, Days, Fairfield,etc etc Inn on a concrete slab by the freeway, is that the San Marcos is a 1minute stroll away from the charming, historic Downtown Chandler Square with fun shops, bars and restaurants.  Don't miss the San Marcos - great staff and great rooms!Ok...so I am one sided about this place! My husband and I consider ourselves "regulars". If you are looking for spaghetti and meatballs, this is not that type of Italian food! This restaurant is truely authentic Italian food....the "soul food" of Italy. I just love the boar, yes I said boar meat sauce over Pappardelle! Don't knock it 'til ya tried it!!I went to Gio's Automotive in March to get a tire rotation and oil change with inspection back in March.  The shady lady running the place told me I needed to get new brakes and a transmission tune up, slapping me with a $350 estimate.  I'd just gotten both my front and rear pads and rotors replaced 2 years ago.  Needless to say, I didn't get the job done.  There was however a squeaking sound coming from my wheels, which I suspected to be a bearing.  But I'm not a mechanic.  
I decided to take my car in to someplace else to get a second opinion.  After searching around, I found a deal on Amazon Local for break service at Tire Pros.  I took my car in anticipating to use the voucher and get new brakes.  However, the man at the counter (I think his name was Jonathan) told me to let him have the mechanics check out the car before I redeemed the voucher.  After a few moments of waiting,  Jon asked me why I thought I needed new brakes.  I told him that I'd been told this by another repair place.  He walked me out to my car, where the tire had been removed and showed me the tread on my brakes.  He confirmed that I had PLENTY of time left on the brakes and that the squeaking I was hearing was indeed the bearing.  He walked me back up to the counter and told me I might be able to get a refund for the voucher I'd bought if I contacted Amazon.  And gave me a quote to have the bearing replaced.  The cost was very reasonable. It was refreshing to have someone who was honest look after my car this way.  He didn't even charge me for the guys having running the initial check. He and his team are the best!I purchased an amazing Schecktor Black Jack guitar from these guys.
It took me a couple of days to realize, but unfortunately, the guitar was too heavy for me.
I was really stressed about bringing it back.
I had no problems returning this item, which confirms that costumer satisfaction is a priority for brindley's....not just making a quick buck.
cheers!! 5 stars!!I love Elmer's. They're so friendly and food is great. I always order the "red & bean" burrito it's not on the menu. But its delish!! It's beans with their special red sauce and a bunch of shredded beef. It's so flavorful and tender. The strips are also very good. Highly recommend this place!!We've been using Delia's since they opened at this location, there are several other cleaners in the local area and had tried them all with mixed results (we wont hesitate to change to a different cleaner if the service isn't great, wound up at Delia's and have stayed with them ever since)

Delia's always does a fantastic, timely job. There have been one or two occasions where a garment was lost  (in what has probably been a decade doing business with them). They seem to research the incident and ultimately will reimburse. I appreciate that they do seem to make an effort to look for the garment, and they've never once haggled on the value we placed on the lost garment.

They're not cheap, but they do a great job.Love it... Especially the wafflesI felt like the luckiest girl in the world. I have wanted to see the Giants at Spring Training since forever and this year we got to go! 

My guy is the best, he bought us a couple tickets to see the San Francisco Giants play Japan. JAPAN! When would that normally ever happen in baseball season? It really was an experience of a lifetime. 

The day was hot, so we should have been prepared and upgraded to the shady suites. I'm a fan of the sun, but the weather was unbearable to sit during the whole game. 

We enjoyed beers and a brat from the Anchor Steam tent, just a little bit of home away from home. Seeing orange and black everywhere, watching Sandoval and Posey, some regulars and a whole lotta new players.

The game was fun, although we didn't win. My guy bought me a souvenir shirt and one for my nephew at home, he's definitely a keeper.Was out in Arizona visiting my brother and we saw that the Barrett Jackson Auction was going on that weekend we were there.  We were able to get tickets and couldn't wait to go...

When we first walked in, I was amazed at how big the entire event was.  There was so much stuff to look at, we didn't have time to absorb it all in on one day. There were so many gorgeous cars that you were able to look at and each one had a little bit of info about itself. I would say about 90% of the cars were gorgeous and I would have been happy to take anyone of them home. 

They had test drives for various car makes and they were free.  Once you tested them out, the Bonderant Racing team was out there in their Bonderant Corvette, and you got to go on a lap with them.  Man... that was almost worth the entire experience itself.  Amazing how fast and how much force you can feel when getting whipped around a hairpin turn and fishtailing through it. Everyone was super friendly here and made it an overall great experience.

Sitting in at the auction was pretty crazy when you had a person bidding near you.  They are so intense and I enjoyed every minute of it there. It is amazing how people can just bid and bid without a worry in their head about what they are spending.  Must be nice... Haha

The one negative is the food is quite pricy, but it is expected at any kind of big event such as this. They did have a lot of tasty food tents to pick from, so that was nice as well. 

Overall, I would recommend everyone to check it out one year if you are able to.  It is quite the experience and thrill to see so much mechanical beauty in one area.I love Julios too!!!!!! The best mexican food around. Free chips and salsa and the Chicken Mini Chimis are to die for. Definitely a must if you haven't tried it.

P.s. writing a bad review about the restaurant for being a dumbass and parking in the parking lot to go out clubbing, resulting in getting towed, isn't the restaurants fault. Follow the parking rules!!Trustworthy and knowledgable!  I stopped in here today with a tire that was about to blow.  These guys were the best, they spent time calling to find me a replacement (I don't have normal sized tires) and put my spare on at no cost.  I couldnt have asked for better services.  They were friendly, courteous and helpful,  I will be back!I have been sampling falafel all over the west coast since the 70s ... this is one of the my two favorites.Kona Grill really surprised me with how great their happy hour is! And on top of that I love any place with reverse happy hour on a Friday night!! Cheap drinks and great food always make me happy!Went here on a Saturday night for a date night and it was absolutely amazing. The dining atmosphere was quiet, the lighting was nice, and our waiter was very helpful as it was our first time here.

We started off with an Apple Martini and a Cosmo which were made to perfection. Then we ordered the Iceberg (wedge) salad to split, the stuffed eggplant and the chicken Parmesan. The portions were bigger so we each had to bring some home for lunch tomorrow. The chicken was juicy, the stuffed eggplant was made with just enough spicy 'kick' to it (upon request) and had a hint of garlic in it. Overall, the experience was one we absolutely enjoyed and would recommend to anyone.Being the procrastinator I am, I needed to find a good pediatrician quickly after I gave birth to my daughter two weeks early.  After a little research, I settled on Dr. Garrett at Scottsdale Children's Group.  I'm extremely satisfied with my choice.

The office staff is super-friendly and set up an appointment for my daughter two days after I initially called (I called Saturday from the hospital; I got an appt, on Monday).  When we arrived, there was a short wait time before we were called into the room.  Don't worry if you need any extra diapers or wipes; the rooms are well-stocked--nice when your baby decides to poop all over the table.  The medical assistants were friendly and even gave me extra time to nurse my daughter in the room after the appointment.

Dr. Garrett is wonderful.  When I told her that breastfeeding was off to a rocky start, she scheduled a follow-up appt. with me later in the week to see if the situation improved.  It did, thanks in part to her suggestions.  She is friendly and down-to-earth, unlike some doctors I've dealt with in the past.

I have to move to Tucson soon and am sad to have to leave Dr. Garrett.  I would highly recommend her to any parents looking for a good pediatrician.Great dinner last night. Our server, Paris, went above and beyond last night to make our visit great. 

The food was terrific!My husband and I recently switched to a plant based diet and this place has made it possible!  I love how they organize the store and make it so convenient to find the foods that suit you.  I love the spice counter, veggie selection, vegan options, non-dairy selection is great, and they have their bars organized by vegan, gluten free, they have vegan chocolate bars that are delicious, and the staff is knowledgeable.  I could shop here daily, in fact some weeks I do. :-)I had a great fusion ahi tuna sandwich here.  They made the ahi tuna with a spicy southwestern chipotle sauce on a ciabatta bread.  They added a a few other vegetables inside the sandwich.  It was absolutely delicious.  This has to be one of the best fusion combos I have ever had.  It came with a side of mashed potatos.  The actual menu is very limited, but I would come back here again just to get this dish and some wine (The wine list is huge).Overwhelming wine list and everything we ate was absolutely delicious. You will have no problem finding extraordinary flavors in the food here! We ordered their cheese plate, mini-mushroom dish, pork shank, and the blondie dessert...all to die for...Amazing meal to start a night out in Oldtown. Broused the great beer and wine selection over bruschetta with a twist: some had marinated mushroom topping which I rather enjoyed. Dinner was served quickly considering the size of the crowd. I had the Sugar Smoke Shank which was very good, though a little spicier than I expected. The star of the show, however, was my wifes Pastrami Style Short Rib. Just order this. It's exactly what it sounds like, which is amazing. Seriously, don't leave here without some of this in your belly. Overall a great place for dinner if you're into that sort of thing.What the?! I had to travel to Phoenix, AZ to see the most stunning Nordstrom in the US? But I come from Seattle where Nordstrom originated! And while the Seattle Nordstrom is great, this one blew my mind. 

I came shopping with a few gal pals and neither of us walked out without having spent at least $200 on something we didn't need. Killing time at the mall before meeting up for a work summit, we had a blast trying on shoes, sifting through bikini racks and checking out everything the store had to offer. 

When I was making a purchase at one of the counters the saleswoman commented on how they were currently in the final phases of a major overhaul. Noticing how lovely the layout was and how each section at Nordstrom looked like its own boutique, she mentioned that it was all brand new. Feeling jealous I told her, "But I come from the land of Nordstrom and our isn't even this nice!" With a big smile she handed me my bag and suggested I check out the shoe section. So I did. And I got stuck there at least another hour. I was so overwhelmed by this store and how awesome the layout was. It wasn't as crowded as the Seattle Nordstrom and everyone working there was extremely attentive and friendly. If I'm back in Scottsdale/Phoenix again, I'll make sure to pop by and do a quick shop here.i am shocked by any bad reviews of this place and i urge anyone who had a bad experience to give 'em another shot! i have seen this tiny place tucked on the side of Camelback for sometime but wasn't impressed with its exterior enough to venture in but boy, was i missing out! these pancakes will knock your socks off; every cake i've tried has taken me to taste -bud heaven. i'm usually not a fan of the richness in chocolate chip pancakes but for some reason The Original Pancake House makes them so divine, i typically order them... but it's not without a thoughtful internal argument since everything looks and tastes really flippin' good. 

i feel sorry for anyone letting the minor "rules" that they ask that you turn off your cell (AS COURTESY to your server and other patrons) and that they are a cash-only establishment get in the way of enjoying super tasty pancakes. but i'm glad some people keep away - it means more for me!Very good service.  The Adult Arnold Palmer is delicious, both the standard and peach version. Great food as well.  Don't forget to get a side of green chili mac 'n' cheese!Fantastic food and great service. The candy fish was exquisite. The pad Thai is also very nice.This would be my new home if I lived in AZ. I went happy hour on Saturday and $3 imports almost made me cry. Staff was cool. Vic, i think thats his name, even tried to help with my friend's annoying question about a Czech beer for like 20 minutes. 

Cant wait to come backBeen there twice, wait staff is nice and "real" ( I love a place that has people working who have tattoos).  But that's not the point.  Food was quick, fresh and delicious!  The price was awesome for what we got on a Tuesday before 6pm, a 16oz bud lite, cheese garlic bread, and two big slices of pizza with add. toppings fed the both of us happily.  Definitely going back!We LOVE Tottie's and have enjoyed the food, ambiance and service for years! I'm not sure if we've tried everything on the menu, but every entree we've ordered has been amazingly delicious.  My husband especially likes the ice creams.  There's quite a selection and everyone is made on the premises.This is the best DD ever!!!  I come in here before I head over to work sometimes and the staff is sooooooo friendly!!  I bought a small coffee, and the worker gave me an ice water to-go along with the coffee; I didn't even have to ask him for water!  The manager even spoke with me briefly before I left.  Some places rush their customers out, but the workers will talk to you and treat you well here!  Thanks for treating your customers like royalty, DD!  :)Somuchchocolategoodness!!! Fudge bites & candy apples oh my! Love this place! I can't believe all the different candy apples they have.I believe the habanero burger has destroyed my ability to detect heat and I love it. I come back as often as I can to pay for the privilege to have my tastebuds killed by this delicious burger.Zipps is an excellent neighborhood bar. Even though I typically go during the busiest times, service is quick and done right. The food is a bit cheaper than other bar & grills and is tasty.

Check out the great happy hour & nightly specials and the patio with lots of tv's.By now you've heard the adventures at the Rustler's Roost ( http://www.yelp.com/biz/rustlers-rooste-phoenix#hrid:_gYib8eA4hDfylSs17Zc_g ). But my adventures in Phoenix didn't end there. 

My BGF had been hounding me for days to find some great "Q." He was convinced that AZ would have great "Q" on every corner. Now referring back to the link above, I admit that I had a wee hangover at the time. Anyway, I'll press on. We chose this place because BGF thought that this would be the spot. 

I ordered the roast garlic chicken and realized with my first bite that I had died (most likely alcohol poisoning from the night before) and was now in heaven. This was the best freakin chicken that I ever tasted. Of course I'm in heaven and BGF is grousing about the "Q" not being any good. 

Now I've listened to this all week from him. 

- This Q is too Spicy 
- This Q is too wet 
- This Q won't fall off the bone 
- This Q doesn't have the right flavor. 

I'll admit it, I snapped. (And I didn't forgive him for about 2 weeks). I went up one side and down the other. If you don't like the gosh darn (loosely translated) Q in AZ, the quit ordering the Blankity Blank (translation again) stuff. Needless to say, I got quite the look from BGF and boss. Boss was actually laughing at us. 

Anyway, I took pity on my BGF and shared some of my chicken, and he fell in love (I don't know why, it wasn't a rooster - oops, I digress). Anyway, it was decided then and there, this is the best chicken around, hands down.Chicago style steakhouse with an exceptional wait staff.  Decor is (mostly) baseball memorabilia, jazz for the background music, food is wonderful steak house fare.  All ages, young, old, in-between were enjoying food and conversation.  Get reservations before you go.Ok so I must have been in a bad mood when I wrote my previous review because this place is one of my favorites. It's where my sister and I decided to have our Grad party and were met with zero hesitation from my parents.

I love this place the atmosphere is fantastic with all the sports collectibles, it doesn't happen to be terribly loud for dinner unlike a lot of places. Let's not forget they start you out with some of the best chopped liver I have ever had.

My favorite here is the prime rib as it is always perfectly cooked and seasoned and nice and juicy. I am also a big fan of the cesar salad here, for some reason it is better than most.

Oh and found out the steak sandwich is really a medium steak served with 2 pieces of bread on the side. My buddy ordered it at my grad party and we both expected some slices of steak between some bread. What he got was a full steak and 2 pieces of garlic break.
 
I have no idea what made me post the last review and not throw out the one random night they were a bit off on a busy holiday. This is on of my favorites in the valley and my first choice when I want a steak. Been here tons of times and hope to go back tons more.Bathroom that makes you want to crap into a hole in the floor?  Check.
Jukebox that has a cornucopia of blissfully crappy hairband rock? Check.
Beer?  Check.
Dirt parking lot? Check.
All in the heart of Scottsdale?  Check.

Yes, the coach house was brought to my consciousness by none other than Kathryn L., who isn't a yelper but should be, and her two lovely friends.  Dive bar perfection.  Not much space, too many smokers outside, but domestic light beer by the plenty and drunk pinball whenever you're ready to kick it up a notch.

This is also a great place for spring training drinks, and if you stay here long enough you just may forget your middle name.Wanna go to....uh... Whuzza place... The one widda Christmas lights and stuff? Uhhh.. :hic:... Coach house! Yaaaaa riiiiight. :burp:

Goes our conversation after bar number two or three. I never start my night here, we always end up here somehow. Either by cab or rickshaw or bike or golf cart. All signs point to Coach house when you're wasted. Followed by Philadelpha Sandwich Co, which you can stumble to if you're up for the walk. 

Even if it isn't Christmas when the place is light up for the world to see, Coach House rocks. Inside is small, but there's a small bar outside as well. The only time I've ever had to wait to get in was when the Fire Marshall was there making a show of keeping the numbers down inside. Something about safety and fire hazards and other such nonsense. 

Bring money for the jukebox! And don't be an idiot or you'll get kicked out. Scratch that... Just don't be an idiot.I was referred her by my PCP, Dr. Lillo.  Checked to see if Dr. Cohen was a part of my insurance plans APN (Performance Network..deeper discounts if you use APN providers) and sure enough he was listed!  

My first visit - Dr. Cohen confirms what Dr. Lillo told me in my wellness visit.  Immediately wants to jump into action and get testing done.  

My second visit - First tests in office.  Painless.  And I received information about my other test - which had been approved by my insurance. 

The office staff is on the ball with contacting my insurance to make sure pre-auths are obtained.  I like that.  

I can only hope that when all is said and done, I'll be breathing easier.  :)My husband and I live in Washington, DC and visited Scottsdale for a winter getaway over New Year's Weekend. We love food and restaurants  and make a point to seek out the best sushi, Mexican food and pizza when we travel.  After much research we selected Patsy Grimaldi's for pizza and could not have been more pleased with quality of the food and the service.

The menu is simple, featuring salads, calzones and pizza.    We ordered the Mediterranean salad which was delicious - and that is not a word I use often in reference to salads.  The salad had fresh romaine lettuce, fresh tomatoes and cucumbers, feta cheese, a few red onions and uber flavorful kalamata olives.  The salad was chopped to perfection and pre-tossed with a light dressing. 

And then there was the pizza.  There are three pizza "bases" to chose from - mozzarella/tomato, white pizza, or pesto - and then you can select your own toppings.  We selected the tomato and mozzarella base with pepperoni and jalapeno peppers.  The mozzarella was not shredded and loaded all over the pizza.  It was fresh mozzarella placed sparingly all over the crust so every bite had some cheese, but it did not overwhelm the pie.  The sauce was made from homemade crushed tomato sauce with just the right seasoning.  The crust was thick and tasty and cooked evenly.  The toppings added some extra flavor, although we would have enjoyed the pizza without them.   This was hands down one of the top three pizzas I have ever eaten and I have eaten a lot of pizza.  

I was surprised to see so many reviews mention Grimaldi's as "overpriced."  Our meal - salad, pizza and two beers was $36 after tax.  For a yummy dinner for two I don't know how you can do much better than that.  I can only guess that the folks moaning and groaning about the price of the pizza chose to top their pizza with 4-5 of the more expensive ingredients that pushed the price of the pizza into an uncomfortable range.  Just be selective with your toppings and you will find Grimaldi's to be an excellent value.

One last note - we did wait for about 35 minutes for a table, which was fine.  We went on a Saturday night.  We had a very friendly server and we were pleasently surprised when we told her we wanted a salad and a pizza but didn't know what size to order.  (My husband wanted both large's.... I thought we'd need a large salad and small pizza.)  Our server told us to order a small pizza and small salad and she was right.  It was more than enough food. She could have nudged us in a different direction and we would have spent more money, but the fact that she was honest about the portions was much appreciated.

Run, don't walk to Grimaldi's next time you are looking for pizza in Scottsdale.Worth every minute of the 30 minute drive to get there!! The roasted chicken and rib combo is one of the few " wow" dinners we've had in a long time! The grilled artichoke was only bettered by the overall service that you get.

Be sure to make reservations......it's a long wait without them!I love the baby back ribs they fall right off the bone! Order them trust me!Love this placeVery special place... Yes the menu was enticing and the food served lived up to the succulent descriptions (a perfectly seared scallop dish for me, and some really fine, melt in your mouth chicken for my partner), but there was something else. From the moment we walked in and were greeted, through the meal service with our waitress, to the goodbyes at the exit, there was this special air of connecting, caring hearts. I know, that sounds kinda goofy, but there just seemed to be some special and warm hearted about the place and the people--- gotta imagine the owner sets some sort of tone, and it is the stuff that will keep me coming back.  Oh, and then something else happened, but I'll save that for a second review entryFine dining in Scottsdale gets no better than Rancho Pinot, located in a small mall, decorated in what can only be called a quirky manner, and serving food that is often astonishingly good.  Do not be fooled by the faux Western wall hangings - Rancho Pinot is using them to tell you that they are striving for a comfortable feel and unstuffy service.  Take them for what they are.  After you taste the food you won't care and when you finish the meal you will probably ... well you will probably think the decor is still quirky.

As to the food, Rancho is serious about creativity.  They do standard dishes with flavors, ingredients, and twists that make almost everything into an "oh, wow!".  Once in a while they miss, as they did with the grilled striped bass, which they dried out a little going for crispy.  But not often, and even then the sides were superb.

One example: their strawberry shortcake is pretty standard except the shortcake is basically a scone, and it works beautifully.

Expensive indeed, but not too much so for what you get.From the view to the food to the service, everything was perfect. We did dinner and watched the sunset then met friends at Jade bar next door for a few drinks. We shared the edamame and ahi tartare for apps. I had the sea bass and my boyfriend had the steak, both were awesome. The band at Jade was amazing, we will definitely return!What??? This place is fantastic!! 

Like many others, I hesitate to write about it as it is such a little gem in the middle of strip mall hell and sometimes it is hard to get a reservation! But, Razz's is so special that I felt he was due a review! 

I have and will only eat at the Chef's Table as Razz is hilarious!! He is total entertainment and I just delight in everything he says and creates! 

So how this works...you sit down, tell him what you like, don't like, food allergies etc and what you want to drink...the rest is in his hands! He is totally accommodating for food allergies (which the GF BF loves!) and he has some great unusual wines at fair prices! 

And then the gluttony begins....course after course comes out of AMAZING food! Everything is superb and I am always painfully stuffed when I leave as I just want to see what he makes next! We have never had the same thing twice, which is something Razz prides himself in, and we really enjoy the whole experience! Finally, when you decide to throw in the towel (my record is 7 courses!), a fantastic desert assortment comes out just to finish off a fantastic meal! One thing to remember - don't eat the bread until he tells you it is okay! 

Razz does close down for the summer (leaves in May, returns in October) so be sure to try it before he is gone and always check their website as they often have great coupons available.  He also stays open late too!

Love it!!!!Pretty small outfit, but the great staff fill the space with a selection of electric and acoustic guitars, and more importantly their knowledge and skill.  You'll see a slew of recently-repaired guitars, waiting for pickup -- a testament to their abilities and fair prices.

I dropped of a hand-me-down guitar for a set-up, hopeful that was all that the old gal needed.  A non-rushed order, they called me a two days later (one of the days was a holiday, even!) to let me know she was indeed in poor shape and I'd be better off buying new than spending unnecessarily on a crappy guitar.

I ended up getting a new guitar elsewhere (no negative on them...I'm just cheap and went the online/no-tax route.  However, my new shiny geetar needs a setup, and I know just the place.

They also give lessons, I believe, but I did not inquire during any of visits.  That's not to say I won't...anyone who has heard me play knows I'm in great need of more expert advice and tips!

Please, please, please, please, please spend your money here rather than Guitar Center.  That place is insanely horrible.Best vacation spot ever.Love the Village Tavern.. great Scottsdale location, not too far from Old Town. The fettuccine alfredo is a great size for lunch, and the sweet potato fries are better than I have had at many restaurants. Outside seating available.. very clean property, and the staff is friendly. Will return.I took my son for Arizona Restaurant Week, wow amazing value for only $30! Top notch service & the best filet mignon in the world. Creamed spinach is a must, and for dessert Ruth's famous bread pudding. A+++Amazing Asian Chicken salad!This is a great Japanese restaurant. The appetizers that we had were gyoza, tuna tempura roll, and the calamari. They were all very good and tasted fresh. My wife had the chicken katsu which was well prepared. It was not heavily breaded like many I have tasted before, and the sauce to go with it was good. I had some yellowtail and salmon sashimi. It all tasted very fresh! It all just melted in my mouth. The head sushi chef/owner also had us try some special wasabi that he made. That tasted really well with everything. We also tried the miso soup, which was one of the better ones I have had. I am half Japanese and have had tried many Japanese restaurants and this one is one of the best in the Phoenix area. To top it all off the owner is very friendly.I can't say enough good things about this hotel. The staff went out of their way to make my boyfriend and I comfortable. The breakfast buffet was much more than I expected. The room was incredible: very large and well-equipped with a full sized fridge and other kitchen amenities. 

I will be returning to this hotel in the future!LOVE LOVE LOVE!! Nice atmosphere, good service, great food!! I would definitely go here again and again :)Great food, great service (Kendall rocks!!!), great view!Still my go to for great chinese!Just an FYI that they have moved locations to the plaza on the North East corner of Pima and Pinnicle Peak Rd.
Same staff, same menu and same amazing service.Great environment and great food. The bread is to die for! A bit pricey but its enough for two servings usually. Try the pistachio ice cream. That alone will keep you coming back for more.When I think of delicious and filling comfort food, Persian Room is one of the first places that comes to mind. I have eaten here many times over the years and the experience has never been anything but exceptional. It's not cheap but not overall expensive and the portions served are enough for multiple meals.

I have had many different dishes but. A few of my favorites are:

1. The hummus and eggplant appetizer served withy their fresh made delicious flag bread.

2. Beef koobideh. My wife loves the chicken but I prefer the beef. It's a long piece of seasoned ground beef. Sounds boring but is absolutely amazing. I actually like it more then the filet skewer. Totally savory and mouth watering.

3. The chicken barg. Simple dish but they manage to make chicken breast juicy, flavorful, and perfect. I don't often order chicken at restaurants but I crave this stuff.

The nice part about this place is you can order combos of pretty much anything. Again, the portions are huge so we always end up having leftovers. 

Makes my mouth water just thinking about it...Great Gym.  Nice selection of equipment.  I can do cardio, lift, or utilize their boxing area.  And most importantly it's clean.  Friendly staff and good location.  People take working out serious there which is refreshing.  Look forward to going back.so we just moved into a new house and what do you know? this place is less than a mile from us. i've heard about it, been invited to it, but never had the time to stop in. over the course of 2 weeks moving, we've been here several times already.

the atmosphere is so casual and friendly. so many beers i've never heard of! we just ask the server and he has not disappointed. they have some of the best vegetarian style pizza we've ever had. soft and hot toppings, and crispy crust with a little burnt edges....mmmm! 

there's tons of reviews for this place so i'm not going to tell you anything new, but we like it and hope to make it a regular stomping ground.
be prepared for the icy air though....it's freezing in there.The first time I came here was during the day and it was filled with an older crowd and had this very divey feel to it, but the beer was good! Only complaint was the chips and salsa which didn't seem very homemade. Lol.

Decided to give it another shot and came in the evening for dinner and drinks. And wow! This place is awesome later in the day. Very good vibe and friendly staff. Lots of beer on tap. Pizza and sandwiches are also very tasty!

I now come here every couple weeks and will continue to return for dinner and drinks. Never been here past 10pm so not sure how it gets later in the night, but the dinner crowd and service is highly recommended!Quick, cheap and utterly DELICIOUS.

I regularly visit Fiesta Burrito to curb my desire for (you guessed it) a big ol' burrito. You can get a huge plate of tasty Mexican food here for only a few dollars. And your food is usually ready in less than three minutes. I'm being serious. This place is gold.

Try their chimichanga plate or the rolled tacos with guacamole, and order a "pina" drink to go along with it. It's great for lunch, dinner or midnight snacking.This is the friendly, local bike shop you are looking for. This place is welcoming and just wonderful really. I was a bit intimidated before going to other bike shops and had a not great experience at a few as I feared. Not so here. As you can see from all the reviews, this is the bike shop you can feel at home in.Great place to eat seafood, now i'm from Alexandria, Egypt on the meditteranean born and raised, so sea food is in my blood, i was very impressed with this place, the rockefeller oysters were great, and the atmosphere is very cool.

The place is a bit loud and busy but that just adds to the experience!This place is GREAT!!! I have been a customer of Frenchs since the early 90s when they had a Mesa location. Great people, great food. If you are looking for a designer butcher shoppe, this is not it. If you want great meat at a great price...go here NOW!!!awesome sandwiches. I'd been here 2 times and 5 starts every timeI Love this place. It is by far the best Italian deli in AZ. I have been here numerous times and never once have I had a bad experience. 
The guys who work there are always very nice and helpful.
 They have lots of food  and beverage options!

I recommend the caprese salad and any of their sandwiches. SO delicious 

The only down side is that when they are busy, the line long can also mean a long wait before you actually get your food.85 Miles round trip. Ughhhhh, this is what we drive to get to George & Sons, yes it is that good!  Several years ago we were treated to take out at a friends house and as it turns out she picked up dinner from George & Sons and we have been hooked ever since.  

Stand outs for us is the Sizzling Rice soup, Shrimp spring rolls filled with nothing but Shrimp, Thai Basil Chicken and the Honey Walnut Shrimp.  Everything tastes fresh and as it should be.  The service is top notch and it the mood strikes him, even George himself might stop by to say hello.I first found out about George & Sons when they catered lunch at my place of work a couple years ago (I later came to find out that it was George himself dishing out the food, which I thought was a nice touch). After spending a long time on my to-try list, I finally decided to pay the restaurant a visit just a few months ago. I have gone back a number of times and it might be my favorite Chinese food place in the area. Some of my favorite dishes are Dragon & Phoenix, Thai Basil Chicken, Crispy Spicy Pork, and Pepper Beef. The only dish I've had that I wasn't crazy about was George's Bird Nest. 

It's never been very busy when I've gone, so the wait staff has been very attentive. In fact, on either my first or second time there, the waitress brought out another dish on-the-house after we finished our meals. Apparently, it was a new entree or appetizer they were testing out. Every time I go back, I check to see if it's been added to the menu, and in fact the first time I ordered the crispy spicy pork that's what I thought I was getting (it was deep-fried, spicy pork bites -- delicious, but not cooked in sauce like the entree currently on the menu which is great in its own right). Hopefully one day that dish makes its way onto the menu, though. Also on the topic of service, the last time I visited, George spent most of the time we were there fraternizing with a large party of elderly people, pouring drinks for them, etc. It was nice to see that level of service. 

I'm surprised by the number of poor reviews that are on here, but it appears those customers ordered dishes I've yet to try, so I guess I've just been lucky to choose the right meals. 

Overall, great food at an affordable price with a welcoming atmosphere.This place is in my Top 5 favorite places to eat in Arizona, no question!  First of all, they're a brewing company so they have to have good beer, right?  Check!  In order to get people to stay and drink beer, they have to have a good menu . . . check!  To get said people to come back again and again you have to have good tasting food, right?  CHECK, CHECK, and DOUBLE CHECK!!

All of the food I've had is top notch and delicious!  And the beers??  I crave them!!  It was Kilt Lifter that first hooked me.  Then the Hop Knot (see my Nello's review for the best Hop Knot in town tip).  And the Pumpkin Porter, one of the best seasonals EVER!  

While I think it is spectacular that you can get various Four Peaks Brew's at some of the coolest establishments across the state (even the Pumpkin Porter, when available), there is one brew that I can only find when I am lucky enough to go to Four Peaks . . . THE OATMEAL STOUT.  This is the most delicious, most creamy and smooth beer I have ever had in my life.  I dream of this beer.  The first time I tried this was shortly after I started drinking (and liking) stouts.   I tasted it, looked over at my BF and said "I think this is better than Guinness."  Of course I got the evil eye, but I'm sticking to my guns.  The Oatmeal Stout at Four Peaks is my favorite beer of all time!

Favorites from the menu include, Spicy Thai Hummus, Spanakopita, Bavarian Pretzels, Shrimp & Goat Cheese Bruschetta (it's a meal, but the garlic is no joke on this one), the salads are great, Bleu Light Special Burger, Veggie Beer Bread Wrap, Fish and Chips . . . just to name a few! =)

The patio is great.  The staff is friendly.  The parking is not the best, but eh, everything else makes it worth it.  Plus, I suggest taking a cab or the light rail anyway . . . better to not have to drive so that you can enjoy more brews!You go into Four Peaks, and everybody there is your friend. On a busy Friday night, this is the weekend warm-up to beat them all. It's loud, it's packed, it's fun. 

I'll usually mix up brews, but I always come back to my old friend... Kilt Lifter (appropriately named, I would say!).  Goes great with just about anything, but i enjoy the Spinach Artichoke Dip, Shrimp & Goat Cheese Bruschetta, and their Calamari is the best I've tried anywhere. Definitely worth stopping in.Three reasons this place is outstanding:

1.  The beer is top notch.  A wide variety of styles made on site.

2.  The food is the best bar food I have ever had.

3.  The old creamery building is beautiful, only made better by all of the giant fermenters inside.

--

Recommendations:

a.  Sit outside if the weather is nice.  Great patio!

b.  Order the beer style you are in the mood for.  If you cant decide, get the sampler.

c.  Appetizer-  Spinach artichoke dip (best in town)

d.  Entree- Chicken Beer Bread Sandwich
with fries and a side of jalapeno dressing

e.  Dessert- Stout milkshakeThis place makes me want to revisit Tempe! It's noisey, they have freshly brewed beer, great service, and the FOOD?!!! super good! They have these huge outdoor air coolers and something about the vibe in there is awesome...I was really impressed.Having just moved to Scottsdale, I had seen Four Peaks brews at local restaurants and couldn't wait to try it. My bf and I visited the brewery after a long day at the Phoenix Zoo. The location was easy to find with plenty of street parking (although it could be difficult during peak hours). We found a nice table on the half-indoor seating area. The ambiance was very cool, with a converted loft warehouse sort of feel.

The bf had the beer sampler, which I helped myself to some sips of. I ordered a pint of the Kilt Lifter, which was a great deal during happy hour. Next, I tried the Pumpkin Porter (full price, even during happy hour). Foodwise, I had the pub fish and chips, which are battered in Kilt Lifter, and the bf had the french dip. Both items were on par with good quality pub fare.

Kilt Lifter: great medium brew, very smooth. The type of beer you could drink every day and never tire of. Pumpkin Porter: we loved it so much, we purchased a growler so we could take some home! Note: there is an extra charge for filling up a growler with a seasonal brew. $4 for the growler itself, $10 for beer, and $5 seasonal charge. Normal refills of growlers are $10.

I am a beer lover. I have spent time living in Munich and drinking some of the best beers in the world. You can't go wrong with Four Peaks brews. Next stop, North Scottsdale location. Closer to home and hopefully just as great!Always a good choice.This place is awesome!! I go here often with friends and always have a good time. The food is pretty good but the beer is why you go. My favorites are the oatmeal stout, peach ale and kiltlifter. The pumpkin porter is also good but only a seasonal flavor. This place is pretty busy at night but is a fun atmosphere to be with friends, drink and watch a ballgame. I would recommend the Tempe location far beyond the Scottsdale one as far as atmosphere and actually seeing the brewery itself.

Never been disappointed here and will continue coming back!!Absolutely great, fresh beer and ales made on the spot.

Fun atmosphere, limited menu, but good quality food and excellent service.

Parking is a challenge, especially at lunch & dinner but worth the effort for the awesome brews!A great balance of  beer, service and ambiance is sometimes difficult. Not here, this outstanding restaurant/brewery has it all. A must do for anyone of all ages living or stop over in Tempe AZ.  
I really had a great time drinking some great beer and the food was outstanding but the best part was the climate and staff.Great time at sushi101. Leant how to make Sushi rolls. Awesome fun highly recommend as fun Sunday. ThanksI love Cheba Hut and always will. So many good toasted sandwiches... My favorites are the Spicy Widow (White Widow with the Jamaican Red meat), Afghani and The Kind, but there are so many more to choose from!

Something about the bread or the toasting... these sandwiches are so damn delicious.Best sandwiches and subs in Tempe. Don't wate your money at Subway or anywhere else, this place is awesome. All of their locations are warm, welcoming, friendly, and fun. And their theme is so funny, who thinks of a marijuana themed sub shop? They do. I love the names of all of the creative sandwiches. 
If you have the munchies (you know what I'm talking about) go here!Best sandwiches. Ever. You will love this place even if you are not a stoner. And if you *are* a stoner? Welcome home, friend. Welcome home. ;-)If you compare this place to baskin and robbins then... oh wait there is no comparison 
I haven't tasted ice cream this good since I was in Rome and that was 7 years ago!
It is SOOO good! 
And they love to get people to sample their ice creams, which always goes down good. 
Well worth the price. 
And there is 101 things to crumble and dollop onto your fresh ice cream to make it even more heavenly!

These guys seriously need to branch out across the world.I drive all the way from Tucson to Tempe to see Erika.  

I wanted hair that was a bit edgy but would allow me to maintain my regular job.  I was having trouble finding this.  One stylist put blond streaks all over my head that looked nothing like the photos I had shown the stylist.  Another salon asked if I was in a rock band or an artist.  Since my profession didn't fit into a "creative" category, I was denied.  I didn't get this attitude when I visited Grooming Humans.

Erika was able to get rid of those Barbie doll blond streaks and put me back to my regular dark brown color.  On top of that she put in blood red peek-a-boo streaks.  She does custom mixes and has any Crayola color you wish.  What is great about the style she suggested is that I don't have roots that show right away.  On top of that, she uses this toner which makes the color stay longer than when I've attempted to dye at home.  While the salon is a bit pricey, I don't have to go that often.

The disadvantage of this salon is the parking.  Better bring a pocketful of quarters as you'll have to use a meter or a pay lot to park.We found ourselves stranded in Phoenix on our way to Dallas for Christmas, and instead of waiting 4 hours on hold, I dialed up Marriott, my favorite hotel chain (well, other than the Four Seasons, but let's be reasonable).  Phil was super friendly, gave me a great rate, even got the shuttle driver to head our way immediately.  He was kind and upgraded us, even though we were only there for a few hours to sleep.  

The hotel was clean and comfortable, and it was just what we weary travelers needed.  Marriott never disappoints me!A family favorite, but we have to go when we are hungry!Loved this place! I had the egg noodle soup with Shrimp and Crab. It was delicious and I ordered a side of cold bean sprouts which I thought was interesting since all the Vietnamese restaurants I have been to have just brought it with the soup. I have been to a ton of Pho restaurants in Utah, Los Angeles and Phoenix and this one is a very good one indeed! I will come again for sure!Crispy, thin crust pizza was great! Very good wine selections. Fabulous atmosphere and food! Anthony was 'the bomb'!Right now this is my favorite comics shop. I don't like mainstream comics very much and they have a good selection of indie stuff. They also have a lot of of graphic novels (which I prefer over single issues) and a lot of artist sketchbooks. The staff has always been friendly, helpful, and easy to chat with.I lived in Philly for seven years, and thought I'd never find a hole-in-the-wall East Coast pizzeria in Tempe, but here it is!

When it comes to pizza, I'm a sauce man, and there's is really really good (crust is great as well, but I'm less fussy about that). They've got great selections, all pretty reasonably priced unless you go nuts with additional toppings rather than opting for one of the pre-defined combos.

My real find was their non-pizza Italian entrees. Like any good East Coast pizza shop, you can also order pasta, meatballs, etc. Their lasagna is off the hook and the portion is ridiculously large. They also offer a "side" of meatballs for $2. This side is two jumbo meatballs, served in its own big container with marinara and cheese - a meal in itself! And their side salad for $2 is also really tasty. I order lasagna with two sides of meatballs and a side salad for $12 then live off of it for an entire day. (Note to Tessio's - your ravioli is so good too, but a little skimpy compared to the lasagna).

You want real pizza or pasta delivered in Tempe, this is your place.The first time I went to the Sail, Gentlemen Afterdark was playing a super-rare reunion show and they blew the roof off the place. Incredible band, if you don't know 'em you're missing out. First impressions: the Sail is intimate, but also roomy, with a decent amount of seating, friendly bar staff and great sound. It reminded me a lot of the old Wong's...only less scuzzy (and I know scuzzy was part of the old Wong's charm). The Sail has live music every night, with pretty much the best bands in town on a regular basis--a decent-sized indoor stage and a big outdoor stage. The Zen Lunatics rule Thursdays with "Rockaroke"--a live-band karaoke that draws a great (and very diverse) crowd that frequently includes surprise appearances from a variety of well-known local musicians. It didn't take long to become a regular. Yeah, the Sail charges a cover (usually just a couple of bucks, which pays the bands and the excellent sound guy)--but the drinks are strong and cheap and they have a variety of good beers on tap. It's a small price to pay for good bands every day of the week. They go out of their way to support up-and-coming bands, longtime valley musicians and visual artists--and it's a fun place to just hang out. If you like the best live music and art Tempe has to offer, there's no better place to be. If you don't, I think that Toby Keith's place is open. Try the Krispy Fried Macaroni & Cheese.I was astonished. I moved back to Tempe and was looking for good indian food. Someone in my class recommended this place and I am so happy they did. I always got chili chicken and garlic naan at my old place and Delhi Palace's version was even better. I am a raving fan! They even gave me garlic naanI have spent considerable time and money at AZ Hi-FI over the past 7 years, going back when Dan managed the shop in Tempe.  I recently purchased a ARC amp from Glen and couldn't be happier with the purchase.  Glen listens first, considers your budget and tries his best to get you into the right equipment.  Its a great shop, low pressure, if any pressure at all, not like some other shops in the valley. I have been an audiophile for 25 years and you must make a stop into AZ Hi-FI before you make any future purchases.Delicious.

Best fries probably ever. 

and desert is a must. imagine a mix of vegan icecream with cocopuffs but magically the coco puffs do not become soggy..

Don't get the pizza. yu-ck.Cool place, and you don't need to be a vegetarian to enjoy it. My fiance honestly thought he was eating chicken shwarma made out of chicken. I told him after we left.Delicious and great prices.  There are so few vegetarian restaurants in this part of the country but these guys do it right.I've come here for breakfast after a few late nights. For days after my visit, I often find myself dreaming about the chocolate chip pancakes. Fantasizing. VISIONS.

In all reality, the breakfast here is pretty damn good. I order the chocolate chip pancake stack with a side of scrambled eggs and sausage links. This order brings me into a state of euphoria that often lasts for an hour after the meal.

If you wanna get your breakfast euphoria on, visit this place, but don't take any of my chocolate chip pancakes.

...o_o.Great place. Was nervous to go and get my car repairs done being female i know that auto dealers could just have their way with me and cheat me. Vivienne was amazing and even picked me up from my hotel around the corner. The prices were fair and i was thrilled to get my car back with the several repairs i needed. I will be going back to them when i get more money to get the other recommended repairs done. Another repair that i went to wanted to charge me a ton for the oil change, but vivienne's prices were better. I will be back there.Oh, Haji-Baba, I love you.
The chicken shawarma plate is ridiculous.
The hummus? Perfection!
Your pita bread? Heaven!

My review, however, is based on take-out. I never eat at Haji-Baba. To me, HB is a place to grab a cheap, delicious lunch and take it back to the office to snack on throughout the day. The plates are so huge, they end up being all I eat all day. 
And my god, I could eat HB every.single.day!TL;dr amazing mediterranean food, with plenty of meat options that will blow your mind. you've never had meat like this before.

I'm really confused as to how I don't have a review for this place already. After living in Tempe/Phoenix for over 20 years, I remember craving gyros from Haji Baba even as a kid. In fact, I would venture to say Haji Baba and Baiz Market are the oldest, quality middle eastern shops in the valley.

Apparently my friend has never been here before, and I decided I would be a terrible friend if I never took him. Of course, he had trouble finding it because he thought it was a restaurant "restaurant" and not a hole-in-the-wall type place.

We were seated even though it was lunch, didn't take more than 10 minutes for our gyro plates to come out which were piled high with succulent gyro meat. To perfectly complement the star of the dish, there was white rice and a salad with plenty of unique dressing. Gyro meat by itself is usually amazing, simply because its meat, but when its accompanied with an amazing sauce, it really becomes stellar. The "white sauce" or what I think is an iteration of tsaziki sauce is perfect for the juicy ground lamb meat. If you haven't had gyro before and you want to give a try, I would definitely get the gyro plate at Haji Baba.

I almost forgot to mention that you can't leave Haji Baba without trying their baklava. Take your pick at which nuts you want. pistachio, almonds, walnuts, mixed, etc. 

Aside from their restaurant food, my family usually buys groceries from here. One of our staples is pita bread, and you can usually get a box of pita bread for like $13. Freeze some of it, and use the rest as you wish. It goes perfectly with store bought hummus and foul (fava beans).Great selection of liquor and beer and great service love the drive through. Prices may be high but is due to the fact of location. Bough the groupon for this will definitely be back inHi, I really like to drink!

Top's is pretty much the best liquor store ever.  They have nice employees and a bitching selection.  I'm pro-any place that is pro-drinking.

They also recognize that ball-point pens don't write very well on hard counters, and they have set up a taped area that allows one to sign a credit card slip in peace.  Top's is tops in my book.Good as it gets.  Extremely knowledgeable.   Friendly but not out of the way friendly.  Without question the best liquor store in Arizona.House of Tricks, my ray of sunshine! The food defies description, it is always, always delicious. The wine list is exceptional as is the beer list. In fact, HOT  - now apropo it that? - takes a great deal of pride in its' bar and it is where you can find me on a Friday or Saturday afternoon at HOT's happy hour, having a lovely glass of wine, enjoying a taste of a martini - the bartenders are generous and sharing  an appetizer or two. HOT is a great afternoon spot.When I feel rich I'll go here. It really is delicious and a fun place to go for special occasions. It's a huge piece of Tempe heritage and I'm glad it's still around.What?! Are you freakin kidding me?! You never ate at The Chuck Box???!!!! They only take cash cuz they get so much business they don't need your stinkin' credit card!  They didn't spend money on comfortable seating cuz they know that your not going to give a f#@$ as soon as you start eating... Best burger!  Get the big one with bacon on it.  Oh yea this place is nice.Really good food.  Kinda like being at a campfire type of a feel.  We always get the big one with the beer battered onion rings.  The onion rings are a must.  Forget the fries though (frys are just eh) and try fried zucchini instead.This place is awesome! My girlfriend doesn't like burgers but if its Chuck box, she craves it!!!

The burgers and fries are good, but a MUST try are the jalapeño poppers!! These things are freaking delish to the point I have to get one for me and one for the girlfriend. 

When we go to AZ this is 1 of 3 spots we must make time to eat at!I have been eating at The Chuck Box for years and despite all the influx of high end burger joints, this is still my favorite burger in town. In fact, I am giving a five star rating here purely on the hamburger, which is absolutely delicious. 

Another positive is the condiment bar for the burgers. It is well stocked, so you can add what you want. The fries are good, and I like that they don't offer a huge portion at an inflated price like some burger joints in town.

As another reviewer alluded to, this restaurant definitely has character. It can get very crowded and parking can get sparse, so try to go during off hours or when ASU is not in session. it is also cash only, though they do have an ATM there.Rubios fills that niche of I need to get my kid from after school care to the Tuesday swim lesson in one hour or less with food in her belly.  I've been exploring different options; at least I was until I found Rubio's.  The first thing you notice is the great service.  As I'm not a regular quite yet, I usually spend a few minutes studying the menu.  The staff at Rubio's has perfected the art of not starring me down during my minutes of quiet contemplation, which seems to be a lost art at other establishments.  After ordering, the staff brings you your order.  Casual dining with wait staff service.

Tip #1.  Sit near the salsa bar when with child.  It makes getting extra napkins easy.

The wait is short.  I've measured this based on my daughter's behavior after we sit down and she immediately says, "I'm hungry and I want my food NOW!!" Although saying, "We just ORDERDED!!" doesn't help; we've never gotten to the melt down stage.  The food has always made it with time to spare.

Tip #2. You can never have enough napkins.  So, save the Earth by just getting a few and more as needed.  You sat next to the salsa bar, right?

The food is good for the price and there are many options.  So you don't have to order the same thing each week.

Tip #3. Mixing the onion cilantro with one of the salsas is a good combination.

Comparatively speaking, I like that my daughter and I can eat something on the healthy side of the casual dining spectrum.  Usually, a bean and cheese burrito for her and fish tacos for me.  The quality seems appropriate for casual dining, although I could do with some more sauce in my tacos.

Tip #4. The churro makes a good incentive to finish the growing food for you and your kid, but you have to get a kids meal.

The Churro is the real bonus.  On Thursday, my daughter suggested that we go to Rubios.  Telling her that we go every Tuesday didn't seem to make a difference.  We take the churro to go and my daughter eats it on the way to swim.We placed an order at 9pm right before closing for takeout. The husband had the bourbon chicken and it was very tasty. I ordered the orange shrimp and received orange chicken by accident, but honestly I didn't even care because it was that good. Tender chicken and a well balanced sauce that wasn't overpowering with just enough spice. 

We also ordered the sampler plate, which was equally good, and fried rice. The fried rice doesn't taste NY style (says this native NYer) but still good nonetheless. 

The overall theme is simple, quality, well balanced flavors that don't overpower each other. You can taste each of the ingredients used in the dishes and there's a real harmony, which is a rarity. If your palate is used to cheap ingredients drowned in sauce to mask their quality and poor cooking technique, this isn't for you. Additionally, a single order is easily double the quantity that other restaurants offer. Definitely a winner for us.First 5 star review for me. I don't think many businesses deserve the 5 star rating because there is usually something that can be improved. Not here. Tott's is delicious, well priced, served fast and fresh.

I've had a wide range of their menu items from the Thai based dishes to the Chinese dishes. Everything is great. Definitely somewhere you should go.When food is offered from love, an understanding of flavor and the intertwining nature of the ingredients, it transcends good food and takes on something that isn't easily found in the Phoenix valley.  It becomes great.  Wonderful people making and serving delicious food in a simple, home style setting make this my new favorite restaurant.If you like food that is truly authentic and exceeds your expectations, that this is a great place to sit right down and dig in. The owners are first generation immigrants from Poland you might think you are sitting in Poland if you while you dine. We ordered the kielbasa platter and the combo plate. The brown mustard really complements the kielbasa. The combo includes potato cheese pierogi which I really enjoyed. With the owners doing all of the food preparation and service, you feel like you are sitting around their kitchen table. We really enjoyed the food, atmosphere and service.My girlfriend and I were hungry and wanted to do something different than the usual. We had passed by El Pollo Loco many times and had agreed we'd try it, but that kept getting put off. 

That finally just changed, and now I wish we hadn't waited so long. Seriously, we are the perfect combination of full and satisfied at this very moment. 

We took a look at the menu and weren't sure of how much to order. Eventually, we based it on cost, assuming that around $15 worth of food would be enough (it ended up being almost $18). What can I say, we're both good eaters. 

She ordered the chicken avocado quesadilla and a side of mashed potatoes - yes it's a strange combo but she loves mashed potatoes so why not. I opted for the chicken avocado burrito and a crunchy taco. The understanding was, of course, we'd try a bite of each other's food.

The quesadilla and burrito were both stuffed full of tasty goodness. She's not big on beans but admitted she actually liked the burrito. I don't think I've ever tasted a quesadilla that had such an explosion of flavor, at least not in the fast food world. The quality of the ingredients was far superior to what I expected. That goes for the whole meal as a matter of fact. We've both eaten enough fast food in our lives to know better so I feel confident in saying that. The crunchy taco was a huge hit as well. It reminded me of the kind of taco I'd get at a sit-down Mexican restaurant. Even the mashed potatoes rivaled KFC so no complaints here!

The service was fine. They confirmed the order before and after we got our food. I'd say we waited no more than 2 minutes in the drive thru to get it.

I wouldn't hesitate to go back, and again, wish I'd tried it sooner. It's tough to put your finger on how good a place like this is going to be when you don't know how big the portions are and they have a variety of sides to choose from. I can't wait to try a different combination next time!I HIGHLY recommend this shop. I did some research (as you are doing now) before I took our vehicles over here for work. One of the reviews I read was from a guy that actually lived in another state and brought his vehicles here when visiting on business. just for routine maintenance. Wow!! That said a lot right there. So...I had work done on 2 VEHICLES, simultaneously, and they were BOTH done the same day. Michael is one of the last HONEST mechanics left. He explains, in detail, the work that needs to be done, and seems to shop around for the best price on the part that he needs to fix your car. He treats you like a person, instead of a job number or a price. He also took the time to talk to me enough to know what work I was willing/capable of doing myself to save me some money...and even described some of the steps to help me out. I mean, who does that?? He took money out his own pocket, right then and there, just to be a nice guy and hope to have a loyal customer. Well, he succeeded. Michael's Auto Repair has a customer for life! Anyway, long story short, DON'T TAKE YOUR CAR ANYWHERE ELSE!!!Let me start  by saying this place is GREAT. I don't even know where to begin with this review because the layout of this arena is fantastic. I experienced history last night at Jobing.com stadium as it hosted it's first ever Stanley Cup playoff game as the Phoenix Coyotes faced my Detroit Red Wings. It was truly just another of the Many joys of my life that i could cross of my list before i leave this earth. I got to the arena at about 3:30pm and imagine this, 7500 spaces of FREE parking...are u KIDDING me.

I got out of my jeep walked into a outdoor mall area on a cobblestone street, there were outdoor restaurants, shops, and beautiful water sculptures. All of these sat to my right, and to my left was the arena that's right sitting in the heart of this Shopping and dining mecca was an actual hockey arena. The layout was nothing like i have ever seen, i mean shopping, dining, music, and a great hockey arena all out here in the middle of nowhere in Glendale Arizona. Did I mention The University of Phoenix Stadium for the Arizona Cardinals is right across the street which is also an awesome sight to see and the next place i plan to visit here when football season returns.

The arena itself is spectacular...the sight lines are beautiful...not a bad seat in the house. The audio system is awesome and the place was electric for this game...and while my red wings fell 3-2 to the coyotes it was a fantastic playoff atmosphere. The food prices are a bit steep, but not awful..and the stadium is extremely clean...but definitely dress warm because it was very cold..but not due to the ice but I believe they had the air conditioner on full blast up in there...LOL  It was colder than normal for even a hockey game compared to other stadiums i have been to.

When the game was over...despite the 17000 plus sellout crowd...i was out and on the freeway in 5 minutes. The staff handled the departure of all the people in  a orderly and quick fashion...easily the fastest time it has ever taken me to leave a sporting event. I can't wait to go back there in the future...and if you are ever in Glendale run, run, run don''t walk to this marvel in the desert. Eat, Drink, and you definitely will be Merry in Glendale my friends!!!!Last night my boyfriend brought home a pie from Barro's with mushrooms and onions...oh my!

I couldn't believe how good the pizza was. It was deep dish with a thick, soft crust and just the right amount of sauce and cheese. I was in carb lover's heaven. The onions were fresh and aromatic. I couldn't stop eating it. I even ate a slice after my body told me that I had had enough. As I sat there with a belly ache, I still smiled from having had what was the best pizza I've eaten in a long time.Everything about this place was great!! The innkeeper Sherry was awesome, the breakfast was terrific, and the scenery was stunning!! I highly recommend this B&B!!Great food! My favorites are sizzling rice soup (great when you're sick), poopoo platter, cashew chicken, house lo mein and house fried rice. The staff is very friendly and if you call to pick it up, it usually  takes 10 minutes. You can also find coupons for free lettuce wraps or crab puffs in the mailer ads.Been there twice now.  Will definately go back.  I really don't understand some of the other reviews.  I think way better than Olive Garden and don't have to wait in line forever.  No effing kids either!  Had pizza first time.  Did not need Alka-Seltzer later.  Had veal parmisian tonight.  Great, great, great!  All you can eat fish on Friday nights for $12.  Give it a try.  Not all of us in Sun City are dead yet!Ate there for the first time in a while. Many people I know, like the place, others just don't. We've never had bad food there. During busy season, expect to spend 90 minutes from start to finish. This is not a service problem, but a kitchen issue. The orange roughy was not good, it was SUPERB, and the chicken stir fry, very good. Food was served warm, and the service provided by Jeff was exemplary. There has been an influx of younger servers who are extremely effective, accomodating, and polite. You get a big bang for your buck. Based on our experiences, it would seem that the negativity is unwarranted.I am new to the Carefree area and wanted to find a good barber. I searched on Yelp and found David at the Little Barber Shop. He is an excellent barber with reasonable rates. Be sure to call ahead as an appointment is usually needed.They just opened it to the public. They limit the number of tee times so play was very fast. The greens were very very fast. In my oppinion its the best course in the west valley.Jan is the best woman in the entire world!!! She has the most variety in the cake decorating and candy supply store!! Check out the candy making chocolate and the variety of molds she has... they're phenominal!! This is a must GO TO place if your into cakes or candy making! Kids love making candy too!!I hope this place never goes away! My boyfriend and I are so glad we finally tried this theatre! He drives by it everyday and a few weeks ago we finally went to check it out and have been back pretty much every week. The prices are great $6.50 per person for an evening show and only $8.25 a person for 3-D! The whole place is very clean and the staff is friendly and helpful. The theaters are smaller but the quality is fantastic, seats are decent sized (and I ain't skinny) and look new. The concessions are always fresh and they offer mix and match self serve candy bins so that's fun! Also, there is also a great pizza place next door and is within walking distance of downtown henderson. Great place, great prices, great location! We just love it! Oh and just like any proper movie theatre there is an arcade complete with pin ball machines and an air hockey table.These guys are great.  Just sold my Jeep for parts and they were so helpful! From the first person that I spoke with to the guy who came to pick it up, everyone was great.  He even helped me get the last license plate screw off that was stuck!  I would definitely do it again if I have another older vehicle.Absolutely amazing. Their pollo asado was unbelievably good! Tacos were legit, enchiladas were amazing, and was left so full I couldn't even finish the rice. Only complaint was there were so many people you couldn't even sit down. This is seriously an oasis in the desert.I love this airport!  When here, I am either going somewhere great or returning to the greatest city in America ~  Fabulous Las Vegas!Joni is the best hair stylist and color specialist I've ever had. She listens to her clients' wishes and offers great suggestions. I get tons of compliments on my hair since Joni started doing it.Wow I crave this place.
Serving sizes are awesome.  Love the moco loco, and the combo plate here.  Very hearty.  Great portions (probably too big).
Spam musubi is bomb here.

But the biggest hit is the kimchee saimin.  The bowl is huge and there are so many tasty ingredients.  And their noodles are really really good.

We drive downtown just to eat lunch at this place.  Unfortunately they aren't open real late at night.  Forget what time, but around 9pm or something.The BEST Hawaiian food in town! I have coming here since i was a kid!!! Always great service, friendly owners and delicious food!!!! I have tried many other Hawaiian restaurants in town and nothing compares to this place!!!! Prices are so reasonable and portions are great!!!! I LOVE love love this place!!!!There is probably no place better known by the locals here in Vegas then the city staple of Hugo's Cellar.  I could write all kinds of information about where, when, what, how to enjoy, find, experience this restaurant.  However, there are plenty of reviews for all that.  So my experience in a nutshell:

The traditional rose delivered promptly to my girlfriends' hand by the staff as we were seated.  The nice sommelier that retrieved the PInot Noir we shared as we paired our meat & fish.  A beauty of a seafood sampler or "plateau" arrived in perfect timing.  Wonderful Caesar salad prepared table side to our specifications.  Then the entrees; Veal Chop Natural for me; bone in.  Veal Oscar for the lady.  The food was tremendous, topped with fresh sorbet and Cherries Jubilee table side yet again.

Yup, so many words to describe how wonderful Hugo's was.  It's an experience, a little pricy.... However, I believe that in most cases you get what you pay for.  Most of the time as a serial restaurant patron I find myself staring at the check asking myself if the juice was worth the squeeze..... At Hugo's; I had some damn good juice.Wow!!! I took my friends here after their wedding. All I can say is I highly recommend this place. Your greeted at the entrance with a long stem red rose ..you're seated and they have a vase for you to hold your rose until you leave. You get a taste of some breads.. and the butter is shaped like a rose!! They keep your water and drinks full all the time. The staff here is amazing!!!! So nice and constant watching your table. It's pricey!! But so worth the special night.  They pull out a salad cart and make your salad table side. I loved it!! After your salad they bring u some sorbet to cleanse your palate and a hot napkin for your hands. My friend had lamb and his wife had steak and shrimp it comes with garlic red potatoes asparagus and rice . When the plates are placed before you,, you will want to get your camera!! not only is it delicious!  the presentation is gorgeous.your dessert is included it's chocolate. Dip figs strawberries This a place to go . And very candle lit . Sorta under ground. You won't be disappointed here :)I love the energy of Fremont street, and the Nugget is the best resort and is in the middle of the action. My preferred Hotel in VegasI've had so much fun AND luck here it is ridiculous. I've hit the jackpot in nickle slots twice, in two SEPARATE years. There are waitresses who are bringing you a drink before you are done with your current one. Mgmt, please do everyone a favor and get some clothes on these ladies. They are nice enough but as old as my mom and it is just a weird combo. Anyway, I come here year after year and recognize a lot of the workers. I'm visiting Vegas for my 6th time soon and can't wait to stay here. Whenever the STRIP takes my money, I always come back to this place and win it back. You guys used to offer live entertainment. Wish you would bring that back. The vibe is laid back, easy breezy. The other gamblers are usually friendly and chat you up.Love this store. Haven't shopped here since the 1990's, but it is such a cool interior that has been the backdrop for movies and for many key events in my life, such as dramatic talks with girlfriends while shopping, etc. totally cool place to visit if you're sick of the Vegas usual.It's s Las Vegas's best Irish pub.  Nachos,  are ridiculous ask for a side of onion gravy.  I'm not normally a corned beef guy,  but I gotta be honest,  I crave it from time to time. Their shepherd's pie is tasty, bangers and mash are good,  basically I've never had a bad meal here.  It's off strip behind The Orleans so it's a must stop by if staying there,  and there's no excuses since its a 24 hour establishment with 2 different happy hours.  Call ahead and ask what the $4 pint of the day is.Hands down, my favorite pub in town!

I may not drink alcohol, but I definitely LOVE the food and atmosphere at this place. The happy hour really can't be beat, from 3PM-6PM and 11PM-2AM, with 1/2 priced full-size appetizers. 

I usually order a plate of the Irish Nachos with Blackened Chicken. These nachos are like CRACK. Fried potato crisps covered in cheese, bacon and chicken. Absolutely delicious.

If you're going just for the appetizers, I also recommend the sausage rolls and chicken fingers, both are absolutely delicious!

In addition to the appetizer menu, the items on the regular menu are pretty damn tasty as well. I love the Grilled Blackened Chicken sandwich, which provides a pretty filling meal for $9.

For the most part, the service at this place is pretty good. There are a couple of bartenders that are less talkative than others, but most everyone is rather friendly. 

I recommend avoiding this place on Friday nights, as there is a loud and not particularly great band that plays covers all night (Darby O'Gill and the Little People). Other than that, you're golden!Holy, burrito moly, best carne asada burritos hands down in town. 

The meat is the most flavorful, tender meat ever. This is the only place we buy our meat for cookouts, I swear by it. It's affordable and delicious, get your butt down there now. It's a large burrito with fresh refried beans, tasty rice, sour cream, Mexican creamy cheese, and the carne asada meat. Only 5 bucks and worth every penny, 

When I was pregnant this was my go to place to grub and get my addiction, aka craving. Yes, hardly anyone speaks English and men look at women like they're meat, but I can handle all of that for the award tasting food, lol

 Writing this review reminds me that I need to go there sometime this weekend for one :)A-1 has been providing us exceptional service for years!  Ken and his team have been absolutely wonderful to work with!  Thank You!

Scott Kerestesi
Cragin & Pike, Inc.Great bartenders with the best bar food in town. Have never had a bad experience.   Highly recommend.This is easily my favorite dim sum place in Vegas. It's a tradition to stop by here on Sunday morning just after checking out of the hotel. It's usually packed (surprise, surprise), but a party of two gets seated really quickly.

We usually order the typical: har gow, xia chang fun (rice noodle with shrimp), turnip cake, cha siu pao (bbq pork buns), mango pudding (Martin M's fav), bor lor bao (my fav), and sweet tofu (classic dim sum dessert!). The har gow isn't particularly special here, but the xia chang fun is good and not too doughy. The cha siu pao here is one of my favorites of all cha siu pao's - the filling is flavorful and the bun is always fluffy.

The service is great and the prices are even better - usually comes out to about $10/person, including tax/tip. Love it!Seriously the best italian food in America.  The lobster risotto is to die for, and as the others say the Osso Buco is amazing.  Ask for Walter- no shitLoved our visit to Ferraro ' s. We took out 6 and 8 year old, and they were treated like little princesses. There isn't a kid's menu, but they were able to pick a pasta and get a "side sized" portion. 
Fettuccine Mare Monte was very good. Cannoli was a huge hit. Very nice restaurant, not in a Casino. You'll be well taken care of.Came here for a groupon beginner's lesson. I have never shot a a bow and arrow before and man was it fun!  We were a class of 5 and there were 2 instructors. The staff is really friendly and helpful of getting you started with safety instructions, proper positioning and form. The lesson is an hour long and is a great introduction. Just be prepared to have fun, and trade a couple funny zingers with the staff. 

There are plenty of targets from middle of the field to way in the back. 
As for sales and equipment, I really don't know anything, but it looked like they had a good variety of items for sale. I liked how the archery range was very neat and clean.Corned Beef hash---Yum!!
Belgian Waffles----Yum, Yum.
Chicken Fried Steak with side of mixed berries, Redskin potatoes and Biscuit.--Maximum Yums!    

The OJ is fresh squeezed and the waitresses are flawless.  This is one franchise joint that has its act together.  I now have another breakfast place to rotate between Blueberry Hill and the Omelette House.I love Black Bear Diner! In whatever state they make their food the same...DAMN GOOD! 

Everytime I come to Vegas I find myself stopping here for breakfast. Everyone knows everyone in this place. Unfortunately, I'm just a visitor from out-of-town so nobody ever knows who I am. BUT THE FOOD IS STILL SUPER DELISH!!!This place is really good! Definitely go here if you want:

-Quality and DELICIOUS Filipino food (just like from home)
-Friendly service
-A great value

I ordered the Inihaw na Bangus (charbroiled, boneless Milkfish with vinegar and garlic) and it was spot on. Tender, flavorful, and crispy in all the right places, this bangus fulfilled my craving for the traditional dish! And only $7.95!! Try finding another place that sells great seafood dishes under $10!

My boyfriend ordered the Breakfast Combo Platter which was composed of  tocino, tapa and longanisa served with garlic rice and 2 eggs cooked any style you want. For only $8.95!! 

Seriously, stop reading my review and head over there now! I promise you won't be disappointed!

P.S. This was our first time at this restaurant but it certainly won't be our last. =)If you live here, this is the place you want to take visitors too. Its authentic Filipino food. Its not like any of the other Filipino restaurants in town. Its a sit down restaurant so if you come hungry know you have to wait a little. 

The service is great. When we walk in, I feel like servers and waitresses are singing to us. Hello ma'am, thank you ma'am... I dont mind. I love it! Filipinos always make you feel welcome and are very humble.

OK the good stuff, FOOD. I love their bangus. Only thing I can say is that this and everything else I will talk about in regards to their menu items make my mouth water.

Here is a list of things that I ordered and highly recommend that you try:
Breakfast meat platter- I think thats what it was called. The everything especially the egg plant was BOMB!
garlic fried rice - YUM
sinigang
halo halo
pansit bihon
sigsig
adobo
calamansi juice

Every single one of those items along with platter is something you should try. You cant go wrong.Good foods. Good services.
Many sushi selection, tastes fresh and good too.
Love the fresh baby oyster and the crab, tastes fresh.
Dessert is good too. One of my favorite buffet to go too.I liked that as soon as I walked through the door I was greeted with a smile and they were eager to help. The store has really grown and has a lot of great scents. I didn't load up on the sprays today but there's a few I want to go back for like their Vanilla Coconut, and Twilight Woods. I bought some Wallflowers today and they really work well. They are plug in home fragrances. Right now they have buy one get one free for the wallflowers and the fillers. I was lucky enough to find a starter kit for $3.00 but it gets better...I found something for 90% off! I've never seen a sign saying 90% off so I was intrigued and bought a 14.5 oz Sweet Pea Forever candle for a 1.95! 

Tip: The cashier said that the items that they find in their storage that they mark as 90% off go up right near the register. He says they sell quick though.I give this Mall 5 stars because for  me it is as good as it gets.

I know it isn't the Fashion Show Mall but I am not going to Meadows for "Prada" or "Louis Vuitton" and anybody who knows Vegas at all knows that just isn't what this mall is about. To those of you who call it "Ghetto's Mall" shame on you. If you want something over priced and name brand then just go waste your money at Fashion Show (not saying fashion show is bad or anything) but to degrade a place just because it doesn't sell some high end material thing just shows you don't know what is really important in life.

I remember my Mom taking me here when I was in Elementary School and working here as a teenager. I love the memories of thinking about those times and the friendships I made while working there.
I do miss the smell of Cinnabon (it closed) and the original "Villa Pizza" that was there before the chain Villa Pizza took over the location in the food court. 
I also miss the "Wherehouse " and picking out my fav CD's.
Times and the digital world have changed a lot.
I still only ever think of Meadows when needing something from a mall and know I can still stop and get a soft pretzel to munch on while perusing the stores.We stumbled on this slice of heaven in a strip mall after eating at Firefly restaurant. I have to admit I like a cigar every once in awhile but don't know jack about them. Here they not only hooked me up with a nice cigar, but also cut it for me, lit it up, and then set me up with a nice glass of whiskey during their half price happy hour. All in a very pleasant atmosphere.  I might add that the service here was par excellence as well as friendly and thats what puts it up to five stars.Went here with a friend last week, loved it!!!!We returned a few days later, and I am happy to say that our great experience the first time was not just a one time thing.  The food, brew, and service was just as awesome a second time!  Will plan to hit Gordon Biersch whenever I am back in Vegas!Mesmerized! 
 We decided to come here since the place we wanted to check out at the Bellagio had closed. And of course, Piero's never lets down. 
 We started with apps, and went all the way! 
 Calamari: Fried to perfection. Marinara sauce on the side was good, but a bit overpowering for the tiny morsels. 
 BB-Q Shrimp with a spicy sauce: Though not a shrimp fan, these things were cooked just right and had a kick ass sauce to drench bread in! I thoroughly enjoyed. 
 Maui Onion and Anchovy Salad with Tomatoes: I can't stand raw tomatoes whatsoever, but I had to give 'em a chance, and this salad was delish. The white anchovies and sweet onions paired perfectly with the diced tomatoes. The tomatoes almost seemd slightly cookedm they didn't seem raw at all! 
 Veal Saltimbocca: 5 stars! The veal, wrapped in sage and prosciutto were sauteed perfectly, and the prosciutto was very generous, not just some skimpy piece most places give. And the Garlic Mashed potatoes were silky and velvety, and stayed this way the entire meal. Most places they get hard due to excess butter and the like. 
 Desserts: Chocolate cake, creme brulee, and tiramisu. All looked fantastic, though I didn't try. 
 Their espresso I had was prepared perfectly though.
 Piero's really exemplifies what a true fine dining restaurant is really about. From start to finish, it's always flawless. The staff: friendly and not pushy or overbearing. 
 Yes, it's not all fancy n bling bling. But it's 'ol skool, Vegas style. 
 This place sets the bar for others to follow!Best place ever invented!! I actually found out about this place from yelp and I want to personally recommend this place to everyone!! So when I went I got jello shots which were only a dollar and I got this fruity drink that was mixed with rum and I paid a few extra dollars for an extra shot. My girls and I were like yuum so tasty only to be completely trashed from sucking it down so fast can we say lession learned??Going to Las Vegas next week and the first stop I will make is @ "Fat Tuesday's" for my favorite 180 Octane! Definitely one of the things that are a MUST DO when in Vegas!I can't believe I never reviewed Fat Tuesday earlier. I'm even more surprised I didn't check in there o.O. That tells you I was having too much fun I guess...or I just have bad memory..which is more likely the case :P

True, I went here about 2 months ago but I was just talking to a friend about it yesterday and that reminded me that I still didn't review them.

Anyways, Fat Tuesday daiquiris were the first alcoholic drink I had in Vegas. :D I suppose this review will be for all the ones I visited: Imperial Palace, MGM Grand, and Planet Hollywood. But, I'll try to concentrate on MGM Grand because that's the specific location for this review. The first one I visited was at Imperial Palace because I stayed at that hotel for my first night in Vegas.  I visited Planet Hollywood's location once or twice during that trip and MGM Grand about twice I believe. We were only there for about a week so that sort of tells you how often we went to Fat Tuesdays. My friends and I all shared 3 glasses which we reused over and over again until the 2nd to last day when I decided to buy my own since most of us wanted our own. 

I always got Mango, Strawberry, and Pina Colada all mixed together. For $1 more, you can also get a shot of Everclear in it but I can't handle that. I can hardly finish  my glass without the extra alcohol. It may seem sorta pricey but it's not really since you get a slight discount when you recycle the glasses (little humbug though since you have to hold onto it) and unless you are super hardcore, one is usually enough to get your feeling pretty good and it lasts a while too since it's frozen. 

I'm too lazy to make multiple reviews..there's really no point I feel because I felt that my service was awesome at all 3 locations that I attended. I can't wait to go back to Fat Tuesday next time I return to Vegas...wonder when that will be though =\ lolyummmmmmmm

This is simply a must-have... just make sure you have an empty stomach because, oh boy, does this drink FILL YOU UP. I got the biggest and baddest one (I think it's called a yard?) Definitely wayyyy too big for me, but I put on my big girl pants to handle it. (Okay, okay, with a third left, I gave it to a friend...I... Just....Couldn't...Do..It)

And to make matters worse, I got the lowest alc one - The Bellini, which was SCRUMPTIOUS (I had tasted pretty much every single one and had to get this one) So the fact that I couldn't finish it... welllll, I was made fun of... 

The pina colada was good too, but not as sweet as I would like.

Yup, pretty much sound like a wimp in this review... oh well :/

**** Add a shot for a dollar!!This place is great.  If you are in Vegas for a couple days for business, or just for the night, definatly worth your time.  Great tapas, great service, awesome happy hour from 4-6 with half priced pitchers of sangria.  Perfect place to dine alone at the bar.  If you do not know what to order, ask one of the bartenders and they will guide you.Great food and service. Highly recommend!
Weinerschnitzel is wunderbar!My wife and I visited  Canonita once again and had a great experience. Mussels and shrimp appetizer, beef ribs, pork barbacoa, margaritas. All great. 
The waitress was a bit too busy however it was not to the extent that we were not taken care of. a couple times the dirty plates were left on our table too long which is a problem as the tables are very small. Great food and drink.I was in heaven!!!!!!!

I kid you not, it felt like I shed a tear when I walked in.  There was over 100 TV's all around the restaurant.  There wasn't a seat where you couldn't see a game. 

The menu is not the greatest in the world, but it's a sports bar, there shouldn't be much to ask but burgers, wings and beer. You shouldn't ask for more than that.  Their portions are decent size.

Beware of the Nachos cause even though they say they are appetizers on the menu, they are bigger than your head.  I can't wait to go back there and watch a  Raider game....yes you heard me right a Raider game.Beautiful hotel, very close to the strip. We got a huge discount on our room from some travel website. 

The suite rooms are gorgeous, 400-thread-count pillows and a huge bed with more pillows and fluffy sheets. Two TVs, also a pull-out couch. Free ice-cold water by the elevators with pieces of fruit inside. 

Their fitness center was fun, too. There were baskets of fruit and huge Aquafina bottles of water. Some of the TVs in there didn't work, which made me sad. Customer service was also excellent. Every single employee was smiling and ready to help. One of the best places I've ever stayed at.Got my Nike+ Fuel band for Mothers Day and I'm loving it. The Nike store at the Forum Shop at Caesars Palace is wonderful and has extraordinary customer service.A new favorite! We called for reservations in the morning (Sunday) and were seated at a table right in front of the window with a view of the Fountains (8:30-9 pm, table for 3). Spectacular! I couldn't believe our luck.

I had the lamb and it was sublime. Juicy, rich in flavor, extraordinary. A must try!

The sommelier was helpful in picking out exactly what I wanted. I found a wine on the list that I very much enjoy, but wanted to try something new but similar. He found a wine that had many of the same characteristics but of a completely different region (South American vs. my familiar Italian bottle). *That's* what fine dining is all about.

Their dessert menu had so many fun choices. We were quite satiated, but had to give them a try. If you're a little budget conscious and intimidated by the cost of a full meal, make a late reservation and just come for dessert! You won't be disappointed.

The decor is bright, bold, and cheerful. Makes a great pair with tickets to see O! The music in the restaurant syncs with the Fountains so you will get the full experience.Love the monorail better than the bus. It's air conditioned and gets you from point A to point B very quickly and is easy to navigate even when drunk LOL 

$12 for a pass that is good for 24 hours and I believe it runs until 3am, not bad and cheaper than a taxi.We loved this place! Great atmosphere, great food, great service. I had a drink called something like "Bahamacardi" and it was so good! The shrimp linguine was delicious, and my sister said her fish was too. I can't wait to go back on my next trip to Vegas.We've been to this place a few times for dinner and also just drinks and apps and it is always good. We stopped in last eve for a cocktail and app at the bar and had a Moscow mule which was good and an order of Conch Fritters and Yuca Fritas (fried Yuca) which is like a fried potato but better. Everything was very good and reasonably priced. Service from the two female bartenders was excellent as well.  We'll be back for sure!We held our post-wedding dinner here in June for about 25 people, and after worrying a bit because we were planning this from across the country and had never been to Battista's, they knocked it out of the park!  

It was perfect!  We had a reservation from 6-8 and because of the photos taking longer than expected, the bride and groom did not arrive until almost 7.  The wedding party hung out in the bar until then (and were having a blast I might add), and they seated us and extended our reservation with no problem.

Service was perfect, the food was great, and the night could not have been better!  We even got a few songs by the guy on the accordian, and an ovation by the entire restaurant when my bride and I walked in!

Simply great, and we will DEFINITELY return on our next trip to Vegas!

Thank you to a few of the reviewers on here who I spoke with about this place!My go-to spa in Vegas and the only one I will go to.  I'm not sure if you can come here if you are not a member, but I am telling you, membership at the Stirling Club is SO worth it.  If you know someone who has a membership, you can tag along with them as well..I always bring my bf and we get the couple massage together.  But, if you don't need one, even better!!

I have had multiple massages and other treatments here and I LOVE it.  I have never had a bad, uncomfortable or unpleasant experience here EVER.  I am usually the type that is very picky about who gives me my massages or does my nails and hair - and I usually like to stick to one person for each..HOWEVER, although I've never gotten my hair done here, I trust the Stirling Club so much, I don't care who they choose to do my massages or nails for me.

Also, if you've ever visited the Turnberry Place (residence of the Stirling Club) it is absolutely beautiful; super high ceilings, elegant decor, beautiful chandeliers..etc etc..and Stirling Club does not disappoint..it's very clean inside and equally elegant.  Really should check it out!

5 stars forsure!!I LOVED this place. Everything was very clean and classy. Even the paper towels were embroidered with the logo. I was thoroughly impressed with both the relaxing atmosphere and the swedish massage I got from Lisa. She is super easy to talk to and made my first spa experience very comfortable. I got in because they have a contract with The Renaissance hotel which I was staying at and they were very accomodating, getting me an appointment with their only massage therapist working within the same day.

I'm afraid I am now ruined for life because I can only have extremely high expectations for the spas at home (I hope I can find a good one) and will always compare them to the Stirling Club Spa.I give this place 5 stars for the sheets!! I stayed here when they first opened and let me tell you when i first got into bed... i melted into the softness of those sheets... I am thinking they are like 800-1000 TC or something... but i will say that after my stay at the Wynn I went home and bought about 3 new sets of 800 TC sheets for my own bed... 

But aside from the sheets, Wynn is a nice "plush" hotel. And if you dont mind spending the money then by all means try a night. I fortunately did not have to pay and was with a travel agent group that the Wynn was trying to impress... so would i pay out of pocket for the hotel... not sure, maybe a REALLY special occassion.

The rooms are beautiful, the bathrooms are grand!! And i loved the pool and how they walked around with bottles of water for you. Everything was so nice and clean... of course this was a month after opening... 

All in all i enjoyed my stay and give Wynn 2 thumbs up!The Wynn hotel! I LOVE IT ALL. The Ferrari store, the buffet, the Terrace Point Cafe, Le Reve, the Casino, THE FREE PROMOTIONS THEY GIVE YOU AT THE FASHION MALL! Make sure you go to the Wynn desk at the mall so you can have chance to win $10,000 in slot credits, but most of the time you'll win a free buffet or something small like that.

This is one of the nicest casino/hotel I've been to in Vegas. More elegant, and have you seen their GOLF COURSE!? It's MASSIVE! I'm impressed by the entire hotel! I'll definitely be staying here next time I come to Vegas!My first experience at the Wynn dates back a couple of years when my wife and I came here to eat lunch with my mother and stepfather.   We had a lovely lunch at 'Sugar & Ice' and, at the time, I thought it'd be nice to stay here.   Fast forward 2 years:  my father's visiting the US from Europe and we decide to do a post-modern post-nuclear-family weekend trip to Vegas with myself and my wife, my father and his girlfriend, and my mother and stepdad.   Yay!  Fun stuff!!
 
Rooms - The goddamn rooms in this place are absolutely stellar.   They easily compete with the Bellagio as far as the room and bed is concerned and I gotta tell ya... the bathroom probably takes #1 spot in my book.   TV in the bathroom *while* you're taking a bath?   check.   A bathtub so big you can have an orgy in?  check.   Shower with water pressure so fucking fierce it'll bitchslap your hangover into tomorrow?  check.   Seriously... that bathroom's got it all.   You can even pick up the phone while you're praying to the porcelain God.   How Vegas is that?

Pool - When I come to Vegas, it's a good idea to keep me away from the Casino (see below) so my wife and I thought we should plump down $400 and get a cabana at the pool for the day.   It's hella pricey, but I gotta say that was one sweet experience!   The hostess came by every 15 minutes to check whether or not we needed anything.  I felt like royalty!   The cabana's got a stocked fridge with complimentary beverages and a decent size flat screen TV if you wanna crank some tunes while catching some Rays.   Seriously, we just hung out my the Wynn Pool Jay-Z style, and that was hella sweet!   Still, I thought I'd go try my hand at the Blackjack table that sits poolside and got quickly reminded that I'm not a celebrity... One thousand dollars minimum on that table?   Hmmm.... yeah no.  Thanks but no thanks.

Casino -  Eat shit and die.  Fuck all the dealers.  They always steal my money when I play Blackjack.  Fuck you casinos, fuck you!

Dining - We ate at Boulud, Switch, and Sugar & Ice.   All three restaurants, while very much distinct in style, had some very good food.  Service varied with location but the dining at the Wynn is certainly good.  Even the food that we ordered poolside while at the Cabana was good.   It wasn't the best culinary experience ever, but it certainly proved as a capable way to mop up the many Vodka Red Bulls loitering in my stomach.

Vibe - I dig the vibe at the Wynn.   It's snobbish enough to filter out the ghetto bitches and twentysomething hipsters.   Yet it's not so snobbish as to feel like you're at a retirement home with a bunch of people waiting to die.   It's got class, but it doesn't have the fake-factor I've experienced at the Mandalay Bay.   I think I've just found my favorite hotel in Vegas!Generally when I do Vegas, it's the Bellagio, Venetian, Palazzo or the Palms. This last trip was for business and I decided to try the Wynn. 

This was the best place I've ever stayed in Vegas! In fact, it's appropriate that it sits on the site of the old Desert Inn because the DI also had wonderful service. I think the Wynn has the best craps tables in Vegas and I've gone their before, but never stayed. The dealer's remember your name, pay you out correctly, give advice if you want it, and never laugh at the table when a 7 is rolled. 

My room was simple, large and elegant and had a wonderful view. 

This trip I got my Red Card as I plan to go back to the Wynn.Again, my wife and I did not stay here, but..... we did the Buffett!

The service was great, start to finish - top notch!

We didn't want to pack our plates full of food, so we got some of a few things and shared some bites.

My wife had the prime rib and gave me a few bites that were tender, and with excellent flavor, mmm gud! the horse radish was whoa! strong! but good. 

The meat loaf, not dry thank goodness, also real good!

The mashed potatoes were excellent!

Egg roll was just right, not over the top great, but not disappointing either.

The small slice of pork chop i had was very dry. whah-whah-whah. :-(
I like pork chops, so this was a bummer, but hey, it was one small piece that was probably sitting out to long anyway.

I had a chicken wing that was double crispy... the way I like it, but again, sitting to long and not hot. But it had good flavor and very crispy (a lite breading for crunch factor-not like KFC at all, dispite it not being hot, it was good none the less.

I'm not an expert here, but the calamari with rice and mussels was a great treat for me, i really enjoyed it.

Then my wife and I shared a small plate of crab legs and shrimp.
Both good, no disappointments. Mmm butter! Lol!

buy then we were done, except for dessert. Good thing they have really small portions so you can try a few things and walk away saying you got to try a few.

We shared a creme brûlée, great. then a creme puff, great, strawberry filled crepe with chocolate drizzled over it, divine! a rocky road chocolate mousse, good also, but what really put the whole night over the top and gave this experience 5 stars was the "Salted Caramel Glelatto!" OMG this was so good it gets the best in show for any desert to date! 

The Wynn is a beautiful place, really over kill on every level, the casino was elegant, the shops, the food, the marble throughout the restrooms, LOL! the Ferrari dealership next door! LOL! We could never afford to stay there but wow what a great once in a lifetime experience.   

I'm probably forgetting something, so my wife might have to chime in later.

If you try the buffet you won't be disappointed, you'll always have something to make up for what could have spoiled it for you. There was way too much food to try. Go for what you know and like and it will taste great.  :-)
 
To say the least we walked it all off over the next few hours after, man you really walk a lot n this town! :-)

TCLove this place, our room was breathtaking, we signed up a few years ago for specials and were going for a wedding and lucked out with an offer the same time we were going. It was I believe $160 a night for a delux panoramic view, $50 hotel credit, two tickets to the circ show, ext. Whata deal, we never wanted to leave our room! The staff was top notch and beat our expectations. Hope to get another letter soon!!!Love this place! We've recommended to family and friends.  Rooms are extremely clean and they have very friendly staff.We never skip breakfast at Ellis Island while in Vegas.  Best steak and eggs ever.  Sit and the bar with a bloody beer, play some video poker while you wait.  Nothing better to start the day!If you're looking for cheap but good food, a friendly staff and a no bling casino, this is the place. I went there for the $8.99 steak dinner but stayed to gamble a bit and was not disappointed. The cut of meat was delicious, I ordered mine medium to medium rare, and they did it perfectly. The split pea soup was homemade and included meat from ham hocks(!), and the mashed potatoes and gravy were yummy. Throw in a 20 ounce beer brewed on site and it's the deal of the century. I had so much steak left over (I'm a small eater) I took it back to my room and the next morning 4 of us shared it as a snack. I signed up for their players card and got my $10 free play which was parlayed into a small winnings that covered the cost of dinner with some change left over. The staff was friendly at the bar and restaurant. We didn't stick around for the karaoke but everyone there said it was usually a good time.My first time eating Fat Burger and i must say i am impressed. Burger and fries were awesome. Definitely enough to share!This place is expensive as hell! But it is Vegas and on the strip so technically this should be considered as "average" price. Came here at 1:30am Sunday morning and ate outside on the patio area. Music was playing, nice cool breeze outside, so I say this was a perfect night to eat outside. When we got our food, the burgers were fresh and hot and freaken good! I would say this cannot beat in n out but it does come in 2nd in my book!I love this place. I went here a long while ago but we still talk about this restaurant !! I'm going to send my parents here for their next trip to vegas. The food was fantastic and the atmosphere was really nice. The bellydancing adds a nice touch. But save room for dessert ! I still salivate thinking about that fruit pastry they serve at the end with the mint tea. I can't seem to find it anywhere else ! MUST GO BACK!!Marrakech has become a bit of a staple for me when I am in Las Vegas. My father had taken me and some clients here long ago and I have loved it ever since. 

The restaurant is in a weird spot just a few blocks off of the Strip but well worth the ten dollar cab ride, trust me. It is pretty unassuming from the outside but upon entering you are transported to a middle eastern wonderland. Seats low to the ground, tent like drapery and intricate hanging lamps create a far away vibe. 

Once seated your hands are washed over a bowl with rose scented water as you will be eating with your hands for most of the meal. Can you say "romantic"? Tray after tray of beautifully presented items are whisked out while you lounge on the seats and enjoy the experience. Shrimp scampi, lentil soup, hummus and marinated veggies, filet skewers, couscous and chicken followed by a seriously decadent phylo dough pastry filled with apples and raisins. 

While you dine the most sexy belly dancer you have ever seen wiggles and writhes between the tables. If you are not thoroughly turned on by the atmosphere, the entertainment and the food you must be dead. 

Marrakech is best either in a large group or just for two. I can only imagine being on a date at such a place--uber romantic. And, with a large group the laughter and indulgence is sure to please. I've been with a group of about 10 and I've been with just myself and a gal pal--next will have to be a sexy man to enjoy the ambiance with.I received probably the best service ever from Chin Chin when my group of five came here last Monday. Our server was beyond courteous and made some awesome recomendations for both food and beverages! 

Service on the strip is normally pretty good.. but this was beyond that.. and to top it all off, the food exceed our expectations as well.

Defintely make your way here if you're in the mood for delicious Chinese food / sushi. I highly recomend this one!I've had many steaks in my time. Two places in Chicago come to mind that had the best in the world steaks. But after my first visit to Vegas, specifically New York New York's Gallagher's Steakhouse, totally blew previous steaks out the water. I had the Aged Steak that was on display on front, and it was the juiciest best steak I've had. The waiter was quick to greet and take our order, as well as giving us a quick review of the meals and answering any questions we had. Refills were quickly refilled, waiter made sure to swing by to make sure we are satisfied. Dishes looked amazing, the setting of the restaurant is great, and you can see the chefs making your food. Overall a very awesome experience. Can't wait to go back to try the other dishes.Once again SUPERB!  No one's NY steak, Lobster tail or Sticky Toffee Pudding compares... Hands down the best ever.  Oh and the prices are much less than other steakhouses.  Also if you like a cosmo get one here, perfectly made!  
We love Gallaghers forever!!

P.S. Make a reservation, no hassle to be seated!I like to enjoy a good steak and I have to say this is probably one of the best stakes I have ever had. The lobster was so sweet and tasty.Fantastic! I love this store, its big, bright and airy. They have a huge assortment, and have hidden secret closets, with even more goodies inside! They carry the most beautiful handbags, and I was told by the salesperson there, are all handmade in Itay. Great experince!We stayed at Circus Circus for one night last weekend, which was Halloween weekend.  Yes...the place was crazy.  Tucked inside this crazy casino is this gem of a steakhouse.  First off, the bartender made us some fantastic old-fashions.  The service throughout the night was outstanding, and they seemed to be grateful that we chose to eat there.  It feels like what Vegas should feel like.  It is dark and cozy, and we sat in a red vinyl booth.  I love how you can see the aging room and the kitchen as you walk in.  The menu is simple, and we enjoyed the porterhouse, a mashed potato, the spinach salad, and the onion soup.  The breadbasket hit the spot.  Alongside the potato came a number of toppings, including so much delicious bacon it was comical!  The spinach salad was just okay, as we would have expected the dressing on it so you get that slightly wilted effect.  The rest of the meal was outstanding, and we especially enjoyed the steak.  It was cooked perfectly, and had a nice aged flavor.  We tried very hard to finish everything, but it was a battle that we eventually lost.  It is hard to even leave a bite at the table, but in Vegas there is no place for leftovers!Thanks again Yelpers for suggesting an amazing steakhouse while in Vegas last weekend!  It's everything you think a steakhouse should look like. Dimly lit, beautiful decor, pleasant waitstaff.   

I chose to get the filet mignon/jumbo shrimp and our table split a bunch of sides.  The filet was juicy, tender, and literally melted in my mouth.  The shrimp were HUGE, and very flavorful. I recommend the macaroni and cheese-it's the first time I've ever had blue cheese mac n' cheese and I was pleasantly surprised!!  My friend was very ambitious, and decided to order the pound and a half bone-in ribeye and proceeded to eat the entire thing. Very impressive. 
They also hooked up our table with some free desserts because we were celebrating two birthdays!  

I definitely recommend this place if you are craving a delicious steak and overall amazing dining experience!Great food & friendly service. Food was mouth watering!  Ribeye was cooked perfectly, steamed and sautéed veggies done just right. Must try the lobster Mac!!Came for my husband's birthday and we weren't disappointed! Some of the best steak I've had!! And the service was amazing which topped off a perfect night.

-Crab Cakes: almost pure crab meat, so delicious. Recommend for two people to share as a appetizer
-Filet Mignon: So tender and juicy and just mouth wateringly delicious. The night we went, they offered a Mignon sampler. Three 4oz steaks prepared 3 different ways. AMAZING! Just outrageous! 
-Dessert: Lemon cake! It was complimentary because it was my husband's birthday. It was good, but I don't know if I would pay $11 for it normally. It's a HUGE portion, so maybe make sure you have at least 4 people to share it with.Thanks for American Express and their $50 gift card to this restaurant, we were able to venture out of our usual Vegas strip restaurant and try a new steakhouse.  So glad we found this place because it became our new favorite!   Everything from the food, appetizer, dessert, ambience, service, bathrooms, parking, etc was perfect.  We made a last minute reservation on a Sunday night at 5:30pm.  

Our server Gustavo (I think that's how his name is spelled) gave us an impeccable service and we really enjoyed his sense of humor along with his charming personality throughout our meal.  It's not everyday you get a server who can provide a smooth flowing comfortable dining experience.   Thank you Gustavo!  We look forward to dining here again real soon.  

For appetizer, you must order their raw oysters.  Between the East and West, we liked the West side oysters because they were smaller and sweeter.  This was a great start to our meal.  

The prixe fix dinner was only $50 but came with a choice of salad, appetizer, choice of bigger cuts for extra $$ or the 8oz filet cut and one family size side dish.  

My husband ordered the Tamaha Wagyu 32 oz cut for extra $50.  That steak looked like something Fred Flinstone would devour!   Only a true steak lover with a huge appetite can finish this steak in one seating!   I was skeptical about the 8 oz steak and thought it would be more dry and boring.  To my surprise even the filet was very juicy and flavorful!   The different side dishes were all perfect and big enough to share with the family.   Crab cakes and Scallops were all good portions to pair with our steaks.  

They are known for the Lemon debosh cake.  No matter how full we were, there was no way we were going to leave without trying this cake.  It's big enough to share between 4 people.  Despite not being a huge lemon fan, this had to be the best lemon cake we've had and would order it again next time.  Not too tart or too sweet.  Perfectly moist and delicious.  Save room for this cake!

We love this place so much better than SW steak or CUT!   Glad to have found Del Frisco's!  Wish they had another location in LA!The service and food could not have been better. I love to eat, so I know.I visited Sapphire on the first night of my visit for the Bar & Nightclub Expo in March. It was one of the craziest, drunkenest nights of my life but I had a blast. Despite the fact that I lost my phone and my ID, I remember having a great time with the friends and colleagues who were along for the adventure here. We spent a lot of money and partied like celebrities. I returned the next day to see if they had found my phone, ID and jacket. Turns out they had my jacket, and they were very helpful in trying to find my phone and ID which never surfaced. Probably ended up in the backseat cushion of a taxi at the end of the night...

Oh well, if you're going to go to Vegas, there's only one way to live.Well, I stayed here for 4 months at the expense of my company when they sent me out to LV for training.  I want to say I had a 2-bedroom for $1300 month, but that was back in 2000 and it was a corporate rate, so I have no idea what they charge today and if it has changed much.

Couldn't really see myself staying here for less than a month, as it really is a long-stay place.  There are folks that have lived here for years.

Two nice  separate swimming pool areas, and they don't get alot of tenant use.  Gas barbeques pool side.  Decent workout room.

Nice fully furnished apartments, clean and pretty well appointed.  Kind of low key atmosphere--they way the hall and floor layouts are, you don't run into alot of people.  Gated car entry with swipe card and underground parking.  Swipe rooms.

One VERY LARGE block off the strip, behind the Flamingo.  I liked its central location.  Pretty easy to head East on Flamingo for grocery shopping, or West to hit the strip.

It was a great stay for 4 months.  This was a quality operation with good  facility construction, operations and security.I *love* this place. It is definitely the best Chinese Food I have ever had. Many options, ranging from the exotic to more familiar favorites. Plenty of vegetarian choices.

Hot & Sour Soup - Full of vegetables and tofu, the sour mixed with the spiciness was a perfect way to warm up. It was so delicious I ate two cups even though I had more food coming.

Schezuan Scallops - Bay Scallops aren't my favorite type of scallops, but this dish was really good. It isn't garnished with lots of useless bits of uncooked broccoli like at other restaurants. This is a full plate of scallops.

Chicken Egg Foo Young - Hands down, the best egg foo young in town. The patties were generously sized and the gravy was to die for.

I also hear that their wonton soup is delicious.

Don't be alarmed by the exterior (Sonny's Saloon) and the neighborhood. The people in the saloon are nice (their drink prices are very reasonable). In fact, I kind of like the atmosphere.

Our waitress was a little grumpy, but I won't take stars off for that. The food more than made up for it and everyone has a bad day every once in a while.We needed a place to stay between moving out of our old house and moving into our new house.  We have been so happy with this location! So clean, very well kept, great new modern rooms, and the staff is so nice. We found them really helpful, and accommodating! The pool is heated and so nice, and super clean. The onsite mini mart is really nice to have. For us, for 2 adults, 2 kids and several pets, it was $217 total for 3 nights, Sun-Tues, with wifi (only $3 per day!!). SUCH a great deal. Absolutely affordable. We would absolutely stay again, and suggest it to friends.I agree with Colleen J.! I love this Westin. It's not too far from the strip, yet you can go back to the hotel at night without the parking hazzle and the going across the big casino to finally get to your room. Love the room, and this is the only hotel in Vegas that has a very calming fragrance. As soon as you step into the hotel, you can taste the different smell. We went to have a couple massage at the spa and had wonderful time, very decent, where you can find tranquility. 
Will definitely go back!!!!Guys - if you gotta hit the mall with your woman ...this is the place to go ...the most comfortable chairs to lounge in while your girl looks at overpriced, shoes, handbags, clothes, etc - grabbed a cup of java, plopped in a chair, did the " i'm cool texting " thing  and the mall was ...tolerable ...then again , it helped that we got their late and the mall shops were closing within an hour ...oh....darn !Great place! I've been to a Rainforest Cafe at Downtown Disney in California, and most recently at the Rainforest Cafe at the MGM Grand in Vegas.  I went for my birthday on 12-28. The large appetizer platter was amazing! The alcoholic drinks were yummy too! The waiter was extremely attentive, and he checked on us often.  I highly recommend this restaurant both at the MGM, or any Rainforest Cafe in general.Great store, great service, and great selection.

This stores is beautiful, even more beautiful are it's dressing rooms.  I recommend trying something on, just for that purpose.  

Overall, the selection is nice, I think they also have a great men's selection.  The most recent time I went (after xmas) they were having a sale, which is always nice.  The sales people were very helpful, but not pushy.  

I am surprised that the prior reviewer said they were not acknowledged.  I was within second upon entering.

I love Dolce and Gabanna so of course I will go back...Love me my Italian FashionThe Prime Rib is incredible and you will not regret anything you eat here.  

Do Not get the two boned steak.  HOLY CRAP.  I couldn't finish it and it wasn't even close.  That thing kicked my ass.

Stick with their specialty.  The Prime Ribbest prime rib house in southern nevada.Such an AMAZING pleasant surprise!!!

My friend booked us here for a college reunion of sorts.  I was suspicious because I've never heard of this place and it's not really very close to the Strip.  OMG...so glad my friend made this choice.  This is one of my new favorite resorts in Vegas.  Let me tell you a few reasons why:

-All of the rooms are HUGE and suite-style; there were 4 of us and we all fit super comfortably in one room.  Two queen beds and a full-size couch (some of the rooms have pullouts but I slept on the normal couch and was plenty comfy) are automatically provided.  If you're road-trippin up from Socal or anywhere else, there is more than enough floor space to comfortably fit one or two more air mattresses.  If you're broke college kids or something, one room could fit 10 people with no issue.

-Bathrooms are super nice; walk-in shower and garden tub are both wonderful.  They also provide a REAL hair dryer and not those dinky toy-sized ones you get at Holiday Inn.

-I think this place used to be an apartment complex or something with the way it's laid out; it's awesome because you can park right next to your room and not have to worry about making a long trek to your car if you forgot something.  We had a fancy rental car and never felt sketchy about leaving it in the parking lot; there are security patrolling on golf carts at all times

-The casino is actually decent for being off-strip.  The slots seemed to be pretty loose and most of my friends won big there (I, of course, had no luck but whatever).  They have a decent selection of table games as well.

-Marilyn's Cafe or whatever is amazing drunk food.  Steak and egg plate in the middle of the night is only $4.99.

All in all, I will most definitely be coming back here to stay and play again.came here valentines! i don't recommend, unless u like pre-set menus, which alot of places do on a night like valentines, but every thing was great! from the service to the food. it was all good!!!!

food was really great. meats were perfectly cooked and all the flavors were on point. i love french food!

i recommend always having reservations here because it is a high-end restaurant. this place is pricy too so dont come here broke. the view is beautiful! u have views of the strip and of bellagio and other surrounding hotels.

when the menu is not preset they have exotic meats such as rabbit and such. havn't had them yet, but that is what i wanted on vday and was surprised with a preset menu. it was still a great experience.Eiffel Tower Restaurant would be the epitome of fine dining.  I would recommend making reservations as it can be busy during weekends.  Also, do remember to dress up for this dining occasion.  I've been here twice, and literally every table in the restaurant has a view of Bellagio's water show.  At night, the strip lights really come alive, and you can take it all in while enjoying a bottle of Grgich Hills cabernet sauv.  This is a great place for a romantic dinner, or a friendly get together.  They definitely have enough waitstaff to accomodate both.  The bartender is friendly, so if you have to wait for a table don't hesistate to grab a cocltail. 

I had the roasted lamb rack with a side of asparagus.  The lamb was cooked to a perfect medium rare, a deep purple in the center.  It was crusted in pepper and served with some grilled tomatoes.  The lamb had the consitency of cotten candy and melted in my mouth.  The asparagus was cooked perfectly in butter and topped with parmesan cheese bits.  The asparagus rivaled my entree in quality.  I also had the opportunity to try the filet mignon, as well as the veal medallions, and both met or exceeded my standards.  We finished with a choclate souffle, which I must wholeheartedly recommend.  

The service exceeded my expectations.  My drinks never dipped below the halfway point.  There was perhaps one waiter for every person in our party.  Our waiter was friendly, funny, and knowledgeable on every item on the menu.  Overall, a great experience.

Although the dinner is very costly, I must recommend it if you love fine dining.  

PROTIP:  You must order the souffle at the beginning of the meal because it takes a while for them to prepare it, so let your waiter know.We had a table with the view of the Bellagio fountains. It doesn't get any better than this. The food was very good. The service splendid. But my goodness the VIEW! We made my reservation at 5pm right when the sun started to set and it was maaaagical.Yum!  So good!  Decent price, great food, huge portions... I ordered the Beef Chimichanga and was not disappointed... I will be back!!HOORAY FOR MY 200TH REVIEW!!

Came here for the ELECTRIC DAISY CARNIVAL LAS VEGAS EDITION...

THIS PLACE IS FUCKING HUGE!!! I heard its about 7 LA COLOSSEUMS PUT TOGETHER?? 

In my opinion, this venue was MUCH MUCH better than the LA COLOSSEUM...why do I say this?

the speedway is just one huge circle! there is no need for crazy obstacle courses *cough LA COLOSSEUM...its not hard to get lost in LA cuz of all the different area....but being at the SPEEDWAY...its not hard to find your friends at all

this place was so spacious that they were able to accommodate all the cars and parking as well too. another cool thing about this place was that as people walked down from the entrance onto the grounds...the pathways walking down to the grounds were pretty spacious *cough LA COLOSSEUM narrow little pathways.

I believe the SPEEDWAY has a 5 year contract with INSONIAC for future EDC events. I do feel bad for LA though...Im pretty sure the council is crying in their arms that they lost this magical event. 
INSTEAD
insomniac will be making LAS VEGAS that much more $$$$.
&
isnt it crazy how one person...can create a holiday...and make that holiday THE BIGGEST HOLIDAY IN VEGAS?? before it was memorial day weekend....now its EDC WEEKEND!
&
I can truly say that EDC IS MUCH GREATER THAN UMF or COACHELLA

I had such a great time this last weekend, and Im happy that I actually went! 

SEE YOU ALL NEXT YEAR!

UNTIL THEN!! ^-^Ever since my latest purchase of the Juicer, Whole Foods has been my go-to place for ingredients. Yes, juicing can get quite expensive, but I rather pay now than pay the medical bills later.  Besides, how can you put a price on health? 

My latest addiction when I can't juice at home, is ordering the fresh juices at the juice bar. Drinks like the "Einstein", "Green Machine" and "White Rabbit." The 16oz has a prize tag close to $8 dollars per drink. But when you actually watch them make the drink you can see why. The amount of kale and parsley that goes into the juicer is astronomical with so little juice that comes out of it.You have to sit at the bar and hang out with premiere sushi chef Jason Lam to have a good time. Let him pick out your poison and have a great night. He knows the best and freshest items daily so trust the chef. Sashimi is a must if you go to this Sushi restaurant  so I can't complain one bit.Comfort food overload. Everyone talks about their humongo chicken pot pie, but did you realize they have a $2-$7 Happy Hour daily? 3:30-6:30 mon-Friday and Saturday in the morning sometime I think it's 11-4. Sunday is funday because happy hour is all day long! They've spruced up the place and I hope that more fun, young locals start hanging out here as it's close to my home. Would love to meet ya!New location? Sales? The Desert Rock Sports Gods hath listened!  New location, a few doors down the way, is much bigger, offers items on sale, AND offers consignment climbing gear.  Staff still as rad as usual...about as good as it gets for a climbing shop.  Now, once the moving dust has settled, time for a digital presence so people can acquire items online.wonderful vegan raw foods! every item is amazeballz De-lishDr. Al and his staff are amazing! Not only did he cure my husband and my back & neck issues, he even took care of our 2 year olds ear infections! Our Pediatrician would just give us antibiotics which weren't working and send us on our way. Dr. Al got rid of the ear infection with just a few adjustments - No antibiotics necessary! Wonderful Doctor, Caring Staff...Highly Recommend!!!Whenever I need extra $$$ whether I'm between paychecks, or for speacial events like birthdays, baptismals, graduations etc,. I just visit my friends John and Richard at Mail for You and mission accomplished!. They have the best interest rates in town and the customer service cant be beat!!! Thats why I am a loyal repeat customer as Mail for You has always come to my rescue!!!! 5 star Rating all the way!!!!!!!!Come for the great and cheap lunch menu they have,great tasting food ,Super friendly vibe and great amount of food for a cheap price.I love Roys I have been here a few times and every time is great! The food is awesome and the chocolate souffle omg!!!! You have to try it.We were in town for the weekend and found this place on Yelp. It took a lot of convincing to get our party of 15 to agree to travel outside the strip for dinner, but it was soooo worth it. 

Everything just worked out perfectly. I called that afternoon several times and finally got ahold of someone. I was so excited when they agreed to accommodate our large party at 8PM. They asked if we were celebrating any birthdays and when I told them yes, they did something special for that person for dessert.

The pre-fixe menu is a great deal, but you can also order ala carte. The portions are generous, so no one left the place hungry. I had the warm spinach goat cheese salad. Yum! The crawfish risotto was apparently very good too. I ordered the angel hair pasta for dinner... I am sure there are better things on the menu, but I'm not much of a meat eater. The apple tart was very good too...though I was really very stuffed and should have stopped eating after the salad! The only odd part about the meal was the mountain of butter that they served with the rolls...seriously, I have never seen so much butter... yum!

The service was top notch. The waiters take their jobs seriously and it showed. Everytime I went to the ladies room, there was someone there to greet me and pull out my chair for me when I got back to our table. I was never without wine in my glass and the dining experience was similar to what you would get at a 5 star restaurant. Believe me, you'll get over the fact that it's in a strip mall real fast.

Our table was nice and roomy...we didn't feel crammed, rushed, or unwelcomed -as large parties in Vegas might sometimes feel.

They served us all a delicious amuse bouche at the beginning of the meal and every dish was served all at once... no one waiting around for their dish to show up. Everything was nice and hot cooked perfectly.

The cost was about $75 per person...considering we ordered 5 bottles of wine at $60 a pop...that is really inexpensive and well worth the cab ride to the restaurant.

To top it off, the restaurant called me to day to find out how I enjoyed my dining experience.... how nice is that???

I would definitely come back here whenever I return to Vegas...which could be awhile given my lack of luck in the casinos.Came here for a pre-wedding dinner with a large group. The service was excellent. The waitstaff knew exactly what we all had ordered and never once had to ask "who had this dish?" They endured our long stay as we closed the restaurant for the evening.

The food was excellent. We enjoyed the tasty bites the chef prepared for us prior to our main meal orders and the little dessert squares after (not to mention the dessert we ordered).

I ordered the rack of lamb with mashed potatoes and kalamatta olives. My husband ordered the milk-fed veal. Both our dishes were well cooked and tender. Others at the table ordered the pompano, scallops, bbq shrimp, and more. Everyone enjoyed the meal and we all walked out of there thoroughly stuffed.

As we were getting ready to leave, we noticed a sign stating that bottles of wine are 1/2 price on Sundays. Just may have to come back some time when visiting and enjoy that special. I definitely recommend this place to anyone who wants a superb/gourmet meal off the strip.I love this spot, it is right across from my office which of course is how I started going here over the last few years.  The only time I am not happy with this place is when someone calls in sick or the owners go on vacation or some reason they just are shut down and you see a sign on the door!! Oh well no biggie.  Their fatoosh salad is to die for.  It's a large portion too, so you feel full and no meat needed, but added gyro meat is always a plus.  Great fresh ingrediants, I'm never disappointed.  All the normal great things like their hummus, tabulli, hot fresh pita breads.  Shrimp scampi is awesome with their Lebanese rice.  Gyros love them and their fries are sometimes a little soft for me, but still good.This is the first Metro Pizza I ever had the pleasure of visiting. It was introduced to me by my girlfriend at the time whom went to UNLV for a while. BEST DAMNED PIZZA AROUND! We had the "SKYLINE" and the "GARLIC FRIES" on my first visit with her. Both of which were some of the absolute best things I have ever eaten in my life. I would come here every time I wanted pizza if I lived here.  They even have a daily calendar for specials you have to see to appreciate. As well as kids nights where they can learn about pizza making. Thank you Beth H., for introducing me to one of the best places to eat in Las Vegas. Just for the record, I still do and always will love you...10th year in a row that I've had my Thanksgiving feast catered by MCB, and the food was as tremendous as always. 
From the turkeys to all the sides, everything was simply delicious. Leftovers for a week! Thanks to Markini and her staff for always making the process so easy.I messed up my order--not them. They corrected it quickly and were so polite and I had a delicious latte. Great experience!I eat here frequently, often with large orders for the office which we submit online. When I walk in, even at their busy times the staff is friendly and often greets me by name. Teresa is always happy, friendly and takes time to make sure our orders are correct. They will even call to make sure you are satisfied with your order if it's placed online.

I have been to this location both take out and dine in and it has always been a wonderful experience. The food is very good and even for those on diets or with restrictions there are plenty of options. The service is friendly and fast and the location always looks well maintained and clean.Service is really great here. The lines are long because it's across UNLV so it's expected. The great thing is the workers here work fast and love their job. 

Advice: don't be so tight on the guacamole lolI go to John Bates.. I've followed him here and have been going to him for years.. He looks mean but he's a nice guy lol.. and his work is amazing!!!! He turns your ideas into the most amazing work.. I can't speak for the other guys, I dont know them but John is the business... I send all my friends and family to see him.. and he is fair with his prices..I don't prefer Mexican food.  Two years of this place, and i'm in absolute love.  It's high end, gormet Mexican.  What a job they do extracting and melding flavors.  GREAT Food.  You'll find this place rigth before at the Mandalay Bay Convention Center in MB.  Great servers, awesome little outside eating area too.  You gotta have the Stuffed Corn Appetizer.  Good stuff!  2 years in a row and figured I owed them a 5* Yelp.good store!Rating is based on the items that I've had at Roy's!

Sushi is wonderful!  Kobe Roll & Garden Island Rolls are always amazing!!! MMM!

The Braised Short Rib is so moist and soft
The Miso Butter Fish is also amazing!!!

For dessert go for either...
Chocolate Souffle
Macadamia Tart...

SO GOOD!!!!Absolutely fabulous. My husband and I recently moved to Vegas and tried this place because of the great reviews but also because it is one of the few places in the city with a decent gluten-free menu (important to me, not him). 

We both expected it to be okay but it FAR exceeded our expectations. We did the prix fixe menu and both of us had the roasted beet salad -- beautiful in its simplicity. We loved the macadamia nut/beet combo. 

I had the scallops as a main. Having ordered scallops in a million different restaurants (it's one of my favorite dishes), I can honestly say these were the best I've ever had. With the bacon and the cauliflower they were beyond amazing. The chocolate souffle for dessert was good, although not life-changing.

My husband had the seafood trio and was floored by how fantastic the salmon and butterfish were. The latter was like Chilean Seabass -- buttery, flaky melt-in-your-mouth perfection.

Neither of us can stop raving about this meal. It was truly outstanding. A lovely ambience as well -- vibrant but with a subdued noise level, even on a Saturday night. It just doesn't get much better than this. We'll definitely be back.My partner and I came here for my birthday dinner on Monday evening and I couldn't have asked for a better experience.

Everyone from the greeters to the food runners were exceptionally polite and kind. Our waiter was VERY knowledgable on the menu and made some amazing recommendations.

The restaurant itself is gorgeous. The food presentation is top notch, not to mention the spectatular quality of the food.

I will definitely be returning here as often as possible!I had always heard this restaurant had great deserts, but that's all I ever heard.  Finally came here last night.

I got the Lilikoi salad, the Hawaiian style Butterfish, and the chocolate souffle.  The butterfish is like a sea bass if I had to explain it to someone.  Whatever is in this misoyako makes this dish memorable.  Hands down I would tell anyone to order this fish and the group should share this dessert.

Service is phenomenal.  The restaurant is beautiful.  I don't care if this is a chain, because it doesn't feel like one.By far the best I have had anywhere! Everything from the  grape leaves to hummus and lean is awesome and that is just for appitizers! I had the kibble and it is cooked to perfection. My grandmother is Lebanese and it is on part with her perfection of cooking. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for middle eastern food in vegas!Awesome Sushi place for dinner! 

Nicely decorated. You can dress up or down for this restaurant. The atmosphere is welcoming yet professional and chic. I recommend going during Happy Hour Sunday-Thursday. Their portions and quality of sushi are still the same as regular hours but for a cheaper price. Ask for a Sake Sangria. It's delicious! 

I've sat at the sushi bar and a dinner table during the 3 times I've gone and I have had excellent service by the servers, manager, and sushi chefs all 3 times. Each were constantly attentive to anything I needed and made sure my plates were cleared promptly. The manager each time approached my table, asked about my experience and if I needed anything.They were quick to address anything I needed. It definitely shows that they care about their clientele. I even joined their free membership program where you can add points for discounts and free meals because I enjoyed the quality of food and service so much. 

I've never sat at the bar, but I have seen people there during the late hours. You should definitely check this place out if you're at Town Square. Happy eating!One of a few 5 star sushi joints for me (Usually sushi is good [fresh] or not good) - Got to get the Fire Cracker - AMAZING!!On April 15 , 2014  I took my Joe Rocket Super Hawk leather motorcycle jacket that developed two splits of the leather on each arm about 5 inches in length !  I took it to JOVA'S leather on the two yelp reviews that I seen and the ower HARRY was very nice and explained to me how he could fix the jacket and asked what day I wanted it ready !  I felt very confident that it would turn out great and when I went to picked it up we both had a hard time finding the splits that were there before :)  Very Good Work and Very affordable ! Thanks again Harry :)This is the Best restaurant in the Top ten listed here, And it is the only one that you can leave without spending $100 minimum. (with the exception of In 'N' out.....)I have been to Serigio's several times and never had anything less than a great experience.  The food is delicious, the atmosphere is wonderful, and the service is impeccable.  If you want authentic Italian food and atmosphere, come here for sure!  We will be back many times to come!Wife & I went there for her B'day. This was our 2nd time. Our waiter Francisco was great. We had the Pasta e Fagioli soup and then we shared the chicken parmigiana. Both dishes were great. Francisco was very attentive and professional and not overbearing. The bread was crisp and the butter was good.
 This is our place to go to whenever we're in Vegas. To us this Italian restaurant is a lot better than the ones that are in the hotels. It pays to come here.Great food - salad, bread, linguini with clams and chicken machiaggano Service was very attentive. @Would definitely recommend. Prices around $25 complete.Their French onion soup and Amy's Turkey o is a perfect match so damn dank! If you haven't tried Jason's deli you need to get on it,this has been of favorite of mine since my preteens haha (;A fabulous off the strip find.  The descriptions of mobster hangout, old school italian, etc. are all accurate.  We were here on a Sunday night and it was packed with locals.  The gentleman who does the entertainment/singing/piano is quite a character, he has a lovely voice and we enjoyed his music and spirit.  One of the highlights was him pulling his old friend, an actor/performer, on stage for an impromptu performance, very neat.  
Our waiter, Tony (of course), truly made our evening; the wine recommendation from Cakebread Cellars was bang on - and because it was Sunday (& Mondays too) all wine bottles were 50% off, wow!  
The lobster ravioli special was incredible as was the pomodoro fresco.  The bruschetta was good, but we wouldn't order that one again.  Desserts were excellent, made in house and imported from Italy.
The ambiance, entertainment, service, food and wine were fantastic; we thoroughly enjoyed this fun, cozy and romantic evening; for that, we thought the prices were reasonable.  It cost us $24 for a cab from the strip to here, but they do offer a complimentary limousine that we may take advantage of next time - oh yes, there will definitely be a next time.
A nice break from the high priced, fake, stuffy places on the strip.Found this place on Yelp with a ton a of great reviews! I was not disappointed. The service we had was just as amazing as the food. I also enjoyed the decor, old Italian mafia feeling...great place 5 stars! Brad was our server and he KICKED ASS. Ask for him. Cheers!Best Cannolis I've found in Vegas hands down.  This place is an old school east coast italian style bakery satisfying even the most critical of dego sweet tooths.  The cannolis ,like I said but can't stress enough, are the best I've had in vegas.  I find it hilarious that no matter how tasty the Italian cuisine can get in this town it's absolutely impossible to find a good cannoli.  Most are way too sweet and came out of a box.  Albinas has been doing cannolis along with all the other Italian classics hand made, daily for the past 20 years.  They have remained practically unchanged by the times, and why the hell would they change?  When you've been doing it this good for this long.We have been going to Fuji's for 26 years and we have never found a better Japanese restaurant anywhere!  The owners are friendly and caring and eager to please. Their sauces for the hibachi are excellent and their ginger dressing is the best!  All of my friends who visit from Japan are eager to go back--not only for the food, but for the owners.  You cannot beat the prices anywhere!Very, very authentic.

You can tell from the menu and the specials that they cater to real asian cuisine and not just the sweet sour port / chow mein / fried rice crowd.  The real food here like the salt baked chicken, the spring chicken, the bitter melon. Man this is the place to get real food like as if you were in Chinatown San Francisco.

Great Cantonese food, which means the rest rooms however, are terrible.Oh God how I wish we had a Wo Fat in L.A....
I heard all about this Hawaiian/Chinese restaurant and the next time I was in Vegas I knew I had to go there for my beloved cake noodle and crispy gau gee. I was NOT disappointed. The whole restaurant itself is very comforting. No frills, no fancypants menu, just good cheap food. I ordered the oyster sauce chicken cake noodle and my friend ordered the beef broccoli cake noodle, and we shared the gau gee. We were happy f****** campers, let me tell ya. YUM!
I am threatening to come here every time I go to Vegas.Moving here from Chicago in 2000, it was imperative we find a good animal clinic where we could take our 17-year-old parrot Max for care.  Everyone recommended Flamingo Pet Clinic and they were right!  Max visits the clinic about every three months to have his beak trimmed and his wings and nails clipped.  Max loves the staff; they're so gentle with him, and the doctors are so concerned, making sure they address any questions and concerns.  There are also many pet items (foods, treats, vitamins, etc.) for sale at the clinic, and they also will board your pet if you go on vacation.  Through the years Max was boarded there a couple of times for over a week and he loved it!  When we picked him up to take him home he would be very talkative and bossy, a good sign he was comfortable in his home away from home.  Max will have a birthday soon, he'll be 30 years!  He's healthy, active and feisty; thanks for over 14 years of good vet care from Flamingo Pet Clinic!  We'd recommend them always to take care of your family members.Another wonderful dinner here at Sushi on Tropicana.   Jeff and I sat at our usual spot at the bar.  Met out amazing sushi chef, Steve and Joey.  Awesome food again.  My uni that Steve prepared for us was superb and fresh.  Can't wait to be here again on our next date night.  We love this place!This place is amazing! I started out chowing down on the homemade refried beans & guac. These beans were almost as good as my Nicaraguan mama makes. I was surprised to see that they had carne asada because I can no longer find carne asada @ mexican resturants nowadays. This place is a must!Best mexican restaurant I have had the pleasure of enjoying in Las Vegas. The food is plentiful and affordable. Had my birthday dinner there twice now and they definitely pull out the stops for the celebration. The fajitas are FAJITABULOUS! and the service matches the food.See my review of Goyemon just remove all mentions of pork belly. Great quality sushi + tempura ice cream = Perfect place for AYCE sushi.I love this place! Everything I've had in the five times I've been there has been absolutely delicious! Definitely recommend this place!Excellent food.  The service was a bit odd on the night we went.  We had reservations and they were late in the evening.  We were greeted with warnings from the staff that the kitchen was slow.  Seems that a lot of their kitchen staff had recently walked out do to a request for higher pay after being on one of the TV shows. The meals we ordered were fantastic so they must still have some of the good staff. 

It was a bit pricey for my tastes and we were scoping them out as a possible after weeding meal place.  We may go back for that meal as they did give us a buy one get one coupon.  

If you don't mind paying a bit more, I would truly recommend their food and ambiance.  Hopefully they will have worked out the kitchen staffs attitude and patron's won't be required to wait so long.I expected it to be heavily packed with shoppers considering it was the weekend, but I guess I was lucky because the crowds were decent and not crazy at all.

Upon entering I rushed to the clearance section of shoes and browsed for some hot items before hitting the display shoe aisles.  And sure enough, I came up on a pair of black Lebron 8's V1.  Although the size of the shoe did not match the box, a Nike employee was able to talk to the manager to give me the reduced sticker price on the box for $49.99 which was pretty damn awesome and a steal for me..

Overall, this location seemed to have a pretty good shoe selection but nothing as good and priced as the Lebrons I had in my hand.I have always found it difficult to find an honest mechanic...until I came to Professional Brake Service! I was recommended to them by a family member because I had several horrible experiences, especially because I'm a younger girl.

I called an made an appointment, and they fixed an engine issue in one day! Not only was their quote 400 dollars cheaper than anywhere else, they called me and said it would be 100 dollars less because they didn't need a part they thought they needed. I was SHOCKED! 

I highly recommend this place, especially to those who have been burned by dishonest mechanics. Extremely friendly service as well! When there is an issue with your car, they will explain exactly what is wrong and why they need to fix it.I was referred here by a friend who couldn't say enough good things about Dr. Hewitt. 
My 11 year old rot lab mix had 3 rather large growths, 2 on his legs and one on his chest that needed to be removed immediately. 
Upon meeting the Dr. He immediately made me feel at ease and explained absolutely everything to me. 
Clearly he loves animals and his job!
I took him in on a Tuesday morning for an eval. Then luckily there was a cancellation on Wednesday for a surgery so I quickly booked it. 
Everyone there is very friendly and helpful and the surgery was a complete success. While he was under they also cleaned his teeth, expelled his anal glands and trimmed his nails which hasn't been done for 7 years since he wouldn't let anyone touch them. 
Surgery was yesterday and he's getting back to normal and sitting here with me at work so I can keep an eye on him. 
I'm definitely going to be a customer for life at Cheyenne west for both of my dogs. 
Hope this helps anyone who needs it..I've been taking my daughter to the play classes as well as the music classes for a year now.  She loves the activities and I love seeing her progress both mentally and physically.  Ms Nicole, our music teacher is the absolute best!I've been taking my daughter to Supersmile for over a year now for her braces and I couldn't be happier with this place.  From the minute you walk in the door, you feel like everyone who works there is happy you came. Dr. Chamberlain and his whole staff are so friendly and professional; they all seem like they love their jobs AND love their patients.  My 12-year old actually looks forward to our appointments.  I couldn't ask for more!Finally a place that makes TAMALES as big as me and mmmmm mmmmmm  ggooooooddddd!!!!!! My experience here was awesome to say the least i had a excellent meal everything was extremely fresh and well cooked . The service was spot on. The staff acted as if i was family and were extremely helpful on the menu rundown. We will definitely be back!!!Ok, so I am NOT a fan of Delis AT ALL none.. I hate strange meat,meat thats been laying out under someone breathing all over it.. chopped meat that someone else has touched..blah, blah blah..Im a freak, I know. However, I was lured into this shop with a friend who swears that this place is the END ALL. I of course will have a bite of his because I am a snob who doesn't eat stuff like that. lol! He had to restrain me from demolishing his Capastrami Sandwich. That had to be THE BEST sandwich that ever crossed my lips. Tender meat, perfect coleslaw, perfect melted cheese and the bread? Fugetaboutit! Seriously.That sandwich made my heart happy! :o)  My only complaint is it wasn't hand fed to me by a rippling man in a loin cloth with my drink...lol!Just stopped in to look at iPads and our salesman knew everything we needed to know about it. We were going to wait to buy but after seeing it in person we needed it.What a store! The atmosphere is one in a million. Yes, there may be a few stores with the name "Bed, Bath, and Beyond" but none like this one. The girl who helped me, Kyann was here name by the way, was so helpful. She was easy to talk to and listened to what I needed and made very smart suggestions. I guess you could call her my designer psychologist haha. Not only did she help me get what I want, but she also helped me order things I needed online. If there's anyone worth talking to at this place, it's her. She is a Bed, Bath and Beyond guru!Love this store. A little over priced but with the coupons you can get great deals, they have so much stuff and the staff is always helpful!!!Really, really liked this pizza. Got the slices...two pepperoni for Jim, and one cheese for me. Loved the nice crispy brown crust, tangy sauce and perfect amount of cheese. The cheese and crust were the same thickness. Perfect!!! There was a nice amount of grease on top of the slice. This is a must for me.

The restaurant looked like we walked into a small, old school inner city restaurant. It was fun. Good service. Waited for a bit to be recognized, but once we were, it was fine.My son has been taking gymnastics here since he was 9 months old in the free baby gym class. Then he started mini kittens at 16 months, and is currently 2 years old and in the kittens class twice a week. It is very structured and organized... 
The first 15 minutes is obstacle courses utilizing the balance beams, barre, vault and rings. The second 15 minutes is running, skipping and hopping in circles to fun music and learning how to freeze, followed by stretching our legs. Then they all play with toys, balls, tunnels, hoops etc. The last 15 minutes is my sons favorite part of class! That's when they get to jump on the huge trampoline or run on the long narrow trampoline, or jump into the giant foam pit and try to climb out. 
It is a "mommy-and-me" style class until they are three years old and out of diapers, so I can't give a review on that age range yet. But from my observations, it looks like the coaches are well trained and take their jobs seriously where safety is important and progress is being made, but still keeping it fun for the kids.It's not this HD in particular but all locations..every employee knows where everything is in the store. & that is so impressive to me cause there is so much stuff in HD!Arrived at 8am sat am to an already busy lobby, and greeted w a good morning and a handshake.  Been a customer for over 12 years and never had anything to complain about but this current team is doing a great job.Dr. Christopher Schneider is the best!  He's very informative and answers all your questions.  He doesn't try to rush you so that he can get to the next appointment.  If he doesn't know the answer, then he will refer to someone who will.  For example, my dog was having serious eye ulcer problems, and the medicine that we were using wasn't enough.  So he referred me to Las Vegas Veterinary Hospital where his eye ulcers where taken care of.
My dog also has regular issues like skin problems, ear, and anal glands problems.  Dr, Schneider is always nice and treats my dog with care.  

Dr. Schneider has been my dog's doctor for more than half of his life.  I recommend seeing him as your pet's doctor.I used to live in Vegas & always went to Red Rock Nails. I tried this place yesterday and I loved it. Great deluxe pedi & classic mani with Andy. It was packed and I walked in & didn't have to wait. I will absolutely go back when I'm in town.I've been to a couple different Auto Techs, this location and staff is by far the most welcoming, professional and helpful. Very fast and efficient.The ladies are really sweet, and welcoming. If you want you nails done last minute, they're fantastic. They can do designs, gel art, etc. Walk-ins are definitely accepted, and they are fast getting you in. The store is cozily designed.I came in kind of nervous due to these yelp reviews but it just so happens this is the one closest to my houese. The manager, Richard was very kind and attentive to all my needs. Surprisingly I left very happy. He took care of everything and made me feel welcome. I will definitely come again if needed and reccommend this place. Ask for Richard, he will take care of everything!Outrageously fast service, animated sushi chef, super fresh AYCE, all for $22 if you're a "good looking lady". $27 otherwise.The staff at JPT is exceptional. Every one of them from the PTs to the PTAs to the Techs are professional and on task. The atmosphere is totally congenial. All the staff make an effort to speak to and acknowledge the presence of the clients and continually encourage us to press through the exercises. However, in no way do they back off from doing the necessary therapy. They follow through with initial PT-client exercises then supervise the client in activities to strengthen the healing. Before and after my TKR, my PT is Kevin, my PTAs are Tammy and Adam, and my techs are Vince and Nate. You will not find more skillful PTs anywhere.

I highly recommend the Jackson group. They are the best!This is my #1 coffee spot! I frequent this Starbucks at least 3-4 times a week. The staff is always so friendly, and after about 1-2 months they learned my name by heart and eventually they memorized my drink as well. They are always so prompt and quick in the drive-thru, and when you go in the cafe they are just as great! There is some room for lounging, studying, or even socializing, but its definitely not as large as other ones I've been to. This Starbucks is always busy, but never ever do they sacrifice the great customer service due to being busy!

Also, just as a quick tip for avid Starbucks drinkers, buy yourself a gift card, go online and register it, and after about 10 or so drinks all the modifiers that they charge extra for become free. Plus, they send you a free drink coupon after every 15 drinks, and also on your birthday you get one as well. It's a nice little perk, and it makes you quite happy when you get those little cards in the mail!Grew up in Madison.  This is a must to visit, and definitely a place to take children: it is fun seeing their fascination with all that this place has to offer.  They also have a merry-go-round that operates in the Summer.  The food's good too: root beer and reuben is hard to beat, let alone the ice cream shop they've got for dessert.

I give this place 5 stars because you don't just go for the food, what Ella's offers is an experience, that that unique experience they do whole hog :)Amsterdam is a great bar in Phoenix.  And it's all because of the person working upstairs.  Yes, there is a "VIP" (anyone can go up there) room up those stairs in the back that lead to an intimate, nicely decorated room with leather couches on both sides of the long narrow room.  In the lighted glass cases along the wall, you will see some very, very expensive bottles of liquor.  One case has brandy.  The other has tequila.  The other has scotch and so on and so on.  Not only is it good liquor (I'm sure it is even though I haven't tried it), but it's very decorative.  The official name of the upstairs place is called "Rare" but I don't think I've heard anyone refer to it, except the person who works there.  At one end of the room, at the top of the indoor circular stairs (please don't use them - they are wobbly and you'll probably break them - it's roped off anyway), you can look over the main bar area and most of the main room.  

At the other end of the narrow room upstairs is a very well appointed bar.  The person serving said bar is Nicholas.  I hate to even call him a bartender as that wouldn't even begin to describe what he does.  Nicholas is a host.  In the grandest and best tradition of the word.  He is extremely personable.  Sees to your needs on a constant basis, usually wants to know your name and people that have been past customers of his, and he remembers them, get a warm hug.  Actually, he'd probably give you a hug if you're a first timer, too.  If he likes you.  Now, on to the drinks.  First off, don't ask for beer.  Nicholas doesn't do beer.  If you want beer, that's downstairs.  Second, Nicholas just doesn't make you a drink.  I mean, he does.  But he wants to know if it's really good.  If it has enough booze in it.  If it tastes good.  He's very concerned if you like what he's serving.  Only then, when your drink has met with your approval, do you pay for your drink.  I've seen him re-do drinks 3 or 4 times again until it satisfies the customer.  And, yes, the rumor that the drinks are $12 is true.  BUT......the service you're getting is part of the higher price, as far as I'm concerned.  And where in all of Phoenix can you get absinthe?  That's right.......absinthe.  Nicholas will explain the entire process to you while he's setting up the decanter of ice water and placing the sugar cube on the silver filter-thingy (I don't know what it's called) over the glass with the absinthe in it.  I've had it.  All I can say is, if you like black licorice, this is for you!

I moved to Chicago in April 2011 and Amsterdam and Nicholas are definitely something I miss about Phoenix.This is not only the best pizza I've had but some of the best food Ive ever had period. Amazing consistency. Perfect. Go check it out. Worth the wait.There probably isn't much I can say that previous reviews haven't already! But I can assure you that it's worth the wait. Of course if you don't want to wait you could just take five of your closest friends and make a reservation. Reservations for parties of 6 or more are welcome. However, if any member of your party is late consider your reservation null and void. Don't blame them - there are others outside that have been waiting hours for a table. 

But seriously worth the wait. Chris Bianco tosses all the crusts himself! The ingredients are always fresh! It's best to go with a group so that you can order multiple pies and try them all. I'm also a very big fan of their grilled veggie appetizer - it's marinated to perfection!

Don't let the wait scare you off! The adjacent wine bar has great prices and it's a nice wait splitting a bottle of wine on a picnic table outside!My husband and I heard about this place on the food channel and made it a goal to visit while we were in Phoenix. We heard from the locals about the long line and decided to set aside time to just experience it. An experience it is. We arrived about an hour before it opened, just to get on the waiting list. Our wait was 2 1/2 hours of which we spent sitting outside having a couple drinks and appetizers from the bar. Everyone else waiting seemed to be in good spirits and made for good company. No one seemed upset at the wait as all of us were there for the same thing. A taste of what ever was creating the wonderful smell drifting from the pizzeria. Periodically a greater would come by just to verify that those on the waiting list were still waiting. 

Once inside the incredibly quaint pizzeria, we were greeted by friendly staff and waiter. We never felt rushed and simply enjoyed some of the best pizza we ever had. The atmosphere is enjoyable and relaxing. We spent around $100 because we wanted to, not because we had to. The pizza is around $11-15 each which is very reasonable. 

Should you decide to visit, be prepared to spend time waiting. Be prepared to enjoy yourself and relax. Be prepared to have a conversation with other people around you. Most of all, be prepared to have to endure smelling the incredible pizza for 2 hours before you can eat any. This restaurant is about the experience, and it is an enjoyable one. We will return the next time we have the opportunity to visit Phoenix.Fantastic! I will be back!Pizzeria Bianco definitely lives up to their hype.

Yes, the wait to eat there is VERY long, but I thought it was worth it, especially when you have great company. I've only gotten their white pizzas there but I have loved them both. The last time I went there, I got the Sonny Boy and it was really good. I've never seen pistachios on a pizza and was a little hesitant, but it turned out to be delicious! The crust on these pizzas is probably the best I've had anywhere and I love to try out pizza places. It is the perfect combination of crunchy, crispy, and chewy. 

We also got a salad (which comes with their bread) and it was a great, light way to start. It wasn't anything special, but we were starving so the bread definitely helped fill out stomachs up a little bit and made us happy campers after the long wait. :)

Whenever people visit, I always take them here and Camelback mountain because I feel like these two are staples of Arizona.Excellent gourmet pizza.  Long wait to get seated but well worth it.  Weekday lunch time usually has a shorter wait.Stumbled in here for lunch w a customer based on Yelp search and reviews.  What a gem, this place was great!  Old school, Frank Sinatra, Rat Pack kind of feel.  You enter through the kitchen and see everyone making all the food.  Started with jumbo shrimp cocktail followed w the sirloin w baked potato, veggies and a salad.  It was so good!  I especially loved the horse radish and I'm not a horse radish kind of guy (well maybe now I am)!  Honestly, I can't say enough good things about this place.  I can't wait to come back!This coffee joint is great. The coffee is so good and so strong just one small one gets your buzz on. The baked goods baked IN HOUSE are soooooo delish. My cupcake was a bit dry once, but I kind of like them like that, however my friend I was with was a bit upset about the lack of moisture. They always have great zines to read and books to look at and tons of newspapers lying around. The seating is good, however they might want to rethink all of the white couches and chairs because they are super beat up. I think this place is the bee's knee's and you should go sip some java at this joint.What do you say about a place that is almost universally loved?
What else can you do but heap more praise onto it, at the risk of seeming sycophantic ?
Lux is certainly amongst the best of the best, for coffee in all of the greater phoenix metropolitan area. In all five areas of criterion:
~Taste: * * * * * the coffee brewed and sold here is perfect, the confections and baked goods are simply wonderful.
~Decor: * * * * * note the striking array of chairs and seating, along w/ additional patio seating make for optimal outside and inside digs
~Pricing: * * * * * nothing here is expensive, and considering the quality of the product sold, very economical
~Service: * * * * * the barristas are helpful, friendly and good natured, perfectly willing to explain the menu and offer tips advice, please tip them!
~Ambience: * * * * * this ties in w/ decor but is meant to be more along the lines of "scene" and the players in that scene. the folks who frequent Lux are my kinda folks (not as much as conspire but close) young, professional, hip, artsy, intelligent, down town people who know good coffee when they see/smell/taste it
So hoped that helped for the fence sitters, if for some reason you were perched precariously upon the fence to beging with.Black n white latte and peanut butter cookies........I'm in heaven!!!!!!!!!

Walking into this place I was immediately impressed with the decor.  I love places that look cool without looking like they tried too hard.  I was actually concerned because places like this usually have baristas that think they're too good for you.  This place was different!  The cashier immediately sparked up a cute witty banter and suggested their house specialties.  We went with one vanilla latte (my standard) and a Black and White latte which mixes dark and white chocolate.  Both were really amazing.

Another cool aspect is their little in house bakery.  On your way down the hall to the restrooms, you can sneak a peak at where they smelt up their decadent baked goods.  It looks so fun! I wanted to ask her if she needed any help!   Well, at least I got to take part in eating the final product...Peanut Butter Cookies!!Fabulous food!! I too am not a coffee drinker,  and I come for the real food. They serve fresh, tasty, imaginative salads, and wonderful soups. I've recently been here twice and had the spaghetti squash entree cooked in two different ways, both incredibly delicious. I dined with someone who ordered a fantastic steak, really tasty. They have a large selection of wonderful pastries.

They actually provide service after one has transacted their purchase at the counter. We felt like there was wait staff, and because tips have already been placed in the jar or added to a credit/debit card, these people aren't  just hoping for a bigger tip.

The ambiance is pretty close to perfection. Patrons working at a table make room for others, background music is nice, not annoying, the dinnerware is beautiful. (I just dined off of a plate from Anthropologie.) Close to museums, near the light rail ... My favorite place for any meal or beverage in Phoenix.I took my boyfriend out to a rare date-night dinner at Richardson's because it is right down the street from our apt. It was very dark, hard to read the menus, but was perfect for our semi-romantic dinner. He was wary at first, because of the construction (especially the wobbly wooden plank leading the front door), but it was definitely love at first bite for us! YUM!

We were sat at the bar immediately, and got to skip the 45 minute wait for a table. The place cleared out all at once at 8:30, good for next time so we can have the restaurant to ourselves. I had the red chile alfredo pasta, which I ordered just for the bacon-wrapped shrimp and was very happy (though full after 5 bites - super rich!) Mr. BF had a severe case of food-envy going on. Sooo good. 

My only wish was that there was a place to hang my coat, which was bulky enough on my lap to make eating neatly tricky, but other than that we will be returning without question. Oh and by the way...the male bartender is equally as quirky cute as the other!A grand mandarin dinner is refreshing for anyone seeking an authentic american chinese dinner. The chinese always do it better though and this place has the best looking waitresses in the crown jewel of the west. The serve delicious buffalo wings. Thats the american coming out, compliments to chef Billy. Confusioun says "A progressive meal even satisfies those who speek chinese"  If you order the chinese itch, beware.... aunt ling dai will have your liver itching for hours! WE love going here even if just for the scenary.If you're a native you'll enjoy this Mexican restaurant hotspot. If you are from out of town you might not get it.  For some reason in Arizona, these less aestheticly pleasing restaurants serve great Mexican food.

I get the same thing every time and it never gets old... chimi machaca...dam it's good!Reliable and good is the word that comes to mind. Always reliably good. Good (and large) Margaritas and martinis; reliably very tasty food (the robs are great, and so are the chicken dishes) and servers are very knowledgeable and well trained. The only negative if it is one at all is that the menu could be updated more often. I have been going to tommy bahama for years and the menu is pretty much the same it always has been. But that also means they still have my favorites there.Sitting at my favorite coffee house as I write this review. I'm not sure why I've waited so long to leave a review. They roast in house and have the most delicious coffee I've ever had. Lisa the owner is a gem, always smiling and happy to see you. I've been coming here since 2003 and even though I've moved across town, I will leave early just to come here for my soy latte. Trust me, it's worth the drive. It's a great atmosphere and also a great place to meet people.You can't beat the deal on Local Dines (http://bit.ly/dfR4eQ )!  A $40 certificate for $20.  This was my first visit to this location because I always used to go to the one on Mill.  I LOVED going there and it is a shame they aren't there anymore because the place had a great vibe to it and had excellent food.  This Bamboo club has the same great food, but you could tell the place is getting pretty old and needs some updating.  None of this mattered to me because I was there for one reason:  the orange beef with that crispy spinach.  Soooo frikking good.  Its like candy.  I also love the fried rice because it is full off good stuff.  The service is also pretty good as are the martini pours.  I will return hopefully soon.Da. Bomb.I really enjoyed my stay at the Stratosphere
   We had a magnificant time here at this hotel and of course the first thing we did, is hit that elevator baby and off to the top to enjoy that spectacular view.
   Wow, you walk to the edge...and there is a glass floor and you can look down and see the street.      We had some drinks at the Top of the World restaurant....mine was a 7up...waiter probably thought I was real cheap......well...sometimes I am....
    The restaurants are OK and we watched people going and coming from the rides..some scared...   I wasn't really interested in that....
    The rooms are OK and there like any other room on the casino strip.  The restaurants were good...but I actually like to look around Las Vegas Boulevard, eat at fancy restaurants.....This place has been called "The Best Thai Restaurant in North America." I'm not sure how this was determined, but the food is pretty delicious.  And, yes, you CAN get many items veganized here: the ala carte menu is a great place to get some veggie and/or tofu combinations, from Pad Prik King to Chili Mint, to green curry (one of my faves!).  Just be sure to tell them no fish sauce and ask about which curry bases are OK. (Sometimes red curry is made w/ shrimp paste).  The spicy vegetable soup is amazing and lives up to it's name! The phrase "I can't feel my lips anymore, but I can't stop eating this!" is commonly uttered.  You can actually get a few delicious dessert options here too! Sticky rice w/ mango, coconut ice cream (made w/ coconut milk FTW!), fried bananas.... all delish.

Bonus: they have Albarino(!!!!!) and Stone IPA on their drink menu, so I get my choice of two of my favourite bevvy's to complete my meal.  

They have recently expanded and about doubled their seating capacity, so it's easier than it used to be to get a table too!  I would recommend a reservation on a Fri or Sat.... but if it's packed you can always trot over to Komol for some excellent chow as well.

I will say this though -- I have been vegan about 7 years and don't stray from that.  I also generally try to encourage others to eat in a similar manner.  HOWEVER - when I take meat eaters to Lotus, I pretty much insist that they order off the Northern Thai menu.  Only one item on there doesn't have meat, but the dishes are very rarely found on American Thai menus... So just go for it already! If you're an adventurous eater, you'll probably love it.epic thai madness

Wins: deep fried whole lobster, green curry, riesling. 
Fails: noneThanks to my Brother, Chris, for his suggestion.  A wonderful meal.  This was a highlight.  The waitress suggested Tom Kah Kai  as a first course (#23 on the soup menu).  What a wonderful coconut mild based soup.  Sweet, sour, salty and spicy all competing for my palate.  I have never experienced such a complex tasting soup.  I would recommend this soup to everyone. 

Lotus of Siam gets top ratings.The location is in a funny side of town, but the food out beats it; their 12:00pm to 2 
:00pm all you can eat lunch buffet is quite the catch.I love Red Square and go there every time I go to Vegas. The attention to detail that went into designing this place is quite impressive. The decor is fashioned after and inspired by communist-era Russia and the bar is made out of dry ice. I have only consumed various vodka drinks here so cannot attest to the food, but they have an extensive caviar selection to pair with their vodka selection, which is vast. I usually get a straight, dry martini with some kind of high end russian vodka. This comes ice cold with a blue cheese stuffed olive at the bottom, soaking up all the booze. I have yet to do the vodka flight inside the subzero vodka freezer but that will be next on the agenda.Some of the best burgers around.  This place is located in the Shops at Mandalay Place, between Luxor and Mandalay Bay.  A totally unique burger menu where you can top your burger with pretty much anything under the sun.  If you are in the mood for a lobster tail or foie gras on your burger, they have it.  For the meat, you can choose from beef (they offer regular, Black Angus, and Kobe), lamb, turkey and veggie burger.  I actually prefer the turkey burger over the rest.  It comes out perfectly seasoned and so tender.  The beef and lamb are always great too.  After you pick your meat, you pick your bun type, your cheese type and then all the rest of your toppings.  My favorite concoction is a turkey burger served on an onion bun with American cheese, peppered bacon, and button mushrooms.  All the usual toppings such as lettuce, tomato, and onion come standard with all the burgers.  They make great fries here which come in both the skinny or thick varieties.  For something different, try their delicious zucchini fries.  They also have a big beer and drink selection here.  If you are lucky enough to sit at a booth, they are equipped with flat panel televisions.  The service has always been great here.  I have never been here when there was not a wait, but the wait is usually only 10 or 15 minutes and there are plenty of nearby shops to browse around while you wait.i go vegas every year and i have to eat burger bar everytime i go. i hate eatin burgers, but not when i go to burger bar. it's the best burgers i ever had. the sweet potato fries are the best! u can also build ur own burger too.I am a big Vegas fan and have been there more than I have places around where I live. I do not eat red meat or pork as I have mentioned before so I thrive on turkey burgers.  Finding a good turkey burger is a pretty hard thing to do, let me tell you. Most are frozen patty's that taste like cardboard.  Burger bar is situated inside of the amazing hotel/casino Mandalay Bay and is a great spot to hang out with some friends and have a couple drinks with your meal.  It is a neat menu where you choose everything you want from your burger with the type of bun and what you want on top.  Like I said I always get the turkey burger and it is a very good size, and juicy not dry like many others.  The downfalls are that you have to pay for each individual topping and the sides that you want with it.  You have your choice of fat steak fries, skinny fries, zucchini fries (my favorite) and some others.  I have a hard time choosing between the three so every time I go I usually rotate them.  I have never had a bad experience with the food nor the service.  The atmosphere is great (first of all its Vegas!). I love hockey so during the winter months they usually have a game on with their many TVs (located in every booth and some overhead at the bar), They have a full bar and some good beers on tap (blue moon always a fave).  I love it here and every time I go to Vega$ which has been happening a lot I have to go at least once if not more.  They are opened late (I believe 2am on the weekends) so when you are fed up at losing at the casinos, or drunk from gambling too much at the tables,  come here and give it a try!I can definitely go back to Burger Bar right now! I am still thinking and drooling about it as I write this. The last time we were at Vegas, we couldn't find this place for some reason but we were adamant this time and found it.

At first, I thought it was just another burger joint as The Counter but Burger Bar is much better in every way. The service was great and the food was sooooo GOOD!

I ordered the Atlantic Salmon burger ($8.50) on a wheat bun and added on spinach and avocado. The burger already comes with red onions, lettuce, tomato, and a pickle as basics. The add-ons cost a little more but for all that, it came to be like 10 something. The salmon was cooked to moist, tender and juicy and everything complimented the flavors very well. Since I am not going back to Vegas anytime soon, I am definitely going to make this at home.

Of course, I can't have a burger without fries! We ordered a side of sweet potato fries and their buttermilk fried zucchinis. The sweet potato fries has the right crispiness without the grease. It could have used a little more seasoning but I was okay with it. On the other hand, the buttermilk zucchinis was seasoned to perfection with a slight crunch and the perfect crispness. (Oh my..I want more now!)

This was a great experience at the Burger bar and it is an A + in my book.I had been wanting to go to Burger Bar in Vegas since the first time I went three years ago. In October, my husband and I finally sat down at the bar and had our burgers at Mandalay Place.

That's when I ordered the best milkshake in the world. It's the Black and White Cookie milkshake. It was like Ben and Jerry's Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough ice cream, but better. It was orgasmic. I was dying over this milkshake. It probably was 1,500 calories, but damn if it wasn't worth it.

Since my husband and I are pescetarian, you would think that a burger place wouldn't be as capable of handling us. Not so at Burger Bar! I ordered the most incredible salmon burger, cooked to perfection. My husband ordered the vegan option, which was two amazing portobello mushroom caps with tons of veggies in the middle. Not only was it incredible to see a vegan option at a major restaurant, but it was a very tasty option. 

The fries were eh, but the next time I am ordering the zucchini fries. They looked amazing. The line outside looked super-long, but I give full credit to Hubert Keller for taking something as common as hamburgers and milkshakes and elevating them to levels of perfection that you never thought they could reach.One of the best burgers I've ever had. Being able to select the type of meat, bun and toppings, it came out exactly the way I wanted.
The patties are extra thick and everything was very fresh. We had the fry sampler and I really liked the basil aioli.
They have a big selection of milkshakes, some with alcohol. My husband had the Twinkie milkshake and said that whoever had created it was a genius. I guess that's a pretty good review!
This place is expensive as far as burgers go (we spent $80 for two) but the quality is so good that we'll be back.As Food Network fans, we wanted to check this place out. The set up of the restaurant is really well done. It's spacious and inviting. We were sat up at the top in the back of the restaurant where we could see everything which was very nice. Ordered the Tiger Shrimp +Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale as our appetizer. While it was incredibly good, it is small for the price. The entrees though... oh the ENTREES! I had the Ancho Chile- Honey Glazed Salmon (mouth watering delectible!), my husband had the Coffee Spice Rubbed Rotisserie Filet Mignon (he still talks about it and the sauce!) and my friend had the much loved New Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin (out of this world!) Best part was since she was newly pregnant, I got the chance to eat what was left on her plate, yes, even after eating my entire meal! We finished off with dessert which I believe was a flourless chocolate cake. Decadent!!! And I must add that the service was extraordinary. Another friend was trying to mess with the waiter by asking him to bring him bottles of beer that had a SPECIFIC date stamped on them and the server happily accomodated his insane requests! In between this craziness, he checked on us frequently and the plates were removed quickly & easily. I plan to always eat here whenever I'm in the area!Quite possibly my favorite restaurant in the country, next to Mesa Grill in NYC.

Ok, so I've only been here once, but it was memorable.  The food was outstanding and no other high-end restaurant in Vegas embraces the idea of being in a casino (Caesar's no less) rather than trying to hide from it.

I also won big points from my boss for suggesting this place to him when he was in town for a conference.Dinner was amazing!   We have also eaten at Emeril's New Orleans Fish House, which was good, but Mesa Grill was AMAZING!  In the celebrity chef throw down, Bobby Flay beat Emeril hands down!  

The decor was upscale approachable.  You could wear nice jeans and a nice shirt and feel comfortable here.  I only wish it were not right in the casino.  Although the restaurant is beautifully decorated with nice details, if you look  beyond the glass windows, you could see the betting monitors.  Mesa Grill needs a better location...maybe in the Forum near Spago's where the view is much nicer. 

My friend and I started with Blue Corn Lobster Tacos appetizer.   The order gives three mini tacos, but wow!  Those little guys are packed with flavor!!  I could eat 20 of those!  Not for that price though.  Haha.

We each ordered an entree and splitted them.  My Coffee-Rubbed Filet Mignon was spectacular.  It was cooked perfectly, melt in your mouth tender, and so full of depth from the coffee rub.  The mushroom-ancho chili sauce was the perfect rustic accompaniment with its rich, deep flavors.

My friend's entree of New Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin was out of this world!  I have never eaten a pork tenderloin like that.  It was still pretty pink, but I trusted that Bobby Flay knew what he was doing and wouldn't give me salmonella.  Well, I'm glad I went for it, because that pork was as tender as the filet mignon.  I seriously could not tell the difference in tenderness between the too.

For dessert, we shared the Chocolate Pretzel Tart.  For me, the best part of that dessert was the spicy peanut butter ice cream that came with it.  The heat was not a smack in the face type of heat, but rather a slow warm heat in the back of your throat.  The tart was a pretzel cylinder with a pool of chocolate sauce.  In the "moat" was what tasted like a flourless chocolate cake.  Delicious!  

Overall, what I really liked was Bobby  Flay's command of spices.  If something was described as spicy, it was always a deliberately controlled amount of spiciness that just slowly warmed the back of your throat and lingered.  it was a beautiful orchestration of flavors blending into a perfect symphony.   Truly amazing.Easily my favorite place to eat in Madison.  Great Lao-Thai food.  Curries are fantastic and make sure to start with a soup.  They're always good.  Tip: place is tiny and you will wait.  Either get carry out or head across the street to the Weary Traveler to grab a beer while you wait for your table.Kick arse brunch

Only suggestion is that they carry a small selection of single malt whiskeys (Laphroaig, Caol Ila, Talisker, Glenlivet, etc).This review might be more towards the artist that performed, than the actual venue.

Now that's not meant to take anything from the venue, because it's great. It's not overly big, so sound gets trapped in and reverberates off the wall very well. 

It's not a good venue for any acoustic bands, but any hard-rocking, electrifying bands will absolutely blow this place up!

Oh yeah, and I was here to see Fall Out Boy, as a part of the Yahoo on the Road promotional tours. 

I never got to see any of my favorite bands in middle school, because something about getting all As and studying, blah blah blah... Anyways, I was finally able to live out my childhood dream, albeit 8 years later, but I had an amazing time here.

They played all of their old school jams (Dance Dance, Sugar We're Going Down) intervened with some classics (I Don't Care, Thanks for the Memories) along with their new stuff (Light Them Up).

They gave a great performance, and unlike most bands, really put the attention on their attendees. They made us feel like we were part of the show, and induced some pretty serious fist pumping and head bopping. 

What a great, great way to reminisce about my childhood :)Best selection of beers in Madison!!Stopped in late (8:45) but I had to come here!  Had the Arugala salad and roasted chicken breast. Delicious!  And the waitress suggested a great pairing of the Sauvignon Blanc. Set the meal off perfectly!Adore (and miss!) this place. I used to work v. close to EE and ate lunch there on a daily basis. Everything is very fresh with lots of great choices. I didn't eat in often but it's a great atmosphere to just sit and chill or to get some work done.The.best.breakfast.in.town.

Thanks bye.

Okay to elaborate a bit - no matter what you order here for breakfast, it's going to be awesome.  And don't look for menu's - the eats are up on the wall, silly.  And it doesn't matter what time of day it is, order a milkshake.  I guarantee you ten dollars it'll be the best one you've ever had (the kind that they serve to you still in the freezing cold tin cup with a big long spoon).

*Tip:  if you are smart you will PLAN to go to Mickie's and you will be there early, and not on a football weekend.  Otherwise you will be standing in line, most likely outside in the cold, for a long, long time.  Take it from me.  -30 degrees on a rumbling, empty stomach in January isn't really that much fun.In college we had a monthly tradition of going to Mickies on a Friday morning, ordering scramblers and then overcoming a looming food comatose in class. You can feel the tradition in this place going back decades, with generations of UW students who have had their breakfast here.

Alongside Camp Randall football, Union Terrace euchre, farmer's market saturdays, and jogging out to picnic point, Mickies Dairy Bar is one of my favorite memories from student life in Madison.

Just one note though - they only take cash so visit the ATM beforehand.I have been coming to AZ 88 for years now!  I can not come to Phoenix and not come here.  Great atmosphere, great food and drinks!  One of the best cheeseburgers I have ever had (The Cheeseburger).  Another great item on the menu is the Hot Pepper Chicken!  AMAZING!Didn't try the pizza but the pasta was delicious. I got the plate-sized ravioli, yummm! The pizza cookie dessert was one of the best things I've ever eaten in my life. Makes me wish I lived in Arizona.Awesome food. Awesome service. Great Price. Scottsdale treasure!Los Sombreros is one of my favorite restaurants in the valley. The food is always just perfect. The prices are extremely reasonable. I modeled my own guacamole recipe after theirs, it's that good. Try the specials of the day, they're always great. 

The service has been a little hit & miss for me. Most of the time they're fine. There's this one woman who is extremely unfriendly. I think she just doesn't like me :-) But ya know, with food & ambiance like this, it doesn't bother me if I occasionally end up with a cranky server!you cannot go wrong at zia. brought hubs there because he's huge on old school punk and so i knew he would be able to find some gems at zia.  good for zia, bad for our bank account-we left there $200 bucks lighter, and that's even with the awesome guy at the counter telling us about some reward program where you get points and it helps you get cds half off or whatever (the guy figured it out for us cuz he was AWESOME).  we got like 23 cds or something tho, so obviously it was a good deal oh, i got two of my friends some gifts from there too-zia is a good place for random fun gifts. we had to buy 2 cds new ( i HAD to replace my mudvayne cd for the ride back to cali!) and it was cool they had those in stock.Bellagio hotel is one of the nicest hotels in Vegas. I have stayed here a few times, and my most recent stay was last week. The staff continue to be very attentive and wonderful. Reserving a lakeview room or a one or two bedroom suite that overlooks the lake is a plus! The pools are dreamy and gorgeous, and you do need to get out there pretty early on the weekends to get a lounge chair. 

The hotel also has a wonderful art gallery (Bellagio Gallery of Fine Art), a great selection of restaurants (Circo, Fix, Yellowtail, etc) and wonderful shopping. Their show "O" is pretty amazing also- that is a must see! 

It's just a very classy, upscale place and one of the best places to stay at!Bellagio was originally named Beau Rivage but, the name was later changed to Bellagio. It's a beautifully water themed resort Inspired by the Lake Como resort of Bellagio in Italy. It's most notable feature is the 8 acre lake between the building and the Strip, which houses the Fountains of Bellagio, a large dancing water fountain synchronized to music. See my review of the fountains for more info on it. 

Bellagio was conceived by Steve Wynn and built by his company, Mirage Resorts, Inc. following the purchase and demolition of the Dunes hotel and casino in 1993. Bellagio was designed by DeRuyter Butler and Atlandia Design. Bellagio opened October 15, 1998 and had a construction cost of $1.6 billion. 

In 2000 it became a MGM Mirage property when Mirage Resorts was sold to MGM Grand Inc. for $6.4 billion by Steve Wynn to create MGM Mirage. After the sale of Mirage Resorts Steve Wynn started a new company, Wynn Resorts. 

All in all I love Bellagio! It was Steve Wynn's crowning achievement until Wynn Las Vegas was built. The atmosphere, fountains, food, shopping and service are all 5 stars. Tons of great shopping like Armani, Chanel, Dior, Fendi, Gucci, Prada, Tiffany and YSL in Via Bellagio! I have never stayed there so I can't compare the rooms but the hotel and casino are almost neck and neck with Wynn Las Vegas and that's saying alot!. Forget Aria and the rest of City Center and stay either here, Wynn or Encore. You'll have a great time. 

I have added a picture of Steve Wynn's original concept for Beau Rivage which later became the Bellagio. 

Insider tip: Check will the hotel concierge for times but, you can go on a free tour of all of the different rooms types at Bellagio daily around 3pm. And you don't need to be a hotel guest to go on the tour.Saw "O" and was thoroughly entertained.  Got our tickets on line as part of their dinner/drink package and saved money!

It's always WORTH a special trip to see the water show out front in the fountains and THE FABULOUS seasonal displays in the garden.  They are creative and wonderful.  I've visited at Christmas and again this Fall.  There were giant cornucopia's, horses and a talking tree just to name a few of the highlights.  It's a wonderful family photo opportunity.Had a fountain premier room and definitely worth it! Loved watching the fountains during the day and at night. The room was exceptionally clean and well decorated. My favorite hotel to stay in Vegas. The only negative that comes to mind is the checking in process. The lines were extremely long and very slow to check in.Stay there.  Great customer service, great experience.  Beautiful all around and I have to say I don't want to stay anywhere else ever again.

Plus it was probably icing on the cake that I left UP $150 when I was gambling.We've stayed here many times and it is always superb. People think that it's expensive - and it can be, but in the off-season, we get deals for $119. a night! Quiet and classy, we always like returning here, especially after being in the noisier hotels. In the summer, the pools are outstanding, and the gym is tops year around.It's been a few years, and when I went, Bellagio was THEE place to stay in Vegas. 

I had the fortune of a friend treating me to the stay while we were in town for the WSOP. From the moment we walked in, it was clear that this was a masterpiece of Las Vegas. The feel, the atmosphere, everything was first class. The hand blown glass tulips in the lobby are breathtaking. There is an air of classiness to this place that seems lacking in other casinos (not all of them) on the strip. Bellagio feels like it runs at a slower, more deliberate pace. The staff were first class and very professional. 

The room itself made you want to stay and appreciate it. Everything from the fully stocked wet bar, to the view, to the absolutely gorgeous bathroom with steam shower and hot tub, to the most comfortable beds just made the Bellagio steal the show. The view of the strip is awesome. There is so much to do in the hotel/casino that you could really just stay there; lots of high end shops, restaurants, salon & day spa, etc. can fill your day with activities.

Fortunately, I had been to Vegas twice prior to staying here so I could justify just hanging out and taking in as much as I could. Everything about the Bellagio is just dripping with elegance. I know that now, it is considered one of the "older" hotels on the strip, but that does not make it any less appealing. At night time, it is always an experience to go take in one of the fountain shows. 

Yeah, it's pricey, but it's doable if you're visiting off-season and work your magic on the internet to book a room with them. The room service is flawless. 

On the casino floor, they are very aggressive to make sure you have drinks while you are gaming and even if you are not. I came down the elevators early one morning around 5:45am to grab a newspaper and a coffee. A very attractive young waitress approached me as I walked out of and asked me if she could get me a drink. I told her I was just looking for some coffee and a newspaper. She told me she would go get me one and asked me if I would like Bailey's with it, to which I happily accepted. I wandered over and grabbed a newspaper, and she was waiting for me with not one, but two cups of coffee with lids on them.

Bellagio will always hold a special place in my heart. Great memories and I hope to be back one day. Without hesitation, 5 stars.$285 for 2 nights and 3 days for me and my hubby to stay in a suite.

We stayed in the spa suite and loved it so damn  much. I was so sad that we did not stay there for a week. We went during the summer time when it was blazing hot. luckily we had a decent size spa tub that could fit the two of us along with my two year old. Our room was big, over looking the roller coaster & the strip. At night, we'd lounged in the spa tub in warm water (since it was hot) & turn on the bubbles. My daughter loved it so much! Being in vegas does not mean you have to gamble, drink, and party. Heck, i'm 21. It was my first time in Vegas & I truly had a blast. I think it was because being in our suite made things feel so relaxing. Can't wait to go back to the New York New York again!

BTW, we also had a special deal with our hotel room purchase. We received a free buffet for the 2 of us at any of the participating hotels :DFor the love of God (if such a thing existed): Eat. Here.

Don't go here for just sushi or tempura, which are all excellent. Go here for the chef's creations.

A meal here at least once a year is in my prenuptial.

If you cannot afford to eat here, seriously consider a loan. Seriously.This review is long overdue.  Every time we visit Las Vegas, Nobu is a must for us.  The service, ambiance, drinks, and food get a A+.  We always get the cod miso, it is to die for.So amazing. The place was beautiful and the staff was very friendly and helpful. My friend and I stayed for 3 nights for $369 total. The buffet was pretty good and so was the cafe. It is on a fun piece of the strip right across from a movie theater and within walking distance of so many of the iconic Vegas sights. I had an amazing stay here and next time I go to Vegas this is where I will be booking my room.This show was absolutely AMAZING! I would definitely go one hundred more times! Always giving you a laugh! They interact with the audience and bringing people up on stage putting them on the spot which everyone gets a kick out of. Everyone has a good time during the show. Never wanted it to end! Awsome acts by them also!I really liked this show! It was sexy and provocative and very, very cool. The acrobatics were melded into the story line in an interesting way, and even though it was a variety show format, I felt there was a great deal of coheasion among the acts. The dancers where beautiful and interesting to watch, the acrobats impressive. There's quite a bit of nudity and if you're prudish, you might be put off by some of the implications on stage, but it was a great show.10 randomly selected reasons to stay at the Venetian:

1. Super comfortable bed
2. All the rooms are suites = lots of extra room
3. 3 TVs (kind of unnecessary, but when else will you have a TV in every room, including the john?)
4. Huge bathroom with:
5. 2 sinks AND separate vanity
6. Bathtub AND separate shower
7. Bouchon Bakery is downstairs for a sweet treat
8. Clean!
9. Blackout curtains - a must in Vegas
10. Very helpful and kind concierge

Definitely worthy of 5 stars!The venetian is beyond amazing. If you can get a good travel package it can be absolutely worth your time.

In addition to that, the rooms are awesome, and the location is great - you're at the beginning of the strip and the strip is walkable, so that makes things incredibly convenient. The rooms have fantastic views of the sunrise/sunset too.

Service is fast. We had a problem with our showerhead leaking and they came up to fix it in an hour or so. Same thing with extra towels.

While the hotel deserves a 5, the venetian (stores) deserve a 2. Every store in that venetian "little italy" shopping area is a: incredibly pushy and b: typically overpriced (unless it's retail in which price might be normal for Chicago).

These people are more pushy than folks at a flea market and try to fleece you just as fast. It's a total tourist trap and while the food and restaurants are excellent, the gondola ride and fake ceiling are both cheesy and confusing on your body, respectively.

When you're walking back to your room at 2am and you' re in a well lit area made to look like daytime and it's buzzing with activity, it tends to throw off your internal sensors like a bear in hibernation being out of hibernation mid-winter.I absolutely love this hotel! It is now my home away from home in Las Vegas! 

I just recently stayed in one of their Bella Suites with a few of my girls, and experienced the best service ever! All of the employees are wonderful, and treat you like royalty. I especially love how they give personalized service. For example, whenever I called for more towels, they would say, "Good afternoon Ms. Lee, how can i help you today? ..... Alright no problem, is there anything else i can get you Ms. Lee?" 

Besides the top notch service, The Venetian is located in a great spot if you're looking to hit up the nightclubs at Encore, Wynn, or inside The Venetian. You can save, by just walking over as opposed to spending money on a cab. The pool and jacuzzis are also very nice. There are also multiple jacuzzis if you want your own for your group. 

There are many food choices inside the hotel / casino. My favorite is Grand Lux Cafe for a quick lunch or dinner; their burgers are the best and they're also open 24/7. And definitely join the Grazie club if you're going to gamble. As a perk for being a new member, I got $25 free slot credit to play with! 

All in all, you may pay a bit more to stay in The Venetian, but it is definitely worth it for the primo location on the strip as well as outstanding service. I will definitely be staying here again!This is the only place you want to stay while in Vegas.  Great service, a plethora of restaurants, shops and ohhhh did I mention the huge casino?  One tip, call the hotel and ask for better rates.  Online the rate was 179.99 and we booked a huge room for 129.99.What else can I add to the hundreds of great reviews?  Stay in the Venezia tower, and traverse the grand hallway.  I do mean grand!  Eat at Bouchon and have pastries at bouchon bakery kiosk.  Go in the hot tubs at night.....yes they are super heated!On our first trip to Vegas, we stayed at the Golden Nugget.  Very nice, but VERY far away from everything.  As we explored Vegas we came upon the Mirage and decided when we returned that we would definitely stay there.  We stayed in the "gold" elevator section.  Absolutely worth the few extra bucks.  The pool is incredible.  Buffet was "good".  It's central location on the strip is hard to surpass.   I prefer the Paris buffet, but if you don't feel like trekking, the Mirage one is not bad.   No matter how many big, knock your socks off casinos they add, the Mirage will always have a special place in my heart.This is s my all time favorite hotel. Mlife has me as a lifetime customer now. I used to always stay at Caesars properties until staying here. The staff is just amazingly friendly and helpful.  The view from out room was of the strip and the volcano.  The room itself was oure luxury.  I do not have a single bad thing to say about this property.  Love itDelmonico's is easily a 5-star restaurant, but not because there is a famous name (Emeril Lagasse) associated with the restaurant -- but because the food is simply exceptional. This is fine dining without the pretentiousness of stuffy, overpriced, mini-portion restaurants. 

We happened to be staying at the Venetian Hotel & Casino and made reservations to Delmonico's, which is on the premises. There was about a 1-minute wait and we were quickly whisked away to a candlelit table. The restaurant itself is very simple yet elegant; nothing over the top, flashy or obnoxious. The lighting is perfect; not too dark and the wait staff is extremely attentive and prompt.

Delmonico's is known for their steak; the bone-in rib eye steak. This slab of meat is prime and comes with a nice price tag. If you're at Delmonico's -- ya might as well go for it, chump!

For starters, I had the Lobster Bisque Soup; thick, creamy and packed with flavor. I absolutely loved it! Best Lobster Bisque I have ever had. It came adorned with a polenta type cake in the middle. I am not sure if it was polenta or dried shrimp cake -  or even bread, but it didn't matter as it all happily made its way down my belly. 

We also tried the crab meat cake; fresh chunks of crab atop a puff pastry and dressed with tomatoes, lima beans, asparagus and all sorts of good spring veggies. Amazing! 

I decided to try the Rack of Lamb with the Twice Baked Potatoes. Jeff went with the Rib Eye Steak and Baked Potato. The Lamb was head-spinning! Topped with a rich sauce and truffles! Perfectly cooked and moist and tender and gaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh! I can't rave enough. The steak was just as good -- even the fatty pieces were delicious. 

The food, the service, the atmosphere, the attention to detail, the $25 corking fee -- all was worth the price. Definitely a place to experience while out in SIN CITY!My very favorite steak. It would be my last meal on earth if served with a well aged cab.No matter what, you can always count on The Palm to do things perfectly.  Service, food, drinks, wine - everything was great.  Again.  We frequent The Palm in Chicago, DC and Vegas and have NEVER had a single problem.  In Vegas, try to sit "outside" and watch the hilarious Vegas crowd wander by.  This may not be the best steakhouse in Vegas, but it is consistently amazing...you can not go wrong eating here,The Palm is the industry standard; awesome food and professional wait staff.I must say the greatest hotel experience I have recently add in my life was at the MGM Grand. I went this past weekend for a special yelp themed Spring Break event. The instant I arrived at the hotel I was was received and treated extremely well. I asked for an upgrade at the registration desk and the person who was checking me, told me she would talk to her manager. The manager came out, properly introduced herself and told me we had several upgrades available, the first one they tried to offer was their recently renovated suites, which she showed me images of in their catalog. I almost took it, but then inquired about the other suite - the properly named Celebrity Suite. The Celebrity suite was about 650 square feet, has a hot tub and a king sized bed with an awesome view overlooking the Vegas strip. She sold me at hot tub. They even were nice enough to waive my resort fee, since I was not planning to use the wi-fi or use other services.

When I entered the room I was in love, it was everything they mentioned and so much more as visions of hot tub parties danced in my head. For the two days me and my buddy ED A stayed at the hotel, we were treated like royalty as each day we were given bottles of champagne and given awesome thank you cards.

The hotel boasts also several pools, with Wet Republic being the most popular. The pool I must say was an awesome experience as well, with several spectacular views and the djs spinning classic club bangers. 

Finally the staff was great from the receptionist, to the manager, the cleaning people and the Parking attendant, who assisted me greatly when I couldnt find my parking ticket. 

Overall the MGM Grand was a masterful experience, and I would totally stay their again.The MGM never disappoint$. :)Ahh, yes, the Double Down. The iconic punk bar of Las Vegas and beyond. There's bands almost every night. There's always a good crowd of people hanging out and, even though your shoes may stick to the ground, the drinks are good and cheap. If you have a band, play here. Not only is it fun but they pay you and give you free drinks. The parking does suck though and don't park your car too far away because our gear (yeah, it sucked a Gretch guitar 'n rad amp) got jacked last time we played there. major bummer. This place is still one of the best bars in Vegas though!We got a panoramic view in our room, which was great, we could see the strip, and the mountains. Our room was spacious enough for the two of us. The king bed was very comfortable. Bathroom was simple but clean. Having a safe and mini fridge in the room was nice. Hotel staff was very nice to deal with, and made our stay comfortable. Really no complaints. Hotel's casino was conviently linked to the fashion show mall.The best service and the most outstanding filet and salmon!
Such a treat to find a unique restaurant that is in the heart of the tourist crowd. We will definitely go back when we're in town!!!Oh mon ami! I wish I still spoke/remembered high school French! Or even better...I wished I was in France. Alas, Mon Ami Gabi will do. This petit French restaurant sitting outside - where else?!! - at the Paris Hotel!!! DUH!

My friends and I made reservation thru Open Table and were seated at our reserved time. We were smack centered in the patio (half-way outside) facing the Bellagio's water show. I'm sure it's even more spectacular at night. If you prefer to dine here for dinner, do make reservations!!!

Now to breakfast/brunch ...there's nothing better than eggs benedicts (YAY POACHED EGGS!!!) with crab...which is why I was SO HAPPY I went here for brunch. I LOVE crab benedicts, which seems to be a popular dish since one of my friend's ordered it too - what a copy cat! Although, I think it was best she ordered her own because honestly, I wouldn't want to share :). My other friend ordered the steak. It looked good, but he did not want to share either. After we gave the waiter our order, he complimented us that we had made a good choice and asked if we had been there before. Nope, Mon Ami Gabi virgins - we just Yelp a lot.

Verdict: My Crab Egg Benedicts were YUM! Loved them! If it was served for dinner, i would still order it :)Me and hubby came for dinner one night when we went to Vegas. The food was amazing, tasty and decadent. Had a beautiful view of the Bellagio fountains across the street and a romantic atmosphere. Must haves: french onion soup and salmon.Love this place. Went here 3 years in a row for my birthday. Free parking at Paris garage. I always get the Filet Mignon.I should probably point out that my trip to Mon Ami Gabi was a bit atypical.  A lot of reviews noted how long the wait was to get a table, but the five of us were fortunate enough to get seated outside immediately.  While that might have been luck, I'm sure when we were there had something to do with it too - a Monday morning in early February.  Had we been there on a weekend during the summer or spring break instead, it would have been a very different story...and possibly a very different review.

Although nothing we had really amazed (except the baguettes...so good!), I thought the food was pretty solid overall (four stars is about right).  Since my friend and I both wanted to try the Sea Scallop Gratinées, we decided to share an order while I went with the Croque Monsieur for myself.

- Sea Scallop Gratinées (sea scallops with caramelized fennel, onion marmalade, and mussel cream) (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw?select=mAWQUpEJV5oBmFBVS95EbA) - the scallops were pretty standard, but I really liked the mussel cream, onion, and fennel.  Despite how good it was, I'm not sure I would get it again since I feel like I can find something comparable in SF.
- Croque Monsieur (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw?select=uHua_ESHqRFwEwM6xZ-KUQ) - pretty damn tasty.  Unlike others I've tried, there was a nice balance between the gruyere and crème fraiche.  The corners of the bread were a little hard and dry, but it's a pretty minor quibble.  And the fries?  Delicious.

What made me give them five stars though were their baguettes (yes, that good...http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw?select=NoliktR7IHC8B3EkaJBwiQ) and the service.  Our waitress was terrific - accommodating, friendly, and checked on our table quite often.  What stood out though was how honest she was.  When I asked her about the soup du jour (soup of the day - cream of garlic), she actually recommended I skip it since she thought it was pretty salty.  I passed as she suggested, but she was nice enough to bring out a espresso cup of the soup anyways so I could see for myself...and she was right.  Not sure if many other servers would have done the same thing.

Considering it's The Strip, the lunch prices seemed relatively fair, but I can't say if the same is true for their dinner menu.  Still, the view alone might be worth the money.  With the Bellagio right across the street, I imagine it's pretty awesome to watch their water shows while you eat.  That is, assuming it's on while you're there.  It wasn't for us...Vegas tradition for boyfriend and I to eat here every Vegas trip! :)

They have never disappointed me with food. EVER. 

HOWEVER the last time I went with my boyfriend, I got a horrible waiter who was obnoxiously rude and just didn't seem like he really enjoyed his job. Although I love the food and I'm never scared to throw down the bills here because I'm always satisfied, the servers need to keep in mind that a lot of people going are expecting top service. C'mon your a restaurant right in front of the bellagio show, on the strip with patio seating. Show customers a little decency here.... be nice or at least come when we obviously want to order or need something... 

ANYWAYS enough about him...

escargot- yum
salmon- yum
steak- yum
ALL the desserts - DELICIOUS
croque monsieur- yum
au poivre- yum

I can go on forever... if your in vegas, stop by and give this place a try! u won't regret it!I think this has become my new favourite spot to eat in Vegas. From start to finish, the whole experience was 5 stars!

I had made a reservation for 9pm, and we were advised that if we wanted a table outside (which we did) that there may be a wait. So we headed to the Paris about 40 minutes before our reservation time. I spoke to hostess and requested a table on the patio, and asked if we could try to get a table fairly up front and centered, so we'd have a good view of the Bellagio and the fountains. She said she would do her best. Half an hour later, we were being shown to our table by an incredibly friendly hostess who made conversation, and didn't just take us to our table like sheep. 

Our table was perfect! Right up front and dead center. We were able to people watch, and the fountains at the Bellagio really helped set the scene for a romantic dinner on our last night in Vegas. 

Our server was attentive, but not overly so. Knew the menu, knew the specials, and was able to make recommendations. Friendly but not in your face. Efficient but not cold. 

The food was perfect. We started with the onion soup and warm brie, both were gone within minutes. Be forewarned, however... the onion soup is not the onion soup you find at your average American restaurant. A nice big crouton, plenty of melted cheese, and that slight sweetness that you should have in a good onion soup. The brie was ridiculously good. Melted and gooey, drizzled with a peppered honey, and whole cloves of roasted garlic. The baguette they bring you to start is warm, crusty on the outside, soft on the inside, and the butter is soft and spreadable (HUGE brownie points for that!). 

We both went for the steak frittes: my partner getting the steak au poivre, with the peppered sauce, and I ended up getting the bourdelaise and the bernaise sauce on the side, because I couldn't decide which I wanted. Both were amazing, but I ended up pouring the light, slightly lemony bernaise on to my steak, which was perfectly rare and melt-in-your-mouth tender. The frittes were thin and cooked perfectly. We shared a side of ratatouille, that had incredible flavour and complemented the steaks perfectly. 

A perfect end to our trip.Good food, great service, outstanding views! 

I've come here every time I've been to Vegas and have tried every possible meal from breakfast to a late dinner. The best time to enjoy Gabi's is at nighttime: the Bellagio fountains will be going off every 20 or so minutes, the Strip will be packed, and the patio cool and pleasant even in the summer months. However it can get crowded in the evening so if you want to sit outside be prepared to wait for 20 or so minutes and get a reservation in advance. I've come here with a friend once without reservations and was told there would be more than an hour wait to get a seat anywhere on a Saturday night. Since the restaurant is so versatile it's hard to recommend 1 or 2 dishes in particular so it's probably best to list the highlights by meal:
Breakfast: Croque Madame or the Quiche Lorraine. Help yourself to some champagne too, it's Vegas
Lunch: Chilled zapacho, Seafood Crepe, and the Trout Amandine are all great. On Friday they serve an Australian cod which is brilliant
Brunch: Do yourself a favor and order a French 75. It's no longer on the menu but they make the best in town. Add in the Eggs Benedict and it'll rival Bouchon for the best French-themed brunch in Vegas.
Dinner: The Seafood Platter is the best deal for an appetizer. 50 dollars for a whole lobster, oysters, tuna tartare, shrimp and even more. Follow that up with the Steak Bearnaise or Roquefort and finish up with profiteroles accompanied by cognac. Be careful: the calories will add up but it will have been well worth it.best view and best atmosphere on the strip from paris hotel.  very friendly staff and waiters.  i was in vegas with a friend and we dined at many places but this was our favorite for the location and price.  i love theie french onion soup with melting thick  cheese.  their steaks are delicious.  you must try this place when you visit vegasLove Mon Ami Gabi!

Great for brunch and a mimosa or a nice dinner out.  I would highly recommend sitting in the patio area along the strip.  Great for people watching and the Bellagio fountain water show.  Last few Vegas trips I've made it a point to come here instead of trying new places.

Breakfast is really good. Also very happy with dinner as well.  They have a fully stocked bar.  It's a busy place but the service doesn't suffer.  I would rate the food 4.5 stars but the location and ambience and how it's in the middle of everything bumps it up to 5 stars.They didn't have breakfast (served until 11) the last time I came here.  How very French of them, but they caved in to fatty American dreams, and, I've got to say it was probably the best decision they've ever made.

You've GOT to try it!  I ordered the Eggs Florentine and it was aaammmaaaazzziiinnnggggg.  They make their own English muffins and the Hollandaise was not overpowering like it usually is in other places.  Eggs were perfectly poached, and it came with a side of hash browns, which were crisped to perfection and seasoned well (had some caramelized onions tucked away in there too).  

If you don't have a reservation, you'll probably have to wait in line, but we had a party of three and the line moved pretty quickly.  They get fairly busy, and the service is so-so.  But the benedicts are superb :)Just always awesome!!!! I love it!!! It's now become a tradition for me when I come to Vegas, its a must go! Enjoy people! I do every time!!!!! Oh and the hash for breakfast...AMAZING!! :)I was a bit hesitant to try this place at first because of my awful experiences over at Sugar Factory (also in the Paris), however I'm glad I decided to come here!  

My first visit I got:
-Escargots de Bourgogne: snails seasoned with a tasty green garlic sauce, served on a sizzling plate
-Filet Mignon Merlot : steak was about 8-10 oz. and had a delicious sauce with it
-Frites: side that comes with the steak, they are basically thinly sliced french fries which complimented my steak quite well!
-Frangria: their take of sangria and each glass only costs about $5.50...just get it

My second visit I got:
-Escargots de Bourgogne again
-Bacon Wrapped Pork Tenderloin (Special): comes with mashed potatoes and an apple and fennel salad, the entire plate was delicious 
-Steak Au Poivre:  (boyfriend's dish) very generous serving of a flattened steak seasoned with peppercorn, also very good
-Frangria again

The service was excellent and everyone was friendly.  If you decide to come here just make sure you book a reservation because the wait here can be long (patio seating is first come first serve).I love love love this fancy little French bistro. I've sat inside before which has a nice, dimly-lit, and intimate atmosphere when you don't mind a little bit of surrounding noise from other tables. The best seating though is on the patio where you get a nice view of the Bellagio fountains and just a splendid ambiance overall. 

The bread basket is delicious. I think the bread they serve is one of the most important determining factors as to whether or not you will get a great meal. I have tried the Escargots de bourgogne. I wasn't sure how I'd feel about it, but it was actually really good! It was seasoned with garlic-herb butter. For dinner I had the Steak au poivre. It was nothing less than amazing. 

To pair with dinner I ordered their french sangria, known as "Frangria" which is absolutely divine. I wasn't able to try out their dessert so that is something I'll have to look into on my next visit. I am also really looking forward to trying out their breakfast meals after hearing great things about it. It is a good spot to take friends and also have a nice romantic dinner out with your significant other.During my recent to trip to Vegas I knew we were going to hit this joint up again because it was sooooo delicious last time we were in town, so why not? Right?

Since I gave up mean for Lent (yes, I am a confirmed Catholic) I didn't have too many other choices. I settled for the Egg White Omelette. The omelette is just that, an omelette. So it was good. It comes with a roasted tomato that I cut up & it complimented the omelette & gave it more flavor. Their hash browns weren't too greasy which is sorta hard to come by. It came with a side of toast as well. 

Even during busy lunch time & no reservations made, we were ableto get seated in less than 10 mins. Pretty impressive.

All in all, that entree was actually so good that I decided to order it when we had breakfast before leaving Vegas :) I totally recommend it.Had our 30th wedding anniversary dinner at Mon Ami Gabi and all I can say is WOW!
Staff was great as was the food. Be sure to get there early to sit on the patio along Las Vegas Blvd!  Life doesn't get any better.Diner was excellent like in france! 

Do not hesitate to go for the escargot de bourgogne and moules frites, they were amazing !!!

Price is oK, enjoy!!!Deeelicious and fancy. Going to Andre's was a great way to start a short vacation in Vegas.

The ambiance was very intimate and quiet, despite the fact that it is next to the casino at Monte Carlo. I was with my mom and we both had a nice time.

Service: Friendly, respectful, nice!

Starters:

Bread: Crusty on the outside and soft and warm inside. Good sign.

Watercress salad: Came with thin slices of beef, parmesan shavings, lemon aioli, mushrooms, and toasted bread. AMAZING. We did not know what to expect when we ordered this, and we liked the very cute presentation. But the flavor of all these ingredients threw us back. I never had something so fresh and delicate on a piece of toasted bread! I guess molecular gastronomy experts know what they are doing. This all worked so well and was very impressive.

French onion soup: A big cup of very flavorful broth, caramelized onions, thick gooey cheese and bread. It was piping hot and so very good. I went with a soup I usually enjoy, and this did not disappoint.

Entree:

Steak: With broccolini and mashed potatoes. A deceptively simple dish. The steak was tender, the broccolini crunchy, and mashed potatoes were probably more butter than potato but I wasn't complaining. Everything was juicy and perfect.

Duck: Came with pieces of gnocchi, root veggies, and duck medallions. The medallions and sauce were too salty for me, but everything else in this dish was good. The duck was so soft and tender! I usually don't like duck but this was quite nice and did not have an overpowering taste.

Dessert:

Lemonade cake: Again, molecular gastronomy wins. This was amazing. I do not know exactly what the components to this dessert include, but it was sweet and tart and light and yummy.. just heavenly. I recommend this dessert.

Chocolate souffle: I went with the safe choice again-- something I knew. This was fluffy and not too sweet, very much chocolatey-- what more could I ask for?

We used the TravelZoo coupon for this place and I was glad I did. Not my favorite place to eat in Vegas, but this place is definitely worth a try if you are looking for someplace quiet and comfy but sophisticated. I would come back.Fantastic food.  Fruit plate was enormous, fresh with great variety.  Gyros were very tasty.   Decor is kind of neat with neons and cozy booths. Waitresses were very nice and had cute uniforms.  Overall, one of my very best Vegas eating experiences.   Definitely will be back again.This place is amazing and sucky all at once. I went once at 9AM and once again 5AM later the next morning. Don't order a chrorizo omlett, because there isn't one on the menu.Nice inexpensive place to stay. Looks awesome at night from the outside.

Rooms were clean. The view was awesome from our room.Easily one of my favorite hotels in Vegas.  I highly recommend this place to all of my friends and family who visit.  Here's why:

- Great selection of rooms.  You really have 3 choices of rooms & service here.....Mandalay Bay has mid-level rooms/service, THEhotel has great rooms/service, and the Four Seasons has excellent rooms/service.  The giant 2 bedroom suite at the end of the towers of Mandalay Bay are my favorite.

- Parking is easy.  The self parking and valet parking here is so easy.  The parking garage at the rear of the property has easy access from Frank Sinatra drive or Mandalay Bay Dr.  For locals or tourists it's an easy in/out.

- Great selection of restaurant choices.  From high end restaurants to cheap eats, there's something for everyone....and it's good food too.

- Lots of bars and lounges.  Everyone can find a place to have a drink and enjoy themselves.....from hipsters to regular joe's, there's something for everyone.

- Decent limits on table games.  You can find $10 min bet blackjack here on occasion.  There's also a good selection of slots and other table games.

- The vibe here is awesome.  I can't explain it, but I always feel good here.  The people and the vibe are always energizing.

- Great entertainment.  The House of Blues and the Mandalay Events Center always has great entertainers in their lineup.

- Walkway to Luxor.  If you want a different experience, you can easily walk to the Luxor via a connecting mall area without going outside.  This is huge during the sweltering Summer months.

Overall, this place has a little bit of everything for everyone....and they do it well.

Will I return?  You bet I will!Came here in early October.  Was upgraded to a beautiful room facing north with stunning views of Charleston Peak and the rest of Las Vegas. Staff and house keeping were excellent (they hung my pants up in the closet which I had left on a chair!!). Great meals at Verandah and enjoyed using the gym and spa. In the lobby there was a mini donut cart cranking fresh made complimentary donuts which were incredible (no joke).  Easy and convenient access to the casino, Mandalay Bay, Luxor etc. I love this place and am a fan of the Four Seasons!!!!Three times I've been here. Each time I've had a great experience. I absolutely love the chef's tasting menu. The tasting menu was an assortment of lettuce salad. Roasted peppers, diver scallops, quail, hanger steak, free range chicken, pureed potatoes, MmMMm and their white corn when it's in season....you gotta get. Now I'm not a corn person because I don't like to see it. BUT MAN it's sooooo sweet and flavorful!. I had the Ribeye here as well....cooked to perfection. Along with the Lobster bisque....yea I could sop that up with a biscuit. 
This restaurant actually opened my eyes to the tasting menus. 
HOLY CRAP I almost forgot desset. An assortment of sorbet. Fruits, monkey bread, volcano cake....yea. This place made me have a fat day. BUT WHO CARES. Food was fanf*ckingtastic! I tend to eat a lot.....Went here last night and had a great time. Service was very friendly and attentive. Our table went with the Summer Tasting Menu which was the way to go in terms food and price. For sixty dollars we got the following:

1st Course:
Grilled Quail
Watercress and Cucumber Salad
Roasted Red Peppers

Main Course:
Diver Scallops in Citrus Butter
Kobe Rib Eye x2
Roasted Chicken

Dessert:
Molten Chocolate Cake
6 Different Types of Ice Cream and Sorbet (Coconut was the Best)
Fresh Fruit
Monkey Bread

We also add Fore Grais, Corn Soup, and Oysters to our meal and they all were excellent. This is the place to come for simple, perfectly prepared food.First off, I love this place.  I've eaten here a couple times which is saying a lot because I like to try new restaurants everytime I'm in Vegas.  For a restaurant to bring me back again is big.  The service staff at Craft is fantastic, from suggestions on entrees to wine pairings.  They are very knowledgable and attentive.  The tomato bread soup was the best I've had, and the steaks are high quality and cooked to perfection.  Everything was delicious down to the sides and desserts.  On the pricey side, but well worth it.one of the best steakhouses i have ever eaten at. if you're going with a group of 4 and money is no object, i'd suggest doing the kobe tasting menu. it's 3 courses but the amount of food is so generous. especially the desserts. personally, i don't think the upgrade to surf and turf is worth it. unless it's a 2 pound lobster tail or the sea scallops. sometimes the prawns and crab legs surf options are little too rich because of the butter poaching. my favorite thing on the menu is the kobe skirt. also if you like your whiskey on the rocks, the restaurant has an icemaker that makes a 2 1/2 square inch cube.Simply an awesome meal. T-Bones were outstanding and all the salads and side dishes were delicious. Service impeccable. Best shrimp cocktail I have had in years!Holy moly - run, don't walk to get these 24-hour braised shortribs! I have been dreaming of returning to Craftsteak to devour this dish after visiting last year. The meat is fall-apart tender, and the au jus has the most amazing flavor. The bartender told me the secret to making them even better (I wasn't sure this was possible!) was to take the rolls that were served with dinner - split them in half & put the shredded meat on there to make mini-sliders. I don't know how it was possible to make it even better, but it did!! Insanely good.
The bartender offered to do a small/half portion of one of the sides for me, and even the small portion was very generous. I will be dreaming of these shortribs until my next visit! YUM.BEST MEAL OF MY LIFE!

Went there for our "splurge" anniversary dinner. Everything from start to finish was amazing. We had a reservation and were promptly seated in a nice cushy booth. The restaurant was packed, but it wasn't the usual "so loud I can't hear anything you say" loud. Our friendly waiter brought my perfect Dirty Martini quickly and made great recommendations on the menu.

We ordered the Chef's Selection package which was pricey--but again totally worth it and a TON of food.

We selected the Kobe cuts of the NY steak and Rib Eye with a side of 1/2 a lobster. The lobster was a decent size and wonderful; and both steaks were melt in your mouth delicious and so perfectly prepared, I might never be able to have "regular" steak again. 

The package came with a ton of sides, we ordered the mushroom assortment, a potato gratin and 3 (!) salads the highlight being the Buffalo Mozzarella salad. It was actually way too much food, but everything was amazing.

I've read some complaints about the photographer, but since it was our anniversary, I didn't mind. She was a bit overpriced, but the photos are very high quality and a nice momento we wouldn't have otherwise gotten.

All in all, a perfect meal and evening. Just writing this is making my mouth water. Eating there again is incentive enough to go back to Vegas more often!One liner....Amazing.

As I walked through the door of this humble (for Vegas) exterior, I'm instantly struck by the full length bar wall covered exclusively in various whiskey bottles. The thought crosses my mind, "Yeah, I can totally do that for dinner." My eyes like to wonder around a place to check out the eccentricities, and I notice that  they literally have hundreds of bottles of wine stashed all around the entire room. They've won me over already.

Their dinner rolls are light, fluffy, savory, and are topped with glazed butter and probably ground sea salt. Honestly, they remind me of my great grandmother's homemade recipe which I haven't eaten in nearly 20 years. So whiskey heaven, and a time warp to home cooking.......yep, I'm loving it.

Medium rare grilled New York Strip comes out lightly seasoned, cooked to perfection. I'd also ordered a couple of sides consisting of au gratin potatoes and grilled, sliced carrots. I couldn't have asked for anything more. 

After working my way through the sea of food, I cannot possibly eat anymore, and they were quick to box it up for me with everything individually separated to not spoil or comingle the flavors. 

Over the top? Absolutely not. Great, high end steak restaurant? YES. I would have no hesitation going back.

Check it out for yourself, and I'm certain you'll not be disappointed.Oh how I count the days until I can dine at Bouchon again. I used to have a party there while in town for NAB but alas our company wanted to try something new last year.  They have a fantastic private dining room for groups of 15 or smaller and a big one for larger groups. Their wine list is phenomenal and they make excellent pairings upon request. Although the company doesn't go, I always make sure to have at least one meal during my annual voyage to Vegas.OK, one more review for Bouchon for breakfast.  It was fantastic.  Our group of five enjoyed the various dishes, service was simply superb, and the atmosphere was quite good. I want to go back and try something else.

We had breakfast here on 16 November 2009.I had dinner here last time in Vegas.  We tried a number of appetizers, salads, and other dishes.  We had foie gras, duck, a couple of the salads, lamb shank...I can't remember everything we had.  But I do remember the foie gras blew me away...and that's all I really remember.  Oh also we had an oyster each at the end, in lieu of dessert.  I guess the oyster was kinda sweet...so whatever.

The waiters and staff were helpful, I had a predinner drink at the bar with a friend too.  Also, our waiter helped us play a prank on the guy in our party who paid with a credit card...which involved writing a deceptively high gratuity on the receipt...that was fun!No trip to Vegas would be complete without a trip to Bouchon :) Came here for Sunday Brunch and left completely satisfied!

Me and my friend shared 2 dishes: "Chicken and Waffles" ($25) and the "French Toast" ($12).. both were DELICIOUS!

I've never had chicken and waffles so I don't have much to compare this against, but this is one of Bouchon's most popular dishes, and it is clear why.. the chicken was VERY moist and flavorful, and went nicely with the crispy skin. The dish also came with 4 slices of waffles. I was a little thrown off by the bacon and chives baked INTO the waffles, but they were still good because of the fluffiness. The 2 sauces really completed the dish - savory gravy for the chicken, maple syrup for the waffles. HUGE portions - can't really see anyone finishing this on thier own... 

French toast - presentation was beautiful!!! Hello french toast tower!!! Layers and layers of french toast with cooked apples squeezed in between each layer! Just a warning - small portion and very sweet!!!

Between the 2 of us, this was the perfect amount of food! Going to Bouchon's is always such a nice experience and definitely my favorite restaurant in Vegas :)My favorite place for brunch in all of the U.S. thus far! So remarkable and delicious that I would hop on a plane and fly to Vegas just to dine at Bouchon again. For a Sunday the wait was only about 15-20 minutes which is not bad at all. 

I ordered off their special menu and had the egg benedicts. I usually can only finish one but I devour the whole plate practically. The english muffin was perfectly toasted and their hollandaise sauce was not overwhelming at all. Everything about the presentation was beyond expected and I enjoyed every single bit. 

My husband had the Chicken & Waffles. The chicken was roasted and came with bacon and chive waffles with a side of tahitian vanilla bean butter. The BEST chicken and waffles we've ever had. 

Definitely a place we highly recommend out friends for brunch and would visit each time we're in Vegas. I heard the dinner is also delicious too. Be prepared to pay around $25 for a plate. Expensive, but not for Vegas and the meals are well worth the price.Went there for brunch... fantastic. We sat outside and even in the middle of the summer it was lovely outside. I wouldn't recommend it during the middle of the day though. Had the sourdough waffles and the french toast. Both were fantastic... the waffles had cinnamon in the batter which was amazing.Bouchon is my Sunday Brunch spot! Be sure to check out the specials, at times they are real winners. 

We came a bit late (around 1215). At this point, they were sold out of the Terrine Foie Gras and Charcuturie. Instead we got a basket of their delicious fresh-baked pastries and beignets. Next time, I'll probably skip the pastries but the beignets are so light, fluffy, and perfectly cinnamon-sugary I'll have to try those again!

They're famous for they're chicken & waffles--gourmet of course. And they're absolutely delectable. You'll be licking your plate clean (if that sort of thing was appropriate here, of course). The entree I had was the Corn Beef Hash. The one thing that I'm very nit-picky on is overly salty food. This hash was just right! They cooked my eggs exactly how I specified and all the delicious flavors came right through.

TIP: Show up early enough to get the good Hors d'oeuvres!I am in love.  Nutella!  Amazing coffee!  Wish that they would expand their menu of sweet crepes!  Go to the restaurant (up the elevators).  It is cheaper than the "to go" stand in the casino.  I ordered my food to go a couple of times from the restaurant without a problem.  Yum!Soooooooooo good! 

It's quite possible that the steak sous-vide here tops the steaks found at both Peter Luger in NYC and Mastro's in LA. 

Great cocktails and wine list. Very fresh seafood as well.Bouchon is one of those places that you go to in Vegas so you can show people back at home pictures of to brag about living a fancy lifestyle in Vegas just because you were in Vegas. It is beautiful inside and directly outside of it. They're connected to the outside gardens in the Venetian with beautiful flowers and a pool, along with a really pretty gazebo. Just down the hallway a bit is a lounge near their second "front desk" that has amazing architecture and design that makes you really feel like you're not in America anymore, but is instead in Europe. They may be a bit pricey, but you're still getting great food and amazing service, so definitely worth the price tag if you're up for paying about $20+ for a brunch.

I've had two items on their menu before and they are both delicious. One is the baguette with smoked salmon and capers. This is my pretty standard choice when I'm not sure what else to get. It is flavorful and the just a good combination always. But if you want something more out of the ordinary, you should definitely look at their Chicken and Waffles. I have never had a waffle that was so meant for chicken! It is not your typical buttermilk waffles. It is the best combination of a savory waffle and chicken where the batter of the waffle has been mixed with bacon and chives! Doesn't that just make your mouth water?!? It was so perfect! So crispy on the outside and perfectly fluffy on the inside. The chicken went deliciously well with the whole combination and they roasted it to a good taste, yet didn't burn any parts of it. The sauce that comes with the chicken was a bit salty so it went well if you were to order some fries to dip into it too. So a definitely recommendation from me are these two items.

They also serve you some bread that are shaped in the most unique possible way. It looks like a bunch of leaves strung together and you basically break off one of the leaves. It is a bit hard since it seems a bit over crispy, so don't expect too much from that. But other than that, the bread is still good and I think is very artistically appealing for the eyes rather than the teeth that you're going to have to use to crunch through the tough to break shell!

In short, beautiful location, beautiful presentations, amazingly delicious food and wonderful atmosphere. If you need to brag to people about the high life in Vegas, you need to visit this place at least once.Culinary perfection!!! For dinner I had: caviar, foie gras, and peach melba. Each was PERFECT!!! I highly highly recommend Bouchon!!!Of all of my dining experiences at Vegas, this one is definitely up there.  This restaurant is located in the heart of The Shops of Bellagio.

I had the Sea Scallops and it was simply awesome.  Very nice presentation.  The complimentary bread and olives were very tasty.  The ambiance was dark and classy.  Also, I certainly can't complain about customer service.  I think I discovered my new favorite Vegas spot.  

I opted to sit at the bar, but the best spot is on the patio where you can see the water show.  I'd advise, however, that you make reservations because the patio appeared to be packed even for a weekday.  I can't imagine what it would be like on a weekend.I recently traveled to Las Vegas for a trip. I stayed at the Wynn, which I highly suggest, but I wanted to eat at Olives and watch the fountains. I am gluten free and dairy free, I have to say that over all my experience in Vegas dining was fantastic. Olives wait staff and bar staff were top notch. Very friendly and helpful and concerned with my food issues. I had the tuna carpaccio and the roasted chicken with green beans and olive oil mashed potatoes. It was all excellent. I will definitely be back here next time I am in Vegas. The mimosas were great too.I've had dinner here three times. The food is always delicious and the service is always outstanding.  

Most recently I made my selections from the theatre menu and it was a great value for the money. I had the sea bass that is wrapped with potato.  

The bread, you get as an appetizer, is awesome.  There are five or more choices and they're all great but my favorites are the pretzel and the bacon bread. Incredible!

Enjoy!I am a frequent Las Vegas visitor and shopper and I never go without stopping at these outlets.
First of all, they have a wide selection of stores...a little bit of everything for everyone...but they do have the usual favorite designer stores. 
My best advice to get the best deals is to go on holidays and weekends. Yes its busy but they have way better deals. If you go during the week, there are usually no special deals and it's not worth going there. The whole point of outlets is to get good deals. 
I usually stop here during Black Friday. Warning to all those that go this year...its freaking cold, parking is horrible, and there are LOTS of people. Despite this, I enjoy going every year because I get awesome deals. Some of the stores even form lines, like Coach, they only let a certain amount of people in at a time, so a huge line forms outside. This is common on black friday. 
So if you don't like the madness and the cold, stay out of here! we don't need grumpy people shopping around because you will need a lot of patience for shopping on this day.
Otherwise, one of my favorite outlets to shop at!I decided to eat here after reading about decent cheap places to eat in Vegas. 3 of us in our party ordered the secret menu 777 special. The $7.77 special consists of a delicious steak, 3 shrimp, garlic mashed potatoes, salad and veggie. Excellent! My son and boyfriend ordered the $9.99 secret prime rib special. There's were good too! Definitely recommend this place especially if you want to get off the strip and save a few bucks.Friendly staff especially Gary, the executive chef. We had a complimentary corn on the cob with fresca, Parmesan, pesto mayo and paprika ...delish! The rehab omelet with fresh fruit was delightful after a night of fun in the club. To top the meal off, Gary surprised us with apple pie. Very sweet! Thank u Gary and team for making our visit special!I've been here at least 3 times now and every visit leaves me wanting more.

Recently, I visited for an early dinner and opted for the Chef's Tasting. Once you get over the sticker shock, $120 per person, it's a delightful experience. Don't bother asking what's on the menu, just go with it. No thinking- just eating. Of course, if you have a shellfish allergy DO TELL them that so they can make adjustments.

One of my favorite flavor combinations is yuzu and truffle oil. I'm crave this and actually think of Shibuya each time I want to relive this taste experience.

The sake pairing is another $55 per person. However, we chose to go with 2 bottles of 300ml sake instead. These 2 bottles took us through the 8 courses. I started with the Demon Slayer and then moved to the Only Daughter ... or some name like that. The meats and rich flavors paired well with the "Only Daughter." 

If you ever want to treat yourself to some amazing sushi and money is no object, come here. It's sooooo good.Love, love, love this place!  

Perfect for groups!

I bring participants here after seminars.Love, love, love this place! Such a great atomsphere and the food is really good as well! Don't forget to buy a jager shot and get spanked. Really great place to go to with friends.The hamburgers are great and the sweet potatoes fries are sooo fantastic.I always enjoy visiting Delux. Their turkey burgers are the best, haven't tried anything else because I can't get past them. They have my favorite beers on tap, Abita Purple Haze, Papago Orange Blossom, and Rogue Hazelnut. The servers are always attentive and they are open late.With 500+ reviews, I doubt anyone needs anymore convincing to try out a Delux burger ... unless they happen to be blind. I've been here countless times and there isn't much deviation from the norm. Delux sushi? Now that's something to talk about. 

After combining Zen 32, I've been reluctant to try their sushi bar. Their sushi prices  could maim my already slim wallet. $14 a roll? I say 14 a no. Unless it's happy hour, I suggest going somewhere else that serves sushi for less if you're that desperate to satisfy your sushi craving. Then again, you're at Delux. Just stay and get a goddamn burger. 

But when mom and dad calls saying that I should take a break from studying and take me out to dinner ? HELL YEAH I GOT TIME FOR DAT.

I've tried the Vegas Roll and Caterpillar and I have to say, one plate was enough to fill me. Quality was good, portions were decent, and presentation was clean and eye-catching as well. Being the typical nosy Asian mom, she kept pointing out how the sushi chef was practically standing, getting paid to do nothing on a busy Sunday night. I assume he gets more orders during Happy Hour.  

The only qualm I have is that when he finally did get an order, he would make it really quick, but would then leave it on a rack until a server came to pick it up. I understand that burgers may take longer than sushi to make, but when I watch him make my sushi and leave it out for 5+ minutes even though I'm sitting RIGHT next to him, I'm a little peeved. It's fish, you don't leave it out like that you know? Even if the server is just trying to make sure all the orders come to the table at once, it just really irked me.

 Other than that though, I say burger or sushi, try it all.Can't speak to the ambiance as I got my food to go, but my Chinese chicken salad was fantastic.  I was working late and picked up the food.  Went back to work and the salad even sat out for an hour before I got to it, but it didn't matter.  It was amazing.  I'll be back for more!I've heard that the buffets at Bellagio and Wynn are overpriced but seriously, this one is definitely worth the extra $5-10. We ate at Cravings and Bellagio had more in terms of selection, comfort, quality and service.

I like that part of the sushi and salad bars are monitored by staff because some people tend to eat, cough, talk or sneeze as they pile on their plates.

Primed ribs - best I've had. Be careful not to OD on this like I almost did. 

Sushi - ask the guy behind the counter to give you fresh ones. Some people, I understand really like their sashimi, but no need to pick the fish and leave the rice. Sure, seeing the machine spit out the rice like larvae isn't too appealing. Sort of like the giant mother alien squeezing out her eggs.When it comes to Vegas, this has to be my most favorite buffet yet. So I finally gambled for the first time with my $25 Grazie credit, which came with my suite package for The Venetian and luckily I won $55. With that said I wanted to eat somewhere nice on my last day in Vegas so my girlfriend and I went looking for a buffet and a lot of people suggested to go to this one. 

The wait was not long at all and I think the price was a little over $22. That's definitely worth it already if you really put into consideration where you're eating. 

They have so many different stations, and everything I ate was beyond rich in flavor. My favorites were the Bleu Cheese Pasta, which had Chicken and Sun Dried Tomatoes!!! EXCELLENT!!! I also loved their cutting station which had Kalbi beef. I've never been to a buffet that had a cutting station that served that and it was one of the tastiest meats I've ever tasted. 

They also have: 

-A soup station which had four different soups, can't remember off the top of my head... Miso was definitely one of them... 

-Italian, which had you Pizzas and Pastas. Every pasta I tried was really tasty. 

-They have the cutting station which I mentioned earlier. 

-They have an excellent salad station. Their selection of add-ons is one of the biggest I've ever seen. 

-They have freshly made sliders (mini burgers) at their grilling station. You can choose from beef or turkey sliders. Beside that are the extras you can put in like condiments and vegetables. 

-They have a mini-bakery section with different breads like white, sourdough, wheat. 

-They also had a build your own sandwich station. I had one with some exotic Italian deli meat. I forgot what it was called but it was muy delicioso. 

-They also have an Asian foods section. 

-A seafood section, which has a whole section dedicated to shrimp. I LOVE SHRIMP!!! 

-They have a gigantic dessert station which has the greatest Strawberry Tarts I've ever had in my life. I usually hate tarts because I hate anything that's beyond sweet, but these I genuinely love. They have lots of chocolate and fruity goodies, as well as a soft serve yogurt station. 

The service was excellent. Our waitress had a whole section to herself and she was on top of it all!!! Even though Cherry Coke wasn't on the menu she actually brought me a coke and and mini cup of Cherry Grenadine so that I can put as much as I want!!! The chef at the cutting station already remembered me the third time around and already knew what to give me without me having to ask. 

This is the most amazing buffet I've ever been to. Most buffets rush whatever they cook but you can tell that their chefs do put love into the food that they make. The best part about all this is I honestly felt that they could have charged more yet they kept it at a relatively low price for a hotel of its stature. Next time I'm in Vegas I'm going to make sure I eat here at least once!!!My husband & I always love coming here. They have a middle eastern section that is just delish. The seafood is always fresh and so much to choose from, for those of you that like huge crab legs, this is it. The desserts are so yummy. Cotten candy, all different types of cakes, ice cream, puddings! This buffet is top of the line!No Spoiler Alerts Neccessary-

Wow. So many bright lights. So many performers everywhere - front, back and above. I was entertained throughout the whole performance. Even the act with the fat adult baby were hilarious as the other performers got ready for the next act.My favorite Cirque de Soilel show! Very artistic, very acrobatic, great music, and great set design. This show has it all - feats of strength, flexibility, and a lot of humor.I've seen a few Cirque du Soleil shows including Ka, O, and Mystere.  I think Myestere's the best one.  The acrobatics and energy of the show is great.  Nothing is more impressive than the hand-to-hand show which features two brothers doing amazing acrobates.  It is breath taking.AMAZING. 

this was my first ever Cirque du Soleil show ever and I was so impressed!! There was a ton of interaction with the crowd which I wasn't expecting and it seems like every seat in the place is a good one! 
There was live music playing the entire time along with the show which set a sweet vibe throughout the night. 
I didn't understand if there was a storyline to go with the show, but either way it was still silly and high action and perfect for the ADHD- Always something to look at!!! 

The stunts were incredible and kept me interested literally the entire time. I can't believe humans can do some of that stuff!!!

Go see it - you won't be disappointed. Worth every penny!These are the best cheese curds in town, hands down! I was looking forward to less of a wait now that they've opened up their extension, but no luck. People love this place, and rightly so. You will have trouble getting a table. It is busy. However, if you are able to sit down, you will enjoy their delicious sandwiches (the pulled pork and grilled chicken are very good), platters (friday fish fry--yum!), lazy susans, and salads (delicious spinach and grilled salmon salads). A word of warning, the food can be a bit greasy/heavy, but it is comforting and craveable! If you sit at the bar, they have fantastic beer specials ($9 pitchers of a different wisconsin beer each month) and delicious drinks (house-infused organic raspberry vodka, anyone?). The bartenders are super nice, as are the servers. Only downside is the wait times, but hey.. the people have spoken.After a horrible experience at XS, we called Richard Candido for a last-minute table at Tao.  We thought it would be a tall order, considering there were 16 of us, but he pulled it off.  Most importantly:  No drama, no BS, no attitude - this is what VIP service should always be.

Thank you, TAO (Richard, specifically) for saving the night (again).Compared to Boston, Vegas clubs are just WAY BETTER especially if you are with a huge group of pretty girls.

I was just walking down the strip and ran into a really nice promoter who put me and my friends onto the guest list. She wasn't there that night but when I texted her and she helped me out. 

Line- I waited for a while in the line but was placed in the express, only ladies line (which 15 girls go in at a time). So sweet being a girl! If you want to get in...get there by 10pm!!! If you are a guy, you better have a lot of girls with you or $$ for tables.

Fee-I can't remember exactly but I think it was free admission and drink before 12am. ( I went in May)

Layout- This place is HUGE and extremely nice.

Music-Top 40 and a lot of good music. Some old school, some techno,...a little bit of this and that. Since there are so many different rooms, same music might play because there are different DJS throughout Tao. I think there are 3. One of the bottom floor when you get in, 2 upstairs (1 in the big dance floor, 1 in the side room).

Crowd-It's so big so there's all kinds of people here! My friends and I met some nice guys and got to sit at their VIP table. Was awesome!!!

Dancers- Really good. I was locked on a GoGo for a while because she was just so freaking amazing and hot!

Bathrooms- I didn't use the ones upstairs but I heard they had some weird, clear doors that when you locked it, the door would go from clear to blurry. So cool!

Overall, if you go to Vegas you HAVE to go to TAO! It was my best nightclub experience there and I went to Pure, Playboy Club, Rain, Ghost bar, Moon, and....others.I love steak! I always go to whatI think is the best I can find, Peter Luger in Brooklyn, Capital Grille's, Del Frisco's, Palm, Charlie Palmer, etc. This certainly ranks right up there with the best of them plus it's an elegant place. The porterhouse was fabulous. Juicy, Tasty, everything I could hope for. It was a while ago that I went so I don't remember exactly what the dessert was  but I remember it being very good. Highly recommended.Hands down my favorite steakhouse in Las Vegas.  Nothing beats the combination of outstanding service, delicious food, and great atmosphere.   Here's what we like to order: Tomahawk split for 2 (it's 30 oz , so plenty enough for 2 people), the truffle corn,  caprese salad (if in season), the tuna ceviche,  the crab pasta appetizer, and dessert. .. You must try dessert, a lot of effort is put into the desserts here and the menu changes regularly. ... Just ask your server for suggestions.  If you're looking for a great steakhouse experience,  this is the place to go.  The only suggestion I have is that they update the music they play, the restaurant has a very alive, energetic feeling that needs more up-to-date and slightly more upbeat music."O" will always be my favorite Cirque performance.  It was the first Cirque show I saw as a child, years and years and years ago.  And it is the reason why I continue seeing Cirque shows to this day!!  "O" made me a deeply devoted Cirque fan!!Mind-blowingly Beautiful!!!

From the opening moments of clowning around to the beautiful finale, this is a show worthy of spending your hard earned money on.  It radiates joy, beauty and ecstasy.  All of the performers just exude passion and joy from their very tips of their toes.  The music is typically dramatic and enjoyable as all Cirque shows have the manner of being.  I spent the first ten minutes with tears in my eyes at how perfect everything was. Truly with the addition of the pool, they have created such a thrilling and dramatic experience that is sure to stay with you long after you've left Vegas.

Before entering the theatre, spend some time viewing the beautiful sculptures on display featuring some talented Cirque du Soleil performers.Our first show in Vegas.  it was great!  Amazing stage!! Great colors and cool customs.  

The show is pretty exciting, and funny.  The first 2 rows might get a little wet!  Other then that, i think this is great for the whole family.Jaw dropping, mesmerizing, beautiful, haunting. I loved it! And the clowns are funny too.Definitely worth watching. The girlfriend took me to see this and I was very pleased. The transitioning from land to water was amazing. Don't waste your time on NY cirque du soleil shows...stick with vegas... WOWThis was an amazing circus show. I've never seen anything like it before. I was just thinking to myself the whole time... how do that do that? and that looks like so much fun, I wanna do it too! LoL.This is by far on my list of top 3 favorite Cirque shows. The water is mesmerizing, and all of the performers do amazing jobs! The theater is located in the back area of the beautiful Bellagio Hotel & Casino. I guess not the back-back....the upper corner? It's a little bit of a walk from the front lobby, but pretty easy to find. The price is a little steep for a ticket, but take my word for it - it's worth it! Here's my tip of the day: skip the higher priced orchestra level seats, where your view might be obstructed anyway by a taller person, and get seats in the loggia. No one in front of you, and you get a unique view of the theater. Be sure to take note of the ceiling, it's gorgeous!This was incredible!

Tickets were a bit pricey, but my fiancee and I went to the Bilagio  and found the ticket desk. They gave us an additional 15% off of our ticket if we chose the evening show (I'm guessing they were trying to fill up the arena), so our tickets were roughly $135 each, but it was worth every penny.

When the show starts they do a fantastic job of getting you involved in the performance (not physically, of course), but you find yourself lost in the show. There's so much going on at one time, sometimes it's hard to see everything, but it's so beautiful and the acrobatics were incredible!

If you could see only one show in Vegas, I'd absolutely recommend "O"!I've seen a few CdS's and each one has its qualities.  I personally like this one because there is a storyline and it is mostly action.

I don't want to ruin it for anyone, but the stage scenes are amazing, you always feel engrossed in the whole thing, and the final part with the stage is awesome.  If you've ever played old Final Fantasy games, you'll probably get a kick out of it like I did.

I think you have to be high or on something to think of half of the things in these shows.  To the makers of Cirque du Soleil: Keep lighting up!The story, stage, and effects here are amazing.  The problem I think previous reviewers might have is that is it is not as obvious as the other shows.
Seriously, this is one of the best things I have ever seen live. You HAVE to pay attention and be able to make some jumps in logic, as well as appreciate the fact that it is live music choreographed with a completely rotating stage and pyrotechnics to a deeper Homeric story line.  You are not getting spoon fed your art, as with many of the other amazing or less then amazing (see: Wintuk) Cirque Shows.
BTW, its's next door to Rubochon.  That adds another half star.
In effect, it's not your typical Vegas show, which might warrant the other reviews."When I grow up I will run away & join the circus."

That's what my Cirque du Soleil bracelet says & that's the phrase I used to threaten my parents with as an angry teen.

Fire, battle scenes, a rotating stage & a darkness I have yet to experience in other Cirque shows-- KA gets five stars. The story of a brother & sister torn apart by war was an easy (& heart wrenching) story to follow. My favorite scene of all is the simulated sea scene--it really looked like the characters were floating through water.

This is the fourth Cirque show I've seen (Zumanity, Believe, Ovo.)  Highly recommended because it is much less campy & more serious than the other three shows. I loved the industrial looking set & the gloomy & moody feeling that encompasses the show. 

We called the MGM & bought tickets for the same night (about $65 per person.) We were seated center, but close to the back of the  theater. Seats are extremely comfy & have speakers in the headrest. (FYI: no intermission)

Perfect show for a fire sign like me.It's hard to write a review on a show without giving away anything. And let me tell you, you're best going in with no idea what to expect! 

This was my first Cirque du Soleil experience and DAMN was it a good one! I want so bad to talk about everything I bore witness too, but I must not!! A trip to Vegas specifically to see KA would be worth it! 

The story at times was a little hard to follow, but that had mostly to do with the fact that I was slack jawed trying to figure out how they were pulling off what they were pulling off. Brilliant. 

Ticket's were definitely on the expensive side, but I can honestly say it was well worth it. I would spend it again. As is with most first time in a specific theatre experiences, I can also tell you that really any seat in the house affords a perfect view. It's not entirely necessary to spend big here. Also, a lot of the action happens ABOVE you, so sitting front and center is probably not the best position, even if it's the most expensive!

Before heading into the theatre, you get your photo taken which you can look at and purchase after the show. For $45 you get two separate shots in a beautiful book style frame. They have it pre-printed and framed, which is fantastic. In fact, if it was just viewed on a monitor, we probably would've passed. Bonus points on presentation guys! It made me buy it!Ka starts off slow, but then blows you away . This is the show that Spiderman on Broadway can only dream to be. It is a very different type of cirque du soleil. It is a special effects blockbuster with a bunch of Wow moments.My very first Cirque du Soleil experience!

Saw this show in 2006 and was very impressed!  Too bad this was the same night we got in from the first half of my vacation at Disneyland and kept falling in and out of sleep.  Not because it was boring, but I was just soo tired!

What I did see, I enjoyed: people falling from the ceiling in the lobby area as you walk in (on bungee cords of course), the theater itself - massive and beautiful!  And all of the props, costumes, acrobatics! Craziness!  And I loved every bit of it (in between my little cat naps)!

Ever since then, I've been hooked - I saw La Nouba while in Disney World and Alegria here at home - all great shows and experiences!  Can't wait to see more shows!This is a great show. The whole stage is a prop, moving vertically at times to act as a wall to climb. Very impressive with what they do with the stage alone. 

On top of that the show has a good story line, and great acrobatics. Probably one of the best shows you can see in Vegas.Rick Moonen's RM Seafood does not get as much recognition as some of the high profile restaurants in Las Vegas, but in a way, I prefer it that way. Based upon past experiences, some of the more lauded and lionized establishments along The Strip have become too big for their britches, charging ridiculous prices for just very good food. Hell, if I have to drop $500 at one sitting in Vegas, then it better come with a happy ending!

On the night that we dined there, the upstairs dining was closed (damn this recession!), and although I was disappointed, I thought the downstairs dining room -- with its white leather booths and maple-stained tables and chairs -- had a casual elegance to it that was unpretentious yet visually appealing.

For dinner we ordered the large chilled shellfish sample, which was a multi-tiered steeple tower of seafood holiness and contained 1 whole lobster, 12 oysters, 6 clams, 6 shrimp, mussels, 1/2 Dungeness crab, and a seafood escabeche (calamari, mussels, shrimp, king crab, in a spicy vinaigrette). The entire spread was literally an altar for the senses, from the cornucopia of shapes and colors, to the briny freshness of the sea, to the sweetness of the shellfish meat. We washed down the entire thing (well, almost all of it) with a bottle of the 2007 Rivers-Marie Chardonnay ($25 corkage), which in taste and texture is a dead ringer for a white Burg. And while not cheap, our bill was a fraction of what we might have paid at some of the other high-roller restaurants in town.

But as good as the food was, the best part of our meal had to be when Chef Rick Moonen himself came by our table and shared some wine with us. As gregarious and hyperactive as he appears on television, this Top Chef Master completely won us over with his passion for life and generosity of spirit. The ballers can have their bling, but the next time we visit Las Vegas, we'll skip the exorbitance of the other places and instead feast like kings at RM Seafood.We went here for lunch.  The dishes that were ordered were, roasted sweet corn soup, clam chowder, lobster roll, and a "surf and surf" dish.

The sweet corn soup was a bit sweet for my taste, of course there is the word "sweet" in the name of the dish so that should be assumed.  The razor clams were good.  Clam chowder was OK. The clams were a bit tough.  It had the viscosity that I like, not overly thick.  I really enjoyed the chunks of lardon in the soup.

The Lobster roll was good.  Although it was a little heavy on the creme fraiche.   The "Surf and Surf" was not what I had imagined.  It is crab and lobster on a bed of wheat orzo tossed in a beurre blanc sauce.   I guess I didn't pay attention to the "Surf and Surf" in the name of the dish.  What was served was what looked like two huge king  crab segments and a whole cut up lobster.  The orzo with beurre blanc sauce had a very bright lemon flavor to it and cut the richness of the seafood. 

The service and environment was good considering it was lunch.  The "Surf on Surf" dish was overall the best dish I had for this Vegas trip, regardless of the cost but wow it was big bucks, for a lunch.Not a foodie, and usually opt out of this kind of high dining experience, but this one really stands out to me as (gasp) worth the money. You're surrounded by millions of dollars of Picasso artwork, the Bellagio waterfall is sparking right next to you - my veal came to me arranged in the shape of a convincing picasso face and the wine pairing was memorable and very informed. I really enjoyed every dish here and would go again in a heartbeat.Extremely classy place. Love itI love this place. It's one of my favorite spots in town. 

The food is delicious, with an ever-changing menu; the service is top-notch; the clientele are classy; and the view of the strip is one of the best in Vegas.

The experience truly can't be beat.a great experience partying here. 
the bottle services were crazy-awesome... the VP of Treasure Island came down and partied with us... plus- comp'ed us bottles and bottles of Grey Goose and Patron. my friends and i had the VIP section to ourselves for 2 hours. it was 3 of my friends' birthday. everyone stared at us like we were celebrities. i guess they thought we were having a blast and wanted to be partying with us. 

it's not huge- but it's a lounge. as a matter of fact, it's a nice lounge. it overlooks the water and the strip- the neon orange is enticing, people from outside can watch you partying/drinking. i think the concept is great. i think Treasure Island is one of my favorite places to bar hop and chill with friends. it's less drama. 

the gogo dancers are HOT!!!!! i took so many pictures with them. haha. everyone is pretty friendly and the glasses of liquor never went empty. it was fast and friendly service.Ok, people.  Let's give a lill' credit where credit is deserved.  Grand Lux Cafe holds a special place in my heart.  Let me break it down for y'all,...

- Yeah, Grand Lux Cafe's evil twin sister restaurant is The Cheesecake Factory.  But, what this means for you, gentle reader, is a hearty, "American-sized" meal.  You won't go hungry here.
- Not only are the portions generous, the food is DANG GOOD.  It might be reminiscent of The Cheesecake Factory, or even Mimi's Cafe.  But, it's consistently good.  REALLY good.  Comfort foods galore.
- And, good comfort food is even better after a hard night of hardcore partying.  For all your alcoholics out there (particularly from California), don't front - you know y'all head to Denny's or Jack In The Crack or Mel's because really junky, greasy food tastes even better at 3am and when you're trying to sober up.  Well, the food at Grand Lux Cafe is several notches above Denny's, Mel's and Jack In The Crack.  AND, this place is open 24:7.  Even better.  You can stumble into the restaurant looking like a complete train wreck, missing one shoe and tiara in hand, at 3am, 5am or 7am!  And the yummy comfort food at Grand Lux Cafe will be waiting for you like a faithful, faithful friend.I was craving calamari for a week before we came here. My boyfriend asked around to see what restaurant had calamari and a couple people directed us here. 

We were seated very quickly and given water and bread right away. I already knew I wanted calamari, so we ordered that once we were seated. 

It took us a while to decide what we wanted since the menu had a big variety. I guess that's why the website says "something for everyone!" So true!

We finally decided upon the Crispy Caramel Chicken because it just sounded so good! "Crispy Battered Pieces of Chicken Breast in a Spicy Thai Caramel Sauce with Mushrooms, Onions, Red Chile Peppers, Garlic and Ginger. Served with Rice."

The calamari came and it wasn't just calamari. It also came with Rock Shrimp, Zucchini and Onions. Served with a couple dipping sauces. It was all so crunchy, just the way I like it! I loved that they added in the shrimp, zucchini, and onions. It made it all the more better!

The caramel chicken came and we were ecstatic! IT looked just as it was described in the menu, maybe even better! Our first bites had us melting in our seats, it was so tasty! The chicken was breaded perfectly and the Thai sauce was just delicious! It didn't have too much ginger either, which is a surprise since a lot of dishes with ginger tend to have chunks of it. 

All in all, perfect experience! The portion was perfect to share, we didnt even finish, so we had some yummy leftovers the next day :)This place was great.  We discovered it on accident and were very pleased.  Everything in vegas is so expensive and it was nice to find a place with good quality food and great service that we didn't have to spend an arm and a leg on.  The server was very friendly and checked on us often.  She told us the restaurant is owned by the cheesecake factory and to expect big cheesecake factory portions.  We both had burgers, the were gigantic and they tasted great.  I plan to vist the grand lux every time I go to vegasLove this place! I ordered the fish last time and it was pretty good. I've been here a few times and ordered the pasta the time before and that was pretty good also! Lunch special deals are pretty good and definitely filling. I hear the chicken sandwich is really good.I absolutely love this place! Rolling out solo on a Sunday night I ended up here with some ladies from San Diego and LA and found myself neck deep in a hodge podge of fake breastasisisisisissssss....a bottle of goose later and I can't even begin to explain the goingz onz at the VIP table. Music is the best I've heard at any club mixing hip hop and killer house with spots of "satisfaction" and "shiny disco balls"..off the charts base lines and a perfect scene for people to meet and greet and be marry. I highly recommend it anytime your in vegas...VIP by the waterfall is fantastic BUT beware, bottle prices are 500+ ...as long as  your with good people and prepped for the hit to the money belt, should be well worth it! Oh and special thanks to the new friends I made from So Cal...We were skeptical at first...GO TO TRYST!!
The club played a mixture of Hip Hop, R & B, and house music the entire night. Huge crowd of people, so it gets HOT on the small dance floor. The drinks are expensive, but well made. If you get in free like we did, you will not have a problem with purchasing drinks. Look for people giving out passes on the strip. The line gets long, so get there by 10pm or earlier.This is my second review on Caffe Boa ! I always like to follow up with an updated review. I walked in hoping that my experience would be as great as my first....and it was !!!!!!! Our server was great as usual ( I had her last time) and she is knowledgable and friendly. The food was fantastic and the drinks were cold and served fast. The perfect weather and patio puts Caffe Boa over the top. FANTASTICTHE place to go on Madison's North Side.  Roomy, beautiful decor, family-operated, friendly staff.  The pastries are good, the bread and rolls are excellent, and the brunch and lunch menus are amazing!  There are lots of good vegetarian options, all clearly marked.  The Earthly Delights sandwich is my favorite--wow.  The soups and salads are also very, very good.

My only complaint is Manna's coffee, which is sometimes thin and over-extracted.  People who don't have a taste for good espresso may not mind (my Mom likes it fine), but I have to order a mocha or flavor syrup to cover up the bitter taste, and the texture of the mocha simply does not compare to what you'll get at the cafes on the square.  Still, it's probably the best coffee on the North Side.Great pools for the whole family.  Very beautiful grounds friendly staff.I do love this place as I'm always down for a good salad. I love how they switch out items and how the salad bar along with soup stations are always fully stocked and fresh. Can't complain about their fresh desserts as well. I do have to say that this place is way better than Zupas as Zupas' soup pales in comparison to this place.

I have to give all stars as my friend and I visited this place recently and after still being there half an hour before closing, they tossed the perfectly good hot items and placed fresh new batch. It shows that no matter how late and how little the number of customers there are, they still are keen on quality even with so much waste.Awesome hike. I've done it a couple times and loved it each time. Bring lots of water and wear good hiking shoes with good grip. There are loose, little rocks on some parts and I've managed to slip and slide, but luckily catch my fall, at least once each visit. The BF saw someone fall and busted his head on a recent hike so just be careful!Echo is one of my favorite hikes. Done it bunches and bunches of times. My favorite part (except for the top to rest a few) is the big long handrail. Every time I go down it, I slide on my belly on it. Trips peeps out. So if you ever see a blonde chick sliding down it... that's probably me. Hiking is my ultimate passion... and Echo is recommended for hikers that like a challenge. : ) happy hikingThe Cholla Trail is amazing!!! Im glad I got new sneakers for christmas, because I needed that traction. Really fun hike -  Im scared of heights which makes things a little complicated, but I LOVE hiking and the views from this mountain are incredible.  First time I made it almost to the helipad, second time almost to the summit (stopped after the climbing got a little too vertical and steep but plan to push on next time). Took us a little over an hour to get near the top. I am DEFINITELY coming back. Most fun hike I've done in a while!Very tough hike but comes with beautiful trails and stunning views so is well worth the effort.Probably the most awesome hike I've done! 
It's an incredibly steep incline the whole way up, and they have installed rails in some places to help you scale the mountain.  The best part is the view on the top of the mountain!  But be prepared to share it with about thirty other people because this is a very busy and popular hike. 

If you are not in shape, its going to be pretty difficult, and there are some cliffs and openings that are pretty hazardous so you need to be careful.  There is a lot of climbing and using your hands to get yourself up, so don't expect it to be easy.After a long weekend at a kung fu seminar my sifu had, and REALLY bad food a had in scottsdale, I was thinking to myself AZ food sucks!!!!!! I don't live in AZ but I go there atleast once a year and when I leave I am disapointed and wishing I'm back in CA for real food. One of my friends that live there challenged my complaint and brought me to Famous Dave's Barbeque. You know i loves me some bbq but this is AZ how good can it be?? 

WoW!!!! This place is off the hook!!!!! we ordered the dinner sampler which had chicken, hot links, BRISKET!!, ribs, and some sides. They were all feakin OFF DA HOOK man!!!! Especially the brisket!! i think it was the best i ever had. they offered 4-5 different kinds of bbq sauce. I'm tellin ya i was in heaven!!! 

PLS forgive me AZ for i have sinned!! you have opened my eyes and i will never say the food sucks there again!!! 

THANK YOU SIR, MAY I HAVE ANOTHER!!!  :)I had read some reviews about this place, and between those and my prior love for pizza, I knew I had to give it a try.  Sadly, it took me way to long to get here.

I actually took the GF & my parents there for a joint dinner.  They had never met before, and I was really banking the success of their meeting on Cibo's food and ambiance.  I can honestly say, mission accomplished!

Not that the restaurant had anything to do with the weather, but we had an amazing table outside (the only way to go here), under a tree in what turned out to be a cool Saturday afternoon. That was only the beginning.

Our appetizer plate was amazing, and definitely enough for four people to share.  This plate had enough variety, that even the pickiest of parents found something he/she enjoyed.  

We all order pizzas, because none of us really knew how big they'd be.  The crust, cheese and toppings were everything we could have wanted. Crisp, warm and delicious.  The pizzas are big enough for two, and I'd actually recommend sharing with someone else (unless you want leftovers) because dessert is the best here.

You won't find many places that serve Nutella, let alone in homemade crepes.  The crepe with Nutella and banana was unbelievable and is a destination dessert in itself.  I'll come back just for that.  We also split one limoncello drink, which was so strong.  The parental unit was flying high after just sipping that once!

All in all, this place is excellent.  It is totally tucked away in a cool neighborhood, and is a great place for a date or to feel like you are escaping the suburban sprawl in PHX.Great gourmet pizzas, awesome salads, and a cute place suitable for a variety of occasions, be it a date, dinner with the gals, birthday get-together, or a family outing. One of my favorites!We have been countless times for but lunch and dinner and have always had a wonderful experience.  The food, ambiance, and staff are incredible.  Actually, the pizza is the best I've ever had.  The Margarita is a tried and true but my new favorite is the "La Noce".Went back to Fez last night after taking a several week hiatus, and all I kept thinking over and over again was what the hell is wrong with me??  Why would I ever take a break from such a delicious and fabulous place?!

Went after the heartbreaking Suns loss, convinced that I could not be cheered up, and somehow Fez managed to do the trick.  Not sure whether it was one of the 5 reverse happy hour specials we ordered (chicken phyllo packets, bruschetta, 2 orders of fez fries, and lettuce wraps, what we were hungry!!) that did the trick, could've been the two-for-one drink specials after paying $9 for every beer at the game, or it may have been our fantastic waitress Sarah who snapped us out of it.

Either way, everything was spectacular and Fez just got bumped to a 5 star.I haven't been here in a while and its a sin.  This place really rocks.  Great service and you good must go, now!I really love this place. The food is fantastic, servers are always welcoming and the crowd is "hip". Bloody's are GREAT! The music is way too loud for a professional gathering (or for the whole family for mothers day) which I learned the hard way. If your looking for a good brunch or happy hour with friends, this is at the top of my list.It's now been almost 2 years since I discovered Mamma Mias...when we moved to the neighborhood.  Still my favorite regular pizza place.  Cheese pizza with mushrooms, olives, and, if I 'm feeling wild, corn.  Surprisingly yummy.Awesome pizza and service.

The crust is my favorite but the toppings are impressive as well.

Try the white pizza or the calazone (light ricotta), you'll thank me later.Ate here tonight, was sitting at the table next to another person who wrote a bad review.  The coals in their oven died out from over use, that's what happens when you are constantly moving pizzas in and out especially on a busy night.  The guys making the pizza's did a great job cranking out pies as fast as they could but you can only fit so many in the oven at 1 time.  The oven was not broken as another reviewer stated earlier.  She also stated that it took an hour for her two pizza's, funny, we ordered the same time as you, our pizza took 35 minutes and you received yours before we did.  I'm tired of people acting like it's the end of the world when your order takes a little longer than normal.  It's Friday night, the place is packed, you are there with friends and family, enjoy your time out together, or were you in a hurry to leave because your bratty son kept spilling his water and bumping into my wife's chair.  The server had informed us about the situation prior to our order just like she did to the other tables around us.  Pizza came out great as always and our server was very friendly and accommodating even when a 15 top of rowdy men were seated in her section.  For a corporate restaurant chain, the pizza is great.  1/2  carafe of wine and a large pizza our check was just over $30.  The location in DC ranch is beautiful, but you end up with snotty b!tches like the other reviewer tonight.  From what I recall she was in an 8 top with two children who couldn't stay in their seats, most of the time the entire party were on cell phones and nobody seemed to be conversing, I only saw 2 pizzas on your table along with 3 beers a salad and the rest glasses of water.  So as an 8 top, your check was probably around $60 which was  undoubtedly discounted after you made a scene complaining about how long it took.  I will definitely be back, the pizza is very good (much better than the Scottsdale quarter location), the staff is friendly, just sometimes the guests need to lighten up, if you wanted pizza in 30 minutes or less call dominoes.the rooms were a one star but the surprise was the restaurant up stairs looking over Fremont its called fire flight.  its a tapas bar but its the real deal we went at happy hour had amazing food just like what i use to have in Spain  for 6 people and 2 pitchers of sangria our bill was 100.  Best find of that city absolute amazing foodExceeded my expectations. For the price it was very nice. We stayed in room 816 and it overlooked the Freemont St experience. The front desk warned us it could be noisy but we were okay with that. We were out until 2 am every night so it didn't bother us. The room was very clean each day. Hash House a Go Go was delicious. We signed up to watch a 90 minute time share and received $100 in restaurant.com gift card, $100 slot play, and 2 nights free stay to use in the next 18 months (Vegas or Orlando) and we didn't purchase a time share. The pool area was nice but it has a lot of potential to be amazing. I would definitely stay again.Just finished eating here. this place looks classy even if it is a little small. service was great. I had the enchiladas verdes & my guest ordered the Enmoladas. My plate was delicious, the right amount of spicy & tasted very authentic. The enmoladas were good too, were more on the sweeter side, but savory. Yes portions are on the smaller side but the food/taste really made up for it.  We then had their flan for dessert and oh man it's exactly what flan should taste like. This place is so delicious I will definitely return for dinner (they offer different menus and more selection) .If you love Pinball, this place is Mecca.   I have fond memories of a younger me playing pinball and not worrying about anything in the world.   This is a special place in Las Vegas where you are sure to get a good pay-out for your quarters.  Heck, we had so much fun there and it only ended up running us about $5 per hour.   Where else can you get that much fun for the buck?

As a bonus, the guys who work there are very friendly and helpful.   On top of that, they keep these old machines in top working shape.   It's great to see these 10-20-30 or more year old machines working as good as new.   What a special treat.   And what's really a truly amazing bonus is that this place is non-profit.   That's right.   After their operating expenses are met, they donate the rest of the money to charity.   These guys are totally awesome!    

Way to go Pinball Hall of Fame.   Each trip to Sin City will now include a visit.

*** Update 13-Mar-07 ***

Ok, this place deserves 6 stars.   I went there last night to enjoy a few more games before a night of gambling.   What they do is leave the overhead lights off.   The lighting is coming from the games.   What a really cool way to play!   The whole room takes on this super mellow feel to it.    Great job!

**** Update 03 - June - 10 ****

Was back in Las Vegas last month and checked out the new location.  Wow... it's a much bigger place with more games.   That's pretty cool.   
One thing they are starting to do is to replace the old style light bulbs in the machines with cool white LEDs.   It gives the machines a warm, friendly glow and they draw much less current.   This place is still a small slice of heaven!   Good job guys!Jimbo DIED and went to PINBALL HEAVEN ! ! !

Pinball ALERT !
PINBALL Alert !
pinBall alErt !

This place is about one thing and one thing only:  PINBALL !!!  

I saved my 400th review for this gem.  

This would be Pinball HELL if I was stuck here with no quarters...

I should also mention I have a bi-coastal list of pinball spots here:  http://www.yelp.com/list_details?list_id=gGDHjDE7A5YYZVCctiC7yw
The closest (i would assume) to the Pinball Hall of Fame in LV is LUCKY Ju Ju in Alameda, Carlifornia (see: http://www.yelp.com/biz/0QlH001-SzzfwwuLoS8B7g ), which I hope to get to see for myself before heading back to NYC.

Why can't they have something like this in every major city in the United Staes? Pinball machines are works of ART in their own right from the translite work, to the cabinet art work, to the back box, and upon the playfield. I especially LOVE the art on the machines from the 50's. I think I've found my mission in life...

The Pinball Hall of Fame is about 20 minutes from the Strip if you're coming from the Mandalay Bay area.  Parking is plentiful in this non-descript strip mall.  On the two occasions I visited there were only a handful of people playing the various machines.  

Most of them are VERY well maintained, cleaned, polished, restored, and in excellent working order for machines that are on 24/7.  This place is a labor of love and it shows.  All proceeds go to charity - I believe the Salvation Army.  

I'll update the review eventually with all of the machines I got to play.  However my all-time favorite is: 

   + The Pinball Circus (see: http://www.ipdb.org/machine.cgi?id=4354 )

There are only two of these in the world and the Pinball Hall of Fame has ONE of them!!!  This machine is awesome!  It's unique in that Midway created a machine that was upright and vertical in the same way as other coin-op video games versus the traditional horizontal playfield.  There's three different playfields and at least 7 flippers on this particular pin.  Incredibly unique and incredibly fun to play for $1.00 per game.  I was able to get 2 free games based on one credit. All I know is that if this game were still on the open resale market or available brand new, I'd have one in my house!  I love it that much.  Too bad Midway is now out of business.  I really wish this machine was not just a limited prototype and was actually mass produced.  

Most of the old-school pinball machines (ie: electro-mechanical (EM's)) are $.25.  The solid-state machines are either $.50 or $.75 per game.  

Unfortunately, I didn't get to play all 170+ machines.  Each one has a different "personality" and set of rules.  I could easily waste the entire day at this place. The machines I typically gravitate to and would be compelled to collect are those produced in the 90's like: 

   + Addams Family (see: http://www.ipdb.org/machine.cgi?id=20 )
   + Scared Stiff (see: http://www.ipdb.org/machine.cgi?id=3915 )
   + Star Wars (see: http://www.ipdb.org/machine.cgi?id=2358 )

For those produced after the Year 2000 - all produced by STERN (see: www.sternpinball.com ): 

   + High Roller Casino (see: http://www.ipdb.org/machine.cgi?id=4502 )
   + The Simpsons Pinball Party (see: http://www.ipdb.org/machine.cgi?id=4674 )
   + Spiderman (see: http://www.ipdb.org/machine.cgi?id=5237 ) 

The Electro-Mechanicals (EM's) are a special breed of machine that doesn't have all the gadgets or high speed of the newer solid state machines.  The best value for your quarter can be found in the EM's.  While I have a preference for the later generation machines, it's so easy to appreciate the old school EM machines because of the great care put into maintaining and upkeep of these beautiful machines.  My favs:  
    + Kings and Queens (see: http://www.ipdb.org/machine.cgi?id=1381 )
    + others...

I absolutely LOVE the Pinball Hall of Fame.  If you're in Sin City and not a golfer, gambler, or shopper and looking for something unique to see and experience, check out the Pinball Hall of Fame!  

Absolute 5 STARS...
pix laters!  =PNew clean location, little hard to see with the small sign so LOOK as you are driving. Fun as always!I'm a regular here. It's good to go on dates, family outings, or even by myself. I'm fairly awful at pinball but love playing regardless, so it's a little bit more expensive for me than it seems to be for others, but I'm more than happy to grab 10-20 bucks in quarters to relive the arcade filled excitement of my youth. Tonight I went and noticed a few new machines including one from the '20s that flips pictures to create a moving scene (pretty neat!) and Tron. My favorite machine? The one you stand on that vibrates violently from the feet up to "rejuvenate" your legs. One of the ladies working behind the desk one day told me that she saw some little girls sitting on the vibrating platform giggling and just had to laugh because they had no idea what the weird sensation was.

Employees do not go out of their way to "serve" you, but are you really coming to the pinball museum to be served? If you have a problem with a machine, they are more than happy to help. I once dropped a bouncy ball that I won under a pinball machine that couldn't be reached and the guy working not only grabbed it with a broom, but gave me an extra for free. :) So no, they are not going to seek you out to be friendly, but they are most definitely not rude as stated in other reviews.

I love the Pinball Hall of Fame and am always happy to pump quarters into the machines. I always grab a few extra dollars in quarters for the fifty cent machines (tonight's haul of comic character figurines was impressive) and popcorn. I could spend all day here if my parties did not always drag me out.This place is incredible with the amount of dedication put forth in maintaining all of those pinball machines. On the website they have listed about 150 pinball machines plus other arcade games are also available for play as well. The location is well hidden and took me a second glance to finally realize where it was.

Anyway since I live here for the summer I love to nerd it up here playing all of these pinball games from the past. I actually own the P: HoF Williams Collection on the Wii so it was great to see half of those tables here available for play. Those tables would include Black Knight, Fire Power, Funhouse, Pinbot, and Space Shuttle.

P: HoF is truly a hidden gem here in Las Vegas.There are other arcades in Las Vegas, but this one is the granddaddy of them all.  They have everything from the oldest wooden pinball machines to ones that are surprisingly newly made.  Got all of my favorite video game cabinets too.  

You also need to visit the new store Gamers Paradise next door. You can play a few games in there For Free! Plus they have a huge selection of home consoles and games for sale.  

Be sure to get some snacks while at the Hall of Fame, both the money from them and the Hall of Fame arcades go to charity. How amazing is that? Have some good fun and do some good for people in need at the same time.  Best part of it is that they don't toot their own horn about it. So I'll toot it for them :)Went there twice in that weekend for desserts. The staff is very friendly and they remembered me when I came back the second time.

The dessert choices were awesome and the hard part was selecting which one to eat. I ended up with 3 mini cup cakes.I had a serious foodgasm when I had a piece of the Nutella Mille-feuille. The layers of puff pastry and nutella/cream goodness was mind numbing. Wow... Thanks to the server for recommending this since it was waaay to hard to choose between all the tempting treats on display.

Everything here looks - and I'm sure tastes - ridiculously good! I wish my bf and I weren't so full from brunch so we could try more but there's always next time.

Also, there are tons of food eye candy at JPP.  The cakes on display looked like they came straight out from those cake challenges in the Foodnet Work.  I wanted to take a mini wedding cake home to my sister for her anniversary but I didn't think it would survive the crazy Vegas heat.I love this place. It's a must visit whenever I go to Vegas. They have two locations - 1 in Aria and 1 in the Bellagio.  The one in Aria is bigger and nicer.  It reminds me of something you would see right out of a Dr. Seuss book.  

I've tried their chocolate, croissant, desserts, and this awesome spiced chicken panini sandwich.  It was sooooo gooooood!!! I can't wait to have it again the next time I return to Vegas! I also need to try their crepes.  I've heard great things and saw a lot of people order them.  

Be prepared to stand in line during peak hours.Just got back from Vegas and while I am not yet fully recovered.  I do remember that this was the best restaurant I ate at.  A formal, yet relaxed atmosphere, exceptional service, and amazing food. 

The price fixe was a pretty good deal - around $50 for an appetizer, entree, and dessert.  I had the ceasar salad, which was whole lettuce leaves covered in dressing and topped with homemade crutons.  A great starter.  

The entree was the star of the show.  I went with the chicken.  I thought it would be just a plain chicken dish, but this was honestly the BEST chicken I have ever had.  It was crispy on the outside but still tender and juicy on the inside.  The seasoning was a perfect combination of salt, pepper and other spices.  I am still amazed that chicken could be this good.  There were also mushrooms on the side that complemented the meal very well.

The scallops were HUGE and very good.  They did not taste fishy and pratically melted in your mouth.  

The dessert was a three scoop ice cream dish.  You can't go wrong with ice cream.  They also gave us a butterscotch mousse dessert that almost put me over the edge.

The wine list is pretty pricey, so I went with a glass of wine (Malbec).  It was a very generous pour - probably a glass and half, so that was a nice touch.

I HIGHLY recommend eating here.  I can't say enough good things about this place.You know what I loved about this buffet?  The fact that this was the most sanitary buffet I've ever been to!  There are no patrons sticking their hands into the food or putting food back into the serving platters.  No sneezing on the food or "taste tests!"  Many many thanks to the chefs that man the stations!  

What's also amusing are the bathrooms...  the trough designed sinks surely made me feel like I really chowed down - which I did.  Oink oink.I felt like this buffet was best described as "Grand".  I still haven't made my way to the Bellagio buffet yet but I am assuming that the Bellagio is the other Grand Buffet on the strip.  

Liked it alot and thought the food was fantastic.  Had to wait in line for awhile but good things come to those who wait right?  Well, there is a reason there is a long line.  I think buffets that are expensive are worth it if they give you a nice comfortable setting to sit in and offer some good eats.  Hell, when you are on vacation, you have to live it up right?  

As a local, you might not come here all the time but I think you should always treat yourself good once in a while.  Splurge a bit.  The higher than normal ceilings and their cool entrance in the middle are other things that make this place a TOP PICK in my book......This is the best Buffet in VEGAS!!! Every time I think about this place my mouth waters... Everything was so delicious and the atmosphere was really beautiful.Ate at the lunch buffet a while ago. I still say it's one of my top 3 favorite places I've ever eaten. I especially loved the tomato bisque soup. There wasn't anything at the buffet I didn't like. We were there on a monday for lunch in the fall and there was no line ... which helped us like it even more. Lunch was about $20 each which we though was a great deal because the food was great.Wow. I have not written a review for the buffet yet!
Caution: Is more pricey, but you get what you pay for.

Two words: Prime rib. The best. I love it.

I will tell you though, the Champagne lunch for an extra $7 is well worth it because they load you up! It wasn't one of those restaurant where they forget and you have to call a waiter and wait for them to come back. No. They refill it whenever it gets somewhat empty or half way empty if they're doing their rounds. COOL!

One of the best quality buffets out there. Trust me. My mom is Asian so I've been to my fair share. 

Tip: Since it takes about an hour wait. Why not get a late lunch, stand in line by 2PM, get in at 3PM and pay for the lunch price and at 3:30PM, they switch the lunch menu to the dinner menu? You get the best of both worlds! So genius I should have thought of it sooner! Foolish me...Best buffet for dinner compared with Bellagio's and Wicked Spoon buffet.
More variety, the only one with rib eye, the best desserts.
My wife is VEGETARIAN and she loved too.Loved the decor , loved the food, biggest strawberries I have ever seen!! one word.......WINNING!!!!!!!I've eaten here at least two dozen times, and bellied up to the bar for drinks somewhere in the vicinity of 100 times (hey, I used to live in Vegas!), so I'm reasonably well qualified to write a review of Fix.  Essentially a nightclub that happens to serve food, Fix is as much about what you look like and who you're with as it as about the food.  The room is gorgeous, and the curvy wooden ceiling which is the centerpiece of the restaurant supposedly cost about a million bucks by itself.  Almost as good looking as the physical space are the people who inhabit it.  Fix is always packed with some seriously good looking people (a large share of whom are celebrities of some sort) who come to fill up before going to out to hit the clubs.  

Given that I've spent the first half of this review talking about everything but the food, you'd almost expect it to a.) be beside the point, and b.) suck in a very expensive way,  So how is it?  Think comfort food meets nouveau rich (kobe chili cheese fries, truffled mac and cheese) that's very very well executed.  My recommendation is to go with meat, specifically the ribeye (get it sliced and seared), since the steaks here are aged USDA prime, and are actually better than what you get at Smith and Wollensky or the equivalent.   Desserts, punctuated by donuts that put Krispy Kreme to shame, are another high.  Bonus points for service that's essentially perfect and lacks the pretension usually found at places like these. Best of all, Fix has a late night menu they serve until 1am on weekends.

So in summary, it's not cheap, but if you like good food and good looking people, there's really nowhere better to go.

(PS - If you're a group of a good looking girls, call ahead and they'll give you some seriously special treatment.)Good friends and good food, what more could you ask for?

We thought the menu sounded good and pleased the palate of two picky eaters in the group (myself being one of them). I selected the kobe sliders for my entree becuase it was one of the more basic items and was about middle of the road on prices. I loved the presentation and it was a good-sized portion altogether.

The dessert was fantastic.The chocolate brownie and espresso milkshake were chocolately, but not too sweet. It was a great ending to a lovely meal.Cucumber Martini. The best martini i have ever had. Period. This dark seductive restaurant was filled with other delicious drinks (chocolate martinis) though I definitely recommend the cucumber martini. We did not eat here, though the food looked good. The bar staff was attentive and the place had a fun vibe to it.all the dishes we ordered were awesome!! the ahi tartare was delightful! it was mixed table side by our waiter.  i suggest getting the signature trios.  i ordered the kobe beef and was not disappointed! for dessert we ordered the root beer float and a fresh strawberry dish.  the root beer float was served with sassafras ice cream.  i thought it would taste funky but it was awesome and didn't overpower the float at all!!!!!  the strawberry dessert came with a balsamic vinegar sauce at the bottom of the plate as a design.  i thought it wouldn't go well with the strawberries but it was amazing!! the vinegar added a nice sweetness to the dish. wow! that was divine! i always tell my husband that we should drop in to the union square mm restaurant just for dessert.  it was that good!!!!Perfection. Amazing service from Lee. The food runners gave excellent and poignant descriptions of the food. The bussers were attentive and polite. The ambiance, elegant and comfortable. I love this place. Now, on to the food...

My wife and I chose the 5 course tasting menu for $115. What a deal! Everything was superb...just unreal! The stars of the show, however, were the truffle risotto with chestnut foam, and the beef cheek garnish that came with the "wagyu style" ribeye (on a side note: I don't like the term "Wagyu Style". It makes you think that you're getting something close to Wagyu. And while delicious, the beef here was not even close). We also ordered a side of foie gras rice with our entrees which, while delectable, didn't really have much foie gras flavor. 

Since we were just married the night before. the pastry chef sent out a congratulatory "pre-dessert" which, for all intents and purposes, was a snickers bar...the best friggin snickers bar you could ever imagine! Then the actual dessert course came: a trio of seasonal offerings...passion fruit panna cotta, marscapone cheescake, and the ubiquitous Michael Mina root beer float with sassafras ice cream and IBC root beer. Nuff said.

Perfect service, nearly perfect food, and a beautiful ambiance. Love this place.What can you say badly about a place that offers to charge your smartphone while you eat?

We try to visit Minas every time we visit Vegas. the food is fantastic. The tasting menu  - while getting long in tooth - is excellent value and gives a decent overview.  But go beyond tht menu for the really great choices. 

The wine list is comprehensive and the sommelier is a breath of fresh air -  non-condescending and full of trivia.Besides Nobu, this place was the only other restaurant that we truly enjoyed in Vegas. 

They have a special tasting menu which you can try if you go there between 5-7 PM which is a great deal. We were planning on ordering from it originally but we decided to pass on it and try the famous DB burger. 

For appetizers, we had raw oysters which were great. We wanted the foie gras but they only had the cold kind on the menu (something about transitioning to lighter foods as the weather gets warmer). This was a disappointment since there are so many raves about the foie gras in the reviews from other yelpers. At the end of the night, the restaurant manager said that they can usually make it still, so in the future, just ask him and they can try to accommodate the request. 

The burger came next and it didn't disappoint at all. I thought the portion was huge for a girl, perfect for a guy. The fries were great. I loved the combination of the meats in the burger with the foie gras, though I thought the portion of foie gras should have been bigger (it's about the size of a nickel- and it should be more like the size of a quarter so you can enjoy it more). 

For dessert, we had the floating island which was light and refreshing. They also gave us some free cookies and candies since it was our anniversary. 

The service was great! Paco took care of us. He was very attentive, and even gave us a copy of the menu to take home as a souvenir of our experience. He also told us about the waterfall shows (there is the frog, flowers and balls) because we weren't sitting near the window- and he wanted us to be able to come and watch them still. If you like that sort of thing- be sure to tell them when they seat you to sit you by the waterfall. 

So overall, a huge thumbs up from us- and a big thank you to Paco for being such a great waiter!I finally, FINALLY got to see this show last weekend when I was in town for my friends 30th birthday. It was the best show I have seen in Vegas thus far. Great musical talents! Anyone that can make awesome, rhythmic sounds come out of pipes deserve the credit. The band members are fantastic as well; Great costumes and stage design; A lot of comedy and audience interaction - and all this with not one word spoken. 

The Blue Men and the band hang around after the show for pictures and autographs - A dab of their thumb or hand to their head and bam! You have an automatic blue thumb or hand print autograph on your program, c.d. or face. 

I'm so glad I got to experience The Blue Man Group. I highly recommend this to everyone that rolls into Vegas and is looking for a memorable show.Possibly the best show I've seen! I wasn't expecting it to be so comical. Tons of fun, incredibly entertaining! If you enjoy drier humor, the subtle non verbal comedic relief then you will love the show. Clean, wholesome, a must see if you are in Vegas!!!My husband surprised me with tickets in the second row. First and second rows get ponchos since you never know what's going to jump out at you during this show. Going into it, I really thought this was going to be a lot of music, I didn't know it was somewhat of a comedy thing also, but that's a good thing! I really enjoyed the music and there is a ton of audience interaction. It was a great show for a great date night and I really enjoyed it!I loved the show.  I especially liked it when we got to stand up towards the end and danced and the balls on the ceiling dropped with teepee everywhere.  Fun!  The music was awesome.  Just makes me want to move!  Wish we could have danced the whole time.  

The only part I didn't like was the "date" act.  That was boring and pointless.  The rest of the show was fun and entertaining, as a show should be!  

My son saw one of the blue men after the show, and he drew on my son's face.  That was fun to interact with them.We stopped by this past sunday night after I found out a good friend was working there and he INSISTED that I stop by.  I'm actually glad I did.  I bumped into some other friends who used to live in SF so it gave us a chance to catch up.  Now, I'm not big on seafood at all but I will say, the drinks, potstickers and the chicken yakatori were all top notch (and my friends that ordered rolls said they were great).  It wasn't too packed either so we didn't have to wait at all, the music was good and we just had a good time overall.  Next time I'm in town, I'm definitely stopping through when we have more time instead of just stopping by right before we're hitting the clubs.  Thanks Shaun, see you in a few months.This is a review for their happy hour specials.
Yesterday, I aimed to enjoy RA's lunch specials with my friend and if it weren't for him arriving 30 minutes past 3pm, I wouldn't have discovered their great deals. 

We ordered the 'RA'ckin Rolls, Crunchy Calamari Roll, Viva Las Vegas Roll and the Pork Gyoza potstickers. Might I say, impeccable presentation and amazing taste! My friend also ordered the mango margarita and he lurved it! Guess I know what time I'm coming in for my next visit!Amazing works of art from chef Stratta!  He's as talented as he is humble.  The staff are so friendly and knowledgeable and the food just speaks for it's self.  Kudos to Alex and his team!The setting, service and steaks exceeded expectations and are among the best I've experienced. Dinner here was definitely a driving factor and the primary reason I planned my return trip to Vegas. I typically don't order steak but last year a filet here changed my life and convinced me that beef is possible of trumping all when prepared properly.

To celebrate a special occasion I made reservations in advance to secure a seat along the windows which allows you to enjoy the Bellagio fountains throughout your meal. Our server Beau set the bar for service. He was personable, knowledgeable and attentive without being overbearing.

He suggested a moderately priced wine which paired perfectly with the 8oz filet I ordered. Although the truffle mashed potatoes are delicious, they are sometimes offered with lobster, which is divine. 

This place is expensive, but true to the cliche "you get what you pay for" So if you're looking for an experience and not just a meal I highly recommend Prime. It just might change your perspective on culinary quality.Came here for my 5-year anniversary, and as always, they never disappoint. 

Just thinking about their mussels and braised beef short ribs makes my mouth water! 

Pinot brasserie is a must if you are in Vegas.Oh.. em... gee... can't go to Vegas without stopping here!!

I first ate at the world buffet 4 years ago when my mom and step-dad had their wedding dinner here.. and boy was I hooked from the start. 

Every food imaginable. Amazing selection of fresh food... and everything looks so good you will want to try it all. Mounds of crab legs (yum!), all kinds of other fresh seafood, steak, prime rib, ham, chicken, all kinds of sides, sushi, Chinese, Japanese, Italian, Mexican, American, any kind of food really.

Last time I was in Vegas for 3 days me and my best friend went to the world buffet 4 times!! (breakfast, lunch, dinner). Best value is to get a buffet hooper pass (around $40) which is valid for 24 hours from time of purchase and good for unlimited buffet eating at any of Harrah's 7 buffets. We literally went down the strip eating at 5 of 7 of these buffets, making sure we hit this one up one last time before our time was up. 

You have to try it yourself before you judge based on 2 or 3 star reviews...TL;DR: THE BEST BUFFET ON THE PLANET.

Long version: Came here using Buffet of Buffet pass on Christmas Day. Was a madhouse, but since there were two in our party we didn't have to wait as long as the large tourist groups did.

The food was delicious. Now, it's a buffet, so don't expect everything to be like a made-to-order restaurant. But they did have m-t-o items! Each buffet station is a different region. You could go here every day for every meal and not try everything on offer for a week--there is THAT much food.

There's a Mongolian-style grill in the Asian cuisine area. There's sushi, Italian, American... but the desserts are the best. Ten different kinds of gelato, cakes, pies, cupcakes... yeah. You could spend half your day trying to eat everything here.

PS, use Buffet of Buffets pass--it makes all the gorging well worth it!Bought a great deal on Groupon. Usually dinner is $32 per person, but with Groupon came out to $22 per person! Plus, you get a bottle of wine of your choice!

There is a huge variety of food. It's just not possible to try everything, unless you are subhuman! Roast beef, prime rib, turkey, chicken, tacos, ribs, salads, sushi on and on and on. They have italian ice cream and a lot of desserts to choose from.  I've been to other buffets in Las Vegas and can safely say this is top 3 in my opinion.

Service was great. Our dirty dishes were removed quickly, water refilled and it was all done with a great attitude. The line to enter for dinner went very quickly.

No complaints from me.Great place for dinner. We love the ahi tuna tacos. Good atmosphere as well.One of my favorite restaurants!  Have been a couple times and have always had at least adequate service and amazing food.  Lobster tacos (surf & turf, no steak- I don't eat red meat) are to die for!!!This place is yummy!!! Hubby and I came here recently for a weekend lunch around 1pm, place was packed but the wait was only about 15 minutes. Valet parking is there to help as the parking lot is small.  They have inside and outdoor seating, and even with the high temps the patio is cool with the misters. Service was excellent and friendly and the menu had a good amount of variety.  The kitchen is small but they have a real good handle on getting the food out.  I enjoyed the short rib tacos but the star for me was the kale salad.  Outstanding.  Hubby had the burger and said it was the best that he had ever had.  A bit pricey for lunch, around $15-20 plus drinks and/or appetizers but well worth it.  I would not hesitate to come back!Food is awesome!  Fun, different, innovative...but not to the point of being weird.  Just tasty!  I would be willing to go just for the drinks, appetizers and cookies, but then I'd be missing out on the amazing entrees.  I just love everything here!  Not the place for a quiet, solemn talk or something.  But perfect for a fun evening with friends or a date.  I want to have my birthday dinner here next year! :)Parasol Down is usually a place I take out-of-town guests who I want to wow with New Vegas splendor (while still being supremely lazy).  

You have to take the escalator down, and the wait for a table outside is typically 10-20 minutes.  But you can sit inside and have your first drink, looking up at the gorgeous parasols spinning slowly around...and around...and around....

OK.  so.  The girl will call your name, give you a seat on the patio...and there you stay for the next two hours.  The drinks are steep, but pretty damn good.  I'm a fan of the pearasol something-or-other...but have never had a bad drink there.

The real reason for hanging out on this patio though (besides the swanky music piped in and the comfy couches) is the gorgeous waterfall view and the "show" that plays out over the course of the evening.  It's quite difficult to describe...there are floating glowing orbs, dancing silhouettes, color shows...words really don't do it justice.  Random things come up out of the water, and from behind the waterfall...all in all, a subtle and entertaining backdrop to a great conversation with your guests.where do I start...I have been there now a dozen times and am never disappointed.  Great food-great portions.  We tend to always order the Red Chile Roast even if it's not a dinner entree, it's taken home and mixed with eggs for tasty breakfast burros...seriously 4 meals.  The ceviche is light and fresh, the North Central Chicken is dee-lish, the Pork Osso Buco totally awesome.

Cute patio, great service, kick ass food...and I just heard there is a brunch menu on the weekends...all around winThis has to be one of the BEST shows I've ever seen!  I highly recommend  this show, is a must see in Las Vegas!WHOA - all I have to say is the Cirque folks that do the creations, what imaginations they have (or serious drug intake) KIDDING. :)

I really didn't know what to expect, I refrained from reading a lot out it, I am a Cirque fan so I knew it would be good and they didn't let me know.

Decent ticket price actually, compared to other shows and it's at the Wynn - - oh and while walking out of The Wynn,  Justin Timberlake strolled right by.

I recommend buying tickets to this show BEFORE you go to Vegas, don't wait until you get there to buy show tickets or you could miss out.Beautiful show; loved the intimate settling.

Reminds me of O show but the stage is a round circular shape; lot smaller & more intimate feeling making you feel like you're closer to the stage. 

Vivid & passionate colors used throughout this show.

Loved the beautiful flowers that bloom at the end of the show.

Highly recommend this show; this is one of the better Cirque Soleil shows in Vegas. =)

FYI, you can buy discounted tickets on day of the show at Tix4Tonight but you have to go in person to buy them; they have plenty of booths & locations within casinos so don't worry.There is a reason why this is the best show in Vegas. Went there with my family and sat in the spalsh zone. It indeed is like a dream, I would love to give out more details but don't want to steal the thunder. All I will say is dont miss this show

Even when sitting in the 1st row.of.spalsh.zone we hardly got wet, so dont carry any cover/rain protections.. just sit back and enjoy.One of the most amazing things I've ever seen; a beautiful and inspiring work of art.  I laughed, teared up, got chills, gasped and got rushes of adrenaline.  A total blast!

Loved the narrative, the context of dreaming was so well done and contemplating the logistics alone is an entertainment.Came here for lunch after a long night at the strip and a few hours of rest..service was quick and the dudes were friendly...the place was clean food was great..butt afterall it is in n out hahaI've been to Vegas many, many times and I've tried many places to eat.  The Paris buffet is by far the best value for your money.  I go at least once on every trip.  Brunch, dinner...it's all great!  The desserts are a must!  Do not miss out.  (I'm not big on desserts, by the way).  Creme brulee is very well executed and one of my favorites.  The service has always been friendly and attentive and the atmosphere is what I expect in Vegas.  ALWAYS A GREAT AND SATISFYING EXPERIENCE...from someone who's not so easy to please.We visited more buffets than I'd like to admit during our last vacation. This one was definitely the best and surprisingly a lot of fun for two Americans who lived in France once upon a time. The food was very good and a wonderful variety. We even got the sample some regional styles we hadn't tried before. The crepe bar was my favorite part and the decor was a lot of fun.I fell in love with the dim lighting and sexy decor while walking by and I vowed I would be back for dinner before we left our weekend stay at the MGM. Well vows are not meant to be broken and this place met all my expectations and then some... 

The service was amazing, loved the bread basket, food was delicious, and the drinks did not disappoint.

I had the mediterranean sea bass and it was simply divine!!! Keep in mind mediterranean sea bass nothing like chilean sea bass which is my favorite of the two... However, they mediterranean sea bass still rocked my taste buds!

My friend had the roasted chicken and boasted it 5 stars!!! 

Everything was perfect at Fiamma Trattoria and this place doesn't deserve anything less than 5 stars!I love this place!  Lots of books, and friendly librarians can help you with whatever you need.  The new self check out machines are amazing you can put up to four books on the table and it checks them out all at once.  Especially helpful on a big trip :).

If you need a quiet place to work or study head upstairs to the fifth floor, tons of books, and even better desks with plugs so you can plug in your laptop and work.  Make sure you take a break and enjoy my sons favorite part the amazing views.  He loves to stand at the windows and see everything.My friend pretty much forced and me to go to the show last night for my 24th birthday.. And I'm so glad that she did! I had a ball! The guys are hot (especially Matt) and the interaction with the crowd is amazing! It's not just a strip show, it's real entertainment! Highly recommendedJust go there and see. You gonna love it. Make sure you sit in the first rows and preferably have big bachelorette sign and then you are up for a treat;)So, if you're reading this, you're probably looking for a restaurant with great prime rib. When I was in Vegas I wanted a good, substantial, reasonably priced prime rib, and I got it at the loft. I'm sure, there's better prime ribs in the world, but if you want high quality, bang for your buck, I recommend this place. Here's a cut and paste from their menu.

Roast Prime Rib

season with sea salt and cracked pepper then slow-roast for your dining pleasure.
The Orleans Cut

I got the beefeater, and it was fantastic, but couldn't finish it. My wife got the gambler, and she couldn't finish it. My father in law got the chicken, he liked it, but it was a weird choice. Anyways, nothing bad to say, good stuff.I don't write reviews of things too often.  I guess maybe because I'm a little lazy. I REALLY have to like or dislike something to write a review. And we definitely liked Fleur de Lys.

Simply put, it was the best meal my wife and I have ever had. The Fillet was out of this world. I've never had red meat like this. It just melted in my mouth. Everything was perfectly cooked.

The wait staff amplified this experience to another level. I believe our waiter was William. Incredibly knowledgable, which was helpful with the wine tasting. He was attentive without being overbearing.

Overall it was the best cullinary experience we've had. I can't compare it to too many other high end restaurants in Vegas, but we are from the Bay area and are not strangers to good food. I would HIGHLY recommend it to anyone. We will definitely be back.As a fan of Fleur de Lys in the City, this was our choice for a great meal in LV. We found the food to be outstanding and the service great without being either overbearing or pretentious. 
The reservation was handled efficiently and with a minimal wait. We erred by not allowing for a relaxing time between dinner and The Beatles up the strip, the staff was able to ensure prompt service without feeling rushed.This, along side of its big brother next door, are the best restaurants in Vegas. The food is mind blowing. Service is as good as it gets. The atmosphere is top notch. 

One thing about the menu. Everything is good. But if you want to taste the world's greatest mashed potatoes, you will find them there. 

If you hit it big and have enough extra money in your pocket to either buy used Kia or have dinner, treat yourself and go here. Its insanely expensive. If you are a foodie like me, it is well worth it. Does not get much better than this.Dinning at L' Atelier de Joel Robuchon is a culinary treat unequaled and definitely worth the experience and expense. We dined at the counter bar which provides a great view of the kitchen and the chefs working together to create what we called food art as each course was meticulously prepared and provided an incredible presentation. We where seated promptly at the time of our reservation and service was excellent and our waiter was excellent at explaining each course we received. We ordered the seasonal discovery prixfixe which included several courses including awesome Foie gras stuffed free-range quail with mashed potatoes a half bottle of French Champagne rounded out each course. A definite treatI haven't given 5 stars to any place in a while, but I just can't resist it with Salt Lick BBQ!!!  I went with friends while checking out the Red Rock Casino in the Summerlin area of Vegas, and truly found a gem!  We were lucky enough to come during the Monday Night Football special from 7-9pm which featured ALL YOU CAN EAT BBQ for only $20!

You should've seen the look on our faces when we walked to the buffett table and found stacks of ribs, bbq chicken, beef brisket, sausages, chicken tenders, onion rings, potato salad, and fruit!!! I asked the waiter if I was in heaven, and he told me I was!  Wowzers, my stomach and taste buds orgasmed as I imagined all the possibilities of eating all that food! 

Amazingly, the food turned out tasting better than it looked!  The ribs and chicken were my favorite, and the meat would just drip off the bones! The warm moist juciy bbq goodness topped with the tangy house bbq sauce and drizzled with spicy pepper sauce was to die for.  DROOL... I am getting hungry just thinking about it!!!  

I seriously almost lost it while I was eating and much of my meal ended up on my face but I didn't care!  

The wait staff was totally awesome too!  Funny thing happened when my Invisalign trays were accidentally thrown away because I keep them in a napkin when I eat!  You should've seen the look on my bbq covered face when I realized it was gone!  My friends couldn't contain themselves when they saw my face and busted up laughing, while I ran to the waitress and asked her to dig into the trash for my aligners...and she went and found them!  and she was nice about it too!    So i had to slip her a little sumthin-sumthin for her trouble.  $5!!! 

All in all, please go eat here if you want to experience a gastrorgasm.  And don't forget to use the hot pepper sauce.  MMMMMMM^100000Katie our server was great, she blabbed on about smoking meat and sausages but was very attentive and pleasant. The riiibs were great and came out very quick, everything was good grub and grogAfter losing pocket aces at green valley ranch, I needed a place to get my hopes back up and lucilles sure did that.  AMAZING food and service.  The peanut slaw is to die for.Yum - Barbecue!  Brought an out-of-town friend to the barbecue for lunch and it was awesome.  I had the barbecued chicken sandwich and the flavor was right on and the chicken was tender, and the bun was very fresh.  We had ribs as an appetizer and they were very Delicious and the meat just fell off the bone.  They have a wonderful children's menu with a variety for the little ones to choose.  I love the ambiance of Lucille's - I am so glad we came here before she left as she bought 3 bottles of barbecue to take home to California.  Thanks for a great lunch and thanks for the great service.Plenty of food, fresh and good quality. That is a good restaurant about.What?!?! Only ten reviews?  That's not cool but this place is. When I did my first triathlon I reluctantly went here to get what I needed and I expected some kind of elitist attitude. You know like, we have done ultramans and your but a lowly Olympic middle age nothing. Not even a little bit. They didn't care if I was doing my first sprint or my one hundredth ironman. What they DID care about was consistent good customer service. They also listened to all my silly little first time concerns and addressed them. I love this place and now that I no longer live in Arizona. Miss them horribly!I've got at least thirty people hooked on ycs! They need to come to phoenix the foods worth my hour drive but, I hate the expensive gasThis place is ammaaazzzeeballllss! I had the bone in filet mignon, to DIE for! The mac & cheese, pigs in blanket, Ahi and their beautiful beverages! Not a bad thing about this place for me, simply amazing. And the dessert! Oh my.. try the raspberry filled donuts, you will melt. highly recommend this place.Ah yes. The good life.

Just finally had Pita Jungle for the first time. Read a lot of reviews about it. Friends bragged about it. Did some research online. Then I decided to order my lunch online since I only had an hour for lunch.

I ordered the Mediterranean Salad with a side of Mixed Beans.

Salad....divine. Golden raisins. I got mine with double chicken. Dressing wasn't necessary. Enough flavor in the vinegar and light oil. I only ate hlf of this thing because it was DAMN huge.

The mixed beans were interesting. I thought it would be a small portion. Turns out it was for a family of 14. Ok.....I'm overdoing it a bit. Family of 4. Amazing mix of pinto, lima, northern, etc. Fantastic flavors.

I'm coming back. Short review? Yes. But keep in mind, I ordered my food, picked it up, met my friend's parents, ate, and wrote this review all in one hour.

Order ahead online for pickup. 

Best. Place. Ever.We dined here this past Sunday to indulge in their Easter Bunch which was absolutely decadent.  The selection and the caliber of the food was divine as unlike other buffets every item was fresh and flavorful.  The service was exceptional as every waiter was attentive yet not too intrusive.  My toddler loved the Easter Bunny as well as being able to roam around the outside patio, yet none of the staff complained as rather they were very warm and entertaining.  We would definitely return for their regular weekend brunch.We ate the breakfast for couple of days, the food was good and the fruits were super freshOfficially my favorite place for breakfast now.  Those crepe omelettes are some serious stuff!!!  It was funny..we had such a difficult time picking what to eat on the menu cuz everything looked so damn good..it was borderline stressful.  But what's the big deal??  We're going back next week!Huge portions, plates are enough for two. Definitely get the banana muffin as a side (comes with most entrees). Great coffee, very friendly staff. And yes, the ranch potatoes are awesome, don't substitute it with fries no matter what your kids say.Still great all these years after the Rachel Ray review. I ventured to the Hawaiian section at the back of the menu. The Portuguese sausage with eggs, sticky rice, and a banana nut muffin (of course!) was delish. The sausage was juicy and well grilled. It's a great off-the-strip brunch spot.

...and I'm writing this at the restaurant using their free wifi!Yum Yum! Great breakfast, great service, homey and friendly. This will be our choice from now on when in Las Vegas.Loved it! Awesome waiter, service and food. Big portions for great price. Yummy food. I got chile relleno omelet. Oh and I got to use a coupon buy one get one free. I got the coupon from this lil book all cabs carrySin City is the playground for to-be-brides, burned-out college students, and exotic dancers galore.  But with the bright lights and a full schedule of gambling, shopping, and drinking you definitely need to start your day right with the most important meal of the day--breakfast. Egg & I is a local favorite and contrary to the restaurant's name they do serve entrees san eggs. *gasp* 

The offering:
*Reuben Sandwich w/ Fries: The meat was perfectly seasoned between two toasted slices of bread. mmMmmm... Oh and they gave an extremely generous offering of french fries. yum yum! 
*Fender Blender: Some type of egg and crepe contraction which was light fluffy and all around delicious. It came with an asian-inspired sauce which complimented the main course perfectly. Oh and the potatoes were spot-on!   
*Florentine Omlette (Daily Special): Ironically the daily special was not special at all . Instead it was a complete epic fail in my party.  Way too cheesy as the produce was drowning in the gooey sea.   

The food is great, the price is right ($8 average entree), and I'm definitely coming back!I go to Las Vegas a lot for vacation, and I frequently rent a car so I can get off the Strip a bit. Until recently, I didn't really know of anywhere to get a good breakfast off-Strip. Then I found the Egg & I and now I eat there. Every. Time.

The food has always been delicious. The banana nut muffin is to die for and if you tell them it's your first time at the restaurant, they'll give you one for free. I love free things.

The portions are huge and - how shall I put this delicately? - perfect for when you're hung over. My friends and I ate here the morning after the Rock & Roll Half-Marathon last December and it was like being in hangover heaven. 

If you live in LV, or you're visiting and have a car, go to the Egg & I. Heck, it's even worth the cab fare. Trust me.Eggcellent! We've been twice and enjoyed every bit of this great breakfast place! The place is packed and there is always a wait, but 15 minutes of my time is fine by me as long as I am going to enjoy the food. If you know my reviewing you will see that service, and location are not heavy factors in my rating. I am a total foody, so what is most important is the taste, the quality, and selection of foods offered. What I ordered this time was the Bandito omelette, I enjoyed it. The last time I ordered the Chile relleno omelette, it was delicious! I liked it more than the Bandito. it came with a banana but muffin, which I finished even I told myself to fight the temptation. my kids ordered the strawberry stuffed French toast, I forget the name of it but it was stuffed with cream cheese and strawberries. they wanted to lick the plate. When we go to Vegas we won't have to think twice about it, we will be there.Pauli from ATL checking in here.... just for a bit of nostalgia...

I used to live in Phoenix a few years back, and of all the places I miss eating at, this is #1 on my list.  I remember how I first heard of the place.... I was over at a friend's house in Scottsdale having a few beers after work, and remember asking him what his favorite Mexican restaurant in Phoenix was.  My friend, who had more than just a few beers in him, stared at me all glassy-eyed, got right in my face and said... "Cheeeeno Banddddeeedo!!"  As I backed up a bit, thinking my friend had too much to drink (he had, for sure), I wondered... hmmm...the Chinese Bandit?  What the hell is that place about?!?  Or is he just f***ing with me?  So, I asked him what kind of food they serve there... And, as he did his best to focus on me, when his eyes hit mine, there was this long pause.... and he had this expression on his face that I can't forget... I wasn't sure if he was having trouble putting it into words or if he was sh***ing in his pants.   And then he put his hands together, like a nutjob working a Rubik's cube.... and said, "They... dooo... things... like.... egg-foooo youngggg burrritos and jaaaade red chicken tacossssss...."..... as he gave me another crazy-ass look (the kind that tells you it's time to say goodnight and get outta there - which I did)....

So, a few days later, I remembered his drunken explanation of Chino Bandido and thought I would go check the place out.... And from that point on, I was hooked.   Egg foo young burritos indeed!   And jerk fried rice!   And those refried black beans with fire-in-the-bungholio sauce mixed in.... Yep, those will burn you twice... All served in a giant disposable aluminum baking dish... And you got that combo, along with a soda and tip for about $10!!!   WOW!!  

At that time, I had never seen anything like it before, and I still miss eating there more than any of my favorite old haunts in Phoenix.... I wish somebody would franchise one out to Atlanta - I would be the first customer in the door on opening day, guaranteed....This place was actually a lot cooler than I thought it was going to be.

When I went they were also showcasing an Area 51 exhibit which I also saw.  This museum I think is owned by the Smithsonian, so you got the story that the government wants you to hear.  I personally laughed at a few of their shenanigans.  It was worth seeing though.

The Atomic museum was really cool and very educational.  They had a lot of cool displays and a video feature which was cool.  It is a walk through type of thing, unguided at your own pace.  At the end they had a giant beam from the World Trade Center, which I felt was unrelated, but it still has a somber feel to it.Stunning views, French Bistro interior, delicious food and wine, do you want me to keep going?  A little bit of Paris right in Madison.  If you are looking for a fun and romantic spot, this would be it. 

Service was spectacular and didn't miss a beat, food was presented beautifully and my eyes did not deceive my taste buds or stomach. 

Happy Hour specials were perfect.  White or red house wine (delectable), $3.00 Stella's, oyster specials, sausage plate, warm olives and crusty french bread. 

Sardine Burger was unbelievably delicious and moist. Frites were perfectly seasoned.  Next time I have to get the mussels!Beautiful location overlooking the snow covered lake. My party was lucky enough to be sat near the patio, with the sun shining in. 

My party started with these chocolate/walnut pasties that honestly were out of this world. I'm not the biggest chocolate fan, but this dark chocolate was not overly sweet nor bland. Perfect.
I ended up ordering the House Burger with frites on recommendation from a friend who frequents quite a bit and it was fantastic and presented beautifully. Definitely a large helping of burger, frites and a side salad.

The waiter was quite attentive, and extremely patient in regards to our late party guest. Did not make us feel rushed or guilty, and always came to check in with a smile. 

Great service, food, atmosphere, and location. Just be sure to reserve a table, I've been told, especially for Sunday brunch.How does this place not do better than #24 on rating  in Madison ??
Wow 
Caesar and orange and  water cress salad 
Scallop appetizer with rhubarb jam !!  (Amazing) 
Sea trout entree (cooked to perfection..) with haricot verts and potato - 
Everything was great 
The chocolate ganache with hazelnut crunch and caramel looked amazing but we just didn't have the room !! Wish we could have !! 
You won't be disappointedThe customer service was outstanding! And my coffee was delectable! The ambiance, music, decorations, & design of the seating area was optimal; stylish and functional (and plenty of space)! The bathroom was also really nice! I'm only here for three days but plan on going back! :)Great food!  Great service!My husband and I have been to countless BBQ restaurants in California, Nevada, and now Arizona.  Bobby Q's is BY FAR the best BBQ we have ever experienced!!

The food is incredible, and the service is just as good!On a return trip from Sky Harbor, we stopped there, at our daughter's request, to eat.  That meal was the best BBQ meal ever.   We shared about 5 different meats (sausage, pork ribs, beef ribs and brisket, and chicken) with several sides, including mac and cheese and pecan cole slaw.  The beef ribs were OUTSTANDING!   Would definitely return.Incredible BBQ. Not nearly as good as Bryan's Black Mtn BBQ in Cave Creek, but 2nd best in Phoenix.Probably the best BBQ place I've ever eaten at and this includes Phil's BBQ in San Diego.

I ordered the Whole Hog Heaven and everything was perfect. Love the BBQ sauce, the ribs (even the beef) were fall-off-the-bone. The sides were great as well. Lots of food for the money.

Service was very friendly and even the manager was checking up on us.

The interior and exterior of the restaurant are also very nice.FANTASTIC! Not just the food either. Service was impeccable. The bartender, Jo, took care of us at a booth in the bar during happy hour and was superb. Not only was she incredibly friendly her knowledge of their menu was impressive!

While we sat inside due to the heat they do have a fantastic patio that I'm sure fills up quick during the patio friendly time of year. Inside there is a bar area which includes a few booths as well as a large open area restaurant. 

We shared their brisket quesadilla off of the HH menu. It was very large and quite tasty. Brisket was very tender. They make their own guacamole which is served along side the quesadillla along with salsa and a bbq sour cream.

I had the (award winning) Smokehouse burger and was not disappointed. It was very juicy and had great flavor to it. I'm not usually a fan of barbecue sauce on my burgers but this burger is definitely the exception! I chose the mac and cheese of my side and let me tell you, the best I've ever had! Don't tell my grandma I said that!  I'm talkin stick to your ribs good. I'm drooling right now just thinking about it.

They also give you fresh baked donuts in your way out as a thank you. Warm and delicious, I will definitely be back.My friends and I were in Arizona for a couple of days and had the pleasure of trying Bobby Q's. Between the three of us we split a hog's heaven and baby back ribs, which we mostly devoured. Do not underestimate the hog's heaven. It is massive and delicious. I particularly enjoyed the st. Louis ribs.
It was overall a great experience, and our waiter Rishad was a delight. 9/10 would dine here again.The food is AMAZING and affordable! Best BBQ in Phoenix! I come here every time I'm in town. The service is great too. Jessica went above and beyond to make our dinner enjoyable.I really like the atmosphere and food at this place. We eat there all the time for work, and I have yet to eat a bad meal. The service is great. I would highly recommend it for anyone.A coworker of mine highly recommended this place last year when I told him I was headed out to Tempe for spring training. I didn't get a chance to come last year but I made it a point to check it out this year. I was able to make a same day reservation for Saturday evening through the yelp app and I'm so glad I did because the wait was going to be about an hour otherwise. We waited less than 10 minutes to be seated. 

Our server Tiffany was great, we told her it was our first time so she took the time to give us history on the restaurant and she gave us her recommendations. The corn bread was so yummy and moist. My fiance and I shared the whole hog heaven, which comes with two meats, two ribs and 3 sides. For $40 not bad at all, we didn't finish our ribs and meat (there was a lot for two.) The sides could have been a little bigger, we devoured the mac and cheese and mashed potatoes. The mashed potatoes were so creamy and flavorful. 

I usually prefer baby back ribs over the St. Louis but in this case we agreed the St. Louis were better. The pulled chicken was my favorite, it wasn't the typical chicken covered in bbq sauce. It had some other flavor I can't describe but it was amazing! We walked out of here stuffed, I almost needed to be carried out. The home made donuts at the end were a nice touch, even though I was full I couldn't stop eating them because they were so light/fluffy and bite size. Definitely took advantage of the 10% for checking in. Saved us 10 bucks, I'll take it!! I'll be back next year when I'm in town.Im not a dessert person but I cant help but eat a red velvet or boston dream from this place every time im in las vegas. Its pretty pricey but its worth it. A must try if your a dessert person or just want something sweet to eat...!If you can afford this place.... try this place once in your life.... 

It comes with the following:

It's nutts but insane pricey... about $1800 and up per night  =)So I finally went there for dinner. Their pizza is amazing!!! We had 3 different types and all were stunning especially the roasted corn! The crust is out of this world. They also have a great sangria which i had a few too many of.....oops o:). 
If you are going to go at night with more then 2 people, I would suggest making reservations and they do have avalet but you can usually find a spot on the north side of Campbell and 40th st. 
If you live in the Valley this is a definate MUST!!!!Amazing breakfast and chill atmosphere. Besides the horrible parking, if I could go here everyday, I would!Lgo..lgo..l...g..ooooooooo!! This place is always amazing. The pizza is always great...amazing burgers and salads as well.  the grocery store is attached next door and is a great place to pick up your favorite drink, Tammie coe cupcake, or small gift. Also a great breakfast! One of the easiest 5 star reviews.Wait a second...I have not written a review!  This is nuts!!!!!

Anyways...I adore this place.  LGO and the pizzeria are my favorite places in the world...lol...I am here at least 4-6 times per week.  It is nuts!  Anyways..the reason I am here all the time is because it is FABULOUS!!!!  This place can never go wrong!  The orange and fennel salad it amazing!  It is the perfect mix and each bite and a delight in your mouth and to your taste buds!  I often get this salad through out the week.  I love the kale and quinoa salad too!  It is my go to salad.  I am obsessed with the avocado pizza with prosciutto and goat cheese and the roasted corn pizza with prosciutto.  I wish I could get enough but I cannot!  The ambiance is awesome! Mr.Lynn is a genius and made this place so welcoming and open.  I love how its so laid back and romantic at the same time.  The parking is difficult, but you expect that since it is so popular!  Now the Peanut Butter Pie!!!  OMG OMG OMG!!  There are no words...it is DELICIOUS!!  I try to refuse every time but I cannot.  I really enjoy the sangria.  The wine selection is great!  I just love this place!!!!A friend of mine recommended this place as we are visiting here from Minneapolis.   Besides the great music and nice vibe, the food was amazing.   Both me and my bf are gluteen free and their gluten free crust was delicious. :-)Somehow i have gone by whole entire life without going or even hearing much about of La Grande Orange Pizzeria. After always seeing great reviews on my Yelp home page I decided that i had to go and give it a shot!  None of us in our group had been there before so we had no idea what to expect. We all had a fantastic time at LGO!
When we showed up we had to wait 20 minutes so we went next door to the grocery store, the time flew by while we where over there. With all the things to look at, it was the fastest 20 minutes of my life. 
Our food was beyond delicious and our service was great! I cannot say anything bad! If you haven't been before you gotta go! I will defiantly be backI can't believe I have lived in Scottsdale for 3 years and just recently visited Penzey's. I needed file spice for Gumbo. File can be hard to find outside of the Bayou, and they had it. The prices are surpirisinly low for the quality and specialization they have. I ended up buying about 6 little spice jars, they have all had great flavor so far. I will definitley be going back when I can spend more time. The employees are very friendly and helpful as well!We are from out-of-town and we stayed in Madison for two days.  Captain Bill's was good, but pricey.  The view was great!   Best clam chowder ever, hands down!  Amazing chocolate moose type pie.   We'll return in the future!I've never watched a Cardinals game here.  However, I've watched 2 Fiesta Bowls and been to several gun shows here.  I really like this place, especially for the Fiesta Bowl.  The place is packed to the gills and it doesn't feel uncomfortable.

Tailgating on the lawn area for the Fiesta Bowl is fun too.  There's 2 major tailgates and plenty of room to accommodate the thousands of people coming to party.

The private suites are very spacious and nice with ample seating and have great views of the field.  Also, the food in the suites is very good.  A comfortable place to watch a football game.

For gun shows, there's plenty of room for parking and it's spacious on the main floor, so you don't feel too crowded when you're at each vendor booth.

Overall, this facility is top notch.  Can't wait to come back for another event.

Return Factor - 100%Awesome. Awesome. Awesome.

Be prepared to drop some cash, but it will be worth it. Excellent, well-prepared, delicate, well-thought out dishes. We came with a huge party for my friend's bachelorette party and let the waiter order for us. 

The highlight was the tuna tartare. Crispy jalapenos gave it an excellent spice and texture and the sauce was excellent. The lychee martinis are like candy. 

Great atmosphere too. During dinner, the Treasure Island pirate performance took place and we watched part of it from the balcony of the restaurant. The servers were great and the waiters tolerant of all the sexual harassment that came their way from our party. ;)Absolutely love this place. My friends and I have made it a tradition to have either breakfast or lunch here any time we visit Vegas. Great food, great service, they have a large menu with anything and everything you could think of. You get a decent view no matter where you are seated. One side you see the Bellagio garden and the other is the fountain. The only downside is there is almost ALWAYS a line to get seated, but it does move pretty quick. Worth the wait!You know, considering the casino, this place is pretty good. I cam here for both dinner and lunch. Surprisingly enough, they had dim sum on a Monday during lunch (?), which I thought was normally a weekend thing. I suppose that they get so many people (being in Vegas and all) plus all the Chinese tourists that they can afford to do so.

Their Chow Fun is exceptionally good (I always order it and use it as a judge for Chinese restaurants). They translated it into "Rice noodle." This was not as... err... random as their "Wrinkled Beans..." It doesn't sound appetizing, but it's name in other restaurants is "Dry Braised String Beans," or something similar. Both of these dishes are good. I also tried their lamb and duck, both were good (if somewhat overpriced).

Their service is pretty good too, considering it could be a lot worse. They serve hot tea automatically like a Chinese restaurant should. Dim sum was kind of slow when I went with only 3 carts and a few waiters with trays (but again, since it was a weekday, that's to be expected).

The super high rating is due to the fact that it is literally in the middle of the casino. It's not some fusion crap that other casinos on the strip sell. Nor is it some Panda Express imitation. Nope. No longer must I take a trip to Chinatown to get my fix. I can play my Monopoly slots, place my sports bets, grab some Chow Fun with my winnings, and then lose it all on craps... all on the same floor. Now that's Vegas....I wish I could shop here all the time because they have my favorite types of food and the quality of their food selection is second to none.  They have the best liquor and wine selection!  I love their meat and seafood selection because they have the premium cuts and freshest seafood...i once got these enormous prawns and I could have never got them anywhere else.  They have an amazing produce area too...they have sushi prepared by a sushi chef and its all fresh...they have awesome pizza and prepared meals...they have fabulous pastries that I would die for lol...and of course they have all those little things and specialty items like fig spread and this special artichoke dressing that you cannot find anywhere else.  They also have a huge selection of expensive bottled fancy water in cool bottles...i wish it werent as expensive but then it wouldnt be as fabulous...The Big O Vedge is the best vegetarian sandwich I have ever had.  Like... for real.  It is extremely flavorful.  And...with their friendly servers, this location is my solidified favorite! :)A real cool SSgt, Crew Chief from the Thunderbird Squadron, gave us a guided tour around the squadron and hanger where the Thunderbird F-16s are parked.  We saw a 10 minute video of the history of the Thunderbirds in their ~50 seat theater,  Then the SSgt led us around looking at the Thunderbird collection of artifacts, gifts, and newspaper clippings they have collected since their beginning, while explaining the complete history of the Thunderbirds.  After his briefing he escorted us into the spotlessly, clean hanger where the Thunderbird aircraft are parked.  One of the planes had it's engine removed and we were able to look it over.  There was also a full size F-16 cockpit model for viewing.  (I did not ask, but I believe younger folks and kids can sit in the cockpit.)  This a hidden gem, not too many people know about and it's FREE.  Located next to the flight line on Nellis Air Force Base, I do not know the difficulty for civilian visitors getting there.  I'm retired Air Force and was able to get on base with my military I.D.  My Garmin GPS took me directly to their front door.Went there last night for a company party.  It was a drive, I live on the other side of town and Scottsdale on a Saturday night is no picnic to drive through.  

The occasion was a dinner hosted by my company.  We got served 3 courses, and were waited on.  The first course was all vegetarian.  The fried cheese raviolis were amazing, the salads that were severed were delicious.  The raviolis were the first items gone.  We sat in a round table with co-workers and food was served on big plates (that were heavy, we had to help each other serve).  

The second course there was no vegetarian food, and I was offered two other choices due to my question of if any of this food was prepared vegetarian style.  She went and found out  non were, and  was she offered me eggplant parmesan.  It was excellent.

The third course was dessert, tiramisu and apple crumble deserts.   
The tiramisu was amazing.  

The placed was packed and I can see why, the food and service was amazing.

I don't know price range, since the company I work for hosted it.  On their menu on the website it has prices I believe.

It is somewhere I would take my wife for dinner, but not while we live on this side of town.Best moca in Tempe.  Great place to sit and enjoy.Deseo was an excellent experience!!! My girlfiend and I dined here for one of our first dates and theres nothing negative to be said about this place.

We started off in the bar and I had a beer and my gf had a berry mojito. The berry mojito was awesome even though i dislike mojitos. The bar atmosphere is somehwat dark and elegant. They have a wide variety of beers and drinks but they take their pride in making you the best mojito in az. We ordrred an appertizer and when it came out the chef also brought use a free ceviche plate and said he had made too much so it was on the house. I was instantly happy with my first taste of the ceviche, it was absolutely perfect. After drinks and appetizers we opted to be seated and we sat at the ceviche bar. While choosing what to oder we were given more free ceviche complements of the chef. I highly recommend ordering any of the ceviche was the rainbow was my favorite. The tuna and salmon tasted very very fresh. We had the fish special plate and the bone in pork chops plate. Both full of flavor. We finished the night off with chocolate cigars and a coffee liqour drink. Both very good and highly recommended. Be prepared to spend some money but get to the bar for the unwind hour as the drinks are priced well and they are well made.

This is a great place for a romantic date as it is very very nice and an awesome experience. I consider it fine dining and the price somewhat points in that direction as well. Call and make reservations ahead of time and get there early and hang out in the bar i promise it wont let you down.My husband took me here for our anniversary.  This place is beautiful! We got here a couple minutes early and went to the bar and had a couple drinks. We were then seated at our table and resented with the menu. Everything looked so delicious we had a hard time deciding. Every course was perfect and beautifully presented. the best for me was the Orecchiette con Salsiccia, past shaped like pig ears with sausage. It was soooo good.  For the main dish my husband got stuffed veal, I had to steal a couple bites :), and I got a seasonal fish, I forget what it was called. We ordered a dessert, the Baba cake, not knowing that they were going to serve us an Anniversary dessert, $9, since my husband told them our special occasion when he made the reservation. Still it was wonderful, 2 cannolis served on a plate with "Buon Anniversario" written on the plate. 

I just wish it wasn't so chilly outside because the patio looked like a lovely place to sit when the weather is right.Too bad I can't bring my dog along- very cool trail. Good workout, lots of people, lots of parking, very central location- super easy to get to. 
Bring lots of water, and bring your camera or some great shots.A very cool local spot!  This store is more than just a bookstore.  There are some really cool local art products as well as events and book signings.  It is definitely a place to check out!Great place to get books for a broke college student!  Friendly staff and a great selection.I have a new favorite place to eat downtown!  It's a classic Las Vegas feel restaurant with good service and great food.  The prices are not overly expensive and portions are perfect!  My favorite, CHICKEN POT PIE!!  Great fall dish!  My boyfriend enjoyed the Pot Roast!  We are returning soon!Homemade mashed potatoes, chicken parm, fish and chips. Excellent. Plus the jazz music and interior make it a very cool.I must have seen Phantom of the Opera at least 2-3 times in San Francisco over the years.  I wasn't expecting much for this show, but decided to go anyway since we got some free tickets that came with the hotel room.  We almost didn't go, but the damn Venetian just kept playing songs from the soundtrack everywhere we went (elevators, women's restroom, etc.) that we got the songs stuck in our heads and decided to go for our 2nd show in one night!

I gotta say, I'm glad we saw this show right after Blue Man Group (which I've also seen before), since this show just blew that one out of the water!  The set was so much better than the one in San Francisco, probably because this theatre was built especially for the Phantom show.  The special effects were more dazzling, and the opening sequence just took my breath away.

The show was a lot shorter than the usual broadway show, it was only around an hour and a half with no intermission.  However, I still got to hear all my favourite songs, and you don't really miss out on the stuff that they cut.  I think it actually helped the show that it was a lot more fast-paced after cutting some of the slower parts.  I only wish that they got a better "Phantom" since he seemed pretty old and didn't have the sexy, mysterious vibe of other singers that have played this role before.

This is a leaner, meaner version of Phantom of the Opera, and I would see it again in a heartbeat!Wow!  I've seen Phantom twice now...from the back section and from the second row... and it didn't disappoint either time!  It's a complete show, singing, stage sets, etc.  I will go back again I'm sure...We went their based on the reviews seen here and we were not disappointed! Very cool vibe to the place, the wait staff was great and the food was fantastic!  We ordered The Taos plate and the Scallops special...WOW.  Everything taste incredible and the scallops were probably one of the best we have ever had...super tender and way mouthwatering.

Had margaritas...those too were very good.  Mrs. had the prickly pear version and was thoroughly impressed.  

We want to take some friends back...might not be able to sit in the bar ( we went on a Wed. during happy hour and it was full) , but the back room looked like you can hang out with a group a little more comfortably.

We will be back!On Sunday I had the best breakfast ever.  Not the kind of breakfast you eat on the go before work - more like the breakfast you eat after hiking Camelback or running 6 miles.

Carne adovada with eggs, beans, potatoes, cheese, and tortillas.  Red chile sauce.  The room smelled like a campfire.   So so good.

I would also like to take this oppurtunity to thank the idiot legislators who passed the law whereby I cannot order a Bloody Mary before 10am on Sunday while enjoying the best breakfast ever at Dick's Hideway.  Why Sunday?  Some drunk can order one before work Mon - Fri, but I can't on my day off?  Well, at least I can still take my handgun with me....

Thank you for listening.The name "Dick's Hideaway" is an understatement! This is as hidden as a restaurant can get. Hole in the wall? Yes! 

I was Yelping around on Saturday morning looking for somewhere to eat in AZ that wasn't a chain. Challenging task, I know. I needed something that reminded me of home. Something with character and culture. This is when my prayers were answered and I stumbled upon rave reviews of this adequately named establishment. Chile Adovada on their brunch menu? Surely I wasn't in Scottsdale anymore... this sounded like heaven to me! I could hardly contain my excitement when we finally entered this humble abode of brunch delight! At last- I found a joint that didn't resemble a Denny's or Ihop. I was delighted to say the very least. My boyfriend had the breakfast burrito and I of course had to get the Chile Adovada. It was pure bliss. The plate was large enough to feed 2 but I was starving. Every bite was out of this world! I could talk about the food for hours but let me move on to the ambiance. It was about as cool as the food. I felt like I was part of a club or something of that nature. There are no signs on the door advertising the place so it felt a little secretive. Pretty cool huh! The staff was super friendly and inviting. I topped off my weekend brunch with a small glass of jalapeno infused tequila. Careful if you don't like spicy flavors! If you like heat as much I do though, you will love it! 
I will definitely be back at Dick's again soon! 
Ciao!I SO love Dick's.  Thank goodness for punctuation, or that sentence would read a little differently. ;)

Their food is delicious.  They grill over pecan wood.  Their specials menu always has the most delicious items on it, like the NY Strip with fresh crab, hollandaise (which was amazing, normally I find this sauce lacking), and spicy chipotle sauce.  Well worth the money, for sure.

Most of the specials items are a little pricey (and well worth it!), so if you're looking for a less expensive alternative, go with the bacon-wrapped shrimp appetizer, as it's only about $15 and is definitely a full meal.  

Be careful with the garlic appetizer.  While it's OUTSTANDING, the next day may be a little...windy. ;)

The wine list is great - several selections, and many are moderately priced (especially their happy hour specials).  And they have a good draft beer selection.  

The service is always spot on.

The place is SUPER TINY and intimate, which I love, but also means that you need to walk in with a good attitude, knowing that you might need to wait a bit for a spot at the bar or one of the three little tables.  There is also a private room you can reserve, I believe, for dining with a bigger party.Great service, great selection.  I was in awe with their selection!  When I go back for the Tim McGraw/Faith Hill concert next year, I'm stopping by here again for some more stuff.  This place is very close to the rental car hub.  I was tempted to stop by there again before heading back home.Found some great green vinyl chairs from the 70's and an awesome painting for above my bed. The fall working behind the counter was extremely helpful and pleasant.I absolutely love this place, hadn't written a review but I looked at their website which says they are temporarily closed!!!  The pizza crust is about perfect, the mussels appetizer, the pasta specials (shout out to the gnocchi gorgonzola when they serve it--so money) and one of the better examples of tiramisu in a restaurant are all great.  I can't help but think that their closing/moving is due to how cheap the place is.  Every time I ate here, everyone with me thought that they were stealing something.  I loved watching Le Notti Bianci and other old Italian movies on the screen!  Oh, Cafe Porta Alba, please come back soon!

***UPDATE***
Their website now says they are opening a new location in Hilldale.  Woohoo!  Encouraging, although I'll have to drive there as opposed to being within walking distance of the Butler St location.If you had told me last week that I would be giving a cafe in Gilbert five stars I would have told you you're crazy.  Folks, YOU CRAZY!!

I was not expecting to be wowed by the unassuming uptown Romeo's Euro Cafe in Gilbert's little downtown district.  But it delivered and outdid itself.  

After the painfully hard decision based on the huge and extensive menu, I ordered the Avocado Feta Pita ($7) and was BLOWN away by the taste. The inside of the pita revealed a sauteed melange of grilled turkey, avocado, feta and a special dressing.  I'm a huge fan of avocado, so I had an inkling I might like this - but I was a bit skeptical of the sauted part of this.  That's a bit too decadent and rich for my tastes. 

But I didn't care.  That's how freaking good this pita was.  I'm a dude and don't have hips or anything, but if bigger hips were a consequence for this, LAY IT ON BABY!!  

Was it authentic Greek?  Not at all.  I would consider it more New American, with Mediterranean influences.

It didn't stop there though.  My fellow eating partner ordered the Corinthian salad ($11), which looked mighty attractive I might add - and I don't care for salads at all.   It was gigantic and came appointed with grilled chicken, artichoke, hearts of palm, red peppers, mushroom, feat and capers in a Italian dressing.   Sounds pretty pedestrian until you see the size of the presentation and the veggies used (marinated mushrooms, for example).  

Dessert was just as incredible.  That's what you first notice when you walk in the door, btw - the big glass counter full of freshly baked desserts - from cheesecakes to tarts, you name it they probably have it.   The apple strudel was a rather large portion, flaky and not too sweet.  But the runaway winner (that even the server agreed on) was the caramel kiss cheesecake - caramel marbled with dark chocolate.  The texture and taste outdid even the Cheesecake Factory. 

While lunch was pretty cheap and basically consists of pitas, burgers, subs and salads, the dinner menu is larger (chicken, seafood, Greek plates and pasta) and seems to run a bit higher at $15 - $20 for entrees.

The space itself lives up to its name with marble tabletops and wrought iron chairs.   It feels very Euro and very cafe inside - with a decidedly boutique feel.  While it's not overly lady-like in here, it would be kind of uncomfortable for a casual everyday Joe used to steakhouses and burger joints. 

Good service despite the busy and brisk lunch time crowd.  Romeo's Euro Cafe is really out of the way for me but definitely worth going out of my way for.  I can't wait to return.I have been wanting to eat here for a very long time but I am a baller on a budget and I usually don't splurge on expensive meals. My friend and I were starving and couldn't decide on where we should eat. I checked Azcentral and found out that Wildfish had an all night all summer long happy hour that starts at 4pm. Score! Walking in it was very dark inside and all the way in the back by the kitchen you can see all the glorious seafood on top of ice. The hostess explained that we could sit at the bar or at one of the lower level booths for the happy hour special. We ordered a couple of cocktails that were too sweet for my liking but the food was fresh and delicious. We ordered the crab claws, some cheese that tasted like buttery brie, and potstickers. I enjoyed everything we ordered and will be coming back very soon. FYI the all night all summer long happy hour special is also at Eddie V's and Roaring Fork.Yep, the portions are as big as your head but that should not be something that's bad. Ever heard of a doggie bag? 

Anyhow, in a town full of corporate fast food chains, HHaGo Go is a breath of fresh air. They have a nice coffee bar and nice breakfast drinks as well as thoughtful dishes. I had an omelette with sun dried tomatoes, goat cheese, and herbs. The dish was light, fluffy, flavorful and not greasy. They also offer a thoughtful children's' menu with some non-typical and traditional dishes for variety. 

If the portions are too big go to McDonald's! 

I'll give it five stars because it is different and thank goodness in a town of Carl Jr's.yum yum yum!

this place makes me want to move to vegas.

stopped in on our last morning here for some delicious breakfast treats and boy oh boy did this place deliver.

i started it off with an excellent bloody mary. the boyfriend and i were going to split the chorizo hash, the server suggested i get a side and they were kind enough to give me biscuits and gravy that consisted of 1 biscuit and THE BEST sausage gravy i have had outside of my grandmothers kitchen and it was absolutely perfect.

5 stars!!I was super unsure of this place.

The IP was really under construction at the time... it made me pretty nervous walking through.  & it took me a while to find this place... but wow.  When we did find it, diamond in the rough.

We dropped in for a breakfast/brunch after a crazy night.  Lots of kids and families.  Loud.  Luckily, there wasn't too much of a wait.  We were seated after about 15 minutes of waiting.

Great service, the waiter was super attentive.  I love a bloody mary & this was one of the best that I've had.  Just the right amount of spice to clear up the massive hangover.  Their juices are great... freshly made, or so I was told.

I had the sage chicken... it was insane.  Huge dish.  Perfectly crispy & the sage was intense but surprisingly good.

I can't wait to go back.Had the chicken and waffles and man was it tasty. My girlfriend loved her meal as well. Big portions and great service. Will be back for sureSage Fried Chicken breakfast is amazing!

I went to this spot specifically from the reviews of Yelp, boy, it did not disappoint.

Price - Very reasonable, my giant fried chicken breakfast was only $12 with a biscuit, two eggs, two bacons, mash potatoes, and fruit. 

Wait - Wasn't very long, took us 10 minutes to get a table for 2 at noon on a Sunday.

Selection - there was so many options on the menu varying from all different types of dishes for the right occasion.

Very impressed, thank you Yelp.Delicious! Over the top and fabulous! Everything is good there-- everything. And ENORMOUS portions.Loved everything about this place! Great prices! The food was delicious! The services was spectacular! A must visit when in Vegas!This place has fabulous food and great service. This is a must for anyone visiting Vegas.A Must place to eat if you are in Vegas. Great staff; very friendly, very good customer service. The food comes out fast and tastes great! Huge portions for a good price- would recommend it to anyone.5 stars all the way around!  Beyond the outstanding food, the view takes the dining experience to a new level!  The dining area is on a slowly rotating floor at the very top of the Stratosphere (Seattle Needle shaped building).  If you get a table next to a window, the rotating floor will give you a 360 view of Vegas.  Unlike any other dining experience.Probably my favorite thing we did in Vegas (and we did a ton). Great experience!!

Want to get away from the sweaty/dirty masses for a while? Well they can't probably afford to follow you up here!! :)After a disappointing pulled pork sandwich at another barbecue place -  Sassy Sal's in the Northwest- I was still craving the real thing so my girlfriend recommended we go to TC's which has been a favorite of hers for a while. 

We had a certificate from Restaurant.com which obliged us to eat there and while we were originally hoping for take-out, I'm glad we stayed.  First impression - I really liked the decor which had great, vibrant color along with tasteful framed photographs on the wall which made you feel right at home.  This is exactly what I want from a barbecue joint -clean, tasteful, casual, and homey.

Service was prompt, friendly and attentive throughout.  The food was the real deal - plenty of  great tasting pulled pork with just a bit of sauce on the bun and great coleslaw to go on top.  My girlfriend got a two meat combo with beef ribs, hot links, and two sides which she said was also good.  The peach cobbler was great - and I don't even like peaches!  I can't wait to try the glazed donut bread pudding.

I'm kicking myself that I've lived down the street from TC's for two years and this was only my first time there.  They've got a ton of lunch specials for only $4.99 and daily specials. 'll definitely be back soon.I have eaten at both TAOs in Las Vegas and NYC many times. Delish! 

The decor is similar in both establishments (large stone buddha, lots of red and black). Service has always been on point and it's great for groups because the atmosphere is loud and fun.

Some of my favorite menu items are:

-cloudy sake
-lychee martini
-salmon sashimi appetizer (with jalepeno)
-crispy rice (which has tuna on it)
-miso-glazed sea bass
-giant fortune cookie

Some of their menu items are also found on TAO Beach's menu.

Oh, and remember to always read your fortune out loud and end it with "in the bed."This is the traditional place my friend likes to go before hockey games next door at Jobing.com Arena and I see why. They have really good Happy Hour specials, which we took advantage of since we got to Westgate early. Beats getting stuck in Rush Hour traffic and also having to pay the outrageous prices to park for the hockey game! 

I had the Blue Cheese Chips, which were kettle chips doused with melted cheese, blue cheese dressing, bacon bits, and green onion pieces, and they were so good! To drink I had a Diet Coke, which they gave me free refills of. My friend got an order of Sliders and some Garlic fries, which Gordon Biersch is known famously for...and the fries were delicious and not overly caked with garlic like they are at Chase Field. Until last night, Chase Field and Salt River Fields were the only places i'd ever had GB's Garlic Fries...so add #3 to this list. 

Small, easy to eat items and I got full on the Chips and Garlic Fries. My friend was still hungry since his Sliders only came with 2 and then we split the fries, so he ordered the 8-inch Veggie Pizza. GB's version of the Personal Pan Pizza. it was cut into 6 slices and looked really good! He also had a Fat Tire beer to drink. 

We were there for about an hour and a half, since we had time to spare before the gates opened for the game. We left around 5:30 and walked over to Jobing, walking by the shops and restaurants. Last night was a great night to be out and about. Westgate was hopping and not just because of the hockey game either. The movie theater was jam packed, as were a few restaurants and some stores. Some people I noticed were doing holiday shopping as well. 

I enjoyed the whole experience of Gordon Biersch. The bar staff was awesome and very cool. Our meals were pretty good, and the whole atmosphere was full of Colorado Avalanche and Phoenix Coyotes fans. 

I recommend giving Gordon Biersch a try if you haven't already.I just got a hankering for a Vegas trip again, which reminded me that I never reviewed Triple 7. How can that be? Oh yeah, it's probably because I had a few too many of those amazing microbrews and had a slight lapse in memory. 

I had some Vegas pals always telling me that this was THE place to go for cheap dinner and amazing beer, and I always would reply, "Don't bother me. I'm playing blackjack." Well, one day the blackjack dollars ran out a bit too quickly, so off to Triple 7 we went. And we were pretty famished (and sober) when we arrived, so we went to town on that menu...Meatball sliders, garlic fries, nachos grande, Prime Rib ($10!!), and, of course the microbrew sampler - you get five 5oz pours for $5. Can't beat that!

When the food starting arriving all six of us got a look of dread in our eyes, thinking, "Dear lord, what have we done?" If Vegas is about excess, than we sure as hell were doing something right, because this was a MASSIVE amount of food...and mostly pretty damn cheap and amazingly tasty too. 

The beer? Ah, the beer. It's so good when it hits your lips. It really is. The Porter was my fave, but the night we went there was also a brewmaster's special that had upwards of 9% abv...I think that was the one that really did me in. We left that place full, tipsy, and more than satisfied. Can't wait to do it again.Seriously, why have I never noticed this place?!  I've been to the Lappert's in Hawaii and while this doesn't quite give the same pleasure of eating ice cream on the beach, the macadamia nut ice cream is what will have me coming back for more.  I usually make a beeline for Aloha Specialties, since usually the line is long and moves slowly.  For my next visit, I've decided on a new strategy, dessert while waiting in line to place my order at Aloha. My favorite is the original macadamia nut and chocolate macadamia nut ice cream.  The buttery, nutty goodness of the macadamia nut flavor pairs so well with ice cream!Great explanations. Impressive exhibition. Absolutely worth your time if you're in Vegas.This place is by far the best sushi place i've ever been to!!I have been to Rain plenty of times since the Palms opened and it is definitely a quality club.  The dance floor is a little small since the VIP tables on the dance floor take up most of the space now.  But when Oakenfold is a resident on a Saturday night who cares.  I don't really have any negatives about this club.  I would buy the advanced tickets off the web as you get in without waiting in the large line.After learning about a special rate celebrating the 40th birthday of Ben, the hotel owner, I booked two nights at The Clarendon, the first in July the second in November.  I had visited the property once before, a few years back when the restaurant on the premises was under different management; I was left with the impression that the hotel looked really cool and fun and I made a mental note to check it out sometime.  With the special deal I found, I decided now was the time.

I booked a Jr. Suite for both nights, and my first stay was last night.  I checked in early before my boyfriend arrived.  Rachel helped me check in and was really friendly and helpful.  I took  in all the details as I walked to the elevator and then to my room.  Really fun, local tilt-shift photography was hung on the walls leading to my room (#221).  I wish I had snapped a few photos of my room, because it was really fun - a great king-size bed with a funky, upholstered headboard, dark-wood heavy furniture, a plush occasional chair by a lamp, a long desk/dresser, a 42" (if not bigger) TV anchored to the wall, and awesome blue walls made up the room.  Unfortunately, I noticed the room hadn't been cleaned properly.  By the Keurig coffee maker, I found a mess of opened sugar packets, creamer, and used swizzle sticks, and no  cups or coffee.  I called down to the front desk and Rachel answered.  I told her what I found, and she came up to check it out.  She seemed sincerely disgusted at what she saw and she was very apologetic.  She left the room and came back with some cups and went down once again and this time returned with coffee, tea, and a wet rag to wipe down the counter.  She also brought a few bags of chips, some candy bars, and four bottles of chilled water.  She asked me what else she could do to make up for the mess, but I told her she'd done enough - more than was her responsibility, actually.

Later that evening, after a pretty dismal experience at the Gallo Blanco Cafe, in the hotel lobby, I stopped at the front desk to request some extra towels and some sugar for the coffee.  Ben, the owner, happened to be at the desk at the time and told me he heard we'd had a bad experience at the restaurant and asked how our stay had been otherwise.  I told him about what happened before in the room and complimented him on having Rachel on his staff.  Like Rachel, he was very apologetic and asked what he could do to make up for it.  He also told me it had been Rachel's first day, and I couldn't have been more surprised - what an asset to his team!  Before we went back upstairs, Ben gave me his card and asked me to let him know when we'd be staying over again so he could upgrade us to a full suite.  He then came by the room with a huge stack of freshly laundered towels (they were still warm!) and apologized again and thanked us for our patience.  Talk about customer service!

When we checked out, Rachel was back at the front and asked about how our night went.  I recapped for her the rest of the events and she again thanked me for our patience and good nature.  This is why I support local businesses, especially when they hire amazing people who know how to treat their patrons and guests.  For the wonderful customer service we were given, I'm rating this hotel five stars.

Ben and Rachel, THANK YOU for being great.  I look forward to our next stay, though I wish I didn't have to wait until November!

P.S. - The amazing AC in the room? What a delight!One of my favorite hotel in the us. Great room, very calm and lovely staff. One regret : you can't charge the restaurant food on your room. But that does not affect my final rating : 5 stars!This is my favorite hotel in Vegas. It is a no gambling hotel so the noise, smoke, and crowds of the casinos are held at bay. The staff are always friendly and willing to help in any way they can to make your stay a good one.First time here, this restaurant is comparable to some of the best German comfort food found at various places that I have been stationed in Germany. The potato pancakes served as an appetizer were correct, and some of the lightest that I have ever had. the mushroom soup was perfect, and the service was excellent and attentive.  This place is definitely worth a returnWe loved this place. Came in with a big group of 13 for a nice dinner.  Great food, appetizers main courses and desserts good wine list.  Love the decor and location, and the staff is hot.    Easy walk to bars from dinner.

Check it out.One of the best pork dishes ever. My wife's ribeye was outstanding. All the food was top shelf. My favorite in Phoenix will go back next time I'm in town. 
A little noisy but everything else was so good.Had a blast here! Drank for free all night cause we were gambling at the bar, funny as all hell to watch all the drunk girls come & go. Awesome Bartending Staff! Josh is one of the best bartenders ever. Nice vibe in this place, great music, Partied w/my group of  6 people until 4 am. Totally made our last night in Vegas an awesome. MGM sure knows how to treat their customers.First of all I love the Red Rock Resort, it's so hip and trendy and beautiful. It's nice to go here instead of the strip because it is so refreshing.
Terra Rossa is the Italian restaurant located inside. I really recommend the bolognese spagetti. It's amazing. I also recommend the appetizer that is basically like fried risotto and mozzarella cheese. (it starts with an A) The service was unbelievably good, wine was delicious, and of course the food gets and A plus from me.
If you win big gambling, go there!OYSTER BAR THE PLACE WHERE FOOD PEARLS ARE MADE

Thank you Thank you all the Yelpers that got me here.

  This was an amazing place filled with all the wonders of the sea and a staff that are the Pearls of this Oyster.

  I started out my first day in Las Vegas with a big bowl of Combo Pan Roast and WOW. I could have turned around and gone home and been happy I made the 10 hour trip to Vegas. Yes it was that good. I ate here 6 times during my stay in Vegas and each time was different and wonderful. I started it all off with the Combo Pan Roast and ended with the Combo Pan Roast. Go for the level 9 gives it a nice kick. 

   The flavor of the Pan Roast is something that makes you feel content; when you're done eating it you know if that was the last thing you ever ate it would be ok with you.  

    I also tried the Alaskan Chowder which is their clam chowder Kicked Up a Notch. Was really good comes with Lobster, crab, and shrimp + a few other add-ons that make it really good. On another visit I got the Etouffee which has a water base and had a bit more kick to it at a level 8 but has deep flavor. 

    The oysters were fresh and a perfect appetizer or even a dessert they are that good. I did get to try the gumbo also not quite my kind of gumbo a bit darker in flavor than I like but still tasty. 

  The best part of the Oyster Bar is the People who work there Sandra made every meal special and Ricardo makes the place fun and a blast to be at. Each time that I was there I met good people to talk with and great food to eat. This is the Cheers of Oyster Bars. If you even have a doubt if it is worth waiting in line for 2 hours to eat here I will say with a smile that the answer is YES hands down.What you yelpers said!

What a cool experience! After reading about the rush here and wait for seats and finding ourselves looking for lunch late afternoon on a Tuesday we thought, this is our chance! Good plan.

I didn't quite understand from the other yelpers the whole "cooked in front of you" concept. Maybe on my mobile app I didn't read enough. But while we sat down and helped ourselves to a couple of Wedmier hefeweizen and had a dozen oyster shucked to order and started on those, we watched the magic occur. 

There are 6 'pots', all plumbed directly for steam. They place your selected seafood into the pots with some wonderfully seasoned broth to start the cooking. Midway in the cooking, then they add the necessary differentiators for the different orders. Gumbo gets a roux, "pan roast" gets a cream brandy sauce (not following how that is a roast, but I digress), etc... Heat is adjusted to your liking, and the 7 out of 10 was really perfect for people who like spicy but still want to taste their seafood.

Major kudos to yelpers who let me know going in that the plate split was wise. No way we should have gotten 2 entrees. A dozen oysters and one pan roast washed down with beer was perfect for the two of us.WOW, my boss took me here for dinner one night. I'm not sure if the food was just good because it was FREE or because the food the chef made for us was GREAT! 

I didnt have to wait in a long line, but when we sat down, a line started to file and before you knew it all the seats were full and more than 5 people were waiting. The pricing is decent, i had the pan roast spicy #7. I didnt come hungry, but i ate ALL the food in the bowl. All fresh ingredients(you can see everything they put in it since they cook it in front of you) and they steam cook it(also, illegal in CA) so its that much better to eat here!! trust meHonestly folks this place is where it's at. Shellfish heaven is right. Watching them make it in front of you is definitely the way to go (get used to it if you eat nothing but sushi). The food is all fresh and nothing but deliciousness. Plenty of sauces to choose from as well so don't short yourself by being "normal", give everything a try you'll be surprised.I didn't believe it when I heard that this place was simply one bar and no other seating. I stepped in line (which really is just...a makeshift line in the middle of the casino floor) and...waited. It was a bit late, so there wasn't that much of a line and we ended up only waiting for about 30 minutes. We struck up conversation with the couple in front of us, who also happened to be from California. We got seated and perused the menu. Small menu, so we made our choices pretty quickly.

1) I will say that the service is a bit on the slower side. One server and two cooks.
2) The food was awesome. You'd never think it, but the food is in total contrast to the looks of the place.
3) Even though the service was a bit slow, we had a fun time joking around with the staff. The banter between us made up for the slow service and made the night that much more enjoyable.

The food was great. We pretty much licked everything clean. There was one thing that was even more amazing, though...So we look across the bar, and there was this girl that just could not stop eating. She was at her seat with her boyfriend from the time we took our spot in line until after we had finished up and left. From my estimation, she probably ate about $120 worth of food and beer all by herself. The funniest part is that her boyfriend only had one dish, some oysters and a soda. My girlfriend and I were so amazed that this was the only thing we could talk about the whole cab ride back to the hotel. The look on the boyfriend's face plus his body language when he received the bill was priceless!Able to get a seat just before lunch time. Wow, service was good and entertaining.  Manhattan clam chowder was great. The linguine with clams in red sauce huge and sssooo good. Couldn't eat the whole bowl. At least another meal. Could have another type of bread, not sourdough. Now I know why the line is always so long for a seat. Go during off hours. It is a 24/7 bar and no kids allowed.OK so I am a picky eater who tends to lean towards healthy and quality.  While in Vegas for the weekend, my BF and I decided to try Nove Italiano mainly bc we wanted a restaurant with a nice atmosphere and a nice view.
We figured, "OK Italian, it will probably be pretty good but nothing out of the ordinary"
Were we wrong.
This food was unbelievable.

In the beginning they bring you an assortment of fresh breads and breadsticks with a little tray on the side with Olive Oil, Red Pepper Flakes and Parmesan Cheese for dipping. 
I dont usually partake in bread, but I did try a thin breadstick with the dippings and it was really good.

After reading about the Grilled Octopus App on yelp, I figured we had to try it.   Let me tell you, it was amazing.   Obviously not for everyone bc its octopus, but it was so tender and the flavor of the marinade was simple but very very fresh and a great flavor.  They were grilled so they were crispy.  Like nothing I have ever had before.
The marinade was not too heavy, more like a ton of fresh herbs.

I had the White Pizza with Clams.
Very simple but amazing.
Extremely thin crust so you can eat it and not feel full or guilty.  And big clams and plenty of them on top.

My BF got the Chicken Marsala.   It was on the bone which at first seemed weird, but he said he loved it bc it fell off the bone.
Huge gourmet mushrooms and plenty of them.
On the side he had penne pasta in Alfredo sauce which he loved. It looked like it was fresh-made sauce and a bit lighter then what you would expect alfredo to be.

We got a side of the Aparagus special dish, which was Grilled Asparagus with an egg and Ricotta cheese.
Sounds totally weird, I know, but so great!!

The place is also swanky and upscale but comfortable, the view is great.

Overall this place is a Must when in Vegas.
And the price ,we thought, was very fair.  We more than enough food, and 1 glass of wine and a Diet Coke and the bill was $125 with tip.     Not bad at all for a fine restaurant in Vegas.All I can say is YUMMY!!!

My husband and I love going here for date night.  The good is great and so is the service.  And, as a bonus, we get coupons in the Valpak envelopes that come in the mail every month for "Buy one, Get one free" meals.  It doesn't get much better than that.AMAZING, AMAZING chocolate croissant.  Got the vanilla bean iced coffee too..I love seeing specks of real vanilla bean floating around.  You must go early for warm chocolate croissants...they go fast.  I am so happy about this place, I need to try it for lunch.Jalepeno shots are great! A lil spicy for you novices, but nothing scorching for those who like the heat. The carne asada was great and salmon tostada was mmmtastic. Service what what you'd hope for in all restaurants, friendly faces, timely and proactive.I love this place. For a little over $20 on the weekends, you get access to a more food than is imaginable and unlimited champagne and bloody marys. Heaven. 

They have everything you could ever want to eat on your break from the blackjack table: sushi, crab legs, eggs, bacon, oysters, shrimp, omelets, chicken, steak, chinese food, and more....I could go on forever!

And, they're very generous about the all-you-can drink specials, which is good because I'm about as good at gambling as I am at dieting, and when I go to Vegas, I'm apt to lose a few $$$. But the food makes up for it all.Holy desserts batman! Came here for brunch and it was so damn good. Price was a bit up there but it met the quality of the food and free mimosas and champagne. Just about everything we put on our plate was delish! I couldn't be happier with the whole experience. Our server was a bit short but she wasn't rude or anything, I chalked that up to she was really busy (The place was almost full when we walked in). The husband and I have date night tonight so we'll be visiting for dinner..I'll update and let ya'll know how that part is.Their pani puri is tasty.   I like their mater paneer with bhatura.  The mater paneer is comfort food and the bhatura texture perfect.  Love their mango lassi!

I love this place for excellent authentic Indian chaat.  They sure know how to cook.Ok what can i say about Rao's...WOW!!!!! this place is amazing!!! we ordered the gnocchi with meat sauce, lasagna, fusili with sasauge and cabbage, meatballs, and grilled veggies. First the gnocchi, im a gnocchi lover and ive tried gnocchi pretty much everywhere and these were up there with the best..the sauce is just spot on. The lasagna is to die for..the layers and goodness and the sauce and cheese..wow. the fusili with sausage was awesome also..full of flavor and just yummy in my mouth. All these great food for a great price..we got all the above entrees plus a salad, soup and an ice tea all for under $180..plus the portion size is well above normal. We left the restaurant with full stomachs unable to eat dessert which is unheard of for us..anyways im definitely coming back for sure. 

The only thing i was gripe about is the info shows casual attire..well casual to me is just that casual..i went with jeans and nice shirt and shoes and my hat..they asked me to take off my hat at the dinner table which i dont mind doing ..but dont say its casual attire then. i say it should have a classy title than casualI totally agree with everything that Wilson who wrote the prior review said.  This place is top drawer.  It is huge, well run, very classy, nice and helpful attendants.  Towels, robes, iced bottled water, a fully stocked refrigerator in the Tea Room with leather chairs and ESPN.  

If you are not a hotel guest it is $45 for a full day pass and that includes an extensive fitness center too.  The fitness center is co-ed.  The spa is not.  Most guys keep to themselves, but occasionally someone strikes up a conversation, but not much.  It is generally quiet and peaceful with candles and waterfalls galore.

It is difficult to find.  Use the elevators around the corner from Starbucks in the Augustus Tower.  It is on M floor.  Enjoy!My research and stalking and multiple drive-bys have definitely paid off!! 

I first tried their french silk pie that I received as a gift, but I never had been in the shop. The french silk was delicious, dense, yet delicate. They have a different spin on this pie... I'm not sure what it is.. but I still enjoyed it! 

When I finally went into the shop yesterday, I fell in love. The staff is so happy and energetic and they make me want to work there! The shop is clean and simple... with just enough taste;] 

We went for lunch and we STARTED (!!!!) with the mud puddle... omg. It was warmed and served with a swish of whipped cream on the side. SOO delicious. More so like a brownie with a decadent splash of ganache in the middle. Then came the salad to offset my guilty pleasure... citrus salad: oranges, grapefruit, golden raisins, walnuts, apples, toasted coconut flakes, spinach, lettuce, with a ginger vinaigrette dressing. This is eating rainbow foods to the max, I think dietitians would like this. All the ingredients were fresh and abundant. Served with a slice of their fresh bread, which was also delicious. 

My friend got the love monkey panini... more so dessert, but we'll let it slide just once! Peanut butter, marshmallow creme, bananas, with chocolate sauce for dipping. Incredibly delicious. I want to serve this to a 4 year old!! 

This was a perfect lunch and just under $20 for two people. Fine by me! 

I can't wait to be back, and hopefully meet the owners!My fiance and I have been coming here since we relocated. It is one of our favorite breakfast/ lunch spots in town. There menu is full of fresh and healthy items and you can indulge in some of their pastries and desserts. 
Our favorites include the power smoothie
Spicy breakfast wrap
The conservative
and a must have, chocolate/ hazelnut biscotti!
Their coffee and teas are delicious. 
You can pretty much catch us there at some point during the weekGreat music out back. Dance off style.I had been to the bar at this trendy little spot several times with co-workers and friends, but I hadn't tried their dining room until recently.

The waiter was very knowledgeable and recommended some great entrees for us to try. With the caprese salad as an appetizer, our meals were more than enough!

I regret never having eaten in their dining room before and will definitely be returning soon!This updated review is for their lava cake only! We got to come back a couple days after our first visit and we had ordered the lava cake for dessert! Deliciousness! Melty chocolately not overly sweet moist cake with aweome ice cream! I definitely recommend this dessert for anyone that goes to Flemings. 

My filet wasn't as awesome as the first time, some tough pieces to chew through, but I still loved the Fleming's Potatoes! We also got the sauteed spinach instead of the creamed spinach and I liked it 10 times more. 

Service was better this time around, but they weren't extremely busy for a Wednesday night! I will definitely be back for Happy Hour and Lava Cake!My company was looking for a steakhouse to have our dinner. this turned out to be the perfect option.
From the moment I started inquiring and working with Kelly I knew this was a great place. Kelly was accommodating and helpful. She explained all the options we had available to us. 
We had a private room, which was perfect for our group. It was a lovely room with plenty of space to mingle. 
The service from the moment we arrived was 5 star. 
Our wait staff was attentive and kind. our food was brought out in quick succession so that we were all served within moments of one another. 
We started with a cheese and fruit platter which was very good. The bread served was crunchy and warm. Two butter choices. 
The salad crisp and fresh. Perfectly dressed. the entrees were cooked to every ones desire and there was not a morsel left on anyone's plates. 
The cheesecake was a slice of heaven. 
Our president was delighted with our choice. We will be back. 
Thank you Kelly and staff!!One of my favorite places to hang out and get a bite to eat. Good food, atmosphere, ect. An all around plus for me!Was in PHX for work and one of my co workers took me there for lunch...all I can say I had the best turkey sandwich I have ever eaten... Too bad I wasn't around to enjoy Happy Hour!This place Rocks! The food is great and the decor is cool. Try the Popcorn Shrimp hmmm good.  The waitress and  staff are hot.  The place is really loud,young crowd and has a huge bar all in all this place is a cool place to eat before going out to the clubs.Definitely my favorite Thai food place.  Reasonable price, convenient locations (for me), decent service and the food is always good.  I like pretty much everything they have.  My usual dishes are eggplant with chicken, Tom yum soup,  and beef salad.  Their iced tea has a smokey flavor to it which I really like.AHHHH! I absolutely love this place. My cousin and her husband who practically eat anywhere and anything at anytime they want because they can afford it told me this is one of their favorite restaurants. And after trying it out for myself I can definitely agree! Let me start with the interior, this location is sort of has an odd stand alone building in the middle of a parking lot for a shopping center. But the inside is really nice because it's like your Aunt's classic living room, which has a nice home feel to it. I ordered the Pad Thai, which was in the lunch specials part of the menu. Let me just say the best Pad Thai I've ever had! Amazing flavor! I'm getting hungry just thinking about it! Service was good too and always good to know since Asian restaurants can be really rude sometimes. I recommend this place to everyone and I have been ever since I've tried them. 5 stars well deserved!!-Great Service
-Amazing Steaks
-Great environment for those looking for a more intimate dinner
-Order the endless meal. This is the best way to try all of their best meats.
-Come hungry!Best Gyro around. Friendly staff, nice clean place.Settebello serves up authentic Neapolitan pizza right! Try the DOC Margherita, it's awesome!This is the only place I shop for my dog.  great product. informed staff. And good services.  Plus the bakery is awesome!!!This my favorite pub in Phoenix! Good beer selections. Good food (the shepard's pie is amaze-balls, the Irish nachos are epic, and the frickles are delish). They have good live music / entertainment during the evenings. This is a great place to go during the day to hang out with friends, watch a game, have a quiet beer, or have an awesome night out partying. The weekend nights are a raging blast! The staff does a great job handling it all!I first called Stanley Steamer to get a price quote, based on what I needed done, they were going to charge me close to $460.00... Needless to say, I told them forget it!! I started looking on yelp and found keystone... I am so happy I did... I initially spoke with Brent... What a nice guy... Answered all my questions!!  What a fabulous experience and their prices are amazing, $170!!! Steve and Mike were very professional, friendly and did a wonderful job.  I will NEVER call Stanley Steamer again and will always use keystone in the future.  My neighbor was so impressed with their workmanship, she asked for a business card and will also use them.  

Keystone, please give Steve and Mike a "pat on the back" they represented your company wonderfully!!!The best seafood I have ever had. Better than Italy. Better than Greece. And I am from Seattle! The best. The ambiance of the place is top notch as well as the Kierland Commons in Scottsdale. It's is an oasis in the physical and cultural desert that is the Phoenix metropolitan area.Best service I have ever had!  The steak was absolutely perfect (I've been back twice, once to the one in Old Town and another to the steak house on Pima, and it has been consistently perfect)!  And for dessert, it isn't even a question: you have to try the butter cake if you have not had it before.  When I am in Scottsdale, I can't go to another steakhouse; I'm ruined forever.We went for dinner last night and the food and service was excellent. Would definatly reccomend. They went overboard for our special occasion. Great dinner.You have to try the chopped steak salad. Is truly to die for. Nothing like it anywhere else on  the planet.i really like loco patron! they have bomb fish tacos and their margaritas are really good too! im not sure what kind of flavoring thing they use but it's really sweet so you can get a skinny version margarita and it's still delish! 

service is decent. they are quick with the waters and chips and salsa when u sit down. food comes out quickly too. 

great happy hour and lunch specials. big fan of loco patronThe Loco salad with pork red chili is amazing. Brook and Joe provided amazing service for my late dinner last night. I will be back again.This is art.  The best and most expensive meal I've ever had.  I would go as often as my wallet would allow.  Incredible.I'm unsure if the current drool on my shirt stems from a salivary gland disorder, or from reminiscing of my meal at stripsteak this past weekend. 

Either way, Michael Mina's STRIPSTEAK offered one of the best meals i've ever had and will forever be a MUST while in Vegas. Each meal is started off with a trio of Duck Fat Fries, compliments of the Chef. Duck Fat Fries are french fries which are fried in duck fat , seasoned three different ways and served with three dipping sauces. These are easily the best french fries i've ever had are deserving of the 5-star rating alone. 

Collectively, our group ordered the Japanese A5 Filet (market price of $95), a few orders of Salmon ($35), the American Kobe Burger ($25), and additional sides of duck fat fries and the truffled mac and cheese. While the prices are high, this is a prime example of "you get what you pay for." We were told that the A5 filet was flown in from Japan earlier that morning, and upon receiving it, was tender enough to cut with a fork alone.  

The Salmon, cooked and seasoned perfectly, was extremely fresh. Having eaten at places such as Neptune's Net on Pacific Coast Highway in California, I didn't think it was possible to taste a fresher tasting fish, but Stripsteak really nailed it. When served with a side of truffled Mac & Cheese, which might i add was some of the best i've had the pleasure of trying, it was truely an adventure for the taste buds.

Onto the burger. The American Kobe Burger was the least expensive of the various options. It featured a kobe beef patty cooked to a perfect medium served on a bun with fennel slaw and watercress. What was without a doubt the best burger i've ever had was served alongside a second helping of the succulent duck fat fries I had experienced at the beginning of our meal. 

Overall, i was very pleased with the meal as well as the amazing service and I didn't hear a single complaint in our party except regarding the price. But like I mentioned earlier, "you get what you pay for." Unless of course you were the one ordering the $95 A5 filet... That should have come with a lapdance.Chef Doug is the best!Simply the best steak of my life.  I have eaten here twice.  

Excellent wine selection.  BYOB allowed.  Wagyu beef is amazing.  Perfect preparation.  Worth every penny and I cannot wait to get back.Amazing. Amazing Amazning. 

I have been here 3 times and each time has been stellar! I have had the filet, the sea bass and the flank steak and all were just delicious. The wood fired grill really gives the steaks a unique flavor. The mushrooms....just to die for.

The best and most amazing part (if you ask me) are the frits you get (for free) as starters. They all have individual dips too. Nom nom. 

The service is impeccable as well. I have a background as a waitress, so I always like to see how the waiters take orders, etc. I don't get to say this too often, but they were on point. 

The martinis are made to perfection. The restaurant's ambiance is gorgeous and of course it's in Vegas, which is our favorite vacation destination spot!Rarely give a 5 star rating.
This steakhouse had superb food.
Excellent service, great ambiance, and awesome steaks!

Our whole experience was excellent (once we got past the snooty little girls who seated us)     Our waiter and his fellow staff were first class.

The mixed appetizers and entrées were some of the very best I have ever eaten. 
Their beef was cooked perfectly to our requests, the side dishes all of a very high standard.

When back in Vegas, will be dining there again!This place is awesome. the staff is really cool and helpful. they let u do everything by your self while a range master watches. they have a wide range of guns to rent from hand guns to machine guns. while i was there i rented a SAW M249 and was bad ass. the prices are reasonable. bring your family for a all around good time. A must visit when coming to VegasHuge selection and excellent sushi. I highly recommend the garlic shrimp sashimi!  Well worth the price.I love this place but wonder why it's not busier!  The food is delicious, there are TVs to watch sports / the news, and the service is great.  They also have free wi-fi which is great if you need to have a lunch meeting.  

One strange thing I've noticed is that it seems their wait staff changes frequently.  I used to get a discount because I have been going to Swish since it was located on Sahara, but now none of the waitresses / servers know me.  I've been a loyal customer for about 7 years and they would always give me a loyalty discount upon every visit, which was always incredible!  

I wish Swish would create a customer loyalty program, as I know once people enjoy a meal at Swish, they almost always go back again.  

Either way, Swish is delicious and I hope they stick around!I go to Rose for my nails. They have very fast service and I have received several compliments on my nails when I got them done at this place. I have been going there for three years.Oh. 97 reviews. Guess it's not a secret. Well, I'm sure they all read about the same. I've eaten there 3 times, and that's about 8 not enough. If you want something different, this is it. Oggie is good, the Cajun was great. I wanna try many others.There probably isn't much left to be said about the awesomeness that is The Cornish Pasty Co. in Tempe, so I'll keep this brief. I'm a HUGE fan of the Cajun, it is absolute perfection with an amazing chipotle sauce that is the perfect compliment. Since I started going here, I've also come to enjoy starting off my meal with their garlic roasted potatoes (great to share with a friend). I've also tried the meat & cheese, which was great even though despite the fact that I'm not the biggest fan of sausage unless it's in a patty and comes next to some eggs and pancakes. Had a bite of the Italian as well, quite tasty in it's own right, although I picked out the big chunkier tomato, just a personal preference.

If the Tempe location is a bit cramped for you, and it DOES get pretty hectic in there sometimes, there's always their Mesa location which stays true to the formula but offers more seating room if you choose to dine in. 

Don't make the mistake of not trying CPC at least once, I've introduced many friends (and even my parents) to this spot, and I've never gotten a single complaint. There is enough diversity on this menu that you can find someething for just about any range of tastes...hands down one of the most obvious 5 star reviews I've given.Bloody awesome. Seriously.

Ok, my significant other and I walked in around 8 pm on a Friday night. I think if we came a little earlier we'd probably have to wait for seating. We thought the place would be larger, its a little small, but that's ok. It felt like we were in a British pub, and I've been dying to go to London. No, but seriously, the atmosphere is really cool and very original. Service as well as the staff here are very friendly and really cool.

I don't drink, but the prospect of getting to choose from tons of locally brewed and imported beer is appealing. We ended up ordering a cheese steak pasty and a chicken tikka masala pasty. I was extremely skeptical and thought I was going to be in for a big disappointment. What business did this British pub even have THINKING about chicken tikka masala? To my surprise, I think I just tasted the BEST CHICKEN TIKKA MASALA IN PHOENIX. Hold up, Cornish Pasty Company, a BRITISH type PUB HAS THE BEST CHICKEN TIKKA MASALA in PHOENIX. I know, you must think I'm nuts, but I'm Indian and I thoroughly enjoyed this amazing interpretation of a stereotypical Indian dish. The tikka masala overshadowed the cheesesteak which I thought was rather bland. I think the issue here was that the chicken tikka was so overwhelmingly awesome. I can't wait to go back and have the tikka masala again and perhaps try something else.

Everything here is super fresh, you can see them making the pasties and dough and everything. The pasties have a perfect texture and are golden brown on the outside. If you're unsure of what a pasty is, it is basically a chicken bake or calzone, but with different fillings. Really awesome.

It'd be awesome if the owner of this place decided to get a few TVs, then it'd be even more pub like. Also,  it'd be super duper awesome if he decided to pick up some English Premier League games on the weekends. I would most definitely come down for some breakfast pasties and watch a few games.The Cornish Pasty is so full of awesome that it is really hard to describe it's awesome awesomeness. It's kind of hipstery so i can't say that i'm their target audience but whatever. I goes and eats where i please. I just throw a few butterfly sticker-tattoos on various parts of my body and blend right in.

I like places with a character and this place has it in spades.  The cooks/waiters/waitresses are friendly and the pastys are good eats! 
I must warn that they are more filling that you would think. 

Good beer good food! Ridiculously cheap (knock back a few Rogues for me) The dark lighting also makes your friends look sooo much better.

win win.  and win.Probably my favorite restaurant in all of Arizona. The food is fantastic (I recommend the Cajun Chicken pasty), the servers are really hip and awesome, the kitchen is open for you to see how your food is being made, and the prices are fair. Don't be discouraged if you realize they make the pasties the night before, because they cook them the day of and give you the option to take them home half cooked if you want to eat them at home and cook them yourself. Just such a awesome atmosphere for small groups or a date and really good food with a very nice beer list.Ok so let me start by saying this review is probably pointless, since I doubt any of you will read 780 reviews to make a decision. But this is my favorite meal in Tempe. The wait staff is great, and not the fake "hi welcome to blah blah blah I'm so happy you're dining with us can I take your order". This is truly a great part of Tempe culture. If you feel uncomfortable here because it's hipstery or whatever else, may I suggest any of the corporate food chains in Gilbert?  I have never had a bad meal here...EVER. With all that being said there is really only one Pasty worth ordering that is the Shepard's Pie. Look I get it there are like 50 other ones here to choose from but save your time and just order the Sheppard's pie.Wow!  Here to visit family, but my wife and I snuck off and enjoyed a little piece of heaven tonight.  We loved the meatballs as an appetizer, then had the Cajun Chicken Pasty, both of which were divine.  We even split the Chocolate Bread Pudding for dessert.  We are still able to move, barely, and both more than happy with our meal.  Terrific time, we really enjoyed ourselves.The Omakase here is out of this world and well worth the drive away from the strip. They have a $55 and $85 version. Very similar except the $85 one has higher priced fish and slightly different sauces. Definitely worth the splurge. Also, if you visit again, tell them it's your second, third,  etc time, and Chef will create something different each time. After the 5th time, he will really get creative. No wonder they have many celebrity regulars! A definite must when in Vegas.Whenever I find a restauarant that I realllly like Im always torn.. do I yelp about it and share the love, or do I keep it myself so the place doesn't explode with popularity and I now have to wait. I've decided to share my little vegas sushi secret with you all.. YOU ARE WELCOME! 

Okay this place is BOMB! LIke not "for vegas sushi" bomb, but even "compared to places in LA" bomb. Honestly we were skeptical at first because I was like oh great are there any legit people that are actually reviewing or is it all white folks that think california rolls are sushi. We actually ended up sitting next to a guy who asked, ohh like can I get like a yellowtail hamachi sushi nigiri roll? Then tried to brag to his date about how he lovvves sushi. People who get rolls do not love sushi, they love mayonnaise. 

Get the Omakase and you will NOT be disappointed. I am not a purist and I actually like when they mix non sushi items with the omakase, this place even includes steak and dessert! and its suuuuper cheap for all that you get and believe me you will be stuffed. 

Sushi was SUPER fresh, and our AWESOME sushi chef, who I swear is a part time comedian cuz he was hiliariousss even threw in some free pieces.. tried flounder sushi with truffles. ZOMGGG delicioso! Every bite was delectable and melted in my mouth. Left completellly satisfied and I will definitely be returning. Trust me, its a bit of a drive but its sooo worth it!!!Great service and outstanding tempura scallop roll paired with some Miso soup and a large, fresh salad.  All for under $20. I'll be back.Love this pizza!  20 bucks fed two of us a slice of pizza and a soda each.  So tasty, we ate there for lunch AND dinner in one day! I highly recommend.Great mushroom & spinach omeletteI really love the food here. I tried the beef/lamb gyro with the Athenian fries for lunch. Soo good! For dinner I tried the gryo plate (huge portions in my opinion) , the hummus (super silky smooth, best I've ever had), and grilled octopus. The atmosphere is very clean and friendly. Next thing going to try is some dessert!Again thank you yelp!! I staked this place out before leaving for vegas and planned to come here, my expectations were high.
From the strip it took about 12 minutes to drive to.. not so bad. I was rushing seen how it was 3:30 and they were going to close at 4:00pm.  but we got there at about 3:45 and there were tons of people in there getting cakes. A cute little place, they have samples... they were sampling the chocolate chocolate and damn did that just get me there.  It was so moist and chocolaty, very good, the frosting is not too sweet, not overwhelming. Very good!!!  
As i looked in to the fridge where all of them were kept i was disappointed cause they only had like 2-3 flavors of the small individual cakes left. But the lady said they have all flavors available in the bake. So i was very happy, ended up getting 8 of the individual ones!! My favorites are the red velet, the chocolate chocolate and the carrot!  Yummy!!WOW, WOW, and WOW again.  Nothing Bundt Cakes is amazing!!! I called in an order for a dozen of the Bundtinis- little mini cakes- for a friend.  When you call in the order, you are able to choose which flavors you'd like.  I pre-paid over the telephone and scheduled a pickup time.  They were very friendly over the phone and verified my order along with all of my information.  Turns out, I was able to pick up my order earlier than expected, so I called to make sure that was okay, which it was.

When I arrived at the store, the staff was SO nice! They greeted me, got my name, and encouraged me to try a sample.  It was something chocolatey that melted in my mouth, and the icing was rich, sweet cream cheese goodness.  I'm not even a chocolate fan, but that made me a believer!

When my order arrived, they verified it with me again.  They encouraged me to take another sample to go- so this time I tried the white chocolate popcorn, which was also really tasty.

My Bundtinis were wonderful.  They went through a lot- car transport, temperature changes, being refrigerated, taken out, refrigerated again, but they managed to stay moist and delicious. The icing is my favorite part, and I'm not usually a fan of frosting on cakes. The cakes themselves were excellent, with the carrot being my favorite in this batch.

Nothing Bundt Cakes has a fan in me!I tried one if these bundt cakes at work today and feel in lovvvveee! So after today decided to stop by the Sahara location and pick up a couple of the small bundt's for my family. Got home, made dinner and then open up the bundt for dessert and once again amazing! Customer service was a little slow but well worth the wait. Recommend trying one of these babies, just too good to pass up.i love it here.. i haven't found a thai restaurant to call home yet, but pin kaow is definitely up there with thai that i've had.. it's clean, they're friendly.. fast!  and it's really good..  

just had it again tonight.. it's REAL good. 
try the yellow curry and seafood surprise!I just had to update my review to five stars because this place is THAT good. Seriously.

We now have a new weekly meet up called #ThaiTuesday (or the occasional #ThaiThursday) and I cannot imagine living a week without this delicious treat. In fact, this week I had it Tuesday and Friday. Plus I will be back Monday and then again next Thursday. I guess you could say I am addicted.

This is the first restaurant I have been a "regular" at.. and I love that they know my exact order. Although I am having a splendid love affair with the yellow curry (medium-hot) today I also got the Kao Pad with Tofu... its my new obsession!

The Buddhas delight appetizer is amazing too. Deep fried tofu wedges with a spicy sweet peanut sauce. MMM MmmMMM.

Do yourself a favor and compliment your meal with a pot of jasmine hot tea too!I love this library! I grew up here so I have a soft spot for it. I'm closer to the Phoenix Library so I go online, put on hold what I want, pick it up and I'm in and out in less than 10 just like another reviewer said but if I can't find it at Mesquite it's worth trying here.
You can do the same thing here. Go online, put them on hold and pick them up. Otherwise, like someone said you might not find what you're looking for. The parking is super easy. There is a sheriff's dept. or police station right next door and the police cars are parked in this parking garage so be extra careful how you drive.
If you want to hang out inside there are big comfy chairs looking out  giant windows.
The area is really cool.  Swing right to the Scottsdale Center for the Arts where there are water fountains, flowers, lawns, and ducks.
It's good for walking the nephew up to Old Scottsdale. He can throw pennies in the fountains, feed the ducks, run in the grass. There are sculptures and the horse and carriage are often at the end of the walk. If you have to use the SCA restrooms, the lights change color which is awesome to a little kid.
Just don't go on the day they have an event.Easily my favorite place for cocktails in Las Vegas.  There really is no better place in town that has the combination of an amazing cocktail menu, music, and atmosphere.  The staff is incredibly knowledgeable with regards to the drink menu, and the service is always top notch.  You will not find a cocktail menu in town with more creativity and selection. The drinks are made by the most talented bartenders that the city has to offer, and are a great value for what you actually get - all fresh ingredients and top quality liquor.  I would highly recommend checking out "Mixology Monday" if you haven't been yet: the drink quality-to-value ratio for that event is hands down is the best you will find anywhere.  I have been going to DCR for a couple of years now, and the quality of the menu and staff has always been excellent and consistent.  It is great for groups as well, and everyone that I have taken there has always had a good time, and has returned often.  In terms of overall quality and enjoyment, DCR easily stands up to other cocktail lounges that you would find in NYC, LA, MIA, and other major cities.  In my opinion, it's even more enjoyable because of its humble and non-pretentious atmosphere.  It's clear that the ultimate goal is to create a unique environment and make sure that guests have the best time possible.  This is definitely accomplished here.  The lack of gimmicks and lowest-common-denominator advertising is absent, which is hugely refreshing - especially in this city.  It definitely sets the standard for Las Vegas and is a must-see for anyone who hasn't been there yet.I love DCR! 

It's a small bar on my favorite hangout spot, Fremont East. The door at the establishment is confusing. I will give you a hint. It's on the left hand side. 

DCR is composed of little tables and couches and a few booths. The music is house/techno, not my cup of tea, but it's not too annoying loud where you can't hold a conversation. The lighting is dim, but not too dark.

What makes DCR so damn boss are the never ending rotation of seasonal cocktails. You can order your typical vodka-cran or beer, but what sets DCR apart are these complex, tasty beverages. I strongly believe that if you go to DCR and don't order a cocktail off their menu, you're not experiencing DCR!

DCR is not pretentious, there's no typical patron. Vegas movers and shakers are spotted here (writers, CEOs, the mayor). The bar itself is small, but the place is classy, artsy, and vibrant, but without being "in your face."

DCR, you rock my socks and shoes!Really awesome decor, cute and polite bartender, great service, and moderately priced drinks. We were only there for one drink, but we enjoyed the lush leather sofa while gazing into the fireplace and sipping our drinks. We were there at around dinner time (6pm) and we were the only people in there. I can imagine this place getting packet as the night goes on. Looks like a great place to make out with your sweetie, too, since entire bar is lit by candles and the fire place. Very swank. Hope to go back the next time we're in Vegas!Confession time!  Yes, there are times I dress like a hipster, and yes, I like hanging out at hipster places.  I can't grow a full beard, and the taste of PBR induces headaches, but if forced to pigeonhole myself I do have hipster characteristics.  But hipster or not, The Griffin is an awesome bar that strays from the norm of what is a "Vegas" bar.

Situated in downtown Las Vegas, The Griffin fits the label of hole-in-the-wall.  It looks a bit like a dive bar on the outside, and it doesn't really stand out too much, but once inside it's like you're transported anywhere from an East-Coast underground lounge to where Harry Potter would drink once he's of legal age (or has a fake ID).  The place is adorned with brown bricks, plush chairs, and fireplaces to make you feel nice and cozy.  A jukebox pumps music that THANKFULLY isn't what every single other bar and radio station plays, so you won't have to fear plunging an ice pick into your head after hearing "Like a G6" for the millionth time.  

Perhaps the greatest thing about this bar is the lack of video poker machines and TV's.  I hate video poker, and while I do enjoy watching a game with a beer, this is a place that encourages socializing!  What, communicating without the use of technology?  Talking to people face to face?  Don't be scared!  And for the most part, people here are friendly, I even struck up a conversation comparing Modernism to Postmodernism in American Literature with a completely random person.  

There is a small backroom where you can dance, and I found that to be an interesting kick.  I hear they use the room for other things as well, but haven't gone to any of those other events yet.

And while they didn't have Guinness on draft (Boo!), they did have this chocolate stout that was absolutely delicious.  

While it's fun to go on almost every night of the week, the place gets PACKED during First Friday.  If you want to go there during First Friday, you better get there early, because it's going to be packed and you will have a tough time making it to the bar.  

PROS:
Great drinks on draft.
Excellent decor, vibe and clientele 
Indie music!
No Video Poker or TVs

CONS:
Gets packed during certain events, line can last for awhile.
Since it's downtown, parking sucks

THE VERDICT:  One of my favorite bars in Las Vegas, will go here consistently.Expensive but I LOVE it!

Look, I am a Marriott rewards member, and while the rooms are expensive they are really nice, the 17th floor was awesome (by the way it goes from 12 to 14....like 14 isn't really 13 at that point). The breakfast had fresh fruit, and not the cheap melon stuff, the actual strawberry, raspberry and pineapple. I am a loyal rewards member and have yet to stay in a bad hotel!Fuego Bistro is AMAZING!  I normally do not write reviews but I cannot get the food out of my mind.  My husband and I tried this after purchasing the Groupon on a weeknight around 5pm.  BTW this is a tiny little place, so a reservation is a must. Hands down one of our favorite places! Shortribs  cornbread casserole and Sangira!!Took us a few minute to find the spot - tucked in on a side street as it was, in a courtyard of a older, kitchy shopping area. Between the old gurgling fountain, colorful christmas lights, old trees and flowering coriander plants, my girlfriend and I quite enjoyed the offbeat decore. Not your typical bistro spot. 

The waitstaff were attentive and friendly, especially our waiter, a young dude who's name escapes me. He answered my celiac girlfriend's questions courteously, and was mild mannered and easy-going in a way that really suited the environs. Happy hour menu looked great, and the house marg and mojito were both fresh, simple and tasty.  GF got mussels and a street tacos, with the mussels being right up there with the best she had, and the tacos fresh, tasty and clean.

My main course was the Soy & Cola braised short-ribs with something-something au-jus, I opted for the mashed potatoes and maple chile glazed carrots as sides. At this point, i was feeling like, while the drinks were good, and the atmosphere & service was quirky, natural and relaxed, I wasn't totally expecting the food to blow me away - I was wrong. The dish was both incredibly well balanced and delicious (and very healthy portions at that). Spicy, rich and fall apart tender meat, with gentle touches of sweet, fruity, savory and spicy. The potatoes were addicting, and the carrots (being from Vermont, and a maple lover, i know that maple can be a difficult thing to cook with) were not over sweet, but perfectly tender, buttery, a touch of salt and heat.

All in all a great, friendly and offbeat dining experience. We'll be back.I honestly needed about 2 more days to see all of old town! with its unique shops, restaurants and museums - there is so much to do! It is def a romantic place to go visit if you are in scottsdale - then it is a must see!! the parking is free and it is walking distance. Best off all everyone is super friendly! I can't wait to come back and explore the rest of the town. My fav are the sandwich club and the tavern!Their Filet Mignon Cobb is my all time favorite there, its already perfectly tossed in dressing and is a meal.. not bird food by any means. I have also tried their mushroom/chicken crepes and Im not a crepes fan and I was more than impressed. Great place for a date or just meeting a friend out for a bite. Its swanky yet you won't feel uncomfortable dressed down. Not pretentious and the waitstaff is fantastic. My only complaint is on their mashed potatoes..too much oil and they're whipped to death.. but hey i like mine with lumps..so it's a preference thing.Most everyone knows about First Friday events downtown, but less folks are familiar with the group that puts them on - Artlink.  This group started small, and has done amazing things for the Arts community in Phoenix.  

Though First Fridays have become absolutely huge now, and it hardly feels the same - I actually love hanging with the crowds once a year for Art Detour.

Once a year more galleries open, and lots of businesses will display art instead of just Friday night it's Friday, that Saturday and Sunday!  I've brought new people with me every year and no one is ever disappointed.  Some folks like to drive from one spot to the next and that definitely has it's advantages!  It's also fun to take the shuttle around.  You can have some fun conversations, find out the skinny on a particular gallery, or get hot spot info from the bus drivers.  And while both First Friday and Art Link are definitely All-age events, there are generally several after parties for the over 21 crowd sponsored by individual locations.

Art link has some great volunteer opportunities too, and it can be a great way for someone new to town to get to know people while learning all about the downtown art scene.they offer an innovative twist on Sushi, so if you just came from the Old Saud of Southeast Asia you might be displeasured.  I really enjoyed my dining experience here.  The service was top notch!  Food came out fast, presented nicely, edible art form and agreed nicely with my pallet!  I will def come back again!  Martinis are fab they had my Gucci boots  ah rocking!  plus the bartender was hooking a girl up!  

They also have a really contemporary sushi bar with a pretty light show

I am posting mobile uploadsEnded up here while looking for a diner type place at the MGM casino. Liked the "bar food" variety on their menu so decided to give it a shot even though most entrees were priced at around $25, pizzas around $15 so not too bad. It's fenced off but open to the casino, which is nice. It was an upscale-casual vibe (if that's possible). The service was impeccable! Truly. Meatball pizza as an app was delicious and I've had some serious pizza in Chi-town and NYC. It took about 15 minutes to get the pizza, which we expected, but as soon as it came out the manager came right up to us, apologized for the delay on our pizza, and immediately told us that they would be buying us dessert (we were a group of 4). Not one of us knew what delay he spoke of, we just sort of froze at the mention of free dessert, which i'm not a big sweets person, but free is free. I had the steak skewers...UH-Amazing taste and texture. The garlic chili wings were good, but they seemed more teriyaki glazed to me. The truffle potato chips were great for blue cheese lovers. The short rib was fantastic as was the flat iron steak with fries. Oh, the fries were incredible. Hot and crispy, and stayed like that for a while. We decided to share two desserts in case they were too big. We were super stuffed because we had already ordered all of our food before we knew we would be getting the free dessert. We chose the banana banouffee(?) and the pineapple upsidedown dessert, both were topped wtih homemade ice creams and syrups. Believe me when I say that these desserts were the most amazing creations to ever hit my tounge. They were just beyond description! Yes, both of them! I've had so-called good desserts before at places like Ferrara's and Serendipity in NYC before, but those places were just generic, processed, super market ice cream compared to Wolfgang's creations. They really were unbelieveable. I cannot wait to go back to this place, and the great thing is that it stays open til about 6am I think! We paid about $200 for 4 people.My Fiance and I love this place!!! We've been here so many different times and love how unique the dishes are. I recently had the spring pea tortellini and loved it. It was definitely different and light. Definitely worth eating here if you've never been. PLus their open till 6 amLove this place! great service and really good foodGreat old school, cheap breakfast place.  Small standard menu you can't really go wrong on, hit up the cinnamon raisin toast too.i really truly respect this place as a legitimate and sanitary body modification place.
unlike most places, they don't try to mix tattoos and body piercing in one studio, and i think that adds to a facility's integrity. 
they won't pierce you if you smell like alcohol or act intoxicated or are underage. i know plenty of people who've had their holes stretched here, gotten everything you can imagine pierced, or done that implant under the skin thing and have never heard a complaint. 
there are ALWAYS peoples inside, but whether they're customers or teenagers just milling around their shop, i don't know.I went in to HTC the day after Christmas, having read some great reviews. It definitely lived up to their reputation. 

There was a 1.5-2 hour wait, which to me is an indication of just how good they are. Paperwork was completed quickly and it actually took less time than they estimated to get in. 

Kevin was my piercer and he was really good at making me feel comfortable. He changed his gloves a few times during the process. They really have a focus on keeping things as clean and sanitary as possible. He gave me detailed aftercare instructions and told me to come back any time with questions. Really a great overall experience!With very few drive-in options left in Arizona, the Scottsdale 6 gains appreciation just because of its proximity to many. Located right off McKellips Road the Scottsdale 6 was fairly easy to locate, and in the range of various stores and restaurants, everything someone would need to enjoy a nice night out. 
   One downfall of the Scottsdale 6 would be its lack of signs and directions. Entering proved slightly difficult, obviously my boyfriend and I went once night arouse to enjoy the 7:30 showing of Wolfman, once we found the small dirt road which lead to the ticket line there was about 4 lines for us to choose from with small signs explaining the intended purpose for each one. The signs however were poorly illuminated and difficult to read. The two lines per booth, we realized for cash or debit, were pretty short and not much of a wait. I do recommend getting there early though, in order to find a good spot for your car. 
   After paying the reasonable sum of $6 dollars per person we were directed to one of the 6 screens in which to view our movie. There was plenty of open space to maneuver or car and find the perfect spot but this soon changed when our viewing time approached. It did get slightly crowded but not to bad considering it was Valentines Day. We tuned our radio to the FM station as directed by the associate in the booth and got ourselves comfortable only to hear over the station that our movie was to be delayed. Apparently there was a police car chase, and due to the close distance between the screen and the road we were actually able to see the police chase. Once the movie began there were quite a few airplanes and cars off the highway that added a bit of background noise but nothing to severe as to ruin the drive-in experience after all we realized we would be outside.
   Leaving after the first showing posed quite a problem due to the emergence of more vehicles for the second showing.  The lack of signs again affected our ability to navigate our way through easily, and after circling the area a few times we managed to find our way out. Overall it was a fairly enjoyable experience.This place is located in Scottsdale, but as soon as you enter the lot you feel like you're in the middle of nowhere where a tornado will soon come ripping through the movie screen a la Twister. At least that's how I felt.

You drive up a dusty road to a little booth and pay. Drive down the dusty road, park in a dusty spot of your choice. Well, I'm not sure if I actually drove on a road. It was dirt lot, and I just steered my car hoping I wouldn't hit a pothole or run over a curb.

The concession stand is easy to find. It's pretty much the only building on the lot. There were a few food choices: soda, hot dogs, popcorn, a variety of candy and churros (!!). The bathroom was clean. I think there were tables and arcade games, too.

Despite its slightly ghetto/scary vibe, the drive in is a great value since you pay about $6/person for 2 movies and can bring in whatever food you want.Beautiful Casino, inside and out.   The buffet was impressive as well.   Went in on a weekday and it wasnt too busy - but hopping enough!  Also, i think won a couple hundred here too but cant really remember ;Can I say amazing customer service?!?!  I am soooooo impressed that Jason remember us from over a year ago.   I love great customer service!!! That is always a plus on my list!  Brad is off to a great start too!  Stay tuned... It's only 130pm more details to follow!!!!!  Thank you for cabana service.Be still my beating heart!

When I moved here almost four years ago...I was looking for a restaurant to host a very special occasion for 7 guests.  I went around and checked out several highly recommended establishments and Tarbell's was my last stop of the day.  It was actually closed on the day that I arrived to check it out so I just looked through the windows into the restaurant and when I saw their semi-private partial glass enclosed dining room, I knew this was the place.

On the day of the event, we had two vegetarians in our party and that was not a problem at all (I think their food was actually the best).  Instead of getting an entree, my son ordered three sides and he was completely happy w/his meal.  I recall having the raspberry mojitos and chocolate martini and both were sensational.  Dessert was also top notched and to make the experience even sweeter, Mark Tarbell came by to congratulate us and thanked us for choosing his restaurant to host our special event.

From beginning to end, our meals felt like it was taking us on a culinary adventure.  Service was also excellent and everyone in the party agreed that we'd come to a very special place indeed.

I've been back to Tarbell's on a couple more occasions since then (always w/guests in tow) and the experience has always been the same...everyone leaves completely happy.  This is a very memorable place and I would come here more frequently if it wasn't so far from my house.Coming from Oregon myself, it's hard not to love the lost leaf. It's like a slice of the northwest in the middle of downtown. 

And if your a beer fan, this is the place for you. They have a wide range of many micro's and one of the better places to find beers from Oregon,  which of course are far superior then any other beers. No, I'm not biased at all ;)

The crowd is usually a mix between the indie/ art scene and an occasional grouping of theatre goers out after a show. The place is cozy with limited seating, but this does provide easy opportunities to meet others as you all try to huddle around a table for conversation.

The service can be a bit slow, as others have commented as there is usually just a bartender and maybe a bar back who also serves as a busboy, but they have always been super friendly and laid back. 

Tip: bring cash if your in a hurry as they take cards, but the credit system is still on dial-up so you could be waiting a couple minutes for the charge to go through. 

If you like the Lost Leaf vibe, and want some good light grub, check out Roosevelts as well in the same area.Great selection of gelato! Across from the Marriot Suites. Service is great! Sample the flavors before selecting. Open later than usual establishments in the area. Always lots of people inside. Try it...won't be disappointed.I LOVE Kincaids! Especially with the updated decor and menu, you just can't go wrong. Not to mention they have an incredible happy hour. Half off all appetizers, $4 drafts (including Guinness, WHAT?!) $4 glasses of wine and select specialty drinks. This is a great place to go if you're looking for a different spot before a game or concert, even just a night out Downtown. The regular dining menu definitely doesn't dissapoint either - some of the freshest seafood and perfectly seared steaks! Clam chowder, French Onion Soup, even the salads. This place just knows how to do it. Can't wait to head back for happy hour soon. :)I had the white chocolate peppermint mocha and a French macaron.  The coffee drink was perfectly executed and a tasty way to get my caffeine fix.  The macaron is made in house and is melt in your mouth perfection.  The owner is very friendly and the rest of the staff seemed competent.  My only complaint is that it is on the other side of town from where I live, thus it will be an once in awhile treat for me.I had a fantastic time here on Saturday. There was a great variety of produce, fresh bread, interesting (truly!) arts and crafts, and people watching. My mom splurged and bought me the most adorable handmade apron, and I bought some handmade soap. Really, I wanted to buy something from nearly every vendor there. It was much larger and more well organized than I had anticipated. Although you can use a credit card, cash exchanges are preferable. If you use a credit card, you cannot complete your transaction with the individual vendor. Rather, you have to go to a different line where all of the credit card transactions take place.Ok i have been holding off on reviewing Takamatsu because how do you really write up your favorite restaurant? Obviously i love the place! The food is out of this world and my sushi chef is like extended family. My favorite food is sushi. I love to try new and fun places but it all always comes back to Takamatsu. 

Ok so first : they have everything from sushi to Korean BBQ- to noodle bowls. If you love sushi and Korean - and a great noodle bowl - this is the golden goose of spots to eat. Yes they have cooking @the table or you can order it to taste. Yes they have ALL traditional Korean plates and yummy sides. I suggest the pork belly! 

Second: i go there to eat SUSHI - this is my sushi spot. My safe place with amazing food. Its a perfect date spot! I sit @the sushi bar with Jon and i know im about to love everything that touches my lips. This is my happy place. 

First fav: Tuna mango Nigiri and Spicy Tuna Mango Nigiri - this was created by head sushi chef Jon :) it is an amazing pairing of flavor and a not miss!!!!

Second fav: Sashimi Salad - this is a mix of tunas,salmon and smelt! With a spicy twist! The thought makes me salivate! 

Third fav: Screaming Orgasm - a take on tuna tataki that is mouth watering and makes me literally moan how good it is. Its amazing! 

And the last thing i love about takamatsu is that Jon shops for his Customers. He cares about quality in the fish and veggies and is always keeping the menu fresh. Now reading the yelp reviews i see the number 1 complaint is service time  - no Takamatsu is not a Fast Food Spot- the food here is made fresh and with love and that takes time- this is a Meal place - you come and have a Food Experience. If you are looking for a quick meal - i suggest you slow down and start appreciating what you let touch your lips.I love Oregano's.  The food is awesome.  But sometimes the locations are a little "iffy."

With that, I give my review of my favorite location, Gilbert.  I've been to the ones in Chandler, both Scottsdale locations, Tempe...but by far Gilbert is my favorite locale.

Started off with Calamari. I love that Oregano's has their calamari cut into french fry style wedges, and not the rings and tentacles that most places have.  The dipping marinara sauce needs a little work though.

Then went on to order the Vino Bambino split 4 ways for a dinner salad. To think that this was once taken off the menu? Seriously?  It's so good, once it hits the lips.  

Split a Big Rig and a 'The Lady Is a Scampi.' The size of the shrimp on the LIAS were unbelievable! Could have swore they put Lobster in the dish instead of shrimp.  

Didn't have room for dessert, and I don't really indulge on sweets as it is (I have a rep and a girlish figure to protect), but I hear rave reviews about them. 

All in all, good eats in a great atmosphere, with a very friendly and knowledgeable staff.One of my favorite restaurants in Vegas!! I can't believe all of the bad reviews I'm seeing about this place. I grew up with friends of all ethnicities and Cuban being one, so I must say I've had a lot of Cuban food to know the real deal and this place is definitely the real deal!! The employees are all super friendly, and the service is great! I've been here maybe 20 times and I've never had a bad experience.

The food is absolutely delicious. I've had many different things on the menu and every dish I've ordered, I LOVED!! My personal favorite items on the menu are : Moros y christianos, yuca al mojo con chicharrones, mariquitas, pan con bistec, bistec de palomilla, pollo a la plancha and the arroz con pollo. 

There were some complaints about the prices and the dishes being too small?... I definitely disagree with that. I've never gotten a meal from there that didn't leave me anything but OVERLY FULL!!! Side dishes range from $3 to $6. Sandwiches are $11-$13. Main entrees $14- $18. I think the prices are reasonable for the amount of food and the quality of food and the service that you get. 

I love havana grill!!!So you want to know about this bar? Well it's F-ing cool! The vibe ranges from a laid back neighborhood watering hole with friendly bartenders to a high energy dance party with guest DJ's and an indie rocker crowd. You also get lots of hot chicks and flair bartenders, which is something you don't see too often in Vegas.  They have special theme nights that are constantly evolving, as they try their best to keep things from getting stale. Where else can you see sleazy/sexy women, listen to great DJ's, and watch bottles being tossed into the air, all at a reasonable price? If you're a club hotel whore, then stay there...you probably will not like this place. The Red Room Saloon is not pretenious so just come for some unadulterated fun!Love it.  I am a Monty Python fan and I really enjoyed the trip down memory lane but I believe the best parts were those that were new to me.

Before you see the show look for the Monty Python slot machines in the Wynn Casino, it is a great appetizer for the show to come.I can't believe I had to add this business! I love this place it is so fun, and reminds me of when I was little and pb&j was 75% of what I ate!

PB Loco is a fun little cafe dedicated completely to peanut butter! My favorite thing about PB loco is their different flavors like white chocolate raspberry peanut butter. I don't even really like peanut butter, but that flavor made me change my mind. PB loco offers peanut butter in any way you like to eat it. I had a light snack of celery with the white chocolate raspberry peanut butter, while my friend had a peanut butter and jelly sandwich with marshmallow fluff and bananas and a peanut butter shake. This is an awesome place to bring kids or bring out the inner child in you. If you are ever walking by, even if you are not hungry, stop by and take a sample of their many flavored peanut butters. If you really like one you can even take home a jar!

Crazy Peanut Butters:
Dark Chocolate Duo
Sumatra Cinnamon Raisin
Jungle Banana
and many moreUnstoppable, did cabanas twice for two separate bachelor parties.  Pricey, but you should already know that you need to go big in Vegas.  Feels like the spring break I always imagined.  Hot crowd, ready to party, everyone is friendly and going insane.  Great vibe.  Rehab's still got itGreat dog park off warm springs and eastern endAH-MAZ-ING.

I love this park. Too bad we met for the first time during my final week living in Phoenix. Otherwise, this park would have become a regular staple in my active life. Walking...running...basketball...tennis... They even have baseball cages and a skate park! Now, I probably wouldn't have done either of those, for fear of offing myself. But, hey, I love to watch and having both around brings a very cool vibe, you know? 

The walking/running sidewalk meanders around nice, calming waters. 

There's even some electrical outlets near the picnic/play area. So you can fire up the ol' laptop while you watch the kiddies play and chase each other around. So awesome. 

If I ever were to buy a home in the Phoenix area, this is the first place I'd consider - near this park, which is quite big for parks in Phoenix and, as mentioned before, offers an array of very fun things to do. Heck, there's even a path to ride horses on!

Here's info on the skate park: http://www.ci.gilbert.az.us/parks/popups/skatepark.cfm

Enjoy!Came here on NYE with my husband, friends and my mom.  We decided that we didn't want to be on the strip this year for NYE, but we wanted to go to Vegas.  So, we took advantage of the $99 all you can drink deal that The Pub offered.  We had the best NYE EVER!!

First off, we made sure to arrive an hour early so we could secure patio seating since there were only three patio seating arrangements.  We were SO glad we did!  We got a couch, three chairs, a table and a patio heater...so we were set up!  The deal was all you can drink domestic beers and well drinks from 8p-12a...no gimmicks, no catch.  In addition to that, and unbeknownst to us, they also came around constantly with the most amazing hors d'oeuvres and served us at our table.  They served bacon wrapped meatloaf, mini chicken wellington, ahi tuna, sliders, caprese salad kabobs...to name a few.  Absolutely delicious!!  We met SO many people from all over the world, drank all night and ate like kings. They also had gogo dancers and a DJ inside, so we could watch from our table and listen to the music without being drowned out by it.  To finish off the night off, we had front row seating to the firework show at midnight, along with a complimentary champagne toast.

The evening was perfect, the staff was amazing, the food and drinks were excellent!  We were able to enjoy ourselves and relax while being in Vegas and partying at the same time.  We will DEFINITELY attend this again next year if it's offered again!I am a Zoe's Kitchen fan, through and through, but the service here was great! Personally I don't stray too far from spinach roll ups with chicken, roasted veggies as a side, and there is a reason for that, i.e. they ROCK. Perry was incredibly friendly, offering an authentic smile and solid customer service. She even gave me a freshly baked chocolate chip cookie after learning I was having a terrible day (does not mean you will get one, just as a disclaimer!). Solid investment Perry - customer for life! Eat at this Zoe's today!Great food! Carhops are cute! Service was good and food was hot! They cook to order and deliver on skates! How cool is that! I told the manager about Yelp and he said "Anyone who reads this review and comes to my Sonic will get a surprise!" "A free Jr. Candy Sundae with the purchase of a combo!"  That's pretty cool of him. It's only good at this location so if you like being spoiled, stop by and mention "Yelp" you get this deal!My friends and I walked here from the strip and it took us about 20 minutes following the GPS on our phones. At 1AM in the morning, the walk felt pretty shady. But we made it safely!

After wandering into the Tuscany hotel and casino, we were directed to Marilyn's Cafe. As a group of 5, my friends and I were seated nearly immediately. Once our waiter came around to take our order, he automatically asked if all wanted the steak and eggs. Assumption correct!

At $5.99, the steak and eggs were such a steal! Steak and eggs were both cooked according to personal preferences and they even include toast plus hashbrowns.

Not sure if it was just the late night hunger talking or what, but the steak was delicious! Best $5.99 I spent in Vegas! I'd definitely recommend coming here!This is a really nice mall with a great array of shops, restaurants and a huge Harkins Theater. 

I like to go in the off hours or days to avoid the crowds. Tuesday nights are perfect!This mall is pretty damn awesome!!!! Dillards in there has the best shit ever! def my new fave spot to shop. i bought a few things there. cheap prices for brand names.

Went to windsor and bought a $50 dress... my area in cali doesnt even carry nice dresses like this windsor O_O hitting up this mall when i come back :DTwo dollar movies.  On the big screen.  Two dollars.  That's four dollars if you bring a date.   

Bring some whiskey in a flask and that's still:  $2 + $2 + your flask = $4!!

SURE the seats are uncomfortable and most of the flicks are geared towards kids, but...

*  There's usually 2-3 movies for adults
*  If you drink enough whisky you'll forget about that gnarly kink in your neck

Did I mention already that it was two dollars?OMG, Can't wait to go back! I had one of the rooms with the soaking tub and I wanted to move into my room! Huge rooms, great spa-quality soaps and shampoos, Pod style coffee maker, Mini Bar, Martini shakers! comfortable bed, huge balcony with a double wide chaise, perfect on so many levels, Great Staff, waiters, great breakfasts! Pool, call ahead for spa treatments if staying over a SUday or midweek, they book up quickly! bath robes, great lighting, TV-which I could watch from anywhere in the room or laying in the tub!!! I would only ask for some extra outlets near the desk for laptops etc. so you don't have to get on your hands and knees to find. They did provide a long cord for me whan I asked. I really have no complaints, and for me that's rare, lolI loved every aspect of my recent stay at HVH! Is it weird that I had the Jetson's theme song stuck in my head most of the trip? From the moment you pull up, you feel like you're inside someone's idea of the future. From the mid-century furniture to the color palette, you're inside a Sirkian melodrama for sure. 

Until, that is, you arrive in your nicely appointed room and see the updated rooms with huge soaking tubs, glass showers, a veritable wall of mirrors and a nice flat screen. In my room, the patio doors opened onto a veranda with nice outdoor furniture, and provided a healthy dose of Scottsdale sunshine right inside my room. 

Well-stocked minibar and snacks, and a wonderful in-room dining menu rounded out a perfect stay. Every interaction I had with any member of the staff here was tops, and the pool areas are gorgeous. A lively outdoor patio bar scene made me feel like I was right in the middle of something really fun, and the in-room continental breakfast I had on my last morning was worth every penny.So it's been years that I have stayed at this resort due to bad experiences with quality accommodations in the past but it was the best deal for a last minute Fourth of July staycation and decided to go for it. 
Well, I'm glad I did because for the price on a holiday weekend it was so worth it. 
Price paid was $89 w AAA discount plus tax and resort fee. I know some people gripe about res fees but seriously if u staycay often; resort fees are the norm at resorts in town. It was 18 per night which beats paying 40+ at others.

Anywho here are some pros and cons
Pros:
-mountainside room (room 4176) we received was nicely renovated, ample, clean, separate living room
-being able to be picked up by complimentary resort shuttle to go to and fro from the big resort to pools and restaurants was a plus
-pool was lax so no worries about overbearing life guards hawking ur every move
-activities for kids/dive in movies 
-baby area in pool
-beautiful Sonoran landscape 
-many hiking opportunities 

Cons
-in evening there is longer wait for shuttle pick-up
-water park area lacks a lazy river or wave pool ; only has one slide


Dress code: resort casual, poolside suits ranged from the meshy borderline stripper wearing kind to the nana swimdressTo be honest I was apprehensive to try sushi ken at first. It's unassuming location close to a dry cleaner in a strip mall doesn't overwhelm one with the assumption of great cuisine. But...I was wrong. Their food is great...and the prices are equally awesome. I had a huge pork ramen bowl about a month ago and it was awesome. The portion size was huge!  almost ridiculous actually...I probably got through half of it! Not to mention the fact that the entree came with California rolls and a small side salad...all for around 10 bucks! I will definitely be going again...I will just maybe not eat anything like...a day or so beforehand so as to have a fair shot at finishing my food!In my opinion, this is by far the best Sushi and Japanese joint in town!  This place is as authentic as you can get for Phoenix, AZ.  My husband and I are addicted to the Chirachi bowl which is packed full of rice, seaweed, and piled high with the chef's selection of the freshest raw fish.  This incredible bowl of deliciousness is $20!  You couldn't find this much fresh raw fish at a restaurant for this price anywhere else in Phoenix.  

If I get the Chirachi bowl idea stuck in my head, I have to have it and nothing else will satisfy my craving.  Speaking of...I think I'll order one for take out right now!  ;)

I rate Sushi Ken at the highest rating possible: 5 Noms: "Nom, Nom, Nom, Nom, & NOM!" :DOk, for those of you that want a short review, "the story is short":
Superior Food. Superior Service. erm....UNIQUE Atmosphere. Make reservations. Give Mikey at the door some playful attitude. Tip appropriately.

There, move on to the next review if you aren't into my typical prose.

It's 7:15pm on Friday Night. I was motivated to go to Capo's for only one reason: a Yelper (Judith B.) wrote a bad review and the owner Nico S. responded with zeal...on Yelp...within 24 hours of each other.  So, I went to check it out myself! And there I was, 7:15pm, ringing the Speak-Easy doorbell and mixing it up with Mikey The Doorman (his card says Mikey "The Bull"), trying to get in.  Hey, it's an OLD TIME SPEAK EASY. Don't forget about the UNIQUE atmosphere, here!  Ok, all playfulness aside, the truth of the matter is I got the very last seat in the house...at the bar...right in front of the kitchen staff and the bartenders...and I had a wonderful experience! I got to see EVERYTHING being cooked. I even saw some of the back-staff at work. There are SIX cooks all working a feverish, aerobic pace to keep the food moving toward the customer. These people are MIRACULOUS at what they do. I watched the bar-staff work with equal zeal, so much so that they took the time to make friends with me because they noticed I noticed them so much. What does it say that a Bartender (Melissa) with 5 years experience takes the FRAKKING TIME to shake hands with some random customer? Wow. And John the bar-back REMEMBERED my name. AND JUSTIN the other guy behind the bar...between the three of them my water glass was NEVER empty.

Ok, anyway, there are probably twenty people working at this restuarant, and each and every one of them are busting their hiney's to make every customer happy. Every Breath of Every Minute that I was there. That counts for 5 and a HALF stars to me. I'm not talking about the "I'm busy I'm busy I'm busy" attitude, I'm talking about the "Every Customer Is My Number One Most Important Customer Every Second" kind of attitude. Wow. Props, Nico.

Let's pretend the service wasn't fantastic for a moment.  It was, but let's pretend, just for a moment.  Because I was curious, I ordered the Veal Piccata, pasta fagioli (say foo-ZHOOOL!), and spaghetti with red sauce (Yes, RED Sauce). Yes, I lived in Europe for 8 years. Yes, I know my way around a traditional Italian restaurant a 'la Europa, AND the American version thereof. Yes, I thought the Veal Piccata was great! Cooked TO PERFECTION in my opinion, NOT OVERCOOKED as Judith says. My particular dinner was so tasty I couldn't get over the tenderness of the perfectly-cooked veal...and the wonderful caper sauce it was bathed in. Heck, just that alone is worth five stars to me.  Yet, I digress a little too far.

The veal was perfect.  The pasta in the red sauce was FANTASTIC. Yes, FANTASTIC. The pasta was cooked, in my opinion, exactly Al Dente. Jimmy at Chianti Cafe would probably have been jealous had we been dining together tonight, and given half the opportunity, I'd like to bring Jimmy and a lady friend of his with my girlfriend and compare his cooking to Nico's one day!

Oh, and then the wine. House Cabernet that tasted like it wasn't the "house" brand. Heck, I could savor the chocolate overtones battling the plum on my tongue all night long it was that good. And the wine list had a large selection of wines I recognize from my own collection at one time or other (I happen to have collected over two hundred bottles of primarily sparkling and red wines from Napa and Sonoma counties once upon a time). Sterling Vineyards featured among them.

Oh, and the cappucino after dinner was really, really good.

Oh, and the bread throughout the dinner was so scrumptuous!

Oh, and the port after-dinner drink was luscious and velvety!

Oh, and Kansas led Mich State by two most of the time I was there! LOL!

Ok, so by and large, I compare this restaurant to Chianti Cafe in Summerlin and rate them equally, favoring Chianti Cafe because it is a bit more conducive to seducing my girlfriend sans loud groups of tourists. But Nico deserves 5 stars, because he DELIVERS 5 stars.

And as Dennis Miller says "That's just my opinion, I could be wrong!"This little joint serves nothing but chicken fingers, waffle fries, and texas toast (among a few other things) and they do it WELL!  The place is decorated with a bunch of old rock n roll memorabilia which I think is really cool and he even has an old jukebox in there!  The chicken fingers are in one word : AMAZING.  They are very lightly breaded and fried in trans fat free oil (I know still not the healthiest thing but they are GOOD) and they are moist and tender and juicy every time.  The waffle fries are the best compliment to the fingers and the selection of homemade sauces can't be beat (special sauce highly recommended)!  Overall this place is where you want to go when you are craving some of those delicious little chicken fingers that everyone loves!  Family owned and operated!  Oh and little tip, try to call to see if they are open, sometimes when business is slow they close early ;-)Gellato is always very enjoyable.. I recently had the whisky cream.  It was delicious.  My favorite item to get here are the canolis.  The owners are from an area around Milan so the items are authentic Italian.  Geary place.  Enjoy!!!So your going to Scottsdale via Paradise Valley....or your coming from Scottsdale heading east....your stomach is growling but you don't want the usual...then look no further than Jason's Deli. I was in that situation on Friday night and decided to give this locale a try....and I must say I was not disappointed. I had the Smokey Jack Panini with Smoked turkey breast....guacamole....provolone cheese....lettuce...tomato....bacon on the side which I gave to my wife....LOL...since I don't eat red meat....and Russian dressing. However sandwich was made to order and pressed perfectly on the grill....and the flavor was outstanding. They give you a pickle and homemade potato chips on the side....and I also had some lemonade which comes from a fountain with free refills. 

I almost missed out on the free Ice Cream....but I seen people walking around with cones of Ice Cream and I had my wife ask was it free. Indeed it was and we both enjoyed a nice Ice Cream cone....mine was chocolate vanilla swirl...and you can also get it in a cup as well. The service was great and the whole place had a real nice neighborhood feel to it.....I look forward to returning here very soon. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!Bottom Line:
Show is affordable, and, acting volunteers, or not, I haven't laughed so hard with eyes tearing in a while!! Well done Mr. Savard.

The Skinny:
Walking into the miracle of mile shops there was an "information" desk who gifted me 6 free tickets for admission to the hypnotist show.  I'm always intrigued by hypnotists..especially of the comedic variety, fond memories of Flip Orley back east.  We meandered over to the theater n learn the free section is sold out. Bummer. The map she showed was a huge auditorium(optical illusion??), we opt for VIP seating for $16/seat. Good thing was we could arrive 5min before show as we now have assigned seats. Bonus

Arriving a few minutes before show time the line is huge, but with reserved seating we're good. Inside we see our seats are pretty good, maybe 15th row back. VIP! And second row from the back. Huh? Where's all the free GA section? Vegas Scam! Ha. Maybe the freebies were off to the sides. Sure their view is a bit worse, but the theater is small, not really a bad seat in the house. 

My beautiful girlfriend was among the ~30 volunteers on stage. She made it through the first few 'tests' but fell out of trance and joined me in the audience. She fully believed the others were in trance, they wouldn't make eye contact, and with the stunts they were pulling off they must have been! Perhaps it was a combination of being on stage and wanting to be perform, either way, we, the audience loved it.  

Rather than give any spoilers on the contents, just know it's more PG-17 than PG/G. You Tube has some clips, though I found the live performance 100x better. 

Tip:
Don't forget to shake the volunteers hands before the leave the bldg, you, and they, will have a nice surpriseNow this must be how movie heaven feels like. As a pauper =( having the opportunity to enjoy the experience a couple times a year does it for me. It's first class seats and service for a mere $15 for a movie ticket, then add on drinks and an appetizer, and you end up spending close to $40. Not bad, especially if it's a real big blockbuster movie, then it makes it more worth it. check it out, it's awesome.I love this theater.  I love that you get to reserve your own seat in advance.  No more rushing to the theater hoping to find a good seat.  I also love that you have a choice of a 21 or above only theater or general theater.  I do have to say that even in the general theater I have yet to have seen a child or baby.  It's been adults only so far.  The food and service is good.  At one screening the film start was delayed by 15 minutes and without complaint from anyone the manager came and gave everyone in the theater a pass to come back just for waiting.  Very good customer service.My roomate has worked at this theater for past 3 years, and let me tell you, this is the best theater I've ever been too. I mean you get to eat great food and watch a movie in recliners! You can even order alcohol if you'd like!

Overall, this theater is super friendly, clean, great food, good quality sound and picture, and very comfortable seats.We had a group (8 people) dinner here last week while in Vegas for a conference.  So far, this was the best meal I've had out of all the pretty darn good restaurants in that god-forsaken town.  Meals are what make Vegas fun.  And winning at craps.
I walked in ahead of my (late arriving) group and sat at the bar for a cocktail.  Frank made me a KILLER Old Fashioned, BTW.  I asked what his favorite thing on the menu was and he immediately said the octopus.  Right on the money, as we had two of them at the table and it was amazing.  We also all shared the artichoke salad (good), the beet salad (excellent) and the calamari (best I've ever had).
I had the bone in veal chop.  It was cooked to perfection and went great with the Barbera recommended by our waiter.
Most of the rest had pasta of some sort, all of which I tried were outstanding.
I would happily recommend this to anyone visiting Las Vegas.
Couple things - people complaining about the small plates need to have their head examined.  Also, good food in a good atmosphere with good service costs money, the end.  Finally, as you read through these reviews, remember that most of America consists of the great un-washed masses and LOTS of the un-washed come to stay and play in Vegas.  I'll just leave it at that.B&B provides a pretty wonderful experience with few drawbacks. My first visit was on the company dime, so that may ease any hard judgements. But I did return just a week later. Indeed, the experience is great if not stellar; and the food delicious!

There is certainly a relaxed ambience. I would not call it truly romantic - random music from the casino comes in clearly. There is not much seating, so things could get packed quickly.

Have the sommelier recommend a wine. He presented a fantastic quality and good pairing on both occasions. Anyone not an Italian wine expert probably won't have much luck with the menu anyhow.

Unlike most good spots in Vegas, B&B's prices are appropriate for the quality. Also, one must make a long trek through the casino craziness to reach it. But you'll be glad you did.The 1984's red, yellow, and white lay out sets the stage for their paralyzingly good burgers. After greedily eating my Double Double Animal Style and Well Done Fries (that put Shake Shack to shame), I instantly jump on my phone and rub it into my East coast friend's face. I evoke those meals like children recalling Halloween treats, or Christmas presents.Anyone that has been to Hawaii knows about ABC stores. I was stoked when I discovered that there were 2 ABC stores in Desert Passages shops in the Aladdin Hotel (now Miracle Mile/Planet Hollywood) a few years ago. Now every trip to Vegas guarantees at least one stop here. 

The great thing about ABC stores is that you can get pretty much anything you need while on vacation for a decent price. They have a ton of souveniers - magnets, pens, calendars, tees, glassware and whatever else you may want to bring home. They carry your standard snacks but also carry snacks that cater to their Asian clientele (wasabi peas anyone?).  Plus they have a bunch of Hawaiian snacks - cookies, popcorn and macadamia nuts galore. This is also the best place to get Las Vegas themed Hello Kitty stuff - post its, cell phone charms, pens, etc. 

And they have beer, wine and liquor. One stop shopping, for sure.These folks are really fun to watch.  If you really just want to see some fun artists do there things, these folks are the ones you want.  I watch them every time I get a chance...  Each one of them do it differently.  You can spend hours watching them.I love this hotel.  The rooms are luxurious and spacious the restaurants are a plenty and the buffet is hands down the best buffet in town.

The shopping in the Forum shops is some of the best, from luxury like Prada and Gucci to affordable like H&M you cannot go wrong.

The place is just truly amazing and worth every dime to stay here.A great hotel and casino with a spectacular view of the Strip!Really nice property on the strip with the main entrance lined with shrubs and statues; you really feel like royalty. The newer Octavius tower has really nice rooms overlooking either the south side of the strip or a pool view (good for checking all the eye candy in the summer). This tower also has close access to the pool from the elevators, however it's a long walk from the elevators to the lobby and casino. The casino is huge and I enjoyed gambling there.I guess I'll just have the cake for breakfast....that's how good the cakes are here!  I purposely bought a larger birthday cake so I would have left overs.  Even two days later...the cake is still moist and fluffy in the refrigerator.  I've honestly only had the guava chiffon cake, but it is my favorite cake in the world at this point =)  I grew up eating Asian cakes, the fruit kind....so I think I've been trained to like cakes that aren't overly sweet.  The guava cake has a perfect balance of sweetness combined with the tartness of the jelly in between the layers!  The frosting is nice and airy, so doesn't feel like you've shoved a sugar cube in your mouth.  The cakes are very reasonably priced as well....just make sure to call in specialty orders ahead of time!As i said before this place is so good.. can't stop eating. No seriously. I just can't stop eating it. The only way you could be better indian food would be if you went to india.This place really does earn 5 stars1 The customer service is excellent...  I just arrived from Florida and told the front desk clerk I thought I was dehydrated from the heat, and she gave me a bottle of water!  That is going above and beyond!My cousin was going cupcake tasting to find cupcakes for her baby shower. So I thought why not I'll go. We came here and wow! I'm not a big cupcake fan, but their coconut cupcake blew me away. We tried a lot of the others, but i kept coming back to the coconut. It's super delicious and I recommend it, if you like coconut.

I will definitely have to come back and try some cookies, muffins and bread. A tip from me would be to add coffee to your drink list. I was craving a cup while I was there.Have not had a bad experience here. Service is quick and friendly and the food is consistently outstanding. The only negative is the wait. But it is worth it. And I wish it were open for dinner!!OMG LADIES! I am HUGE on the bus.  I've been riding it to work for 2.5 years, and am horrified that you guys aren't pushing the benefits of commuting and mass transit in this city!

I love Valley Metro. I ride the Rapid bus, every day, twice a day.  The rapid shuttle is part of Valley Metro, but it is a  very different bus line then the city buses that I think some of you have been riding on. There are 4 Rapid Routes...1 from the west valley, (I-10 west from Avondale) 1 from the north (I-17 from Bell Road) 1 from the East, (I-10 East from Chandler) and 1 servicing the 51, from the 51 and Shea.  

If it were not for these rapid shuttles, I probably would not have a job, and probably have lost my mind by now. After I moved here, within 3 months, I had busted a windshield, had someone do a hit and run on me on the expressway, and basically sat in traffic for a ridiculous amt of time, so much that I was commuting an obnoxious amount of time.

Finally, a fellow co-worker told me that she commutes in half the time from the same place using the bus. Since I started riding the rapid, I've been hooked.  My busses are on time, my commute is 1/3 of what I was doing when I was driving, and the amt of money I have saved on gas is unbelieveable.very nice! We saw a very well put together exhibit with very famous and not as famous art. well worth it!!! There were families there but parents were carefully & respectfully educating the children on the att.Completely competent gluten free dining.  Much appreciated!I have to say, Sundays at TAO Beach are awesome!

We got there around noon on Sunday and left at about 5:00pm.  Thank you to Tony who got the 5 of us (3 ladies, 2 guys) a poolside cabana and $200 worth of comped drinks and food.  We had all been out late the night before and the relaxing VIP atmosphere was the perfect way to end a great weekend!   

The service was wonderfully accommodating (and great eye-candy!), the food was delicious, and we're still buzzing about the Poolside drink - the one with the crushed grapes, what were they called and what exactly was in them again?

Many of us locals don't get out to the strip too much because of the touristy crowds, so getting the chance to feel like VIPs for us was definitely a treat!  I even sent our VIP host Tony an e-mail with some attached photos thanking him for everything!Always eat here with my boys. Love this place. Ate Saturday before Father's Day and had a great experience. I've only had one shortfall in service here once and the one time I did, I didn't have to bring up. BJs staff recognized on their own and apologized on their own!  Great staff and management team here!!!  Always come back!I only booked a manicure here (btw if you are only doing a mani, the only one available is the $40) so I came in and was booked in by very friendly staff. I was then taken back to the waiting/lounge area and offered water or tea. The lady then took me back up front to get a pass for the use of the spa (jacuzzi, steam room) for 24 hours. If you book any service, you will get a pass. 

Anyway, Marisol did my manicure and I have to tell you, she is hands down the best manicurist I HAVE EVER HAD. I had it done a week ago, and I don't even have one chip and you can barely tell its growing out. Its almost like a gel mani. She is amazing and super fast. I hate when all I want to is to get my nails done and move on with my life and Im stuck in a salon for an hour or more. 
She also uses this spray that dries them super fast and IT ACTUALLY WORKS. 

Highly recommend her and the spa! I will be going back next time Im in town!I love this place. So far, I am not disappointed with this place. I have been a few times and gotten what I wanted. I have bought kimchi, coco jam, and other things. I like it so much that I took Grandma with me one day and she loved it. We like it because we can get fresh seafood, different meat, veggies, fruits, just about anything. They even have restaurants such as Jollibee. The restaurant has excellent food. This is a definite place to do your grocery shopping and great food to eat.REVIEW FROM A NON-ASIAN:

I don't go there for the food at all.  Although I have eaten at some of their entryway diners and the food was acceptable.  

I go there for their beauty product selections.  It's not an extremely large selection, but they have products I can't find anywhere else, and prices to die for.

I usually stock up when I go since I don't live close and I make a trip specifically for these items when I go there. 

I love to buy their allue collection make-up for my daughters, it's cheap and decent quality and I don't get mad if my kids lose it or waste it.

MOSTLY, I like to buy their line of daily scents, and baby cologne.  These are great for after your shower and I like to rub them on my arms before going out, the smell is great and lasts a long time.  I feel comfortable hugging & shaking hands with people knowing that I am extending a lovely fresh scent when doing so.

They also have some nice facial bars & soaps.

Very bright, brilliant eye shadow colors are easy to find here.  Same with nail polish, although I haven't bought any nail polish here.

They also have good prices on scented baby lotions as well.  I buy those too.

They do accept credit cards, but F.Y.I., they do not allow you to get cash back.  I don't really care, but I thought you should know up front.Great Middle Eastern food.  I used to eat there with some friends from Turkey and they all agreed that this was one of the best places in the Valley.

I am huge fan of Kafta and theirs is one of the best I have had.  The portions are huge and everything from the meat to the rice to the sauces are great.  The lentil soup is also a nice touch.The establishment is clean and trendy with a nice atmosphere.  The food is also very good; I have tried their pizza, pasta, and salad.  A little pricey for pizza, but it is gourmet and definitely worth it.Great place, fast and friendly. Tracy is the best!Okay, after having several root canal procedures; my latest experience would be very trying...Went to see my dentist at Open Wide Dental; Dr. Durisek suggested I see a specialist for 2 of my teeth that needed to be "retreated" or root canals done again...AARGH; he referred me to Dr. Kevin Axx at Valley Endodontic; and it made me smile.  Dr. Axx & staff were great and they even followed up 2 days later to see how I was doing.  Just wish they had the massage chairs like Open Wide Dental...This place is so fun and the food is so good.I'm bumping FTC up to 5 stars.  I stopped in here today with my girls and they proved themselves to be not just a really good coffee house - they're a great coffee house.

Would you like some ethical business practices with that latte?  Actually it comes with everything you purchase here.  Connectedness to the local community?  Standard.  Quality products?  Ditto.

I spent a good part of the half hour or so I was here talking with one of the employees, Shane.  Great guy and he served up 2 chocolate croissants for my kids with great panache.  I even snapped before and after pics.

And I discovered they make toddy.  Next time you're here ask for your drink made with toddy instead of espresso.  Smoother, more robust and more caffeineyer.Loved it. The rooms are Modern plush, and efficient. Like most rooms in Europe. A little smaller then normal American rooms but unless your going to play on the floor its not really noticeable. It had everything you could want in the room. The pool was great, hot tub was over sized and wonderful. This was a last minute stay and and wonderful surprise. Inexpensive for the quality of the hotel 

We where given a coupon to the Avalon restaurant that occupies the same parking as the hotel. We tried it and its a must eat place in Scottsdale.Found this place on Priceline.com's iPhone app. It was only $39.99 for a room here and the rooms are super nice. I don't know how they can afford to charge that low of a rate. Probably one of the best hotels we stayed at on our road trip. 

I would DEFINITELY recommend you saying here!! FREE WIFI! FREE PARKING!!I have used this company several times and have always received excellent service. My most recent call was for a leak in our soft water system. Moises came out to the house within 2 hours of calling on a Friday evening. He fixed the issue quickly, explained everything thoroughly and gave me options on proceeding forward. It was such a relief to have the problem fixed in such a timely manner. It's great to know that West Coast Plumbing & Air is available when needed and always come to the rescue with skilled technicians.We've been coming here ever since Gina opened her doors. She, and her staff, are the friendliest, well knowledgeable nail techs we have ever come across.  We not only trust her with our feet and hands, but our waxing as well.  Gina is a beautiful soul and I appreciate her affordable prices.   
I never ever hesitate on recommending people to go to her.  Thank you GinaI live minutes from this place.  It has been there since the shopping center has opened and I've never been.  I went on a whim about 3 weeks ago, and I've probably been back 1/2 dozen times.  I like, no love, the Brown Bear or Lodge.  They have a good variety but not overwhelming.  Even got  a breakfast sandwich once and it was really good.  I am very impressed.  Pennies more than the chain place, but worth every penny.Love this place!  In reading the reviews noticed that no one mentioned their delicious key lime pie!  We like many other items on the menu along with the service but we LOVE the key lime pie!  Next time you go give it a try!Had another great meal here last night.  This place can't mess things up.   My wife loves the Colorado chicken salad....but the secret is to order it "Stirling" style. Trust me on this.  It rocks and he is a great server as well.  Now if they just get Kiltlifter on tap......heaven.My experience s a teller experience.

This branch is located in the Fry's grocery store. It is a small branch that offers tellers and personal banking experience. I was immediately greeted and serviced with a smile. I was thanked for my business when I walked out the door.The grooming salon at this location does an amazing job with pets. Yesterday was the 2nd time my baby was groomed here by Chip.  I hope I spelled his name correctly, he's just wonderful.  He's very patient and very kind with my Sushi-poo and I'm comfortable leaving him in Chip's hands.I LOVE COSTCO!!!!!!!!!!  I could freakin LIVE HERE.  I get so excited to go here, its not even funny.  OMG.

Ok, so my mom's in town and shes a costco member.  She KNOWS I live for this place.  Of course, its set up like all the other ones, but shopping here can't be beat.

Granted, we went on Christmas Eve, and it was SO busy!  But, its always busy at costco, so its not a surprise.  They carry everything I need, and I love it here.  Lots of stuff to buy, including booze, food, gas, and the obvious other items that are sold here.

Totally worth the membership, as long as you don't mind being around lots of people.Very reliable. Friendly drivers. Reasonable price. Wish they serviced my house in the Philadelphia area. The guy at the curb at the Phoenix airport (I forget his name) is awesome!Finally decide to pay a visit to this place in Peoria, which is an hour drive for me. Was not expect to be as good as it seem in my photos. It actually fill me up very well. 

The place is clean with nice interior decoration. I spent 4 hours there eating 4 dishes and chat with the staff and the owner. It was a great experience that you don't usually get from Chinese restaurant. This place is also huge inside. 

I like their foods and friendly services.Had to find a new lawn service after the one I was using closed up shop.  Where to look but Yelp!  Saw the good review and called up Marcy to have her come and give me an estimate.  What a great experience.  Nice, friendly, punctual!  They did a great job.  The shrubs and bushes were done as  I requested (I hate it when they trim them so short, I lose the shade over my bedroom window), they hand pulled weeds, and they even went above and beyond and cleaned up the dog poop!  The price was reasonable and they worked with me on my schedule (I work nights) and even got it all done before my company arrived the next day.  So glad I found them, with a little help from yelp, ofcourse.I never really write reviews, however, I just had the nicest experience with having my carpets cleaned by Randy.

When searching for a carpet cleaner yesterday, I read reviews on several companies. After reading reviews on F&F, Randy in particular, I decided to call.

All I got was voicemail and I didn't leave a message. About 30 mins later I get a call from Randy.

I explained I really needed the place done on Saturday in preparation for some new furniture. He booked it with a window from 12-2.

The interesting thing is, several of his reviews mentioned that not only is he punctual, but in fact frequently shows up early. Sure wasn't expecting that to be my experience as well.

I was shocked to get a knock at the door at 11:30am! Absolutely refreshing.

He inspected, gave me a most reasonable bid and I said let's roll. The job Randy did is amazing. The carpets look new again and the fresh scent is really pleasant. Had him do the furniture as well, awesome job!

If you need your home done, you absolutely cannot go wrong with F&F and Randy. 

Call them, you won't regret it!I've been here once on a recent vacation to arizona I liked the store and if I had one in georgia id be a regular :)After having a bad nail job at The Summit, I went here to get redone!  Night & Day experience.  Everyone very happy and pleasant,  Vivian was new and did a wonderful job on my toes and Tammy redid a bad nail job I had a week earlier.  Both were wonderful and took their time even though we were last customer of the night.  The salon is very clean and updated...I would highly recommend to anyone who is picky about their mani/pedicures.What a loss for our area!  Kashman's has closed.  We drove there for our weekly Sunday breakfast and was stunned to see a sign on the door and that it was closed!  So we drove south to the other location to discover that was closed as well!  UGH! They were the best and I know their closing will make a lot of people sad.  Good luck to the owners and you will be missed!I LOVE DIlly's! I always get the Dilly Club and Chicken Noodle Soup, which comes with a bread bowl that is oh so yummy!Wow. 
This is like a Fry's Marketplace infused with everything that is good and expensive at other gourmet grocers. 
I've never seen so many different exotic fruits. Dragonfruit, anyone? 
The bakery inspires the 5 year old in me to say "Gimme, gimme, gimme! All that is chocolately, glittery, pretty goodness!"
Food allergies? Rest assured, you will find a wide selection of soy, dairy, gluten, and whatever else is popular these days- free food.
Enough kitchen utensils to please Emeril.
Wifi of course.
Covered parking, now you're just spoiling me rotten.
Fry's low sale prices-am I dreaming?
I have to stop in every time I pass by, because even when I don't know what I need, this store has it!Incredible service...  From taking your order at the counters to asking you if you want a refill when you look like you are finished and ready to go.  Love it!  

The quality of the food is always consistent and delicious chicken.i went here to get two passion fruit tea but when i went to my wallet i was short in cash. The staff there were very nice and told me don't worry. After that pleasent experience, they will always have my business.Wonderful graphics and sign compant owned by the nicest young couple.  They go out of their way to provide top-notch service, a quality product at a fair price.

It is a blessings to have found such a professional and caring company to work with.  : )KCThis is the only location we regularly come to, but I have visited other stores on many occasions. The selection is good; just as good as other locations.

Staff is very friendly, and Bed Bath & Beyond's return policy is fantastic.

Stuff is sometimes a little more expensive than some online places, but sometimes the prices are right on, and with the dozens of coupons available through the mail, prices are great. Also, having a brick-and-mortar store you can deal with is in certain situations very useful (when trying a new product for example).

If you have a Keurig machine, this is the place to go. They have a ton of coffee and tea flavors available in the store, along with a lot of accessories (like storage drawers and reusable k-cups).

Small kitchen appliances, kitchen gadgets and accessories (tons and tons), bathroom stuff, bedroom linens and drapes, fine dinnerware and flatware, candles, art, stuff you never thought existed, it's all here. They also have a good selection of As-Seen-On-TV stuff; so if you are unsure about getting something on TV, try here and if the product isn't too good just return it.

Good place for a first-time home buyer looking to fill their house, and when comparing the selection, Bed Bath & Beyond definitely exceeds other small appliance or bedroom and kitchen accessory stores.Ohh yeah.  Great place to get your grub on.   Just talk to Benny.   He will hook you up.   Try it for your self.YEs I'm a regular...and they please me with no ice and little boba!! what else could I ask?.  I usually order their milk mixed teas and I've tried the Rose, Hazelnut, Melon and Coconut tea. The green tea with green Mango...good!. All good. The boba is not for all, I started ordering later when I discovered it is funny to chew those gummy things while drinking the tea. Good attention!Where do I start? I used to live on dobson and 8th ave and go to the street every day. The coolest/sweetest Korean lady owns it. The boba is amazing whether you get the tea, smoothy, or slush. Try the   (red bean ice) fresh fruit. This place is 5* hands down. Plus... You get to draw on the wall....We held my daughter's birthday party here this weekend and I have to say I couldn't be happier. From the first phone call I made to inquire about the party until the very end with the presents being loaded in the trunk for us, I was pleased. The staff was very helpful and the kids had a blast. I loved the fact that I felt like I got to enjoy the party too since I had so much help from the staff. I would definetly recommend Pump It Up to other parents in the area.Manny's Mexican food is some of the best food north of the border, .. 

 With the friendly service and attention to detail makes this a valley gem! 
The decor and authentic music inside are vibrant and inviting. 
Ample parking outside makes it easy to get in and out even when it's very busy.

The food is excellent! My favorite is the Carne Asada Burrito ... but today I'm having the Fajitas ... what a treat! ... but it seems that everything at Manny's is delicious and made with the care and love that Mom would put into her food! My wife had a Chimi and asked for some baha sauce . . which is a very non-standard request for a chimi . . .NO PROBLEM! it was there in seconds, drinks always full! . .  They even found that so hard to do secret of asking how is the meal, while no one had a mouthful of food! My son had the Baha Chicken Enchiladas . .  he just raived about how great it was . .  creamy sauce, moist savory chicken, . .  he can never get enough cheese . .  he remarked  " Wow this is really cheesy . .  I love it!!" 

The waitresses remember what my favorites are, and suggest other specials that quickly become favorites!

In short Manny's is just great and I can't wait to come here again and again!Awesome mexican food and great value.Busted on RedTube again?
You can't help it. 
Having a penis, as one comedian put it...."is like having a friend who always wants to come out and play."
You're not a perv, but tell her that. Like she's going to believe anything you say right now.

Well my friend, the playground has officially closed, and there's only one way to get it back open...flowers and chocolate.
I know, its cliche, but chicks really do eat that shit up.

Florists? Forget it...they're a rip.
Conventional grocery stores? Great if you want to get her something that looks like you stole it off a grave marker.

Trader Joe's is your best bet.
For $5.99, you can get a floral bouquet guaranteed to get the playground open for business again, and in short order too!
The chocolate bars are only $1.99, I recommend several.

While you're at it, grab a bag of TJ's movie popcorn when you're there, you'll need it for the movie you're going to watch with her later.

When you get home, whip out the flowers and chocolate, while you proceed to scroll through the DirecTV listings and queue up a flick.
Wait..
WHAT ARE YOU DOING???

Didn't you learn ANYTHING?

Change the channel to The Notebook you idiot, and get Black Beaver Bang 11 out of the queue right now!

Do I have to tell you everything?
Jesus!Fresh produce? Check
Short lines? Check
Friendly (but non-ass kissing) Service? Check
Clean, well-lit store? Check

So far so good, right? But, I must say this - ALL non-working, soccer moms in their camel-toe yoga outfits: please, PLEASE do not encourage all of your children to get a lil "Mini-Me" shopping cart and take up valuable space in the damn joint! Okay? No, they're not cute - they are in our way. All of the TJ stores I've been in are pretty small and crowded without this added nuisance. 

And another thing - you would think that ppl who shop healthy/organic/Vegan/blah-blah blah would have some sort of zen-vibe, right? Well, why is it that almost every time I shop there, there's some ass who is a road rager out in the stressful parking lot? Hmmm? Namaste.

Other than that - no complaints! Great store.I can honestly say this is the most I've laughed at a dinner theatre! The cast is witty and very funny! I have seen two of their shows now and always wish I had invited more friends. I'm so glad they have started shows on the west side too! 

My only discretion, if you're looking for a normal, conservative show, this may not be your best choice. It's more out of the box and the interactive but that's what I love about it!I consider myself some what so a wine Connoisseur and found uncorked wine selection to be very good.  You can't go wrong with most of the selections.  We had the pulled pork and lamb meat balls, which were both good.  Mike was our server and he was very helpful with suggestions and the over all service was good.I registered for the Beginner course here after several recommendations from experienced riders. I was/am getting into the scooter or motorcycle market and took the advice that it's best to figure out one's confidence level before buying.

Boy am I glad I took this course!

There are a variety of schedule configurations you can sign up for, but I took one that met all day Saturday and Sunday. The morning hours were classroom instruction, culminating in a written exam. The afternoon hours were riding, culminating in a skills evaluation. Passing those allows you to waive the testing requirements at the MVD to get your motorcycle license or endorsement.

That's really the least of the benefits, though. The instructors were fantastic--really knowledgeable and positive people. Hell, fun to be around, even. They use an incremental approach to get your confidence up and build slowly up to riding. Before you know it, you're cruising all over the course, turning, swerving, weaving, braking, and so on. They teach you all kinds of stuff you would never figure out on your own. Did you know there are at least three methods of turning a motorcycle depending on speed and situation?

The other students were cool as well, for the most part. Mixture of experienced riders, new riders, younger, and older. Of course, the sportbike kids who talked about all their awesome riding experience, how light and powerful their bikes are, etc. are the ones who dropped bikes on the course and had trouble passing objectives.

On the way out the door, I has already discarded the notion of buying a scooter (unsafe at the speeds I would travel) and was confident of my ability to ride a basic motorcycle without killing myself.

Worth the price? Unquestionably. How much is your life worth? Surely more than $200.I had a great experience buying a car from Arrowhead Lexus. They were honest about their prices and didn't pressure me into purchasing additional warranties or gap. My salesman was Dave and he was extremely patient with me and didn't make me feel rushed even though we were there after the dealership closed. I would recommend this dealership to anyone.This could very possibly be the BEST meat I have EVER bought! 
We bought the group-on first. We went in and they told us this side was the group-on case. I thought "yea the group-on side." I took home two bone in Rib eyes. 
UNBELIEVABLY GOOD!
Two weeks later I was still thinking about them. So I invite friends over. I go and purchase a 3" thick center cut Porterhouse. ($89.00). SEAR, ROAST, GRILL, REST.
I mean my buddy and I literally jumped up and down as we sliced off pieces before plating.
"DUDE!!!!!!!" We kept saying "DUDE!!!!!!!!" No butter just salt and pepper. I'm going back for more. The $89.00 was a gift!Last summer I was injured in an ATV accident which required knee surgery and a great deal of Physical Therapy to repair.  I went to a local Physical Therapist near my home in Queen Creek for treatment and was extremely disappointed in the staff and treatment.  I spent 95% of my time with assistants (college interns) who were usually more interested in whatever game was on the TV than my treatment.  I rarely ever spoke with or was treated by an actual therapist.  Additionally I didn't feel the treatment I was receiving was anything that I couldn't very easily do myself at home.  Why did I continue going?  I didn't know any better, and thought that this is how physical therapy was to be received.  To top it off, as soon as I finished my treatments I was informed that I owed a substantial amount of money that had not been disclosed to me prior to or during my treatments.

Very soon after finishing my knee rehab it was discovered that several major foot and ankle issues I had neglected for years would need to be addressed soon, or I might suffer long term major damage  Another very extensive surgery with multiple procedures would be required with a great deal of additional rehab.  Because of my previous physical therapy experience, I decided to seek out a new therapist.  Foothills Sports Medicine was recommended to me by several individuals including my orthopedic surgeon.  While a bit out of my way, I decided to make certain that I got the best treatment possible this time around.  I was immediately impressed with the staff and my treatment for many reasons  including:

* The number of actual therapists I saw working with patients
* The number of professional athletes who had trusted their treatment and careers to the staff at Foothills Sports Medicine
* The attention I received from and actual licensed physical therapist
* The treatment itself

My primary therapist has been Rob Henert, and he has done a fantastic job.  My treatment has been first class and the ratio of physical therapist to assistant treatment is the opposite of my previous experience.  Rob takes care of my treatment while the assistants are there to do just that, assist.  I have also worked with several other members of the staff, and they all have all likewise been very skilled, knowledgeable, and attentive.    I have only been receiving treatment for two weeks now, but am already very pleased with the progress that I have made.  My foot and ankle are already feeling better and looser than before the surgery, with a lot more improvement to come.

If you are in need of physical therapy you can you can feel confident that you will get the best treatment available from the therapists at Foothills Spots Medicine.Jeff is such a great guy! Our den door locked from inside and we had a tough time opening it. In a moment of utter madness we tried using a hammer to open it and damaged the lock even further. With no option left we looked up Yelp and found Jeff. He helped undo the damage and had to use a drill to get the screws out. He also replaced the damaged knob with a replacement for the same minimal cost! On top of that he turned out to be such an affable chap and was very nice to talk to. We would recommend that you call him right away in case you are in lock trouble!Had a wonderful experience at Men's Apparel Club. 
  
I got a new job that requires a suit. Before this I have never had to wear a suit and stared looking at Dillard's with no luck, so I pulled out the old smart phone, looked up "men's suits"and found Men's Apparel Club. 

I called and talked to Barry, from the moment he picked up the phone I felt like I was in good hands. He told me he had some time before his next appointment and would be happy to help me. I left Dillard's and headed to Men's Apparel Club right away. 

Upon walking in he already had some jackets set as side for me to try on. The overall experience was quick, painless and he gave me a great deal, and I was on my way. 

I will return to Men's Apparel Club for all my suits from now on. I highly recommend this business.Yelp pointed me in the right direction again.  Found my hot water heater leaking.  I shut it off, started draining the tank and fired up Yelp for help.  Found SavOn Plumbing with good references.  After arming myself with some Internet research on hot water tanks and a visit to Home Depot, I called SavOn Plumbing to discuss the problem.  They agreed with me that Bradford White tanks were a good choice for my situation.  Only professional plumbers can get this brand but there are some Internet Plumbing sites that will sell and ship them.  SavOn let me schedule installation at a time convenient to me, showed up on time and made quick work of the installation.  They also gave me instructions on how to handle routine issues.  I never knew I was suppose to have the tank serviced every three to four years.  The internal sacrificial anode prevents water chemistry from attacking the tank and fittings.  It has to be checked or replaced every few years to prevent damage to the tank.  Now I know.  Thanks for courteous, fast, professional and informative service.  SavOn is on the top of my list to call for future plumbing issues.Do you enjoy sitting next to crazy people who have no problems invading your space? I sure do!  Luckily Southwest has provided me with the wonderful opportunity to enjoy my favorite past time.  The flights are always ridiculously cheap, I swear the employees are high off of something because they are always happy, and I think the pilots are speeding (my flight always arrives 15 minutes early!).  All planes are pretty much the same, and Southwest goes out of there way to make a little more enjoyable at the cheapest cost.  Unless I am going international, Southwest is my go to airline!Great location! I really like going here. They have a great floor area with every office tool I could need. They have very helpful associates and are very good about getting my jobs done on time. Very good experience, and I will be coming back!Dr Loud and her staff simply put are fabulous. The customer service they provide is second to none. Dr Loud will personally see to it that you receive the utmost care. The staff is kind courteous and will go out of their way to ensure you have nothing but a good experience when visiting their location. The from office staff goes beyond In The attempt to accommodate your schedule..  The compassion this office shows is second to none and would highly recommend their services to anyone...Great tortillas, they have a machine and make them on site. These tortillas are tastier than food city's in house brand. You want to get the one with the little red sticker that says "sabrosa" , these contain real butter and are really tasty. They also serve fantastic food inside.I love getting adjustment from Dr. Macri.  she takes the time to work the tightness out of my back first.  I have been to other Chiropactors and they just jolt my back and force it into alinement...then I am in more pain.  After Dr. Macri adjustments I ALWAYS feel better.  I brought my boyfriend (who hates doctors) after his session he said he would go back to her and he felt she was so knowledgable and he completely trusted her.  I highly recommend Macri Wellness CenterThis is the only place I like to go and shop.  What's not to love, they have great stuff and great prices.  That is the draw.  Sam's has cheap stuff and cheap prices.  And, If you think you only need a Costco membership to buy bulk groceries you are sadly mistaken.  They buy good brand stuff in bulk like watches, jewelry, sun glasses, clothing, etc...  They've had Seven Jeans and Ray Ban stuff in there.  Good wines, furniture, and on and on.  One just go in sometime and walk around looking at everything they have in there.Stopped here for gas after attending a house warming party a couple of weeks ago. Same great service.....same great atmosphere....same great deals.....it's Costco....enough said.Oops, my previous review for this Costco, which is the one we frequent the most.  We love this Costco a lot and they seem like a part of our extended family.  Great place!I went through a bad luck streak with tires and the guys at this location always made my experience a painless one. They are quick and do great work work at fair prices. Once I had a warranty issue and without question that had me back on the road in minutes. Good guys I hope to only see every once in a while! :)This place is fantastic!! Definitely my go to for Chinese food(: so fast and tasty! The coffee milk tea is the shizz and they are extremely inexpensive and give big portions! You definitely get more than you pay for!Our go-to place for Chinese food in the Mesa/Tempe area! We love their Mongolian dishes, vegetable fried rice, kung pao, brown rice, Etc etc! Always great service & amazing prices!Really good food, and very cheap. Fried tofu is excellent, steam chicken with ginger sauce is very soft and juicy, chinese broccoli with garlic is very delicious. Very fast service too!.Such a cool little place. We stop in for appetizers and wine every so often. We usually end up getting a pizza too. I think last time was a chorizo. 
We also take the suggestion of the staff regarding wines. They turned us on to one of our new favorites that we get for home now. 
I almost hope people don't find out about this little spot. It'd be nice to have a little south side secret.I have only been here for brunch.  I had one of the greatest gourmet burgers.  The design and ambience is one-of-a-kind.  I can't wait to go there for dinner.Should deserve six stars.  Amazing food, great service, reasonable pricing, good happy hour, and fantastic design to boot.  Can't wait to go back.Came in on Saturday for dinner, spectacular green chili pork with a side of the sweet corn polenta! On my way back to try the lunch menu today.Loved it. I had the salmon dish. I would highly recommend this place. Im gluten free and they were very easy to work with. The others also loved what they had. For sure will be back.We needed a new vet when moving to the area.  They were super friendly, helpful and very interested in my pet.  I loved the service we received and am glad to have found them.Great subOutstanding Customer Service ! I had a problem that turned out to be an incorrect prescription. The staff was only concerned that i was happy with my glasses and went to great lengths to figure out my issue. In fact, if it hadn't been for their diligence and caring attitude my problem would have taken much longer to fix . i will be a long term customer.Great, friendly service and the rueben is awesome!!I never use the beds - only spray tans - (instant gratification)

Their Versa Spa Spray Tan Booth is awesome - i've tried quite a few - {they've all cloed down!}
It does 6 passses, and after each time there's a dry pass - blow drys the spray on (ie: no getting on your clothes - well, i would suggest to still wear black to the salon).  OH, try the extra moisture mist on as the 7 & 8 pass - it really makes a difference!I came in for a haircut through a Groupon deal and Marie was my stylist. She gave me a very nice trim and cute side swept bangs! I wasn't sure about the idea of bangs, but she assured me they would look good and it did indeed! I have received lots of compliements. They even gave me a 50% off coupon for my next visit. I will be sticking with this salon!Awesome atmosphere!!! Great looking crew, and always an upbeat feeling! The front desk ladies always make this place even better, who would of thought that was possible!Go go go!! Awesome. Easily the best I've been to! Never thought I'd be reviewing a nail salon however they are outstanding! :) went with my girlfriend and her grandma and all the customers where talking about how wonderful it is here!!!Arrived with an appointment and this place was packed yet they said the wait would be less than 40 minutes for the repair.   The repair was done in less than 30.   I was greeted within seconds of walking in and the staff was very helpful.

This was my second visit and both times I had great service.  I will definitely be utilizing this Discount Tire again in the future.I had an excellent experience with Congress and will 100% use them next time I sell. This is a pretty straightforward service; they put my house on the MLS and it basically sold itself because all the agents could find it. I had a For Sale sign outside and did some marketing on my own (Craigslist, etc.), but 9 out of 10 of phone calls were from agents.  I have sold houses before and did not need much help to begin with, but at the same time had no problem reaching someone on the phone or via email throughout the listing for the rare occasion that I needed something.My original destination had changed and HERTZ price jumped from $360 to $1200 and all that was available was a Carolla.

I called ENTERPRISE and was elated that the price here was only $550 for a caravan.  Steve & RJ had my mind set at ease while here.  They were knowledgable & quite funny and the comic relief was just what I needed to relax.  These guys rock!I am upping my review 2 stars based upon the way my dog loves the day care.
He seems to really like it and that is all I care about is what he likes.
My pet comes home tired and happy and that is what is important to me.
I do wish they would ask for proof on flea and tick control on all dogs.
Plus they are $30.00 per week higher then down the street.
Those only 3 stars but better then my past review of one star.
Plus when customers are waiting for help sometimes you have to put your lunch on hold.
Maybe in time I will let them have another shot at grooming which has never went well for us.
Most of the staff seems nice and love dogs.
They have now earned 5 stars due to good grooming and a good staff.
I now feel the higher day care price is worth it and my dog loves it.
Keep up the good work to keep your 5 stars.
This is an honest review.Chodang is right down the street from our house, I have no idea why I've never seen the place.  At first glance it looks like it might not be open, I think the sunlight hits the windows so you can't see the OPEN sign.  At any rate it was an amazing find.  The staff was really pleasant and prompt.  The food was great.  We had the Sea-food soup (with an egg)  and the Bulgoki and both were supreme.  They serve everything with a bunch of side dishes, most of which I've never had before.  Their Kimchi was also excellent and I really enjoyed the flat seaweed wafer thingies, basically all the sides were tasty, tho a couple were too spicy for me to handle.  It's not one of those Korean restaurants where you get to grill your own food, but for me that's okay too since I also like to sit back and relax sometimes instead of be grill-master.  Also I wouldn't consider myself to be an expert on Korean cuisine, though I've been to a handful of other establishments.   Still, this one was very enjoyable, affordable, and had a good vibe.

We definitely have plans to walk there sometime (when it's not sweltering hot) and get our drink on with their collection of Soju.  (Kinda like Korea's version of Sake but sweeter)Simple hole in the wall place.  We ordered Bibimbap, Fried Dumpings and Tofu & KimChi Soup.  Soup was hands down the best part.  Served in a stone cauldron - bubbling hot and spicy with a fresh egg cracked into it table-side.  Fantastic!My husband and I absolutely love this place.  From the front desk to the techs in the back, we have always had a positive experience.

Dr. Bower is the vet we usually see. I recommend him to everyone we know with a new pet. Our puppy is always treated so well. Each time we come here, we feel like the only patients in the building. They have no problem taking time to talk with us about anything we need to talk about. We even ask them training questions!

Usually dogs are hesitant to go to the vet...but not ours! I feel that the positive experiences we've had from the very beginning with Dreaming Summit Animal Hospital has taught our puppy that going to the vet is fun and adventerous.I instinctively feel that most auto places will over charge you. My wife's Honda had a problem starting. I replaced the battery but it still wouldn't always turn over. I assumed it was the starter. I took it in to this Sun Devil Auto and told them I needed a new starter. Scott at the counter said that replacing chargers are about $300.00. I agreed as the car wouldn't start. 
I got a call about 30 minutes later from Scott and was told that it wasn't the starter. It was just the Battery cables and he could replace them both for $35.00 for labor and parts. I couldn't believe it. Not only did he not over charge me, he didn't just go by what I thought was wrong. He checked out the car and realized  that it was only something minor. I didn't know that corroded cables could prevent a car from starting. I have since taken my SUV in there to also have them replaced. I didn't think anyone would look at a car for $35.00. They didn't try to sell me any other service and my wife's car is running fine since.I am from the east coast and I haven't found an awesome cheesesteak until I ordered from here! And there is no delivery fee.The quality of care and knowledge of the doctor and staff is great. This Phoenix chiropractor has a full-service practice (chiropractice, health and wellness and massage therapy).Pizza is great! I just finished cleaning their kitchen, bathrooms, and front lobby area tile! It looks great if I may say. Go check them out the food tastes really good. They make their dough from scratch every day! Smells good in their facility too.Wow!  I was on a mission for the perfect boot and the the pair I saw online seemed to be what I was looking for. They were sold out but the girl that was helping me tried to find something similar. My problem is that I have tree stumps for legs so everything was too tall for me. We ended up ordering the pair I saw online and she did everything for me. She was nice and didn't seem put out. Very helpful!!Great food Italian food. All homemade. Owner seems to be on location everydayThe Roasted Sweet Potato sandwich is the most fantastic concoction ever created.  It is like Wildflower tapped into my brain a stole all of my favorite things and placed it between two gorgeous pieces of bread. Marinated fennel, fig confit, roasted sweet potato, arugula, buffalo mozzerla on focaccia bread. I warn you. It is massivee and I could barely eat 1/4th of it. But oh is it worth it. Dont think, just do it.Just had an excellent experience with Jerry! On time AND solved our problem in one shot when it took 4 previous companies to fix our Trane AC. Would def recommend to anyone with confidence!We had Day and Night install 2 new units on our house in May 2013.  We had problems with one of the units from day one and they told us they would take care of the problem.  This went on for a couple of months, they even had the Amana Rep out.  After replacing a couple of parts, they decided to replace the unit. Day and Night made the decision to replace it with a bigger unit at NO COST to us. They went above and beyond to help us and to make sure we were happy. Everyone they sent out was very professional and cleaned everything up when they were finished.  Great company to work with and would highly recommend them.Jill is absolutely amazing. If you go to any other place for laser hair removal, you are simply an idiot.

Not only is Jill super personable and makes you feel comfortable in a situation that can sometimes be categorized as awkward, her prices are extremely affordable. You couldn't pay me to go somewhere else!Great service and good pizzas made fresh dailyBest Filipino food I've had outside of the Philippines--better than some IN the Philippines, for that matter. The Denuguan is monster delicious. I've literally been going there every few days since I got to Phoenix.So far, I tried many chinese buffet and I always going back to this place. The seafood always better than other restaurant, the taste always great! The sushi always great everytime I went back there! The oyster..awsome!!!! Highly recommended!!!We were staying at the Legacy Golf Resorts during Christmas break, and decided to get some brunch.  I booted up my trusty Yelp App, and a quick search yielded this place a mere 30 second drive away.

This is just an awesome brunch spot.  A lot of the ingredients seemed very fresh and delicious.  I got the breakfast burritos which came loaded with rich, delicious chorizo, eggs, and beans, while my girlfriend got the waffles.  The waffles came with the sweetest blackberries I've ever eaten (although the strawberries were not sweet).

Love the atmosphere, service, and the food.  What can be better than sitting outside surrounded by the farm, enjoying fresh coffee and brunch?  Life is good!Best beef jerky in the valley and the people are exceptionally nice!  Super glad I finally found a place here!  :)Just rode in there the other day, as my trail bike needed a tune-up, and Tribe came highly recommended. Without hesitation, one guy picks my bike up, sprays some lubricant on the chain, adjusts some screws, test rides it, and within 5-10 mins. I was back on and riding again like brand new. Damage? Free of charge (I fully expected to pay, believe me). These guys are friendly, obviously knowledgeable, fast, and more than fair. They know good PR, and have a great lineup of bikes, from what I saw. They get my future business for sure, as I'm looking to buy a good street bike in the near future. Thank you, Tribe staff!Right away I was greeted by the owner, I am sure we looked lost. The people shopping inside were just as nice as the people working. They had a large selection of kids comics which is what we were looking for and the reason we will go back. I love being able to help out locally own shops too!Juba Red Sea & Mediterranean Cuisine is a truly amazing place. 

You just have to get past the location which is a bit daunting located in a very crowded strip center with many African and Somali shops. Plus more than half the cars parked in the lot were taxicabs. I went after work to meet some friends as we had heard a lot about this place as it serves goat! 

We enjoyed some good hummus and pitas as we waited to order. We were disappointed to discover that they only serve goat at lunch time and usually run out by 2-3pm so you have to reserve it for dinner. Oh, well another time. They were also out of the Somali iced tea which I had wanted to try. So water was fine. We ordered an order a couple orders of Sanbusas, which are a deep fried pastries filled with ground beef and Somali spices, kind of like an Indian samosas. Comes with two but are large to share and more than enough for 3-4 people. 

We ordered Chicken Sukhaar which is served with basmati rice that has been flavored with cardamom and cinnamon, and other spices I can't name. Mixed Kabob plate which of the three the chicken kabob was the best. We also ordered the loin of lamb which was excellent, fish which was OK and the best dish was the meat and naan dish which I'm not even sure of it's name. But it was this wonderful marinated beef (maybe called Beef Sukhaar) which was chopped up with onions, tomatoes and spices with strips of naan that I thought were noodles topped up with this wonderful sour cream sauce. It was amazing. We also got the naan sandwich which had the same meeting fillings wrapped in naan like a wrap. Delish! 

Best of all they had this spicy green sauce sitting on the table that we put on everything. We ordered way too much food - each dish would feed 2-3 people and we ordered 8 dishes for 8 people! So we all took take home boxes to eat the next day. Plus with tip and tax it was $13 per person! A truly amazing deal. 

So give this place a try as it's worth the time it takes to find a parking spot.NUMMY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! More than just bagels! My family and I enjoyed amazing breakfast sandwiches and splurged on some chocolate eclairs! So good!Food is fantastic, some of the best sandwiches you can find anywhere. But, really what makes Chloe's are the waitress and waiters. They are all cheerful, helpful and if you become a regular (which I am as I live in Kierland Commons) they remember your name and your usual order. Try Chloe's you won't be sorry!!I am a VIP here! For every 100 Dollars Spent you get 10 Cents off per gallon of gas at any Frys gas station.Our last night in Vegas we decided to keep it low key as we all had early flights in the Am.  So we decided to order pizza and watch the NBA play offs in the room.  While we were at CVS we saw Joe's NY Pizza and went in and ordered two large pies.  One was the all meat pie and the other was a combo.  

Seriously, the whole meat pie weighed in at about 5 maybe 6lbs.  There was AMPLE cheese and shit load of meat.  The crust was delicious and had a doughy garlicy flavor.  Needless to say we all just sat around the TV watching the game and enjoying our pizza.  

I would definitely come back when In Vegas!Why in the world did We not go here sooner?  Why did we just assume Einsteins was better?  What a mistake we made!  Brooklyn Bagel is the real deal. Fresh made eggs, not the microwaved eggs. Fresh soft bagels. Sandwiches made to order on a hot griddle right in front of you by friendly and hard working individuals. This is the place to go. So glad we gave it a try and we will absolutely be back for more!  Keep up the good work!Always had great service here. Even in the drive through. They r always quick and courteous and remember you after only coming in a couple times.Not only is the ice cream great but there's this one really cute guy who works there 10/10 would recommend.South Point kicks arse, i haven't stayed in their rooms but i come here to gamble and drink. The only thing it's missing is people walking around in their Vegas best shirts with rhinestones and sunglasses at night.Get back in line where you belong Nobu,  Sushi Roku is still the best. Johnny is a great host and Haru prepares like no other.  It gets better every time I go.  I've even taken trips to Vegas just for this food.  If I had to pick a last meal,  this would be it. 

CharlieThis restaurant was great had a party of 55 people and we were left full and a wonderful experience. The staff couldn't have been more attentive & meet all our needs .. Thank you to the staff & the chef .. Can't wait to return next year!---I bring my shih tzu puppy here for grooming. They did a great job of executing the type of cut that I wanted and he was happy when we picked him up. The staff and groomers are always very nice and the grooming prices are reasonable. I have brought him here twice and will keep doing so. 
The little "dog bakery" is super cute and my dog loves the treats. 
The overall selection of merchandise is pretty small and pricey, but they do have some really cute stuff that you cannot get at the big box pet stores.Montelago Village @ Lake Las Vegas is a hidden gem in the desert as several posters have said.   Like all resorts in the country, LLV has felt the affects of the poor economy.   LLV is busiest mostly during the weekend and evenings.  

During the spring/summer and fall, the village offers free concerts on Friday and Saturday nights.   ALL of the restaurants there are great, including the best breakfast in town at the casino cafe.    The sports-bar cafe has a giant foot long hotdog which is a must see and must eat! 

I've stayed several times at the Viera Condos.  These are actually owned by individuals and turn into hotel rooms when they aren't using them.   So, for the same price as a most hotels., you're getting a well decorated, full-size condo with up to 3 bedrooms, kitchens, dishwashers, microwaves...  you could literally move in!!!!   When you stay there, the rooms are cleaned everyday.  It's  a great concept!!  The one we rented had a large patio with awesome views of the lake, pool and mountains. 

Montelago Village is not the strip.  It's the anti-strip.  But, close enough to see show and have dinner, but return to tranquility.  

If you want to relax and unwind, have some great meals and be close to the Hoover Dam, Lake Mead and the Grand Canyon, this is your place!   If you want party central, go to the strip.   This place feels like a village in Italy. Slow paced, quaint and world away.Anytime I'm in Vegas I make a stop to the strip house. The ambiance and decor is sexy and mysterious. Red velvet line the walls along with pictures of beautiful pin up girls from days of old. It's lightly lit to almost a candle light setting. A great place to to dine with your partner. The food is amazing. I was greeted with a smokey potato soup shooter compliments of the chef ( very classy ). I had the massive 22oz rib eye steak which was cooked perfectly and tasted divine. Creamy whipped potato and creamed spinach accompanied my steak. If your looking for a romantic steak house to take your date the strip house is the spot to goI highly recommend Dr. Brill. He is a wonderful doctor/surgeon.  He has delivered two of my three children and I'm going to schedule my son's circumcision with Dr. Brill aswell. :)ben there twice since the new owners took over.   great lubch special of 2 slices and soda for just 5 bucks.  ordered a delivery mama special it was quick and tasted awesome.Great crew, and super fast service. Bicyclist friendly too! This McDonald's is also the cleanest I've ever been in. If I lived closer, this would be my regular spot.Ask for Johnny in the pro shop if your buying any bowling equipment. He's awesome. Very helpful. They didn't have the bowling bag I wanted so he ordered it for me and matched the online bag price. Also helped me pick out balls which I had no clue to buy because I was buying as a gift.Rich is the best traditional chiropractor in town. He's a pretty stand up guy too. I've been to about 6 different chiropractors in  my life and he has helped me the most.Best haircut I have gotten it a while. Kelly is awesome. Definitely going back. Too bad I am not from this town.Brooklynites, your search for real pizza in Las Vegas is over.

I probably could just shut up there, but I'll write more, for those of you who require specifics.  I actually almost shed a tear of relief discovering this place today. I've lived in Las Vegas for about 2 years, and I'd just given up on the hope of real Brooklyn pizza. Settebello pizza is good for what it is, more like the pizza you get in Italy. Nothing wrong with that. But when I've had a taste for NY pizza I've always been disappointed. Metro Pizza was suggested to me once by a friend, and after trying it I immediately punched him in the face. Don't worry, he's fine now. 

The owners/staff of Cugino's are all Italian from Brooklyn. The place is a deli and italian grocery, so you can buy all the best meats, Italian canned goods, homemade raviolis, manicotti, stuffed shells, as well as marinated salads and mozzarella that they make there DAILY.  The sandwiches are just flawless. Even the little things I've missed like coffee soda they had there.

Honestly I wasn't even planning on trying the pizza. I'd had enough disappointments  on that front already.  But as proud italians and proud New Yorkers, they insisted. And I'm SO glad they did.I was initially a bit skeptical about coming here because 1) there were bad reviews and 2)  they were doing a groupon sale.  I know my second reason may sound weird to some of you but businesses promote their business on groupon normally when they're struggling, which may be a result of poor service.

So I contacted them to ask them if their groupon deal was applicable to any day since it was a "now" deal at the time. But the man who answered, Joe, told me that I don't need to purchase it online through groupon and that I just come in and tell him my name and look for him so that he can honor the deal regardless of whether I purchase the deal or not.

So I made my way there which is in the gas station at the intersection of Sahara and Durango. A bit far from where I live and work but most places around me were going to charge me $35-70 for the same service so I made the trip here. 

As soon as I arrived, my car was immediately attended to and it took about 35-40 minutes to do which was standard and efficient to me. Really liked the service and I'm proud of taking a gamble regardless of its low Yelp ratings. Joe, whom I assume is the manager, was very courteous and professional. I definitely can't ask for more. For my reminder sticker, they listed $3 off for my next visit, which I assume is not combined with the groupon deal.

Overall, very satisfied with my experience here.Wooly Wonders is a gem hidden away in yet another Las Vegas strip mall. It's small but incredibly well stocked with a variety of yarns and needle craft supplies. The yarns range from mid to high level brands and types, and including Cascade, Noro and Debbie Bliss. They also stock roving for spinners as well. 

The ladies that work at this shop are incredibly helpful and knowledgeable. They not only know about knitting, but also crochet, hairpin lace, tatting and spinning as well. They have a table set up for people to sit and knit at, and the shop gets lots of natural light from large front windows. Overall this shop is my favorite LYS in Las Vegas and I shop here often.Restaurant Impossible has done well for this place. Located in a strip mall, they only have about 15 quad tables in one open room.  I had the country fried steak and eggs up with hash browns.  They didn't have any biscuits made, so I got the apple fritter to-go.  The steak is advertised on the menu as pan fried and I thought it was pan fried but the chef who I talked to later said it was deep fried. The steak was thick and breaded just right.  The seasoning was good.  The hash browns were crispy and seasoned good.  You can tell the potatoes were turning color before they were cooked.  Maybe they can find a way to stop the color change.  The white sausage gravy was good too.  I thought this was one of the best CFS I have had.  I talked to the chef later to recommend putting the steak on top of the gravy to present the crispy golden brown steak instead of smothering it with gravy.  She said she would try it and see what it looks like.  That's when she said it's deep fried. Oh well... regardless how it's described in the menu, I enjoyed it either way.

The apple fritter is made from scratch and is fried to order, so I did have to eat some of it while it was fresh out of the fryer.  It was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  Just melts in your mouth good.

This restaurant will be on Restaurant Impossible in the near future.  Check out what Robert Irvine started with and what they ended up with.  A good surprise.Had to get my Honda Civic Si 2012 washed - it was absolutely necessary and my car was filthy. 

I did a bit of Yelping and went to the best rated place. 

Low and behold Alamo did not fail to it's well recognized name. 

Although the man outside, Phillip? Did not seem very happy to be there overall the experience, pricing etc were right on point. 

They have a lounge for you to wait with computers and WiFi access a television and cups to get soda from the gas station next door. With the purchase of a car wash you also get a car freshener. 

I would recommend this place to anyone! 

My vehicle was ABSOLUTELY spotless! :D 

I bought the highest one worth $71.99 but was dropped down to $50 and I'm glad I spent it!I came here for my birthday in August and there is a reason it is located in the Four Seasons. Charlie Palmer is class class class. In a city that has some of the best food in the world, Chalie stands out.

I had the surf and turf which gave me some of the best filet mignion and lobster I have ever had in my life. Yes it's very pricey. It's pricier than a lot of the other steakhouses on the strip but it is more classic and less trendy.

One thing, please please please do not get drunk and rowdy here. It's not the place. There was a very loud bachelor party next to us and definitely disturbed my quiet birthday meal. I mean I'm paying 100 bucks a plate, can you please not yell "Fucking twat" in the restaurant?

The servers were amazing though and apologized profusely. I understand, they were probably making a fortune off those douchebags. At least I got a free dessert and drink out of it.Charlie Palmer Steak House at the Four Seasons is our favorite steakhouse in Las Vegas.  It has in intimate dining room and above all no kitchen in the dining room.  On our last visit which was Saturday night we noticed a delightful improvement in the overall attention with not only our waiter, wine steward but also the manager, Kirk Perry.  He came over to our table at the beginning of our meal and introduced himself to us and said he would be overseeing every aspect of our dining experience. He checked back with us throughout our meal.   Both my husband and I were so impressed with his caring, professionalism  and above all, personal attention to every detail that evening.  It was my husband's 80th birthday and we were so satisfied that we decided to go here for this very special occasion.  

The food was elegantly presented, the timing perfect and above all delicious.  We like to take advantage of the Cut of the Week which is a pre-fix menu with wine.  The price at $48. is a bargain.  We get a notice in our E-Mail each Monday so we know what they are offering for this week.  I found out that they also have another pre-fix dinner called Tribute To Michael Jackson for $49.  With that one you have choices with each course.  We look forward to trying that very soon.  If you want to experience an "Old Vegas Steakhouse" definitely give this a try.Quick, efficient wide range of services and reasonably priced. These guys had me in and out in minutes and were very friendly too!
Next time I go swimming with my i-Phone I'll be taking it straight here.LOVE LOIS! In the salon. I live in LA and travel to Vegas for Lois to do my hair and I am loyal to her only. She has been doing my hair for 15 years. I tried cheating multiple times closer to home to save money but it cost more for an emergency flight to get it fixed.  If you want GREAT organic looking highlights alongside a healthy haircut go see Lois.My girlfriends had been ragging me about getting my nether regions landscaped.  After reading on Yelp and Youtube what a wonderful job this place did, I decided to have them introduce me to the world of brazilian waxing.  I was not disappointed.  Erin my aesthetician understood I was a neophyte and walked me through the process.  She even told me when it was going to be a bit more uncomfortable so I could be prepared for it.  I left this place walking on sunshine, I felt so liberated.  When I went home to visit, I had another place do my waxing and was truly disappointed.  I will never allow anyone to do my brazilian.  It's a bit pricey but I guarantee you will not be disappointed.  Amy has done my brazilian as well and she rocks too. And the reminder emails they send are quite entertaining.I don't go to any malls or even go shoppnig much so I thought Fashion Show Mall was great! Great selection of stores, high end and regular stores. The mall is huge! And I felt even shorter than I really am because the ceilings were so tall. 

They had a Crocs cart in the mall which made me happy since I was on the hunt for them. They were all out of the basic black Baja's, but I got them in a cool charcoal and lavendar color. And I got a pair of cute black Malindi's.

Also, thanks to Fashion Show Mall, I was introduced and now in love with Teavana! (review to soon follow)

Extra plus that it was in walking distance to our hotel, Treasure Island. Very convenient to be so close.We didn't feel like gambling so we headed to the mall. Either way, Vegas got our money. LOL! :)Man!! This has to be in my top 5 favorite malls I've ever been to. It has everything and every store you can possibly shop at except for a target and a walmart. lolGot their strawberry daiquiri. Bomb. Next time I'm adding like 15 shots for $1 each.Great value great service great prices - I'm a regular here and it's never been short of 5 stars. The staff HUSTLE here - hard working and customer service orientated.  Love this place.Get trained here!  I'm just a fitness nut and love all of the different workouts. Boxing, kettlebells, functional movement, sports rehab, and more.  The owner is better than any physical therapist I ever had.  The personal training sessions are the best value you'll ever get from a trainer, no question. For elite athletes, weekend warriors, or anyone who wants perfect training from a group of genuinely good-hearted people that know their stuff. Five stars without a doubt!A transcendent experience. Thai Food To Go is a super small, unassuming place in a nondescript strip mall off Desert Inn in an area of town many forget even exists. For those who step in the door to this place, they will be rewarded thanks to Service with a Genuine Smile, a full Thai menu, and surprisingly low prices. But as nice as all that is, it's all about the food. So how is it? 

I've had a lot of Thai food especially of late. But only 2 places in Las Vegas have flat out wowed me, and left me thinking OMG why did I wait so long to come here, or to try Thai food for that matter. Penn's Thai House was the first, but now Thai Food To Go did it to me again. That's why I use the word "Transcendent" as it literally kicked me back on my heels and made me say damn! this is good! 

When you walk in you'll notice it's not fancy. In fact it might be considered a hole in the wall, and I don't mean that as a slam. They have just what they need to make great food and little else. There's just 4 tables so when I say it's small...it really is. But when I sat down for lunch I saw big bowls of Pad Thai and all sorts of wonderful stuff being brought to the tables. I played it safe and went with Cashew Nut Chicken and asked for medium heat. They got it right, perfect heat, great flavor, and a portion size that for the price blew me away. And their soup offerings wasn't just the typical boring egg flower soup, I didn't get the name of the soup but it turned out to satisfy a craving I've been having for good soup that nobody seemed to be able to fulfill until now. While I like Komol's offerings and it's closer to me for lunch, Thai Food To Go is a definite add to my lunch rotation. In fact Thai Food To Go may end up being even better than Komol! Yum, Yum, YUM! I can't wait to go back and try their other stuff!

Edit: I went back today, not even 24 hours later. This time around I ordered Green Curry with Chicken. The curry had lots of vegetables in it including beans and green bell pepper which I typically don't like. But in this case the curry overcame all resistance and turned this into one of the best lunch choices I've made in years. I have no choice but to bump Thai Food to Go up to 5 Stars. They earned it, I will be back, and I will bring others.Very Good food! We are half thai family and the flavors are very authentic. Will come back on our drive back to phx. No bathrooms availableAwesome!  Extremely efficient service.  Walked next door to get breakfast at a fast food joint and was astounded that before I could finish my meal, my car had 4 new tires and was waiting for me - not me waiting for the car!  Plus great view of the Las Vegas Valley.  Great products fast, friendly, and professional service!My girlfriend and I eat here quite often.  The Farooj is awesome, and is big enough to be eaten by two especially if you get an appetizer .This is my second lunch visit to Khoury's. I loved the gyro and jalapeño hummus! Comfortable, casual environment. Our service was very good. 

Also, I shared a pitcher of red sangria with friends on my first visit...definitely a great addition to lunch with friends!I had an Excellent visit with Jon Merritt who did my Color Retouch. I was bored with my
current blonde shade and Jon new exactly what shade to use. He was very experienced and very friendly and just the perfect Hairstylist. The salon was beautiful,we used the Boca Park location,and lots of professional products to choose from.  I will now make Jon my new stylist and recommend him to anyone. Thanks Again Jon....     AmyWe never would have gone to see Carrot Top if it weren't for Yelp - thank you!!! I went in thinking "there is no way this is going to be good," but now 24 hours later the wife and I are still repeating/laughing at  many of CT's jokes.

I was literally in tears I was laughing so hard. There was rarely a lull in the laughter the entire 75 minutes CT was on stage. Totally, totally worth it - particularly if you get 50% off tickets the day of the show from one of the "same day ticket" booths. The theatre is small so don't worry about getting a bad seat.I didn't think I liked Carrot Top, but after seeing great reviews decided to see his show.  I am so glad I did!  It was hilarious.  A must see in Vegas!Can't really give any casino five stars because, let's face it, they are out to rob you blind. 

This is for the Cheesesteak Grill. Some of the best tasting, best priced cheesesteaks in the city. And now they have a few new offerings. Mmmm mmmm 

Only negative, the will not sauce your wings. Boo.  Un-sauced wings?  I won't eat them.Love this movie theater 5min from home.  Always friendly,clean and the right the room temperature.  Laugh if you want I still remember I almost froze at brenden theaters.  Sucks to pay good money for a great movie and movie theaterto F it up. Red Rock is perfectHave seen a big improvement! The popcorn is tasting yummy and it is clean and fresh. Really like the staff. Super friendly.I love their dog food!

My dogs have some serious issues with their foods.  They're not very picky eaters (I won't event get into this), but their stomachs are sensitive and one of them is prone to seizures that we linked to his diet.  For the last 5 years we had them on a special food we were only able to get from one place in town, which recently stopped carrying the formula.

In my search for a new dog food, I stumbled across the Soggy Dog.  The ladies were extremely helpful and knowledgeable about what types of foods would be good for my pups, even down to the specific ingredients.  Apparently, I must have looked like a deer in headlights (or a complete idiot), so they gave me some samples.  And not just one or two bags.  I'm talking all the flavors of several different brands...maybe 20 sample bags in all!  

Some 2 weeks later, I ended up purchasing a couple bags of food that my dogs not only enjoy, but have had no health problems since I started them on their new diet.  

If you have a dog with special dietary needs or you just want the best possible feed for fido and fifi, come here.I live in Los Angeles where I can easily buy my Louis here but I make  the effort to go to the LV in Vegas, the one in the Wynn in particular, due to one person, Edward Jackson.  His outstanding customer service is one of a kind.  He knows his stuff, history, products...etc.  I suggest that if you are ever in that area, come see him when you need help with your next Louis Vuitton purchase, you wont be sorry!!!good service and great selection.

I tried on a skirt  one size larger then my normal size because they didn't have my size in the color I like at the time. when I came out from the dressing room the sales person had already done the search for me to see which store still carry the size I wear. which I feel is very efficient. They ordered it for me and waived the shipping cost. I am happy!Jesus H Christ, this place is awesome. 

Located in the Forum Shops, Vosges offers fine, fine chocolates in creative flavors at a relatively affordable price point. if you disagree, check out Teuscher prices sometime and get back to me.

I have a weakness for caramels and Vosges goes well beyond the typical (but delicious) fleur du sel to include blood orange, bee pollen and dulce de leche varieties. There is to-die-for toffee, truffles, drinking chocolates and sampler packs too, in addition to the dozen or so bar flavors available. 

There are always samples to be had and friendly staffers. Go ahead - spend your ill gotten casino gains on sugary treats - you're totally worth it.One of the best Filipino Restaurant in Town! Great Service, and Really Good Food.... love the Tita's Over there there so friendly... and the guy who clean the table and always gives u a great service when you eat there. ...My partner and I were extremely satisfied with our stay!  The front desk staff were super friendly and welcoming upon our arrival.  I was most impressed with the card included in my gold elite gift bag.  I was not only recognized as a gold elite member, but the welcome card was signed by each and every staff member.  This showed me that they genuinely cared about me as a customer and wanted to lee me coming back for more!  Two nights ago, I stayed at a courtyard marriott in Oxnard, and they recognized me an my member status with "oh, your gold elite, thanks" and they handed me a bottle of water.  It seemed like an afterthought and I was not at all impressed.  Thank you Residence Inn Las Vegas South, for treating me like a person you care about!  Also, kudos to the shuttle service and letting me borrow your bottle opener!  I will be back!Great prices, friendly staff/service, and a very nice atmosphere. This is where I purchase all of the candy and stuff that I miss from Japan. Until I found this store, I had to go all the way up to the International Market for my purchases, which is quite a drive from Anthem. 

They also have a great selection of CDs by Japanese artists, as well as anime, and a lot of home decoration/beauty products and food products as well.easily one of the best pizza places anywhere, the family is from Brooklyn, New York and they know what they are doing. Next time you are in Las Vegas take a trip off strip and go to Rocco's...west charleston location or out in Summerlin...try the fried rice balls and the garlic knots!I think I just stumbled on to something here....woopsie.  Right down the way from my work, my boss sent me over to pick up some sandwiches from Rocco's.  Not realizing what I was about to walk into I ordered philly sandwich.  As I pulled up I could already smell the Italian goodness I was about to embark.  Now I have driven by a million times and have read a few of the reviews that pop up but really I HAD NO IDEA what an amazing place this is!  

As I approached the counter I could not believe the selection in front of me....and I ordered a philly.  Silly me.  I love the "by the slice" idea so you can sample a couple different styles of pizza.  There was a great selection from pizza to garlic knots...down to the little dessert complimentary by the cashier.  I told the guy I will definitely be back to do some pizza since that is their thang and that is what everyone raves about.

Contrary to the other reviews the main guy was a sweetheart.  I think people just misunderstand the NY edge.  The place was vibrantly decorated-fresh and modern with a New York feel.  Outdoor seating is available but no one was sitting out there. The chairs and table looked metal - OUCH!  They sure are cute but I dont see myself sittin on those in the summer....this is Vegas boys. Lol 

Now for my Philly, first off their bread is baked fresh.  I ordered the regular which is the 6" but really it looked more than a 10".  It was huge.  The bread as I said was so good I could eat it alone....so fresh.  The meat with grilled onions was so flavorful.  You could actually taste that it was steak.  There was so much meat I could only eat half the sandwich.  The cheese I believe was american but didnt overpower the sandwich. Soo so yum.  I brought the second half to the BF at the end of the day and the sandwich was just as good warmed up-I know because I had to have another bite.  I have had the turkey/provelone before that someone ordered me and that sandwich was no joke either.  BTW my boss ordered the Staten Island and its his fav out of the sandwiches.  

I will be back and bring the fam...sit and actually enjoy the meal there (pizza for sure this time) and I will update my review but as of now two thumbs up for Rocco's philly steak sandwich, fresh bread and ingredients, ambiance, decor and service!!!  One big happy package!  Can't wait to get back there!Love this place.  Reminds me of home everytime I walk in.  Just hate that guy who stuffs his face with the complimentary pastries and licks his fingers with every snatch.Great pizza and my favorite cheese bread.Great service as wellExcellent food for cheap.  It's off the strip but well worth the drive.  They renovated the dining area.Joe's is a staple for us in Vegas--we just cannot get stone crab this tasty anywhere back home.  On our most recent visit, I tried my very first whole lobster!!!  It was beautiful and buttery and delicious.  We also had one of the suggested dinners with the large stone crab claws, creamed spinach, and some kind of potatoes I think.  WIth the tasty pumpernickel raisin bread (and others), giant lobster, crab claws, and the obligatory slice of their award-winning key lime pie, we were stuffed to the brim! (Sorry sides.)  

On past visits we've also had steak (well executed), the fried oysters (super delish!) and lobster bisque (also delish, but they didn't have it this last time).  

As their name implies, you seriously can't come here without getting yourself some sweet, meaty stone crab claws with the sweet mustardy sauce that they have perfected!!!  We settle for Truluck's all you can eat stone crab on Mondays sometimes when we have a real hankering, but no one does it like Joe.I admittedly picked this restaurant solely on the numerous, positive Yelp reviews, but went with a skeptical eye -- good steak in Vegas?

Just outside an indoor fountain at Caesar's Palace that houses a Gelato shop, the restaurant looked great and elegant on the outside. We were seated immediately outside and ordered many appetizers, Single Malts (alcoholic drink), and main dishes.

The waitress was cheery and recommended a seafood appetizer sampler that contained oysters, King Crab legs, and Rock Crab legs. The oysters were very tiny, but the King Crab legs were absolutely delicious!

For the main courses, most of us tried the waitress-recommended Bone-in Rib Eye. Comparing it to the steaks we had at Mesa Grill (Caesar's Palace) and Bouchon (Venetian), this was our absolute favorite steak of the week-long trip! Bouchon, by the way, isn't recommended by us for steak.

This restaurant was on my mind all week-long despite other good places we went to, such as SambaSushi (Palazzo) and Pho Kim Loan (Chinatown).

Come here for the Bone-in Rib Eye steak and the King Crab legs!It's been a long time since I've had a really good, knock off my boots and keep them off!!!, ribeye.  This place really surprised me with the quality of their steak since it's mostly famous for it's stone crab.

-bone-in ribeye:  Yah, I splurged for the bone and honestly, I don't know if it would've made a difference.  I've noticed with other places that the meat next to the bone is usually a bit more tender than the rest of the steak but it really didn't matter here.  Every piece of meat I ate was just as good as the last.
-dover sole:  This thing was A-MA-ZING!  Cooked perfectly and the brown butter sauce on the side was so decadent.  My only gripe about this dish is that they took the belly, and all the tasty little bones away =(  My little heart cried when the waiter took that platter away ='(((
-swordfish with mint pesto:  This was a special that night and it was overcooked.  My friend really should've sent it back for a new one but she didn't.  The presentation was lovely though.
-creamed spinach:  This was very good.  It had a good spinach flavor and wasn't overloaded with cream.
-Jennie's potaoes:  Honestly, I don't see the draw of this dish.  It was just whipped potatoes and it seemed to have lacked butter and salt in it.
-mac and cheese:  This was okay, loved that they used shells though =d
-oysters on a half shell:  Their shucking skillz weren't too bad.  Only about 3 of the 12 oysters on the plate were stabbed to death and I had some shell shards in 1 of my oysters so that was good.  They were offering French Kisses and Kushis that night.  The Kushis defintely stole the show with a slight sweet buttery taste to them.  They also come with little Tabasco bottles that are uberly cute!  And a migonette, which was nice but a tiny spoon to get the liquid onto the oysters would've been greatly appreciated hah!
-brownie a la mode:  This was a tasty brownie.  I don't normally like brownies but this brownie was amazing mmmmmmmm

All and all, I would definitely come back here when their stone crabs are in season and splurge all over again =)Exc!
Potato crusted grouper!
Sweet corn
Onion rings 
And the claws!
You won't go wrongUnbelievably delicious! Prices are kinda steep and high but u get what u pay for. 
I went here last time with my fiancee and fam, and we enjoyed everything! I mean from the mashed potatoes, mac n cheese, onion strings, oysters (i dont even like oysters), to of course the stone crab. Even down to the bread. 
There's only 3 locations i believe in Chicago, Miami, and Vegas. We were all saying how they should open one up in LA. They have to... it would make a killing. But for the time being, since vegas is the closest, looks like we'll have to make a trip back soon.Lemon chicken, I just can't get enough. A+ Service and the food is always made fresh. Very clean restaurant. Prices are very affordable. The only downside to this restaurant is it is located next to a hookah smoke shop so the smell comes in when people hold the door open :( other than that this Little Dumpling location is the spot!!Surprisingly enough, loved this place! Came to Vegas for a bachelorette party, and guess what? We came to Mix Lounge TWICE in one weekend. :) The place is on the 64th floor, with amazing views. Both nights never got too crowded, so it almost felt like the lounge was OURS. The crowd was totally mixed, but leaning towards the late 20s/early 30s rather than the teenybopper early 20s. And crowd was more white than asian (unlike XS - basically downtown san jose moved to vegas. yuck)

Music was awesome, bathroom stalls had huge windows with a view. Pretty sweet place. If you stay in The Hotel, I believe you get in free.I love this place. The view from the 64th floor and the ability to sit and drink on the balcony makes this my favorite lounge in Vegas so far.

What was really special, were the ladies bathrooms. The stalls are individual rooms that have a glass wall. So yup, you can squat while looking out at Vegas from 64 stories up. It's pretty mesmerizing.

We didn't eat here, but were here for a private party. It was an open bar and all of the drinks were made perfectly.

The DJ was pretty weak, and we weren't the only ones who thought so. When we did end up leaving, we walked into the elevator followed by a group of guys who were thinking the same thing out loud. 

Not many peppy "OMG THIS IS MY SONGGGGGG" moments going on here.

I'd love to eat here or drink here again. The outdoor lounge has them ost fantastic views and the couch seats are incredibly comfortable, you could easily sit here all night.I am in love with this place. The only thing I dislike is that they dont have one in california. The staff is friendly. They have very cheap herbs and all of the herbs you can think of. They have so many other items and this is the ONLY store like this in Las Vegas. There is not even that many out here where I live in California like this. Only one. I love this place, and I will come here everytime I go to vegas. I was disappointed when I tried to go on a sunday when I was leaving the next day and they were closed. I think my heart broke. I bought enough Items to last me a while.I did not know about REI really until I moved to LV, and I really, really like it. I've been a few times, and on my second-to-most-recent visit, I decided to become a member. I was buying Danksos for a new job, and I figured that I may as well buy the $20 lifetime membership if I was going to spend $120 on Danish clogs. It will be interesting to see the dividends next year--I feel like I'm a powerful executive, eagerly awaiting my returns from my investments.

However, the 5 stars really comes from service. I ended up buying the wrong size of Danskos (persnickety little clogs) and had to return them. It was so easy and they were so nice in the process. Sometimes when you're exchanging, it can be a hassle, but not here. Also, they told me that I could have worn them out and still returned them. Ummm who does that anymore? Nobody, and that's awesome.

t's an outdoor person's paradise, but lots of warm things for indoor girls like myself as well. I am looking forward to having more incentives to shop here!Having traveled the 215 freeway many times while living on the South West area of Las Vegas, this gas station is very convenient. But that's kinda the idea for these places anyway right?

They have a car wash and many lanes of brightly lit pumps, for night visits. The main building is located next to several fast food restaurants. So once you fill up, you can get a quick wash and then a snack, all without leaving the immediate area.The great thing about Raw Health is that the staff on hand are very knowledgeable on nutritional supplements, the selection here is outstanding!Rob is both a good salesman and very knowledgeable in health/nutrition. I came in yesterday looking for a natural sleep aid and noted that I had tried and liked chamomile before, though he strongly suggested valerian, mentioning that he really liked it and strongly recommended it. The woman that mentioned feeling "bullied" I have a feeling must either be very passive or just bitter! Rob had strong opinions as to what would help me, and handed me a bottle or two for the sake of inspection, but never did I feel "bullied" into buying anything. Prices seem reasonable for a health store too!

Tl;dr Rob knows his stuff, and if there's something in the shop that he thinks would help, I do believe he would make a highly educated recommendation with the customer, not the cash register, in mind.Dr.  Xa is the best.  Straight forward,  no beating around the issues, his staff is so professional.  Scheduling is perfect,  no extended waits,  you walk in and they're ready for ya!The fish and chips are delish, small place but very cozy and the live music was great!! I'm definitely coming back. I love the vibe and the staff is really friendly.I visit this sushi place often. I consistently receive great fresh fish with  fast & friendly service. Try the monkey roll, it's a treat!I ain't 't fu*king with anyone else since reading they do work for some of the major retailers/boutiques around town. Great, prompt service I drive across town for these folks. The handful of times I've been there, they have only been honest about what they can or cannot do. I've checked out other places closer to me with good Yelp ratings but found that the communication or language barrier left me incredibly disappointed.

Even better news, they are opening a second location by me, the Southeast Vegas area!Took our friends from out of town and did a family style. Our favorites were chicken Marsala and ravioli Bianca and must have chocolate mousse pie!!Quality!  The linguini diablo is almost perfect with huge portions of scallops and shrimp.  Every meal begins with salad and their bread is baked with cheese on the spot.What a great selection of shoes here!  Nice sale going on too.  Great staff, friendly, and we love the shoes we got!Amazing service! The owners are some of the best business owners I have the privilege of knowing in this city. You are always greeted upon entering, and the help and knowledge is incomparable. 
My new adopted cat was fussy about her food and treats and they were so good to take the unused portions back in exchange for food our cat liked. 
Prices are very reasonable and with service like I get here I would pay no matter what.This is the best place to go for frozen custard. It is the best tasting and the staff are very friendly!! I go there at least 3 times/week!!Excellent $100 meal for two in Vegas. This included drink, appetizer and entrees.  The servings were large and the presentation was gorgeous.  The dishes were full of flavor.Oh. my. gosh. The food is AMAZING. My first time at an Irish Pub restaurant and I'm a fan! I had the bangers and mash and my husband had the lamb burger. SO much flavor in both dishes! I usually don't like mashed potatoes, but whatever they put on their potatoes made it taste so good, especially in conjunction w/ the cabbage! And my husband's lamb burger was juicy, tender, and an awesome twist on a regular burger. For dessert, YOU MUST GET THE BREAD PUDDING. Oh my gosh, I would sacrifice any diet just for their bread pudding.  It's quite literally the best bread pudding I've ever had, this place deserves 5 stars just for that!because of the blenders in such a small place and my small daughter (she just turned a year) I prefer to do carry out now...but the food and service here are always 100%. They are all always extremely friendly, my husband and i have been going there for years...i just wish they were in a bigger place so we would feel more comfortable with my daughter.I recently discovered that you can walk into a place called a bank and walk out with something called "cash".

This is a life changing event for me. I will do this as much as I can and I will do it at this place called "Bank Of America"

Thank you Federal Reserve for allowing this to happen. I feel good knowing my money is insured up to $250,000 for loss... perhaps I will go get more of that "cash" right now!

What friendly staff!
What green paper!
Wow....!!!!!Great neighborhood Chinese food place. The food is excellent and service was great too. I had the combination fried rice, chow mein and teriyaki chicken. I will definitely come back. Keep in mind that they are preparing your food fresh, so it may take a little longer. I suggest you call ahead.Best haircut I have had in a long time. Super quick and amazing results. I am very happy with my new dew! I'll be back again for sure!An update to my previous review: I did receive a (very unexpected) phone call from Jerry, General Manager of the Pep Boys, who wanted to follow up on my experience from the previous day.  He was genuinely concerned with the quality of his store, as well as the efficiency of his team.   He explained that they are working to rectify their staffing issues, and offered me a free oil change.   As I stated, I was not expecting a phone call regarding the matter, as the staff was very apologetic at the time; but their sincerity and Jerry's professionalism really shows that these guys do aim to please.dr maloney was awesome. she was so nice n informative!!! she did tests that other places havent done on me and told me what they were for. nifty!!!

the receptionist was able to fit me in last min since im from ca n like a dumbass, forgot my contacts. my script was expired n they were able to do an exam for me. totally cheap too since i didnt have insurance. LOVE this place!!! if i lived in vegas this wuld be my place for my eyes!When my fiance proposed to me, he chose a ring that didn't break the bank so we could go out and look for a vintage style ring together. He proposed on December 23rd, and when we went to my family's home for Christmas, my mom gave me the diamond from her engagement ring. shortly after returning home to Las Vegas, we found the perfect ring. All we had to do now was find a jeweler to put my mom's diamond into it. I was a little concerned that it wouldn't fit, but sure enough, Morgan Taylor Jewelers remounted the diamond in my new engagement ring, and it is absolutely gorgeous!!! i could not be happier! they were very friendly, down to earth, and i was able to stay within our ring budget! they were also able to get my ring back to me very quickly. I dropped the ring off on a Tuesday afternoon, and i picked it up Friday- it only took them 3 days! i am very impressed with what they were able to do with my ring, and i would recommend them to anyone that needs a jeweler!!Stumbled upon this place by accident.  I was on my way to the AIDS walk on a Sunday and found out a good friend of mine celebrated his bday the day before.  I wanted to get him a cupcake but all of the bakery that sells cake/cupcake opens at 11am on Sunday morning and I needed it at 9am.  And this is how my little love affair for this place started.

This bakery is truly amazing.  It has a quaint feature that reminds me of those asian bakery you see in a foreign movie or something.  Their cakes looked and tasted wondeful.  But the best part about this bakery is their customer service.  EXCEPTIONAL customer service!  The owner/baker (I wasn't sure) gladly opened the bakery and sold me a cake for my friend eventhough he said the cashier doesn't show up till 10am.  He said he didn't have change or is able to operate the cash register so I gave him a little bit more than the asking price and in return, gave me a red bean mochi instead!  Made my day =).This place was quite a nice surprise. It was inside the hotel we were staying at and it is off the strip. We had lunch and breakfast here and the steak is a must have!  very tender and full of flavor and cooked perfectly!
as for value and quality it rivals other strip steak houses that cost double. i would go back to envy for sure even if i wasn't staying at the hotel. (fyi: the hotel is the Renaissance hotel)Got invited here for lunch while attending SEMA show across at the convention center.  This place is awesome. Had the shrimp flatbread essentially a pizza rectangle shape. Best Ive ever had... Memorable and will go back next time in vegas!You must go here!!!!

I don't dish out 5 stars but I must say this place is great! We ordered the antipasto, the fries, the creamed corn and I ate the filet mignon. It was one of the best steaks I've had. It was perfectly cooked to buttery perfection. I certainly will be dreaming of it for a while. I will say the fries are absolutely delicious, I actually had to force myself to stop eating them if I didn't want my brother to roll me out of the restaurant. They are portioned for 4-5 people. 

You must try this restaurant. Its just a great experience overall. Nice decor, great service, excellent food. Would absolutely return.I really liked the Trump Hotel because it was just a hotel and no casino.  Although I do like to sit and play the slots here and there, I don't think my sinuses appreciate the cigarette smoke.  Our room was really nice with a view of the strip.  All of the staff was super sweet, sometimes as a gay couple you run into some looks or actions by hotel staff but not here, they all were really great.  The clientele however may be a different story.  However, what do you expect - it's Las Vegas.  

Overall I would def stay there again, but there are so many hotels to try out I would def want to try out others before coming back."We're so happy you guys are back!"

That's exactly what the our doorman/valet guy told us every time we arrived back to the Trump from going out. This place is legit I tell you when it comes to their service. You are always greeted with a happy door man/ valet guy when you arrive and they are always trying to find you a deal if you ask. Our guy last night found us a cheap deal for a Hummer limo to get to XS (club at Encore) for only $50. My girls and I fell in love with him. 

My other girl friend got an extremely bad burn from a motorcycle yesterday and we called the front desk to get us some ointment. They sent us a worker who not only gave her ointment and badges at 2:30am , but the guy looked over the burn, gave her basically a diagnosis and prognosis and all at 2:30AM! 

When we went to the swimming pool, we asked for towels. They sat us down at a row of chairs, which included couch beds, and laid out all of  our towels on our chairs for us. BTW.. try tanning at the pool at the shallow end where the water is only about 2-5 inches deep. It definitely beats and is cooler than sweating your butt off at your lounge chair in 100 degree weather. 

Besides the service, our room was awesome. You had to enter a door into a small walk area before getting to the bedroom itself. This made sure outside noise in the hall wouldn't bother us while we got our deep sleep. And our deep sleep was a contribution from the thick curtains that made  our room so dark, that we thought it was 3am when it was actually noon. Our cute kitchen, had a skillet, coffee cooker, utensils, fridge and toaster that were helpful when we warmed up our left overs from eating out. And the bed.. boy was it comfy. Soft bed back board, down pillows and blankets to sink into. I felt I was in heaven. 

And the hotel itself was just clean and gorgeous. This hotel, I mind you, does not have a casino and does not permit smoking. To compensate for that, you get AWESOME and I mean AWESOME customer service. I felt like the Trump was my home to go to after going out on the strip. (Yes, this is basically half a mile or less from the strip, and exactly a 5 minute drive to the Wynn. That was awesome, considering we only partied at the Wynn or Encore any way). And we got a sweet deal on Orbitz for only $250 for two nights!

My girlfriends and I just might make the Trump our getaway place from now on when we go to LV.Glitz done right

Beautiful hotel, plush rooms, and amazing service.Beautiful hotel. The room was spacious, gorgeous, and well cleaned out. The service was impeccable. I very much enjoy the fact that there is no casino in the hotel, so it definitely seems a lot different from other hotels in Vegas. Granted, it is a little bit off the strip, but it's definitely nice to walk into a hotel without all the loud ringing. 

I am definitely coming back, and next time with my dog. They have separate pet services in this hotel! YES!Always good service, portions of fish, and the pricing is great!!  The BYOB is nice too.  They refrigerate your drinks and bring them to you.  Can't beat that!I kept hearing about how good this place was and with such a limited amount of sushi restaurants nearby, my husband and I decided to try it. We went on the Friday before Labor Day, so when we first walked in it was pretty slammed. It looked as if the small restaurant was overwhelmed with the fast paced staff, so we were a little worried about the service. It turned out we had nothing to be worried about, the service was great! We ordered the yellow tail nigiri, salmon skin roll and ebi yakisoba. The fish in the sushi was high quality and very fresh tasting (for Arizona). I don't normally order hot food, but decided to venture out and it was well worth it. The ebi yakisoba was very good, with shrimp that was marinated and cooked very well, and vegetables that were fresh and crunchy. I will definitely return.Wow!! Great Service, Fresh Sashimi I will Definitely go back!!
 no liquor license so  Bring your own Beer or Wine and they will provide a glass:-))This place was amazing. Their cheeses, their desserts. Even the olive oil was particularly good. They use quality ingredients. Service was friendly. Food was a little pricey. I highly suggest this wonderful Mario Batali restaurant!They are truly amazing! Been there three times and I've been satisfied each visit! Always do a good job! Yes the stylist doesn't really talk and they do seem like their in a rush however as long as they get the job done right there are zero complaints from me! Good price! $10 is a sweet deal! I was finding it so difficult to find a good place to getting eyebrows done since my move from California, but this place really met my expectations! I'm very happy!**DISCLAIMER**
I rate only on the quality and consistency of the Coconut Shrimp

Chain Schmain! If you know what to order you'll be fine.

They have a pretty extensive Polynesian inspired menu.
Stay away from all that and go for the good stuff~ 

COCONUT SHRIMP ~Quite Possibly the best (see pics)

Their Tempura Salmon roll is pretty good too but can vary, this time it was a little over riced and the rice was on the sticky side, but it was still tasty.

I Only go here to eat those two items and occasionally their mini sundae which is super fab! 

A scoop of vanilla ice cream set inside a crispy cinnamon sugar wonton bowl with chocolate sauce and whip cream! Perfection!I usually don't review larger chains but I absolutely love Elephant Bar. Never had bad service there, they have a ton of options and their happy hour is fantastic. Drinks are good, great selection of beers and spirits. For food, you HAVE to get the calamari to start. It's unlike any other place and it's so delicious. The teriyaki chicken is great, lemon chicken is outstanding and the prices aren't too bad either. There are very few places like Elephant Bar and this location is the best one. 

-EthanMy favorite sushi here in Las Vegas! I'm not sure I have had anything I didn't like! And the one on Eastern has happy hour specials!!First time I got a room here, I fell in love. Our view was spectacular, overlooking the Strip. I love movies so the movie theme was definitely a plus. The rooms were sleek and furnished with a very classy touch. The price I paid to get a room was cheap for what I got. It's definitely a great place to stay if you're on a budget but don't wanna stay at that dingy douchehole Circus Circus or The Imperial Palace. 

And might I add that it's attached to the Miracle Mile Mall??? Fuckin' great if you wanna do some sweet shopping! I mean, I'm sure you can find the same crap at home, but hey, you're in Vegas, live a little! You got True Religion, Betsey Johnson, BEN SHERMAN, H&M, Urban Outfitters, Lucky Jeans, Volcom, etc. Definitely gotta love buyin' new clothes!I fell in love with this place the moment I sat down and realized I had to peel my own shrimp (head and all) and throw my trash right onto the plastic tablecloth. After several trips, I've come to learn my favorite flavors and spice ratings. I love the hot n juicy special at a mild or medium level. These levels have a good amount of spice that doesn't hurt my face.

Now, I'm not a very good spicy food eater. But I have been here with different groups of friends and have had the opportunity to sample the different spice levels. I can say the extra spicy is very very hot, and it builds with every bite you take. Your lips continue to burn, but you can't resist the tastiness and continue to eat, despite the pain. But what I really like and appreciate about the extra spicy flavors is the fact that you can still taste the flavor despite the heat. Your mouth isn't reduced to just a ball of fire.

And on that note, I would recommend any seafood lover to visit this fine establishment.Will consider opening a restaurant in Honolulu???  pretty please?

YES!  It was that delicious!  On my trip to Las Vegas, I was brought here by a couple of friends and I was hooked after that time.  My traveling buddy and I shared a pound of the Hot n Juicy shrimp with sausage, corn, and rice.  It was more than enough for the two of us.  The mild sauce had a big kick to it so if you're not the spicy fan, I don't even recommend the mild!  The sausage was really good as it had a snap to it and the corn was infused with a buttery version of the Hot n Juicy sauce.  The staff was excellent as they were very good with beverage refills as each of us polished off at least two sodas.  

Hot n Juicy kicks all of the North Shore shrimp trucks in the face and make them beg to call it "daddy!"  I wished I had the time to come back again.  Any place that has me craving their food after a couple of weeks deserve 5 stars.If you head out to Vegas and start craving hot and juicy crawfish this place won't disappoint.  Chances are if you've been to Boiling Crab then you will be familiar with the set up, menu, and experience.  I like the sauce here better then BC and the food here is amazingly fresh!  Highly recommended!The food here is so good, this place feels wholesome, healthy and classy.. maybe the name, location, people that frequent the place, decor and ambiance (can't put my finger on it). Probably a combination of all of them. Food is consistently tastey, staff is friendly and smiley :) and it's clean/comfy. 

One down side is it is slightly higher in price for walk in ordering, another downside are the windows, so bright in the morning and hurts my (sensitive) eyes.I did not stay here but did visit because I wanted to check it out for my next Arizona trip. I was pleased on all aspects! its gorgeous inside and out. The outside has waterways and gardens and the inside is hip n trendy but classy feel. The rooms are private w balconies overlooking the pond and pool area. The pool area has real sand instead of cement so its very tropical! The customer service stood out by far!I have been wanting to see this exhibit for a long time and finally got a chance to see it tonight. It is defiantly a must see-and a true experience of the Titanic "feeling". You first are greeted with a boarding pass with a real passengers information - and at the end you get to see if you survied. Then you get to see all the wonderful artifacts from jewelery to money and dishes. My favorite part was the grand staircase which we were able to take pictures on. Also there is a part were it looks like your outside of the deck with all the stars shining really bright...then you get to the part were there is a huge glacier and you get to touch it and feel how cold it is and can only imagine the pain the poor people had to feel when out in the water. It was filled with interesting facts and a real inspiring exhibit. Makes you appreciate life. But a definite "must see" in Vegas.Terrific exhibit. Well worth the money. 

Everything was nicely put together, you really felt like you were taking a journey. The artifacts are beautifully displayed. I was blown away that handwritten letters and postcards were recovered. It was all so personal, at times I had chills. "The Big Piece" is incredible, it took my breath away. If you are in Vegas between now and 2018 stop in and see this.I am fascinated by the history of the Titanic, so I knew I wanted to visit this exhibit at some point. I had low expectations, thinking it would be a quick walk-through of various artifacts, but it ended up being much more than that. 

The exhibit goes through chronological order, beginning with the construction of the ship and the description of the different cabin classes. There are recreations of the rooms and certain parts of the ship, like the Grand Staircase and the deck of the ship at night, which is eerily cool! It also highlights various passengers' stories and why they were on the Titanic in the first place. Then, it goes into the departure of the ship, the collision with the iceberg, and the aftermath. 

There are a few videos you can watch, including a Discovery channel recreation of the Titanic's demise and another one about the 2010 recovery efforts. There is also a huge chunk of ice that you can touch, which is meant to show you how cold the iceberg and water were that night. The most interesting artifact was The Big Piece, a large part of the ship that was recovered, preserved and now on display. 

I had a $10 off coupon, but I found an even better deal through Tix 4 Tonight. Each ticket came out to $19.60 each after taxes and fees, and for that price, I felt it was worth it. They have an optional audio tour for an additional $6, but there is plenty to read and look at without it. There is also a small gift shop at the end of the exhibit and an opportunity to buy cheesy cut-and-pasted pictures of yourself in front of the Grand Staircase or The Big Piece.

Cell phones must be turned off, and no cameras or food/drinks are allowed!Wow, this was a really good exhibit!  I loved every moment of it walking through and seeing all the artifacts.  Reading about all the stories and the people were really interesting too.  Just makes me wonder about the people who made "last minute" changes to their journeys to be on the Titanic and what came about.

I like the replica of the different class hallways and room.  That first class room looked so amazing! Looking at the pictures of what the dining rooms looked like, the architecture, and even the plates down to the spoon was interesting. I loved the covered patio deck! It was cheesy with the lights but oh so romantic.

I think what would be really interesting is if they had built in a simulator of the hallway that showed partially of how the Titanic tilted over and how it was like (similar to the earthquake simulations at the ca discovery center)

My favorite part was the staircase.  Oh how I wish I could take wedding photos on there!  The husband merely glanced and said "the cruise lines today have even bigger, grander staircases" and didn't really care much for it but I thought it was gorgeous!  I've never been on a cruise so I don't have anything to compare it to but just the shear architecture and detail made me giddy.   The best part I think was the huge piece of the Titanic that they were able to recover.  It really puts things into perspective as to how this "small" piece of the Titanic tells so much about the agonizing pain and passion but into building it, it's tragedy, and it's recovery.

Highly recommend for people on the fence about going to the Exhibit.

I think I'll go find that Titanic movie now... or wait for it to finally come out on Blu-Ray or HD... which won't be for a while... Sigh.We've visited here twice from Denver, and each time I wish we had a shop like this near our home. It's fun to browse, and my son always finds good cookies (TimTams or the British imitator called Penguins) or snacks. I'd love to try some of the home-prep items and may figure out a way to do that. 

I nearly bought a Shandy Bass this trip (Bass ale mixed with lemonade, a traditional drink, go figure) but didn't because I couldn't drink it right away and couldn't keep it cold. Next trip perhaps. How can you pass up a thing that interesting and unusual? 

The owner is helpful and accommodating, and I'm fairly sure she'd order you things she doesn't carry if you can return to get them.

This is a great break from the casinos and an easy-to-find location on Decatur. From the south, go west on Tropicana past The Orleans casino and turn north (right) on Decatur. Proceed north to the 3400 South block. The shop is in a strip mall on the west side of Decatur. It's usually open from 10 to 6 or a little later.You can not beat the food here. Everything is top notch and you get exactly what you paid for, I come from a full Italian family and we all agrees the risotto was as if we were in Italy. The staff was amazing while the place is packed they manage to have people eating in under 15 minutes. The place has an amazing view of the gondola and mall. Overall success it's a dine you must try with eloquent food.We dine at Fin restaurant in Mirage and the food was very tasty, flavorful and fulfilling. We ordered the scallop fried rice (the best), steamed fish, sea bass (so juicy), shark fin soup, duck, Chinese broccoli, steamed chicken, and my favorite the foie gras... oh so good. After we were done with our main course, they brought out their sweet pudding dessert and oranges. 

The service was spectacular. Definitely be back!Gluten-Free! Yes that is right, they have GF pitas and meat pies and spinach pies and tabouli. They are all delicious. What is great is that the pitas fresh are just as good as non-GF - so unlike most GF breads you don't have to toast them for them to be tolerable.  They also have this very thin round bread thing that we have started using at home to make a pizza roll-up. You can buy all the GF stuff (minus the tabouli) and freeze it safely with out damaging the quality. You just use a toaster or a toaster oven for a new seconds to thaw.
These folks are kind and their food is lovely.Awesome place. Visited from California... wish we had something like this place here. Got the fontina burger one day and the BBQ Chicken pizza the next. The "grilled" pizza has an awesome charred taste.

Wish I could have tried the apple fritters but I walked up to the counter at 11:01 and they had stopped serving breakfast. They should really serve those all day long.This place doesn't need yet another review - it's awesome. We know. BUT I had to put a good word in for their FISH TACO FRIDAYS!!!!!!! Oh my oh my I long for Friday's 11-2pm ish.  I order Fish Taco's on many a menu and these rank in my top 3 of all time. 2 tacos, Special sweet sauce (lots), hot homemade tacos, crunch cabbage...FINGER LICKIN good.  $8.95 I think. It comes with a salad that I barely touched because it couldn't keep up with the tastebud party of the fish tacos. They should swap out the salad for something else more exciting like a summer corn veggie "salad" or something.  

Anyway, my other MUST HAVE at The Coffee Shop is the scones! I've never ordered a scone in my life - but here they are unbelievable - soft - like glorified magic muffins.  The whoopie pies are pretty spectacular too.  I always get an iced mocha - and it's always just the way I like it.  

P.S. The ambiance here rocks.  a great place to get some work done (wifi), chat with a girlfriend, baby-watch, or go on a lunch date with your 15 month old like I do (plenty of high chairs and nice people that say SHE'S SOOO CUTE!)I got 2 upgraded $10 tickets after I seen some reviews and advertising for this show. It's about 75 minutes, good clean fun for anyone really. Nathan is very entertaining and nice, he signed his autograph on the photo they took for me and my mom. They don't allow photography inside the show. Overall, I'd recommend seeing it.This place is a riot.  From a "tourist" stand point there is suprisingly alot of fun to be had.  Especially if you don't take yourself seriously.  My Dad, friend and I had an under cover security guard watching us closely by the time we left (not very sneaky sir).  Be sure to watch the fishing demonstration, watching live fish strike bait live is pretty dang cool.  If you're in Vegas, like the outdoors, and feel like releasing some of your redneck side, this place is great.This shop is definitely not for everyone. I love stopping here though to see all the hunting gear. It's so off-the-wall and random due to how many things you can find here. For example, my brother and I found a bb gun specifically for shooting squirrels.  You just don't find that sort of thing in Los Angeles where we're from haha!

It's on the 215 just before you get into Vegas and definitely worth a pitstopI love Yelp! When I was craving Yakitori and driving my husband crazy this place completely fit the bill. My husband was happy with his sushi which given how fickle and picky he can be I say this is a good thing.Target and I have a Love Hate Relationship... As much as I try to fight going there every time my wife mentions it. When I do end up walking under the large Red Target and into those automatic double doors my guard goes down and I feel like a tourist at a Mexican market or something. Everything is usually on sale and you see all kinds of crap extremely strategically placed to catch your eye end and somehow end up in your fire engine red cart. The only thing missing is the chicle kids and if they had those I would lose all non spending power I have. 

On top of my simple comparison of Target and Ensenada this location always seems to have friendly associates working and they are always offering to help you out if you need help finding something.. Not that my wife who I swear owns a military issue topographical map of all the targets in the area couldn't find what we are looking for. This location also normally has everything stocked well and kept clean. This is by far my favorite Target location that I love to hate. 

The last thing that really stands out about this Target is how the food court area is right in front of the checkout lines. Now, if it were only myself and my wife standing in line that would not be an issue 'BUT" it is not, we also have a 2 year old little girl that remembers everything ( this is where I think they actually do have the chicle kids) The chicle kids in Mexico just pop up from thin air it seems and that is how I feel about this food stand when I have my daughter. We can be mid conversation about socks and Yo Gabba Gabba and she will drop everything and Say," I want and Icee and Hot Dog Daddy" And just like the Chicle kids I have a hard time saying no to buying some of the small goods they are selling at that point.

I guess to sum this place up, they have a friendly staff a clean store and regardless of the slight hatred you can carry for any given store I always seem to find myself pushing that red cart and filling it with stuff I really do not need. Touche Target!! Well DoneOur favorite family place to go out to dinner! The people are so kind, even making my son a special "face" dessert! Feel good about eating out!This is my favorite place to eat lunch.  The food is delicious and the staff is excellent.  I have taken slews of my friends for the experience.   They are all return customers.  Don't even try the delectable goodies in the front case.  All so delicious.  The special is my favorite lunch.  1/2 sandwich, 1/2 salad (any on the menu) or small soup (which are just yummy..pick 2 of the 3.  This has a bag of chips and a small chocolate cookie to go with it.  A very cute fun neighborhood family cafe.  LOVE IT!Most delicious burger anywhere. Great value,service,and strip views! Please note this is a FULL service restaurant. When I want fast food I go to in and out or 5 guys. Or fashion show food court..oh my kids love this place. Burgers are made to MY specifications medium rare. Not one temperature for all like fast food places! Also try Oreo choc chip milk shake. It's my number one bribe for my kids good behaviour! LolStripburger is my go-to place whenever I'm in Vegas.  The burgers are great.  The beer prices are decent.  There is a free view of the Wynn.  It's all outdoors with heat lamps for the winter and misters in the summer.  Not much beats drinking beer outdoors in Vegas.  And the bartenders and servers are all wicked nice.  And I can do this all while the girlfriend shops in the mall before she joins me...win-win!

The only complaint that I have about Stripburger is the tv's.  The don't have an HD signal, and they never turn the sound on for games because they play music over the speakers instead.Happy 2yrs!Radio has come a long way since its inception so I think it is just about time to YELP about it!!!! 

I would venture to say it might be the best of the LGO group at this point, although it did not start out that way.  They have a fantastic bartender on Fridays who loves to use fresh citrus in her cocktails.  I believe there is an art to the perfect cocktail, that whole sweet tart just strong enough balance...and these guys have it mastered!!! My favorite is the capirihiana.  Throw in some of their special marinated cherries and it's amazing!  You can get great light plates to share (artichoke, awesome chop salad, and love the tuna crudo) and their main courses are the perfect size as well! The new bar along the north wall makes for a fantastic place to spend an evening and is just beautiful!!! Also, the staff and management are just fantastic!

Like any new born, Radio Melano has grown into itself and into the neighborhood; so jump on your cruiser bike this Friday night and check out Radio!!Jaimie at Dolly Rockers is awesome!  She does great color and for the blondes looking for someone who can give you the tone you want...Jaimie is your girl.  Very cool atmosphere as well.Great food. I ordered the filet mignon with a side of their macaroni and cheese. Both were excellent. GF ordered the Pad Thai. Very flavorful. Our ahi tuna appetizer was also excellent. Service was attentive and quick. Their expensive menu made it hard to choose. For a midrange price point restaurant, this is the place to go in Planet Hollywood.Not sure where I've been hiding out lately, but so glad I found Switch. My friends and I visited on a Saturday afternoon and sat outside on the patio. They do allow smoking, so be fore-warned about that. The only way we could tell our server was a newbie was that he had a pal shadowing him around and taking care that he was doing all he could to make our meal memorable. And it was! Our brunch - quiche of the day - was ridiculously delicious. I imagine they are all different, but this chicken, asparagus, chipotle, mushroom, spinach, and corn creation was amazingly flavorful. Mimosas were made from the freshest orange juice I have tasted in quite awhile. Two of us ordered the quiche and one of us ordered the breakfast special with beautifully poached eggs, crunchy baguettes, and a heaping pile of prosciutto. Great service, lovely ambience, good cocktails, and the food - wow, oh wow! Can't wait to visit again.Fine place, metrosexual, good food, great service and in a great neighborhood that we live.  It's a. Jewel!I defy you to eat the following items and tell me this isn't really tasty Mexican food.
1.  Start with the hot and also the chunky salsa. Mix 50/50. 
Eat almost all of the salsa with a couple of bowls of chips. Save some to put on entree. 
2.  sandy's special with beans and rice. 
3.  1 Roberts taco on the side. Roberts tacos are better than the regular taco cuz they're made with shredded roast beef. 
Granted, I could be biased having grown up eating this practically my whole life. Still, if you don't love this, you may have a serious medical condition...might wanna see a doctor...
Did I mention I love the beans and rice?
Oh, and the chili relleno. 
Their flour tortillas are really good so include cheese crisps and burritos.I really like Wally's. I've tried several options there.
My favorite is the *Chop Chop Salad*- it's a nice combination of vegetables and I like the honey mustard dressing that it's tossed with. They don't put too much dressing so it's not soggy, but it's nicely coated.

I also like the *Veggie Burger*- It's a housemade patty which I always appreciate.

Their *Basil Hummus* appetizer is also very nice.

My husband and father both rave about their *Fish and Chips*- Fried but never too greasy, and nice pieces of fish. 

Wally's is definitely upscale pub food and a nice atmosphere. The wait staff is always kind and the restaurant is always clean!I used Executive for an airport pick up when i was in Vegas for the 4th. They were punctual and the town car was in great condition. The driver was really friendly and they played good music. They also gave us cold waters which was nice because it was HOT outside. Saturday night we scheduled a pick up at TI with their Hummer Limo..again punctual and the new driver was super friendly. We picked up our group at Cosmopolitan then they dropped us off at Bellagio..since it was fight weekend and 4th of July weekend the strip was packed so we had a mini dance party in the Hummer limo on our way because it took a while. Driving that Hummer limo  would be tough but our driver was awesome and so patient. 
I actually made a booking error and scheduled a pick up Sunday morning at 9:15 when it should have been 8:15.. the company picked up on our flight time and when I called at 8 hoping they could accommodate my error the dispatch said the town car was already in route. Talk about service. Love this company. Will use them next time I am in Vegas. 
Also, very reasonable prices!I do take out once a week for dinner. They have great dinners. The sad part is no one knows they even do dinner. The Saturday nite prime rib is the best we have had in years. The homemade meatloaf is awesome Keep up the great work guys. Love the dinners. Oh the breakfasts also great.cute vintage inspired clothing that fits well. and this is coming from a vintage snob who usually snubs reproductions.

i love how in the dressing rooms there's a pair of heels for you to try to the dresses on with. nice touch. the sales girl was super attentive and super sweet. the olivia paintings and sketches that adorn the walls are drool-worthy. 

after trying on a few hot little numbers i left with 2 dresses for just over $100! try and beat that, stop staring! and they both were replicas of actual dresses that bettie page wore!My husband and I started dining at Times Square recently at the insistence of our adult son, who has impeccable taste in anything relating to food. I almost regret having ever tried it as I have easily gained 5 pounds since my first visit 3 months ago. Sure, it's not the fault of the restaurant any more than it could be a spoon's fault that I am a little thicker now... but still I have to wonder. 

The outside of the building is nondescript. In fact I have been driving past this establishment for years and never paid it any attention though I remember the parking lot has often been full. The building does not catch your eye unlike the Castle Boutique whose entrance is opposite of the parking area for Times Square. Inside the décor is simple, not overdone, and the hand drawn images on framed napkins in the bar area depicting numerous faces are unique.  There are multiple flat screen TV's playing sporting events just in case "the game" happens to conflict with dinnertime.  

Our first experience was with a group of 6 during a Friday evening rush in December. Our server was well versed in all menu items, patient, quick to take our drink & appetizer orders and just as quick to serve in spite of the bustling bistro. She returned, personable and unfrazzled, to check on how everything was and to see if we needed anything at just the right times. It doesn't matter that I don't recall her name, all servers here are equally adept and there are plenty of them on hand to take care of customer needs each time we come here, which is usually during the 6 - 7 PM rush on a Friday or Saturday. Keep in mind, though, this place is almost just as busy during Sunday - Thursday evenings as well so expect to wait a few minutes to be seated if you haven't made reservations. I would like to mention that we were not charged gratuity on our group of 6, which resulted in a great tip for our server; she earned it!

There is a well stocked bar attended by welcoming bartenders to address your thirst requirements, be they in the form of alcohol, water, or amazing food. We've eaten at the bar a couple times and were pleased to be visited by one of the chef's to ascertain our opinions on the dishes we ordered. If we could have taken him home we would have. 

Now for the food: For appetizers, my husband is a HUGE fan of the crab cakes served with pesto mayo and lemon wedges while I enjoy the fresh bruschetta. My favorite entrée so far is the Penne Alla Aribiatta without chicken or sausage. I am a vegetarian and have been told by the servers that I am welcome to order just about anything on the menu without meat and the chef will be happy to prepare it. This dish, however, is so ridiculously flavorful that I have not been able to bring myself to order other entrees just yet. In time. 
Other fantastic items on the menu (according to my meat eating spouse): Pasta Giovanni, Spaghetti Alla Polpetti (homemade meatballs he fell in love with and can no longer live without), and the best Caesar Salad that has yet to grace his taste buds - I'll have to take his word since I don't do eggs either. He has had numerous other items and has loved them all. 

This establishment is squeaky clean and very well run. This place is so popular they are in the process of opening a new location at 7th Street and Union Hills. They have been actively training new chefs since we became patrons in December 2013. 

Tip #1: Reservations recommended, especially during the dinner rush. They take reservations for 5 or more but not after 3 PM for the same day. If making a reservation was not an option for you, grab a beverage from the bar and your table will be ready as efficiently as is humanly possible. They are very accommodating and the mouth-watering food and out of this world service are well worth the wait. 

Tip #2: There are several more dishes/specialties on their menu in person than you will find in the online version, though the web version is quite considerable and gives you a good feel for what to expect. 

Tip #3: There is ample parking out back if the front lot is full. 

Tip #4: Lastly, but certainly not least, wear your buffet pants and make regular exercise part of your daily routine because you will quickly become as addicted as the rest of the crowd who has been fortunate enough to find this place. 

That's it for my 2 cents!I'm sad.   Bill's is a classic casino/hotel that I never wanted to change.    Those cheap pitchers of beer will likely suffer the infamous Strip price gauge when the new place comes up.   I am more of a downtown Vegas girl.  And now that they're erasing the trashtasticness of center strip, Downtown is where I'll stay.   I'm lucky to have had Cook E. Jarr sing the first GLORIOUS dance I had with my husband as a married couple at Bill's.   That memory is all I need.We had a delicious dinner and special occasion setting for New Year's Eve-- dinner for two.  The service and food were both extraordinary.  It's a small, romantic spot for a special meal.  We plan to try it again soon for a date night out from the regular menu.  The ingredients were especially fresh and well prepared, no heavy handed sauces here, and that was a delight.  The owners are on hand to greet you and make sure your evening is a special one.  Nice touch and within walking distance of all of Old Town Scottsdale.There weren't so many good reviews on here but I really enjoyed the restaurant! The ambiance was beautiful, the service was great and the food was excellent! I'd highly recommend Café Forte.Doug always has new information on pools and how to handle different issues that might come up with your pool.  He has always done a good job and I would highly recommend using him for any repairs or monthly pool service!Its ALL ABOUT THE CRAB LEGS. 

I live in vegas so I go here all the time.

The crab legs are to die for.  I just load up on the crab legs and eat till I almost puke, they are SO GOOD.

Best crab legs ever.

I don't even bother with anything else.

And I love the old-school, dark, south pacific vibe.  Its so fun.

My favorite buffet ever.Nobody told me about ordering " double double animal style" but when I caught on to what the locals were doing, I jumped right in and have not been able to do it any other way at this nifty retro keeping it simple burger house!  Nobody makes burgers look like the menu picture...EXCEPT here!  It is a point of pride!  
Can we talk for a moment about the fry guy !  How strong. How swift.  How forceful the spud-splitting slices slipping salined into the vats.  Fresh cut never looked or tasted so good.
How can I return to the one who has served "over xx-trillion customers"?  And does that vendor count the customers they have disserviced?  I wonder.  But not for long.  I have to be re-jeuvenated as I pass out from brain freeze sipping my FABULOUS malt.
By the way...you can get 7 up on tap here!  YUP!
This is a must make a meal whenever you meander near MESA or thereabouts!Pratically made this account just to write about this place.

I Loved it here. Im from California but im planning to move to Phoenix and I wanted to see what can be grown in Phoenix, so i made my boyfriend stop at this exotic place and gosh! There were so many more varieties than I anticipated. Even Lychee! My personal asian fruit favorite!

Its not in a good neighborhood and it looked kind of shabby, however it was absolutely WORTH the visit. the people knew what they were talking about and they knew their product so well. I was very happy, i'd definitely will come back when i move to Phoenix!!Great place for kids. We make the trip up to check it out about once a month and spend a couple hours. And to Ian B, are you kidding? Two stars because there is dead shit on the walls? Its a hunting and fishing store. Maybe you should dump your tree hugging girlfriend and get one that lives in the real world?I love this place. It is an excellent, sort of upscale place to go. You do have to wait a while if you go there on a busy night but it is def. well worth the wait. I will def be returning here. The beer is great and the food prices are also very reasonable.The BBQ salad is tremendous.  Love this place for breakfast and HUGE portions.  Fast paced staff always seems to be helpful enough.My favorite go-to breakfast spot in Las Vegas.  Yes there's higher quality joints but I would go to The Cracked Egg over any breakfast chain. It's really egg-celent!  

Favorites: Northshore scramble, Chorizo Skillet, Eggs Benny's.  
Awesome: Complimentary Coffee Cake.  BEST COFFEE CAKE....EVER!
TIP: If there's 2 of you, skip the wait and sit at the counter/bar.

The service staff is warm and friendly. My water is never empty.  The place has modest breakfast themed deco on the walls.  The wait for a seat on a weekend can take a while (sometimes up to 30min, no one likes to wait for breakfast) but we are always OK with sitting at the counter where there's usually a spot open and you get to see the action of the servers behind the counter.

The quality of the food is eggs-emplary! Everything taste fresh, including the fresh fruit if it comes with your dish.  The coffee cake is delicious (different flavors every week, my fav is the ones with fruit).  The eggs are rarely over done or underdone (I order over easy on my skillets).  The potatoes are crispy and hot. The coffee is standard but I'll let that slide cause this place isn't called "The cracked bean".

Overall, Cracked egg is an eggs-traordinary breakfast spot! Good eats and good meets. Try it today! YAY!Love, love, love this place.  I've been to all of the locations.   When I go to Vegas it's my first stop.  Clean and bright on the inside.  Service is quick.  Food is fresh and tastes great.  The best coffee cake and potatoes anywhere!Great wine, friendly staff, and reasonably priced. Ask for Travis, he's the one with the pony tail likely cutting the cheese. Seriously they have great cheeseGot a lamb gyro to go this week and it was so awesome!!  The pita bread was soft and chewy, the cucumber dressing was awesome, and the lamb meat was tender.

Their frequent diner card and 15% off coupons show that they really value their customer.  Cool environment as well if you choose to dine in.

Try it!!  Fast but quality Greek food!!This was our favorite Vegas restaurant experience. It was cheap, and it was the best thai food I've had in the US (granted that I've only had thai food in a central PA college town). 

We first had fried dumplies, which had great presentation and tasted wonderful. The satay sauce that they added was particularly yummy. We then shared the payaya salad mild (thank you yelp reviewers!!!) and it was delicious and still very spicy. I had never had this dish before, and loved it.

Then, we shared Khua-Kai Rice Noodles. A giant portion of stir-fried noodles, chicken, egg, bean sprouts and green onions. All this served in a delicious slightly spicy sauce.

The place itself is very simple. About 6-8 tables, a flatscreen TV, one cook and one waitress. The place is so small that I kept wondering where they put their ingredients. 

The bill came, $20! We couldn't have been happier.One of the best, if not the best pad thai in Vegas. The soups are also very good.I keep exploring Chinatown lately and based on reviews decided to have a quick lunch at this establishment. 

It's probably the best Thai lunch special that I've got so far. I had yellow chicken curry and pork par ram. It was all good but I should probably order it spicier next time... my fault :). Total lunch cost with Thai ice tea (can never skip that) was $10 + tips.

I wonder what else am I going to discover in that area...Oh Man this place is amazing.

I was alittle skeptical about this place because it was called Thai Noodle house but they serve all sorts of curries and regular dishes as well. 

Highly recommend
Duck Fried Rice
Any of the Salmon Curry dishes in the Chef's specials section. 

we tried 4 dishes plus dessert and were blown away by the amount of flavor this place packed. would love to go again.Another place I visited in china town and happens to be my favorite one for pad Thai beef and chicken there duck soup is amazing.. Anything I have tried here has me coming back the girls are very helpful and nice I had to write a review will come eat there again ..We chose TENDER over the pricier steakhouses at the other end of the strip.  We were glad we did.  I went with hubby and my dad.  We're all 3 picky steak lovers. It was very quiet considering we were right off the casino floor.  Nice Morton's type atmosphere with very attentive wait staff. Started out with a round of drinks.  Loved the Manhattan and my dad said it was the best Long Island Iced Tea he'd had in awhile.  Hubby had some firewater kind of cocktail that was very spicy.  I had the baby lettuce salad, which was their twist on the standard wedge salad.  It was fantastic and much easier to eat than a wedge! Pops had a standard tossed salad that was a nice size. Hubby had hangar steak ($27) with a humongous baked potato.  Pops and I had the Omaha fillet ($40) and it melted in my mouth.  OMG best steak ever! We were too full for dessert.

Note that everything is ala carte, but they have prix fixe menus that were very reasonable for 3-4 courses.I recently recommended Mrs Whites to a couple of co-workers from the south, and I made a PROPHECY! I said, "don't eat this shit at work! You will go into a food coma and take the best nap of your life afterward!"

They didn't listen. And the food coma got them fired. Well it didn't, but they were so useless the rest of the day that they should have gone home anyways. 

Chicken that could drowned a baby with it's juiciness! OH SO GOOD! Red beans, rice and gravy that made my heart beg for mercy after my blood pressure shot up to like, a million over eight hundred thousand...in a good way though. If you've ever gotten the meat sweats, it's a similar feeling. You finish eating, completely satisfied and relaxed, and then THE FUCKING FEVER COMES!! I don't think your body can handle what just got absorbed through your intestines, so it flips out. I went into fight or flight mode, hard, and I didn't come down until I slept it off like a food drunk little baby. 

Like J.C.M. said, it hurt so good.This place was great. I love that it's mostly women! I brought in a used car, that I was thinking of buying, to be checked out and they were very thorough. And might I add that it is THE cleanest car shop that I've ever been in?! The waiting area was so awesome! Snacks, drinks, magazines, tv, art on the walls, toys for the kids! The bathrooms was spotless too lol. After the car was inspected the owner went over everything with me and put it in terms that I would understand (never having worked on cars myself). So thank you for that if you're reading this!Went here for dinner a few weeks ago. I was very pleasantly surprised. 

My bowl of bisque soup was absolutely delicious, my burger was perfect. I always judge a burger joint on their swiss/avocado burger and mine was perfection in a bun. Cooked to order and juices locked in. The ingredients were fresh and flavorful. 

Give it a try and you won't be disappointed. Will definitely have to visit again on my next trip out to Scottsdale!I took my girlfriend here for her birthday and we both loved the place. First thing you'll notice as you step in is the huge wine tower and the wine angels to retrieve the wine (pretty awesome mini-show!). The restaurant is elegant, as many Las Vegas establishments are, with a soft ambiance. 

Service was, for the most part, quick and attentive. We had a very cheerful waiter who took noticeable care with handling our orders. Our wine waiter was, however, a bit cold and emotionless in explaining how the wine selection worked. They give you an electronic tablet with an extensive wine list, allowing you to filter by many categories. 

The food is amazing. I started with the Peruvian ceviche, onion soup, oysters, and ahi tuna tartar. The ceviche was one of the best I've ever had,  with a nice tang. I loved the tuna tartar and the oysters, but wasn't crazy about the onion soup. For our entrees, we had grilled swordfish and alaskan halibut with a side of mashed potatoes with garlic. My swordfish was delicious, but her halibut was a bit salty. The potatoes was very good. Since we were stuffed, we declined dessert other than tea, but they rewarded us with a complimentary little dessert platter with assorted cakes. 

Overall, we loved this place and will definitely come back the next time we visit Vegas.We had amazing service and food.  By the reviews it looks like maybe the service has slipped?  Not for us.  Everyone knew our names; we had to wait a little while for our table even with reservations.  We were fine with waiting in the bar, they comp'd us some beverages, the food was amazing. Nice mix of inventive and classics so everyone at the table was happy.  We did the chef's tasting with wine pairing; didn't disappoint.  The wine fairy is sexy.  Charlie Palmer rules.Just returned and tried the new Parallel tasting menu!  WOWzeRs!  I was in ecstasy!  I love Foie Gras so the first course blew my mind.   Butternut squash for the second, yummers!   A little surf and turf with Australian Waygu!  can't go wrong... and lastly the dessert was out of this world!  New pastry chef I understand and holy moly, she's good!   Thank youDave S our bartender was absolutely the best!  Was the perfect host, and super professional.  The food was out of this world!!  Tiny sliders were the best tasting things ever!!
Onion soup... delish!  spring rolls.  Great timeUpon my arrival in Vegas my friends Jeffrey L and Clarisse C, suggested that we go to Earl's.  They usually know the best spots to eat, so I trusted their judgement for this.

I ordered the hawaiian bbq, and was completely in love with it!  I figured the bread might get soggy because of the sauce, but it wasn't at all!  The bread was tasty too, and very light.  I became quite the fan and made frequent visits here on my trip.

I tried the Caprese sandwich which is basically slices of mozzarella cheese and tomatoes.  This by far was my absolute favorite sandwich there.  The vinagerette was perfect with the melted cheese and the tomatoes were just perfect!  

Price was decent too, if you're on a budget for food in Vegas, I'd definitely suggest Earl's, there are plenty of choices to choose from, and you'll want to try just about everything on the menu!1+ for serving delicious hot sandwiches
1+ being open for 24 hours
1+ efficiency even with long lines
1+ satisfying portions
1+ offering free soup on the weekend I visited :) 

I had such a great visit here after reading about all the reviews. The sandwiches are all $5.99 and for a decent portion too. The sandwiches are reallyt good but the thing that sticks out most about it is the bread. Its soft like a ciabatta bread and just ties in all the flavors. I tried the Full Montague and it was soooooooooooooooooooooooo good. It had roast beef, turkey, cheddar, lettuce, tomatoes and though it sounds simple, the hot sandwich satisfies, ESPECIALLY for such a cheap price!

It was so good that I just HAD to come back 4am in the morning to grab another one for my bf to try back home. STILL delicious!If i lived in Vegas, I would be going to this place EVERYDAY! Best part is they're open 24 HOURS!!!

QUICK TIP: try the Carribean Jerk Chicken sandwich and the TUNA MELT!!!! sooo wonderful and flavorful... no need to describe them anymore.. just go taste them for yourself!Being a fan of Disney World, I frequent Disney message boards, and always heard chatter about the Downtown Disney location. Little did I know that this was a chain and they had one in Las Vegas, so I knew I had to try it out.

And I am so happy that I did. Such a seemingly simple little sandwich but it is packed with flavor. I went here three times on my three day trip to Vegas. Each time I got the Original 1762 and each time it was delicious. The sandwiches are a bit on the small side (for a big boy like me) but still mouthwateringly good. The beef on the sandwich was delicious, the horseradish sauce was the perfect accompaniment and the bread was soft, warm and delicious.  I really want to go back there now.For the price and location in Las Vegas this place can't be beat.  Nice sides, original sandwiches, HP steak sauce at every table... I average one sandwich for every day that I spend in Vegas.  Never had a bad one here.  If any place gets five stars in this town, it's Earl of Sandwich.24 Hours HOT SPOT for a quick fix sandwich. 

Each sandwich are made to order and Bake perfectly. Blow my taste-buds away. !

YOU MUST TRY THIS PLACE. =)If you want yummy and amazing hot sandwiches for a cheap price in Las Vegas, Earl of Sandwich is the place to be! 

I have been going to this joint every time I visit Las Vegas because the sandwiches here are one of the best I ever had! The last time we went to Earl of Sandwich, I had the Holiday Turkey Sandwich. That sandwich in itself got me full for only $6 and I was happily satisfied because it has so much flavor and everything you can look for in a Holiday Turkey Sandwich - oven-roasted turkey slices, cranberry sauce, stuffing, and mayonnaise. I love how my hungry appetite disappeared right away because of this sandwich and my other favorite, the Original 1762.

It's a very good thing they are open 24 hours, 7 days a week because in times where the hardcore munchies begin right after a night of club hopping, drinking, and dancing, I know that Earl of Sandwich will not disappoint.Almost 2000 reviews with a 4 1/2 star rating.......I thought hmmmm

Honestly, how good can a sandwich get???? 

IT is that good!!!! No words can explain its simplicity. Try the Earl's Club, bacon plus turkey and that mystery sauce equals heaven in your mouth..... or if you want a spicy kick to it get the Caribbean Jerk. 

Perfect for broke college students, and it is a total bargain on the strip!
For 6 dollars and fifty cents why go to Burger King or McDonalds and get a soggy burger with a fries and a drink, when you can go to Earl's of Sandwich and get a bite of heaven . 

And to top it all off they are open 24/7, I'd come here for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. 

This place is MUST, when it comes to places to try in Vegas!I love this place. Whenever I am in Vegas, I must get their earls original. The meat sauce bread cheese are perfect. They are open until 3AM and each sandwich is just 6 bucks... You can't beat that with a baseball bat.

Also try their brownie. De-lish.I love this place.  Best sandwiches I have ever had I think.  PH is not my favorite place to gamble or stay but as far as food goes it has my two favorite quick eats spots on the strip in Earl and YOLOs.  I would suggest going to Earls at least once per Vegas trip and trying a new sandwich each time because they are all amazing.  My favorite thing to do is grab a sandwich and then walk 30 feet to the PH sports book and watch a bunch of games while I eat but you can definitely take these to go or eat at Earl of Sandwich too (they also have 1 TV).When I stayed at Planet Hollywood a few weeks ago, I often dined here. Their sandwiches are the best I have ever had. You can tell how popular it is by the long, long lines that this place has. You can see the employees make your sandwiches are They give you a buzzer to let you know when your order is ready to be picked up at the counter. 

I've tried the Earl's Club, Chicken Chipotle Avocado, and the Chicken Bacon Avocado Wrap. My favorite is the Earl's Club (it's displayed on the huge board above the area where you place your order). They have salads, wraps, soups, side items (pasta salad, potato salad, chips, etc), and hot and cold sandwiches. I'd say stick with the hot sandwiches because you won't be able to get sandwiches like these. They wrapped them up in a paper foil that keeps it hot and warm for a long time. The sandwiches are so big that I always have to save the other half for later. 

What's another great perk about this place? There's FREE WIFI!

I can't wait to come back to Las Vegas. I will definitely frequent it whenever I'm in town.Had their chipotle avocado chicken sandwich and it was delicious! Best part of this place was that they are open 24/7 ( said one of the waitress at the casino). The place is located right outside a club too. So when your done clubbing you can just stroll right over and get some good food.Found this inside the Miracle Mile shops next to Planet Hollywood. Simply put the best meatball sub I've ever had. The bread was crisp outside, soft inside. Most places drown it in marinara making for a soggy sandwich.  There was the perfect amount. The meatballs were tender and tasty.  The cheese was gooey but not greasy. Awesome sandwich! It was crowded on a Saturday night but seating wasn't a problem. I got a pager to let me know when it would be ready and that only took a few minutes. If I'm in Vegas again I'll visit for sure.This place is one of my favorite things about Vegas!! It's open 24 hours which makes it even better! I've had a few different sandwiches, and each one has been good! The line can get long, but they're pretty quick.The tuna melt sandwich is delicious. I love this place!I am always a fan of their original sandwich. 

Although there is always a line, food comes out usually faster than what it seems like. 

It's just a very nice stop if you are in the middle of the strip (Planet Hollywood) and just trying to get something to eat so that you can go gamble or hang out.パンが温かくて、まわりはカリカリ、中はモチモチして独特の食感で美味しい。具もびっしり入っているので食べ応えあります。半分にカットされているので、シェアするのにもちょうど良い感じです。24時間営業しているようなのでカジノで遊び疲れて小腹が減ったときや朝食にピッタリです！Mmmmmm ..... 
That is all I said after a single bite of this luscious goodness that melts in your mouth with tons of flavornoids delivered straight to your palates! 
This is a must! Do come here at least once if you are in the area!
Chipotle Chicken is the one you want!
Montagu is alright...:/Great all you can eat menu! The chalkboard specials are delicious-brie quesadilla and tuna carpaccio.  A good variety of rolls here, we came here quite a few times for lunch. The quality of fish has been fresh and tasty every time we've gone.  They seem to have a good ratio going b/t sauce, fish, rice.  The garlic tuna is out of this world! 

AYCE includes dessert but one day they had limited choices for dessert as they ran out.  We got stuck with a homemade soy cheesecake-not to our liking.  They have a stamp card.  The place is small and can get busy.  Lot of parking though b/c it's in a strip mall. I think they're open until 12am but haven't been there in awhile.Our favorite sushi restaurant in all Vegas valley!!!!! Truly authenticate Japanese sushi place and no stinky customer service attitude. Sushi is of high quality, great casual atmosphere and great customer service plus the All-You-Can-Eat value is awesome! We love this place and wish we lived closer.My fiancee and I came here on the night of our engagement to celebrate.  Our server, the manager and the chef all came out to congratulate us.  The staff absolutely went out of their way to make us feel special and the food was excellent.  The experience was very memorable and made it an unforgettable night.we loved our meals.  Philadelphia native we were at a pass.  Who would have thought a gem in the middle of the mall.  I had veal parm was greeaattt and tender.  Lasagna pizza was too much to eat and the gnocchi was good.  Drinks were good and a great way to celebrate a friends b day away.   Overall great dinner for the value.We chose Trevi for our reception because we just fell in love with the space when we saw it.  We had checked out a couple of other venues in the Venetian and some other hotels, but we just could not stop talking about Trevi.  I am so glad with did!

We had 58 people at our dinner and we had the entire upstairs (mezzanine) to ourselves.  When you walked up the stairs you came upon the seating chart and guest book as well as the bar and some highboy tables for the cocktail hour which lasted about 45 minutes.  It gave everyone time to walk around, take pictures with the fountain out front, chit-chat with people and find their seats.  We had 4 round tables and 3 rectangular tables (1 being the head table) and they were placed by the windows and around the side.  The décor and everything was setup perfectly and the best part was I didn't have to do any of it!

They had 3 dinner menu choices and we went with the Veneto.  The shrimp cocktail and bruschetta appetizer were amazing; my bridesmaid ate all of the shrimp cocktail from the head table!  The salads were nicely proportioned and dressed, but the entrees...WOW.  I had the Linguine Al Frutti Di Mare (A seafood medley of lobster, shrimp, scallops, tomatoes and scallions in a seafood cream sauce) it was absolutely delicious.  I ate as much as I could and wished I could have eaten more.  We also went with the cheesecake for dessert because neither my husband nor I are big cake eaters and we love cheesecake, so it was perfect.  As for beverages, we had an open bar, but some of our guests wanted shots, which were not included.  They made it very easy for them to open a side tab and kept track of everything.  The servers were fantastic, they were great with drinks and the timing of food was perfect.

The best part about Trevi, other than the food, was the service before, during and after the event.  We only went there once and that was to view and choose the venue, otherwise we did all the planning from home in Phoenix, Arizona.  Michelle made it so easy and she was great with responding to emails and questions.  They let us use their easel for our posterboard seating chart and my parents were able to go the day before to take all the centerpieces and décor over for setup.  Overall, we could not have been happier with our choice and I will recommend Trevi to everyone getting married in Las Vegas.My family lives 5 minutes from Montana Meat Company and I'm so happy it is that convenient.  My daughter is in love with their breakfast and my my husband is in love with their burgers.  Living out in the southwest without many options, glad this is one of them!the shrimp scampi pasta is off the charts!!!! the oysters are delicious, very fresh!!!-best sushi in Vegas (other than sumo sushi in Henderson)
-new management has WONDERFUL wait staff....truly want to make you happy
-all you can eat has wide variety of menu items
-food was prompt
-kids under 3 ft tall eat free (like a roller coaster ride) 
-large fish tank good for kids and adults
-waiters were literally waiting about ten ft behind the table ready to accommodate our every request 
Sushi is amazing here and ruined all other sushi for me forever.  Ponzu sauce is a whole different level.  Joe special, something wrong 69, spicy salmon were favorites.First off - 6022 S. McClintock is apparently their address, although this is a little north of where Amados actually is.  Amados is on the west side of McClintock just a tad north of Guadalupe.  There's a sign out near the street, so it shouldn't be too hard to find.

So what is Amados?  A Mexican joint that's open 24/7 and seriously has some of the best Mexican food you can find.  The carne asada is so so so good, the chile relleno burrito is AWESOME (and I believe it's veggie-friendly for you vegetarian folks out there), their fish tacos are delicious...I could go on and on.  $8 will get you two carne asada burritos, which is a *lot* of food.  They also have a little condiment bar that has excellent red and green salsa, limes, cucumbers, jalapenos, and a bunch of other stuff you might be interested in.  There's a surprisingly decent amount of indoor seating, and there's a little bit of outdoor seating as well.

Amados is basically amazing - I seriously go here at least once a week.  One of the coolest parts is unlike Filiberto's and a bunch of the other taco shops nearby, a trip to Amados won't result in you spending the rest of your day sitting on a toilet.  I've been eating here for years and have yet to get even slightly sick from their food, which is impressive for a 24-hour taco shop.

One warning - late at night (meaning midnight and later), this place can get extremely shady and packed full of people you probably don't want to be around.  During daylight hours though, everything's always very mellow here.

And don't be worried if you don't speak Spanish - the staff here speaks excellent English and is very helpful.WOWOWOW! Holy crap, but this place is beyond awesome! Finally was able to try this place! I've been to swish and this place is soooooo much more better! All you can eat vegetables, need I say more?! I, like everyone else, love those tofu noodles. They are a little chewy, but no way near as chewy as udon noodles are. I love the fact that you can get shabu shabu broth AND sukiyaki broth! 

First off, the one lady who works there all by herself is just... I'm speechless. She works so hard. And she is so efficient! 

I got the Queen 1/2 beef and 1/2 scallops. Both soooo juicy and tender! I had to take advantage and ended up getting two orders of salad and veggies! Mmmm. Vegetables include napa cabbage, carrots, bamboo shoots, tofu, snow peas, and the tofu noodle. The bamboo shoots & snow peas were really delicious... never would have thought to use those! The real reason behind second order of veggies were for those tofu noodles!

The place is easy to find and very clean. And did I mention that service is friggin' great?! And the food is even better. I will definitely be visiting this little joint much more often now.

OH! And I forgot to mention you get a complimentary vanilla ice cream at the end of the meal! You get a choice of strawberry or chocolate syrup or green tea powder!Amazing. Costumes, Theatrics, Music, you name it, it was great.  really fun show.George. Paul. Ringo. John. The Fab FOUR. 

I am SO into symbolism, so when I counted four of everything, the symmetry gave me such a thrill. Four translucent screens. A stage with four entrances. Four roller-bladers to go up & down the ramp to "Help." Four gigantic balloons sporting their signature mop-top haircut. Four of everything to represent the four men whose talent provided the soundtrack to my parents' courtship & to my childhood.

Each song (many from the album "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band") comes alive with the acrobatics Cirque is known for mixed with modern dance moves (breakdancing, stepping, hip hop.) 

My favorite scenes are "A Day in the Life" with the break-apart VW Beetle & the Indian-inspired garb worn by FOUR women (suspended in air) in "Here Comes the Sun." 

I bought same-day tickets from a Tix4Tonight outpost for about $115 per ticket for Section 200. Wonderful seats, as much of the magic takes place in the air! Plus, you'll be glad for the further-back seats when the bed scene comes along! I wasn't born in the 60's or 70's, but my parents would blast their albums on weekend mornings & when we had kareoke parties. Ahhh, memories.I came here with a group of 5 people and we sat in a very comfortable room for cocktails away from the main dining room and bar. We ordered a bottle of tchxolina (sp?) and an order of sorbet. Our bill came to $44 and we sat for about an hour chit chatting.

Totally worth our bill. 

A live band came on at 10pm (it was a Saturday night) and the music was piped throughout the lounge. There seems to be an outdoor seating area too that has the potential for a rendezvous. 

I've been looking for a local place near Seven Hills that's got a bit of class and verve. This is it.
I'll definitely be back.Food was wonderful and the staff was very accommodating. Meals have big portions, best Spanish rice I've ever had, and the enchilada sauce was very good! Margaritas are nice and strong as well.

You can tell that this restaurant is well-managed, they go out of their way to make things right for the customer.Great place to tailgate!Oh wow!  Where do I begin?  This place was recommended to me by a Chinese brother who lives in LA.  He wasn't wrong.  Szechuan doesn't always mean spicy, although some of what they serve will peel the paint off the walls.  Heat without flavor is just an exercise in pain control.

Oh yes, there is heat aplenty, but there's also a deep flavor underlying the heat.  We started with the Yunnan noodle soup.  It was a clear broth, but very flavorful, and a good beginning to what came next.  At my Brother's recommendation, we ordered the boiled fish and beef in sauce (piquant), the Chongqing Spicy Chicken (it's a popcorn chicken style with deep fried chilis), and the green beans.  I was sweating by the time I was done, but what we took home was gone within 10 minutes of getting home by our son.

Oh yes, the place is only about the size of a postage stamp, and we had to sit at a round table with two other groups.  We were also the only ones in the place using English menus, if that tells you something.

I will not go to any other Chinese restaurant in Las Vegas again if I can help it.Love this place. Great Service, Great Food, and the atmosphere is always enjoyable. Try the Kobe Burger its the best! Great place to catch a game!Being Indian, and having grown up in London, I have been pretty spoilt for Indian food. Imagine my dismay when I moved to Phoenix! I've tried many different places here in town desperately trying to recapture the memory of a good London curry house but each time I've left either disappointed or clutching my guts fearing what may come.

Couple of friends introduced me to this place a few months ago and I'm stoked. It's not as good as the stuff back home. And I'm sure you can get better in San Francisco or New York. But if you are looking for something closer to home you can't go wrong.

Plus its got the real live Indians eating in there too. Can't be bad!!Just like LA and NYC - amazing. Great crunch rice tuna roll, and sparkling sake... a must eat....Excellent Thai!  This place is a small family owned and run little hole-in-the-wall and it is truly delicious!  The family is very cordial and the ambiance is very quaint and relaxing.  I had the Curry Puffs and the Crying Tiger Beef salad.  I can honestly say that of all of the Thai places that I have been to--and there have been many--their beef salad puts all of the others to shame.  It is filled with mounds of fresh, whole mint leaves, red onion, perfectly cooked beef in thin slices, and a lovely tangy dressing.  The curry puffs were little like little dried mini pastys with a yummy curry filling served with a refreshing red onion, chili and cucumber salad.  My boyfriend had the yellow curry with tofu, prepared spicy, and the tofu was cooked with precision.  To cool the heat, we enjoyed a tall glass of Thai iced tea.  I highly recommend this place above all other Thai places in the east valley.  I also love to support small business owners that take pride in their work just as this family does.  So I hope you give this place a shot and enjoy their delicious delights as much as I have!  If u go, check out the cute little Thai gifts when u walk in.  The Thai dolls are darling.I'm a connoisseur of Thai food. I have been to over 10 in the valley since I've moved here 10 months ago. This is by far in my top 3!! Excellent!! The pork satay was out of this world!This place is soooo delicious!!! And fun because you get to put together your own bowl. Fill it up as high as you can but don't let it overflow because they will only cook what is on the bowl. Service is amazing at this location, especially Alex-he's awesome!! Very helpful and friendly :) I highly recommend this place, you really get your money's worth!!!I absolutely love this hotel!  It definitely set my bar for what a hotel should be like, anything less makes me think it should be called a motel.  Lol!  Ok sounds bourgeois but seriously!  a living room, 3 flat screens throughout the suite, bathtub and shower, vanity area, separated toilet! soo gooood!Booked the Venetian.  Slipped the check in agent a $20 and voila, upgrade to the Palazzo.  Despite being further back the rooms were newer and nicer.  Second to the top floor had a great view.  The room was really spacious.  The decor was very modern but still warm and not sterile.  Definitely loved the huge sectional to kick back and lounge on.  If you have a large group, definitely consider staying in one of the suites here.

The walk between the Venetian and the Palazzo is quite long though.  

The pool was alright.  Their version of the pool club was pretty lame for a saturday in September.  We got in for free and were welcomed to a sausage fest.  Pass.  We grabbed a beer, took in the nice view, and then proceeded to leave the "club"  If the pool club vibe is your thing, definitely skip this place and walk on over to Tao Beach and be prepared to pay and or wait.

All in all a great stay.  

One big plus is that you can walk to Bouchon and the Bouchon Bakery!!If you're going to stay in Vegas, you might as well do it right especially when it comes your hotel. The Palazzo proved to be a stellar choice for our Girls' Weekend Getaway, and it made all the difference in the overall fun that we had. 

Our suite was as spacious as it was impressive. Decked out with a stand-up shower, huge separate tub, double sinks, our very own living room, comfy beds, a pull out sofa bed, dining table, desk area, telephone in the toilet area (also separate from the actual bathroom), two TVs (one in the bathroom, the other in the bedroom), electronic window shades, comfort and extravagance were not lacking. We were situated right on The Strip which made all the difference as we desired to be in the mix of everything and to walk, rather than cab it to our destinations.

So there you have it. The rooms are lovely. But what about the facilities and overall resort? Gaw-jus. The entrance is grand, the property is massive, and the staff is helpful and courteous. The Palazzo is an addition to The Venetian, another lovely hotel option. So lucky for us, a suite at the Palazzo granted us access to all of its 11 pools. And there really is a pool for everyone. Want to relax with the family? Want to lay out in some peace and quiet by your lonesome? Want to swim with your honey and get some jacuzzi action in? Want to people watch-- beautiful people at that? Want to strut your stuff, party or day drink? You get a pool! You get a pool! And you get a pool! Our group chose the best of both worlds and opted for both fun and relaxation. But the most memorable aspect when it came down some pool action was Tao Beach (review to follow).  Fun! Crazy crazy crazy fun! Great music, decent food, and overall everything that a Vegas pool party should be.

The restaurant options are plentiful and the shopping options are .... well... expensive. Reviews to follow on these too. The nightclub was fantastic too. Very different feel from the outdoor clubs we experienced the night before, but equally as good- if not better. We had an over-the-top great time. Best of all, it's right in the hotel so no mile walk in your high heels, ladies.

Lastly, I'm not the type of girl to gamble so the casino was my least favorite. Though large and updated, it wreaked of smoke and we didn't spend much time there. Also you have to walk through it to get around the property. Meh. I did like that they had phone chargers on some of the slot machines. Another way to keep you there longer, but very convenient.

Overall, the property was everything that we needed and more. Most rooms, like ours, offer a beautiful view if you are a few floors up. And most likely if you get in early enough and ask for one, you shall receive. Of course there are lots of places to choose from when it comes to hotels, but this is a solid choice for a weekend getaway. I'd definitely stay here again.When you have a great server it makes the whole experience better. Ben was our server he was very knowledgeable about the menu and extremely nice and friendly. The food was delicious. We started with fried calamari, lobster bisque and had the wild salmon - fabulous.  It's a great evening.This is the kind of place everyone needs to support. Good selection fair prices and sell some nice extras like sleeves for old 78s. Looks, feels and smells like a record store from the moment you walk in. I'm happy to actually buy music from this company as they do things right.My husband and I had a wonderful dining experience yesterday. We were there around 7:45 and were seated right away. We asked our server for suggestion, had a glass of wine, a beer, an Italian stallion pizza and the ravioli entree. The ravioli was amazing, and the pizza was great, the meat was a little salty, but as to be expected :-)

We will for sure be coming back and bringing guests as well!Best pizza in Vegas...hands down!  I was born and raised in Chicago, and in the 9 years I've lived in Vegas, I've done a lot of complaining about the absence of a good Chicago pizza joint.  But NO MORE!  This place is it!  I'm always greeted and treated like family.  Everyone in there is extremely hospitable, and the service is impeccable.  Plus, the place is always filled with actual Chicago natives....so you know it's the real deal!  I've had both the deep dish and the thin crust, and they nailed 'em both!  The atmosphere is very lively and relaxed.  You'll even find the owner mingling with the guests and chatting about back home.  I recommend this place to everyone.  In fact, I'll be bringing a bunch of my friends there to show them what Chicago pizza is really all about!Everything is excellent every time! No matter how busy or quiet the restaurant is, the quality is consistent.

My wife, a native New Yorker, never liked deep dish pizza until Amore's! Now she loves it.

The chicken dishes are delicious, the Italian cuisine is excellent, and the deep dish beats even native Giordano's or Lou's! It is just great.

Combine the great food with great prices, amazing specials (a full rack of ribs on Wednesdays around $ 12!), and the best service... Amore's is well worth the drive from Henderson (or any other part of the valley)!This place has the best quiche ever!  It's one of those flavors that makes you crave it and is very hard to find.  It's very light and fluffy and doesn't sit in your stomach after you eat.  Service was great and it's very reasonably priced.It's the best pizza in Las Vegas. Not sure what else you need to know.Best BBQ in the Valley!!  Been going to Lucille's since it opened.  I love the pulled pork sandwich and the BBQ chicken salad. We went last weekend for my birthday after we had a bad experience at Notorious P.I.G. in N Phoenix (terrible).  We ordered the super feast.  OMG.  It was $200 but could have fed close to 15 people.  We had nine.  It came with a large salad, biscuits and apple butter, 3 slabs of ribs, 2 whole chickens cut, 2 lbs of different meat options (we got 2 lbs of pulled pork and 2 lbs of tri tip (so delicious - my new fav), 6 sides (huge servings of sweet potatoes, cole slaw, fries, sp fries, corn on the cob and  mac and cheese) and we got sundaes for our birthday.  Everything was amazing and we had a ton of leftovers, probably a slab of ribs, a whole chicken, 4 corn on the bo halves, a quart of sweet potatoes, slaw and mac and cheese, pulled pork and tri tip.

I highly recommend this place to anyone.  I have yet to have anything I would not order again.  I would definitely recommend the trip tip and pulled pork.  The ribs are fall off the bone delicious.

You will not be disappointed.Stellar burger place I have been going to since the 80's in LA

It is really pleasing to me that one of the restaurants I loved as a child, is now a chain going stronger than ever.

We are beyond fortunate to have one of them here in LV.

This place has consistently served amazing food, had a great if corny atmosphere, great service at every location, this one included.

There burgers are exceptional, and huge.  The point break, bleunami, and kilauea are spectacular.

The tacos and salads are pretty good here too, as well as their famous french fries.

This is one of those relaxing places that is not probably going to win any awards, but it is a consistently awesome meal, in a really friendly comfortable setting.

They offer a happy hour every other day 4-7 with certain appetizers half price, and they are large.Awesome,place !! Lunch was awesome and excellent service. Had a burger and it was cooked perfectly. Will be back soon.Seven of us went to this Buffet.  All of us liked the food.  Everyone found food they liked.  We really liked the sushi.  My daughter ate tons of the sushi it was very fresh.    The desserts were great.  My kids really liked having cotton candy.This man is ridiculously talented. I really enjoyed this show, and thought it was a great deal for the price. He is funny, intelligent, and a great singer.My girl Vanessa & I were in the mood for sushi Saturday night & we decided that Roka Akor was going to be our destination! 

I loved the modern look of everything about this place, from the dim lighting to the stylish furnishings. I can't believe we never checked out the bathrooms though, 2 girls sipping drinks & no restroom trip? Boo us! 

We opted to sit at the bar & took 2 seats facing the restaurant. I started off with a Kirin light ($5 for a 12 oz bottle) & V got a glass of white wine. Off of the Izakaya (aka happy hour) menu we ordered: the Kobe beef & Kimchi dumplings (3 pieces for $5), their signature Hamachi Serrano Chili roll (6 pieces for $5), their signature Butterfish Tataki (3 pieces for $5) & the Cremini mushroom with soy garlic butter skewer (3 pieces for $2). Loved them all except the roll, I guess we are wimps because we thought it was too hot. I hate doing so but V sent it back, they were cool about it & didn't charge us for it. Disappointed with our sushi (the main reason for going out!), we decided to try a couple other rolls off of the regular menu. We ordered the Spicy tuna & their signature Soft Shell crab rolls. The tuna was delicious but we've both had better else where. I thought the soft shell was ok but V hated it, the warm crab just rubbed her the wrong way I guess. She wanted to return that roll as well but I stopped her, I felt bad! Still feeling hungry, (we must sound like major fatties w/all the food we ordered but I swear, small portions!) we couldn't resist & ordered the Prime beef filet w/chili ginger sauce (medium rare). OH EM GEE!!! This was definitely the favorite of the night, it was so tender it melted in our mouths! The sauce was tasty as well. Oh & we also shared their signature Blood orange margarita, one of the best cocktails I've had in a while! 

With all that food & drink our total came to about $100 (including tip), not bad at all for the location & quality of food. So our dinner didn't go exactly as planned but we had a great time & would definitely come back again, just not for the sushi!Saw Mac King and had great seats! Show and venue was great.Today was my first time ordering from there, the staff was very friendly and accommodating, the food took a little long because it was made fresh and it tasted amazing. Five thumbs up!!!!Love affair baked roll my favorite as well as Asian skirt sizzling plate. All you can eat is $26 and it is all delish. Don't forget you can order appetizers and dessert with all you can eat! Oh and large cold saki is enormous! Good for a few peopleSandwich & a beer. Works for me.What an unbelievable night we had at Mastro's City Hall Steakhouse. Everything we ate was top notch, the atmosphere is fun, and the service is spectacular. How many steakhouses play Jim Croce, Beatles, and Beach Boys? It's a very welcome change.

It's dark, it's sexy, and it's probably the best steakhouse in Arizona. 

The seafood tower featured totally fresh and delicious oysters, crab legs, claws, and huge shrimp. My Kansas City Strip was out of this world and probably the best piece of meat I've had all year. Gorgonzola mac & cheese and sauteed mushrooms were real winners as well. I'm not a dessert person, but the warm butter cake should be illegal it's so good. I was stuffed already when it came to the table, and then I ate all of it. 

The only hiccup all night was our seafood tower was short a shrimp, and when I told the waiter don't worry about it he said ok, and then proceeded to bring us a fourth shrimp on it's own bed of ice. It was a really top notch recovery. This place is absolutely amazing.Absolutely fantastic! 
This place has the ambiance, live music, service, and delicious food.
This place is super fancy and expensive. Our bill with tip was $205!

The bread basket they give you in the beginning is soooo good. Imported pretzels?!? common.. tasted soooo fresh. they also had baguettes of some sort and a few other varieties of bread.. all imported of course. and all tasted wonderful. 

Dinner for two consisted of
1 framboise martini which was $18. Strong enough that you only need just one. I dont remember what kind of red wine my friend had ordered but it was about the same price (on a side note the waitress knew the wine menu pretty much inside and out and suggested different pairings).

For our entrées, I ordered the Chilean sea bass and I believe he ordered the new york strip steak, both were about $40.  We should have swapped dishes as he liked my sea bass better as I liked his steak better. Both were cooked to perfection. The meat was tender and buttery - melted in your mouth. The fish was flaky and fresh. This place only comes with entrées sides are all additional. 

If you are ever there, you must try the lobster mashed potatoes!! The best buttery velvety smooth mashed potatoes ever! Which chunks of lobster in it!!! hah, and get this. it was$33. .absolutely ridiculous but soooo worth it.  

The bar is amazing, full bar with top shelf choices.
Live band in the corner ..but they were kinda play country-ish music.
The place is dark.. with separate bar seating. and I didn't know at the time as I was in the area visiting but this is a dressy ... dress up place lol
just fyiBone-in ribeye was everything that I dreamed of and more. Everything was so superb, that I'm drooling at the memory of it. Yes, I dined here over 2 months ago and am just now getting to the review but damn...that was a memorable steak. Medium-rare mouthwatering insanity in my mouth!!!! Probably could have done without the sides -- too much food and didn't hold a candle to the steak (mac n cheese was overkill and the spinach was too salty). Just stick with the steak folks and you won't be disappointed. Loved the al fresco seating...I don't think I've ever been to a fine-dining steakhouse with outdoor seating, so that was a really nice change. Oh and best bread tray ever.Great patio for dinner. A hidden gem of maestro's.Yes, its pricey but so worth every bit of it.  
rack of lamb is amazing.  never do I eat lamb but I have the last four times I went.  
Fabulous martinis and great oyster selections.  Be sure to tell them no pepper on the Oysters...why they do that, who knows but they do.  Good oysters need no spices.
Its really not a place for children but my 5 year old enjoyed it.The customer service is as wonderful as the cupcakes! I have driven by the place several times in the past but have never stopped in until today. I wanted to pick up something special for myself for my birthday today. I pulled into the parking lot and found that the place had closed 20min prior to my arrival. I was so disappointed. Then suddenly, one of the workers came to the cafe side, unlocked the door, and let me come in. They were so kind. I was able to get 2 very delicious cupcakes, packaged beautifully! Thank you!I thought I knew what good Thai food was until I came here.

A friend recommended we have dinner here as he loves this place. I just gotten out of Pilates class and wanted to eat something "healthy." To which Thai food, is as healthy as can be these days.

He had gotten the pad-see-ew; and I got their Pin Kaow specialty catfish. Again, I wanted to stick to fish for the "healthy" part of my meal.

The workers were extremely friendly considering the dinner rush was in full tow. 

While waiting on the entrees, I sipped on my thai ice tea to which I really REALLY liked. It wasn't as sweet as most places do it which is allllllllllllll good to me.

Our food came; and let me tell you that the pad-see-ew was the best I've ever had. Not greasy, lots of flavor (not fat), and lots of veggies.

The catfish came out and; to be quite honest, I didn't know what I expected but, it was the BEST THING EVER! I think it was WHOLE catfish oil fried (not to be mistaken with deep fried IN hot oil) and covered with lots of veggies and sauce. OHHHHHHHH, that sauce. It was the 1st time my friend had had it and he loved it, as well.
The portions wer so large, I wound up taking the leftovers to my boyfriends where he and his roomies loved the fish, too!


Since discovering Pin Kaow, I, literally, came here every day for a whole week to eat the pad-see-ew. I would eat the catfish but, that's something I wouldn't be able to finish on my own.This place is simply fantastic. This is my whole family's #1 choice on any given night.  That's because every single item here is delicious, the prices are reasonable, the atmosphere is lively, and the staff are great. The drinks selection is amazing, too, with a station set up with a variety of flavors you can add, and "specialty" drinks like horchata and fresh lemonades.  My brother obsesses over the specials over the day, but on just about ANY given day I'm craving the Pork Barbacoa Salad.

You know the place is good because at ANY time of the day, the place is almost full.

Seriously one of the best casual dining options in Vegas.Fine dining Mexican! Love the pomegranate mojitos and the complimentary warm, fire roasted salsa. Highly recommends the fish tacos with cilantro-lime rice and black bean dip as side dishes. 

Very friendly towards kids with a big kid and small kid menu.The Bellagio does a great job with their garden. I visited it in February when it was all decked out for the Chinese New Year. Huge golden statutes of Chinese gods, a fake Chinese junk boat and gazebo, traditional Chinese garden with bushed shaped like rabbits to celebrate the Year of the Hare. We loved walking around admiring the gorgeous flowers amazingly all in bloom at once. It was free too!An oasis in Vegas.  It's always crowded!  Words can't describe my feeling, so I won't try.  I'll write more about this when I have more words for this.  Sorry.I have to start out that this is one of my favorite bars..  I am just sick of all the other places I go and there is crappy bar food.  Its all greasy and tastes the same.  

The food at BJs always tastes great and they are always changing up there menu.  I never have a dish here that looks like all grease.  The drinks are always great and I love the staff.  If you are looking for a great local place look know further.This place opened was giving out like $5 and $10 coupons if you spent like NO money, man, did that save me a huge amount of cash when they were doing that. Who wouldn't go to Fresh and Easy?!

At this location they had a Wachovia ATM next to one of their windows. Someone one late night about 4- 6 months in, backed their truck in the window and dragged that mofo out of there. But how? That isn't like some intersection that has nobody there? It is on Eastern Avenue and Warm Springs - They should build a donut shop there - cops are there ALL THE TIME. I don't know if the crime was ever solved, but I thought it was kind of humorous that they put that ATM next to the window.We took a cheap cab ride to Buffalo Wild Wings or B-Dubs as the locals call it.. It is kind of far from The Strip and not worth walking to unless you are that bored.  The great thing about B-Dubs are the sauces!  They have about 20 different flavors!  We ordered 24 Boneless Wings in Spicy Garlic and Medium Hot, Buffalo Chips, Fried Garlic Shrooms and some Fat Tires to drink.  It was waaaay too much food for two drunk people!  My favorite thing that we ordered were the Buffalo Chips!  They are not crispy but more like fries cut into little pieces of chip-like heaven.  Our bartender was really nice and made some great suggestions.  She was also from the Yay Area!  Our meal was really cheap too!  Another reason to hit up B-Dubs on your next trip to Vegas!We went to Buffalo Wild Wing on Tuesday because of there $.50 cent special and I LOVE this place! It was somewhat already busy during lunch time but was seated rather quickly. Our service was just okay but the food was amazing. I ordered the Spicy Garlic and Hot flavor (which wasn't that hot) and they were perfect! I am definitely gonna start going to the BWW here in Honolulu and can't wait. :)Just moved to the Arcadia area and I'm originally from Chicago.  It is so amazing to have Chicago food right around the corner. Everything is delicious and the prices could not be better!one of the best shows at the casino with black uhuru!!!!!!!!
hotel is 5 star plus!!!!Its about spending money and time where you want to be. I'm really brutal with the places that I visit often and spend money. Try and always spend money at local family eats because if they are a chain they really don't care about you.

When you walk in you get good energy right away. And the UTL was built out with the customer in mind not with the flow of traffic. From where you sit inside you have a complete view of everything. The teas, deserts, kitchen and staff.  None of this, what is happening in the kitchen everything is transparent. 

I've tried to eat everything on the Menu even stuff I know I won't like. Everyone is not created equal in the kitchen and the cook proves it. The owner has enough insight to know the kitchen is the cooks domain. As I've been a cook before this is very important to have the peace of mind that I'm in my cooking groove I love to cook and I love this food. When I taste the food that is what I get from the Urban Tea Loft.Great mallSo bummed to see that RUB is gone. Got drawn in by the cool bike.
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zKC3gRFQ8eRU8oRXENAEaA?select=ed8NbVr26_qtR-MXHyYTUg#ed8NbVr26_qtR-MXHyYTUg

Righteous Urban BBQ had the best Burnt Ends I have ever eaten. PERIOD!

I came here to the Rio a couple years ago for work and had to stay for several days. Day 1 RUB, server pointed out the Burnt ends. Game on Guinness and a plate full of BE's. I crashed out after that meal.  Line at seafood buffet way too long. Go to RUB and have another delicious meal of BE's and onion strings and more craft beer. Night #3 went back for some more, of those orgasmic ends.

RIP RUB!Kenny is the best colorist and we always have a good time while I'm in his chair. Whether I'm going red or dark or doing some serious highlighting, he always gets it right!One of my top favorite places to be in Vegas.  Extremely beautiful gardens and nostalgic museums.  The art and architecture is impressive and the staff has always been friendly.  The annual membership is completely worth it as the park changes with the seasons...and the festivals are always fun!  Perfect place for any age with or without kids!Been here a few times, and I've had a great time every time. It's peaceful, pretty, interesting, and fun. I absolutely love the animal shows, and the backstage pass to hold the animals is worth it ($10).  I love that they have so many activities for the kids. 

The gardens are very nice, a welcome splash of color in this ocean of brown, brown and more brown. It does seem family-oriented, but it can be romantic to stroll around and take pictures. Love the cafe, too- we only ate there once, but the prices were reasonable for the quality of food. We'll be returning often, as we got the membership.State museum is included in the admission price; good for kids; Christmas event is fun too!Great family-friendly attraction in Las Vegas that is educational and provides a lot of variety with it's seasonal festivals.  I'm a member and continue to enjoy it year-round with the kids.Title really does say it all. Easy parking, easy shopping and fresh food. I love coming into this location as it is on my way home coming down baseline. This store is not mention for you to go full on grocery shopping as they are too expensive. Now they are open 24hours which is even better. I just wish those prices would drop a bit.This review is long overdue.  I went here with 7 of my family members last May after I graduated.  We wanted to go to a place where everyone would have options and that wouldn't be too busy.  I'm so happy we went here!

It's an adorable place and they had no problems accommodating our large party.  They answered any questions we had quickly and kindly, refilled waters in a timely manner, and the food (for a larger party) didn't take too long.

Everyone really enjoyed their meals!  I think 3 of my grandparents (I had two sets there!) went with the Liliana Burger, my other grandma had the chicken salad po'boy, my mom and brother had the salmon, my dad had the etoufee, and I had the Vegan Seitan (which doesn't appear to be on the menu anymore, but they do have other vegan items).  I was so, so pleased with the seitan.  It was tender, flavorful, and came with perfectly seasoned vegetables and mashed sweet potatoes.  Everyone else LOVED their items too - seriously, they were raving.  Both of my grandpas (who are the silent-steady types, and use words rarely and efficiently) said I made a "good choice" for my post-graduation dinner.

I don't live in Madison anymore, but when I come back for visits, Liliana's is high on my list for places to revisit!

UPDATE 6/11/14: GUYS they have a new vegan/vegetarian menu and it looks BOMB.   Their seitan that I loved so much is back on the menu, along with several other extremely tempting dishes that I will be trying ASAP when I'm back in MadtownI've only been here once, but they had me at delicious and complementary corn bread and sweet butter. 

The Jambalaya is definitely the thing to order here - there are few things in life I regret  not having done, and not ordering this might be one of them.  Fortunately, my husband did order it and I got a chance to slowly devour the enormous shrimp, sausage, and seasoned rice in one bite before he took his plate back.

They make their own sweet potato chips as a side. 

Friendly wait staff, and it's a good place to take children.  We don't come to Fitchburg that often, but we might be back again for Liliana's.From NYC and I am kind of a harsh critic to restaurants outside my home town, but munchies has the best chicken shwarma in Arizona... Maybe the world!  Something special about this place, from the small business feel to the owners making you feel at home. 

5.95 daily special! I'm talking delicious food and the best deal in town. Really want them to bring their delicious meals to NY. 

Best restaurant in Tempe hands down. Sit down, order the daily special, and enjoy the Munchies experience.Visited Spur Cross Ranch Conservation Area on a beautiful February Saturday afternoon. This area truly showcases the spectacularness of the Sonoran Desert! Several well marked trails to choose from - depending on how long you intend to hike. We chose to do the Spur Cross trail and turn around after about 1.5 miles since we were with two kids (ages 6 and 9). It wasn't too difficult since we didn't hike all that far. 

At the beginning of the trail, there is a box to pay ($3 for adults, free for kids 15 and under) as well as nice 11x14 maps of the area. Signage is great, and everything well marked. There are porta potties available and some shaded picnic benches. We saw some two wild burros (so neat!!), mom & baby, right in the parking lot. 

We enjoyed checking out Cave Creek that was flowing. There was a nice little "bridge" to cross the creek, so no boulder hopping required unless you were so inclined.

Huge abundance of cacti and interesting desert landscape - volcanic rocks, limestone outcroppings, washes, etc. Great photo opportunities in this spectacular place. Can't wait to go back and hike the rest of the trails!Best lunch value in Las Vegas. You are served chips and 3 different dips (bean, salsa and avocado). Then out comes Fideo soup. You get to choose 2 items (Tacos - crispy or soft shell, Burritos or Chili Relleno). The meat can be beef (shredded or ground), pork or chicken. You also get a Margarita included with your lunch. Since I have to return to work, I always ask for a Virgin Strawberry Margarita. One of my favorite place to eat!Second large group experience here.

Out with a party of 10 at 8pm Saturday night looking for dinner and drinks.  After being told it would be a long wait at R&R, we walked to Saddle Ranch.  They said 30 minutes to get us a table for 10... but volunteered that since we had a wait, they would set us up at the bar and the first round is on the house. (!!!)

The wait was probably a little longer than 30 minutes, but the bartender made great drinks, food and prices were good, and our server brought us a round of after-dinner shots, again, on the house.  

I was especially pleased because this is the second time I've come with a large group on the weekend and we were treated really well at Saddle Ranch - that is why I direct all my large groups here.  Cheers to the manager for taking care of us and earning our loyalty.


EDIT: 
If you're out on a weekend night looking for a good value for a drink, the AMF is the house specialty.  $13 for a carafe (guessing 32 ounces) of a coconut-flavored long island.

If you ride the bull as a guy, the operator tries to throw you as quickly as possible.  For girls, however, they go pretty easy on you.Came here one hot September day. Dogs allowed!! BIG BONUS FOR ME! I have two pitbulls and one mixed saluki breed-- and i brought 2 dogs that day.. everyone loved them..

My friends and i watched the game here with our dogs, friendly staff, friendly patrons. Food looked good (i didnt eat anything) a bit pricey though..

I would come back when i have more money (and i do live pretty far, 40 miles, from here)

oh wellsie..Food:
We started with the caprese salad. It was amazing. They served fresh, local heirloom tomatoes with creamy burrata cheese. 4 large slices and one generous portion of cheese.
Then we had 2 pastas. One was the crab and jalapeno black fettucine. The sweetness of the crab blended perfectly with the spicy jalapeno. The fettucine was also cooked perfectly al dente. The other was the duck liver ravioli (4 big pieces in small order). The best part was aged balsamic vinegar that they drizzled over the ravioli that balanced the heaviness of the liver. The best pastas we have ever had in our lives (even in Italy)
We ordered the ribeye that was shared by 2 ($65 each person). They serve it tableside, cutting the bone off first and then slicing different parts of the ribeye and portioning it out so that each person has the same amount of different cuts of the ribeye. It was perfectly cooked and the flavor was amazing. They did drizzle some olive oil on the ribeye, which I didn't think was necessary. I would have preferred some more vinegar on the side since the ribeye was so rich and fatty.

Service:
I was really high maintenance and they were excellent. First, I'm not a fan of rosemary and they had served rosemary rolls. I asked if there were other types, and they checked in on it for me. The manager came by and asked what was wrong and explained my options (which was not much - just crostini that was pre-cooked and not warm). I said that was fine and my waiter came by later to also check in on my satisfaction with the crostini.
Then, I had ordered a glass of wine with the ribeye. My waiter opened a new bottle for me and poured a tasting. I unexpectedly thought it was too light for the ribeye and said "I guess it'll be ok". The waiter took notice of my response and offered a glass of another wine instead. He then poured a sample of a heavier wine which matched much better with the ribeye. After I approved of the new wine, he poured me a glass of this new wine.

All in all, this was an excellent restaurant. I wish it was cheaper, but the food was worth the cost. 

One note: the prix-fixe pre-theater menus are only available at certain times (for example, being seated before 6:30). Although we were actually dining before a show, our reservation was at 7 (for a show at 9:30) so the prix fixe dinner was not available. We're actually glad it wasn't because we wouldn't have had a chance to try the excellent dishes we ended up ordering.Wow, amazing steak, amazing pasta. Classy ambience. Great for celebrations and groups. It's pricey but it's worth it. Get the porterhouse to share with the table - the presentation is great. Batali never disappoints!Free wifi, large selection of quality tea and coffee, very reasonable prices, great atmosphere.Best place ever! Ever since i started going to pink polish, I haven't gone anywhere else! I always leave happy and my nails always look perfect! Highly recommended!!I love Black Bear! We were stuffed on our cinnamon roll french toast, eggs, bacon, biscuits & gravy, and pancakes, on our platters, not plates. The service is always great, fast, efficient & the food is amazing. You just might want to share a platter. I always want to roll myself out of there after I'm done cleaning my plate.This is my favorite "go to" place for breakfast. The pancakes rock and the coffee is frag and hot. Love the atmosphere. Come so often, they know or name, especially Bob.  LOLWhile I don't really buy a whole lot from here, I love walking the aisles of bulk goods.  They are very reasonably priced, especially when it comes to food.  A huge bag of spinach for three bucks?!  A large container of organic raspberries for around four dollars!?  Yes please!  Also, we have a kitty with asthma and the vet told me that her prescription would be around $60-$70.  Well, my deal-finding spidey senses told me otherwise, and I stopped at the pharmacy and found that it was only $27 there. Win!  I also make good use of my Costco membership at the pump, because while other gas stations are advertising gas at over three dollars a gallon, I was pumping for $2.99/gal.  I like that they have more than just food and house supplies, they have electronics, a photo developing department, movies/dvds/blue ray, books, flowers, personal hygiene items, perfumes, a cafeteria, pet supplies, and more.I Wandered into Bikram Yoga Avondale while visiting my parents for the Thanksgiving holiday weekend from LA., and practiced there almost everyday of my trip.

It's a great studio, it's clean and bright. The folks there were super-friendly. It had a great vibe. I got the feeling that there was a good sense of community there. The sun came glaring into the side of the room one day (through a screened window) it wasn't horrible, but some people started shifting around. Didn't bother me, but made me think of what that place could get like in the summer months.

The instructors and staff were amazing. I'm happy I found this place. It will definitely be my go-to while visiting. Thank you and see you during Christmas.great restaurant the food and service couldn't be betterI love this place. Great happy hour drinks and food. Last night was my 3rd visit. Went and saw Sex in The City 2 and after we brought our ticket stub in and had free open bar for an hour!!!
It is usually very crowded and loud but thats to be expected with a good club. Great place to take visitors b4 hitting the major clubs.one of my favorite sushi joints in this town. i even like this place after going on a disastrous date there with a girl i considered to be the girl of my dreams, so that should say something!I read a review online that talked about Lobster Pot Pie, so when i made reservations I had my heart set on it.  I glanced at the menu and was disapointed to see that it wasn't on the menu.  I asked the hostess who said it had not been on the menu for quite some time.  

Just as I was about to see what my back-up dish would be the hostess offered to ask the chef if they would make it for me.  i was thrilled when she said they would be happy to make the exception.  Made my reservation and came back later that night to a wonderful meal!  Service was great, nice atmospher, and the food was to die for.  Polished off with coconut cheese cake.  Yum!  Will go back on my next vegas trip and try other dishes (on the menu this time).I celebrated my 42 birthday here in September 2013, it was my best bash yet, all my friends had a grand time in a private room with great bottle service! I will be back!By far the best asian market in the entire valley! I first discovered Lee Lee's tempe location and was so happy when they opened this location in the west valley.  Amazing selection from produce, meats, and asian. The staff is super nice. Never have had a poor experience in all the years. Shelves are clean and organized.  Prices are great too.Pearl is an anomaly in Scottsdale- a reasonably-priced quality bar/sushi place that doesn't discriminate.  I can head here for a pre-bar on Saturday night and feel fine, and I can even come here in jeans and a t-shirt for happy hour and not feel out of place.

The Sushi menu isn't the most extravagant- no varieties of fish or shellfish that you can't find elsewhere- but what they do, they do well.

The drinks?  $5 Sake Bombers.  All I need with my rolls is an "Asahi and Cold, please".  Apparently the Martinis and Bombers are big crowd favorites, but I can't testify to that.

The sevrice?  Not fast.  If you're coming in at 5:00 and trying to get a roll and a beer before heading to a 5:30 show at Fashion Square, you're probably not going to make it.  Personally, I don't understand when I'm sitting next to someone at the rail ordering a dragon roll and a martini while constantly looking at his or her watch while griping about the time.  You want something from the sea in a hurry?  Go eat a Filet-'o'-Fish.  I like to relax and savor, and Pearl is comforatble enough that I can do that.

Prices?  Best I've seen for Sushi.  Their "always happy hour" promotion is great- I can walk in with a friend, have a couple beers and sake, split a few rolls, and walk out full and content for under $60... for BOTH of us.  That's amazing.  On Sundays, they actually have even more promotions, where they let you roll dice for even more off your bill.

I highly suggest Sunday or early weeknights if you're exploring it for the first time.  Weekend evenings can get tight for seating.

Pearl isn't the end-all, be-all of Japanese cuisine.  It's Pearl, and that's fine by me.Tried the wings last night, pretty good but I am not much of a wings fan. Pizza was delicious as usual & the cannolis leave us wishing we ordered more.

I think it should be made more clear that the 15% off is for 1st time customers only. Before I placed my order online I called to ask what code I use to get the 15% off & the guy on the phone informed me that it was a 1 time deal. He did however give me a code for $5 off a $30 purchase. When I entered in the code it gave me $15 off! Was that a mistake? Not sure but I got a 16" pizza w/pepperoni, 12 wings, 2 extra ranches, a 2 liter of Sierra Mist & 2 cannolis, plus tax, delivery fee & tip for under $20. Amazing deal!Two words, service is awesome. Now I know that is three words but I don't even give a care. That's right, give a care. Employees from produce to deli to butcher to cashier are awesome and helpful. Thank you Adrian, Peter, and to all others that I rudely don't remember your name. You are all amazing.Thank you Dan and Michael in the cooked food department for your amazing customer service!I absolutely love Cafe Rio. You really can't go wrong with any item on the menu. I usually get the chicken enchiladas or the chicken tacos with the homemade corn tortillas. Their prices are reasonable, they give you a lot of food, and they are fast. I try to make it here every time I'm back in Vegas.This location at Tempe Marketplace has to be the best one yet. For starters the large amounts of parking available. The convenience of the mixture of the eye candy at midweek lunch time (ASU hot girls and business suited short skirted hot heeled women!) Oh yeah and the food!

I thought to myself what am I going to eat on my high protein diet? Mexican? Nope mexican't too much carbs, but wait my carb watching protein eating calorie counting friends. The Chipotle salad is our salvation of eating with out looking like boring dieter. 

The chicken salad bowl with no rice, beans, pico and salsa is perfect! Top it off with a little bit of lemon juice and you got a great healthy lunch and with a water you got it all for under $7. Yes my friends we can eat, healthy, cheap and good. 

For a "fast food" like place they have a nice open kitchen that you can see, I like that they don't hide it from you and you can see how clean it is.I like FD's a lot, and particularly this location.  We generally eat in a booth in the bar, which is a bit more peaceful and private than out in the restaurant area.  Service has always been attentive and friendly.  Love the ribs, and they have particularly good sides, other than the half-ear of corn, which tastes frozen, boiled, bland, and crummy.  And Brak LOVES his corn.  The cornbread redeems however, it's excellent.  They also have great cole slaw and potato salad.  FD's registers a solid 4.75 stars on the Brak-o-meter, 1/4 star deducted for the crappy corn.I had a great visit at Johnny Rockets! Our burgers were tasty, while the fries were crispy. our server made sure to handle all our needs, and The staff was all very attentive while working. We enjoyed the staff dancing so much, and we received ketchup faces with our meal!! We will sure be back for a fun visit!Stopped by with a craving for shawarma and was served amazing beef shawarma, great falafels, and the best baklava I've ever had by the extremely friendly owner. I'll definitely be coming back for more! I regret not buying some of the baklava to go, but that gives me something to look forward to next time.The best orange chicken I've had in Az! 
The red chili peppers are the secret :D 
But not to worry, the dish itself is not spicy (in my opinion). I would like it even more if it were, lol. 

Everything about this place is awesome; food, service, prices, location. 

When I ate at the location I liked the atmosphere, but the TVs threw me off a little, lol. Still, even with them, it still manages to be intimate and not in a bar sort of way. There is seating outside that looks nice, especially during this time of year. 

The people who work here are always very friendly & pleasant. 

When I've ordered take out they answer the phone quickly and have my food ready for me normally within 15 minutes! I don't tell them, but I can't even drive there that quickly, lol. 

Great service all around!I first saw the volcano on my 21st birthday, a loooooong time ago.  Don't ask.
And it was good then.  I loved feeling the heat of the flames on a cold night.  The rumble of the ground and the volcano reached it's boiling point.  Aside from it being free, it's a very entertaining "longer" show you can watch from the strip.  Best view for me is on the balcony next to where the cars drive up to the main entrance of the hotel.

Over the years, the volcano has gone through many changes.  Not good changes - to the point where I stopped making this a regular "must see" on my trips.

This last trip, we decided to give it another go, and we're so glad we did.  The show is fantastic now.  Still long, still keeps you warm on a cold rainy night.  Definitely worth a few minutes to enjoy.  

It's BACK!Cut is absolutely amazing!! The best steak and food I've ever had! I took the boyfriend here for Valentine's Day and it was definitely worth it! The best meal we ever had!! Everything was perfect! The service is fantastic and the wine selection was to die for! If you're looking for a good steak restaurant Cut is the place to go!This place is one of those "blink and you miss it" places. But the food is fantastic. I would not recommend their dining room, as I find the service rather slow. Which is why we often order our food takeout. The calzone's are our favorite and we end up with leftover for a few night. The breads and red sauce are fantastic! Very authentic.Love this place!! Great staff! Great service! Love the bruschetta and the pizza!! Favorite thing to order is the garlic pizza with prosciutto. Make sure to try the pomegranate margarita ( yummy!) !Oh my god. My heart just melts for this place. Just the best customer service from these ppl... The guy and girl who take our orders always remember what it is we order down to the garnish we always request. They have great pad Thai, chicken pang curry to die for, and yummy house fried rice!  The best Thai food place, and the best little ppl running that joint.I've been coming here for the past eight years or so and I began going here when the place was still known as Payton's. Since the new ownership took over they replaced all of the old TVs with high definition flat screens so now all of the games look great! They also improved the patio by adding a canopy which covers the entire area so that the sun doesn't interfere with with the picture of the TVs as well as making the patio area much more bearable during the early part of football season. The beer selection is exceptional with a wide variety of domestics and imports. However, an easing on the price would be much appreciated. The bartenders are efficient and make solid drinks. The menu is for the most part identical to the one that Payton's had with a few additions and omissions, and the salad line-up is stellar. Overall the food is good especially compared to other sports bars and the chefs have been consistently good. The entire staff is friendly, efficient, and helpful. This season we've had a strong turn out on the "Saints" patio, which mirror the Saints performance I might add. For the second season in a row we've been fortunate enough to have Alexis looking after us outside. She's as stunning as the Saints offence, has the eyes of Audrey Tatou, and I think I'm in ****! In conclusion, I spend the entire football season at this place and I've never been disappointed. This is one of the choice bars to watch sports in the valley.What an amazing shop...!!! For book collectors this is a must see while in Las Vegas. .... They have an incredible array of collectible rare books and ephemora...the prices reflect the rarity and quality of their inventory so be prepared... but at the same time the staff was patient yet attentive while we browsed. ..we also got to see the lady who appears on 'Pawn Stars' to assess books that are brought in...really a special store to behold!You know you're having a good time when the bar you're in is crashing around you and you still don't want to leave.

I went back again last Friday night (this place is becoming a second home) for #evfn and karaoke. The karaoke host came in early just for our group and we were having so much fun that the flood behind the bar, the smoke from something burning somewhere and the closed patron bathrooms didn't slow us down. 

I love this bar.For me, there are two types of sushi restaurants in cities outside of New York and LA, where Japanese restaurants are abundant and go beyond traditional sushi fare.

Type 1 - "All About The Decor" - These sushi restaurants are more concerned with the overall aesthetic, where the budget and level of importance is clearly put toward fancy tables, expensive light fixtures, majestic waterfalls, flaming centerpieces, state-of-the-art sound systems and a wait staff waiting to be discovered. Let's not be confused here - the food is really an afterthought. 

Type 2 - "All About The Food" - These type of sushi restaurants exist off the main drags, resting subtly in dimly lit corners of strip malls next to dollar stores, or in the case of Kampai, a bowling alley. They are typically "mom and pop" family run organizations, poorly decorated, and have a singular focus - really fresh and really good food. 

Kampai is your classic Type 2 joint. I've been many times now, only getting around to writing this review after another visit. It's simple, straight forward sushi. Always fresh, with the standard menu expected by those who want straight forward sushi in a no frills environment. 

There's no music blaring and no crazy list of rolls with ridiculously named concoctions with so many ingredients, you really can't identify any flavors once it hits your tongue. 

Don't get me wrong, there's always a time and place for Type 1 sushi places - parties, happy hours, etc. But if you want good food, fresh fish, a straight forward selection and all of it prepared by actual sushi chefs speaking Japanese, look not further.      

Author's Note: If you watch shows like No Reservations, you'll know that Anthony Bourdain always speaks highly of places like Kampai and would never find himself in Type 1 restaurants.Great little place that has the best Sushi chef!  I have to admit, I knew the sushi chef from a former restaurant and so we went there to check out his new place.  Get to know this guy and he'll take care of you!

I went here for the first time last week with a friend and the vibe is very laid back and relaxed.  Very clean and neat little place too.  We each ordered an appetizer- the mushrooms for me, the fried peppers for him.  The mushrooms were tasty, but the peppers were the best I'd ever had! 

We then each ordered a couple of rolls and then a sashimi appetizer.  I ordered the avocado roll, the eel roll and one other roll I can't remember.   I know they are kind of basic, but that's what really shows the quality of the ingredients.  The sashimi appetizer had several different types of sashimi and all the fish was fresh and simply, but nicely, presented. 

The prices were very reasonable for what we ordered as well.  

The little thing that was a big selling point, to me, about this place was the menu.  Everything was clearly pictured and had the roll ingredients for each roll.  For someone with food allergies and who is picky about my food combinations,  this was a BIG help for me!  This is also a big help to those not too familiar with sushi, but want to try something new.

All in all, a great experience.  I will definitely be back!I absolutely love the food here.   I had the Bun Bo Hue- the Spicy Beef Noodle Soup and it was amazing.  Spicy but not too spicy.    The staff was nice and it is best to go before the dinner rush.

I never tried Vietnamese food before and this place made me glad I did  give it a try.The double double is doubly delicious! I wish they had these in New York :(Long line but totally worth the wait... Just as good in Vegas as in Cali :-)Say it with me: nicest people on earth.

So, as I was coming out to Vegas from NYC for my man's 25th, I realized 2 days prior to our departure that I needed to find him a cake or cupcakes or something to celebrate with there.   

Frantically, I searched the web and tried to find something reasonable that wasn't a $70 Ace-of-Cakes-like dice cake.  Being a bit of a cupcake 'ho, I was stoked to find Retro Bakery and to find they'd deliver to our hotel!

It's a husband and wife who run the shop and were so accomodating and helpful.  Unfortunately, when they delivered the cupcakes (right to our room!), I was a bit distracted and they delivered them to my friends room instead, so I didn't get to say hi and give them my sincere thanks.  So consider this to be it!

Um, hi, frosted donut flavored cupcake?  Heaven?Phenomenal ! ! ! :)

It's already been said great people great cupcakes and great prices!!

Pay them a visit you won't regret it.I went to Yayo Taco for the first time today on a recommendation from a friend. He told me to expect fusion style tacos, I was like "what?" Yayo Taco specializes in Mexican classics with an ethnic twist. I don't really know how to explain it in any other sense. Anyway, I'm a student at UNLV. Which is great because five dollars buys me 4 tacos, cantina style, and two sides with my rebel card. Great deal even if the food was sub-par...

I walk in, I'm greeted by this loco cashier named Jonathan. He's a friendly guy who seems to know at least a fact or two about every beer in the fridge; there are hundreds... He set me up with a DogFish Midas Touch after we talked for a minute; great choice man! But it's a sweet beer and not for everyone. I ordered two pollo tacos and two veggie tacos, sweet p fries and quinoa salad. A touch choice considering the menu has pretty good variety.

Pollo tacos: braised chicken with a mole marinade topped with a tomatillo salsa, amazing depth of flavor, I typically don't like the bold taste or a traditional mole, but it wasn't a traditional mole, just mild enough for me. I'll order these every time I come back. Next time though, I'll omit the salsa. I didn't like it but it was easy enough to push aside.

Veggie tacos: spinach, peppers, onions and other ish served with a cream sauce. Very delicious, consistent option. Fresh veggies, good sauce, etc.

Quinoa salad was fresh, sweet p fries were good if not just a little bit on the salty side...

This place was features on diners drive-ins and dives, which didn't factor into my decision but it's worth mentioning. I took a peek in the kitchen and the owner (who was on the show) was working side by side with his staff, a quality I look for in $ - $$$ restaurants. 

Overall: five stars, no complaints, I'll amend my review as I try more dishes...

Great...
-Service, eating within fifteen minutes, front of house knows their ish
-Atmosphere, cool beach cantina theme, surf boards cover the ceiling
-Food, look above
-beer,wine,tequila: how may I help you?

In conclusion, I'll be back, maybe every day...The best food I have EVER eaten!  My mouth danced the whole time.  Beautiful and unique admosphete and exceptional service. Ahhhhhhhh!As far as gas stations go, this one is turning into one of my favorites.  I haven't tried the car wash, but the service here is really friendly and the gas prices are lower than other places around (especially if you pay cash).  It's also near the 101 at Baseline, so it's convenient on top of everything else if you need to gas up and go.Never had Burmese food before...dammit...now I'm craving it all the time after Little Rangoon.  The Tea Leaf salad was unique, unique, unique.  I really would stick to the Burmese food here even though they represent Vietmanese and Indian.  It's rich, spicy and unusual...and cheap.  Alfred and his staff were very genuine and friendly.  Might not make it back, but will look for Burmese in Chicago.Best sushi I have had, lived all over the place, this place rocks, seriously amazing flavors on everything and so fresh!

Made our end of weekend so perfect!

Stop in and see for yourself!Best falafel plate in town. And the staff is so nice and friendly! Plus they have imported booze! Yay booze! Double-yay falafel!Most definitely my favorite west side Sushi spot! 

The sushi is always fresh and tasty! The prices during happy hour are excellent! 

The ambiance is chic and trendy. 
Just love love Tomo's!!!I dont recall exactly what Ive had here as Ive been 2-3 times, I just like the originality. It is a fun place they truly have an eclectic menu with a lot of orginality. I also really appreciate that the bartenders had a great knowledge of all the different saki they have.This place was great the server recommended something's that I found VERY tasty.
The Lobster Ceviche was amazing soooo good. I asked about the Duck Breast and he recommended the mushroom and sauce which was so rich and flavorful I LOVED it. This place is tits I kid you not . A++++ at the very leastMust must take my bf here the next time I go. So yummy!! 

The restaurant was very casual with spectacular food and fantastic wait-staff. Our waiter suggested he choose a tasting menu according to our party size (keeping in mind the 1 girl who couldn't eat raw fish) and our budget ($50 per girl). Smartest thing we did entire trip!! Upon hearing we were there for a bachelorette party, a free round of shots!

The standouts were the green bean tempura with truffle aioli, wagyu beef gyoza and sea bass skewers. But the yellowtail seviche tacos with chili foam sauce stole the whole damn show. YUM. 

Not so yummy turned out to be the rolls, but we just packed it up and brought it for the girls in the hotel room that were recuperating from the night before. They thought it was delicious. I think we were just full by then.Always a staple for good boba tea! Friendly staff, great drink! Love this place!watermelon slushy it was amazing! So refreshing ! My friend has honey dew slushy is very good too!I come here to get my eyebrows done with Amy she's Amazing and the only person who's ever done my eyebrows can't trust anyone else LOVE IT !!!This is all American food.  I'm calling it Ethnic, because American is an ethnic group too and they don't have a fast food grouping.

Hey!  I'm a California girl; we love our burgers the In & Out way.  Always fresh, always made to order and always made right. 

Drive through or dine in.  The drive through is surprisingly fast.  The inside dining gets crowded at meal times but it usually works out that by the time your food is ready a table opens up.  On a nice day there are plenty of outside tables to take advantage of.

Kid friendly dining with lots of high chairs.  They keep it pretty clean even when it's busy.

 Best fries on the planet because they are made ultra fresh right before your eyes.  Watch the guy take a  fresh potatoe and slice it and then fry it.  I like mine extra well done.  Not a problem at I&O.  They make it the way you want it. 

 Add on grilled onions with or without your slice of raw onion.  No prob.
Full slices of onions (none of those dehydrated minced things that look like lice on your burger), rich ripe red tomatoes (not pink; red and ripe)and whole leaves of lettuce (none of that shredded stuff with brown edges).  The buns are baked fresh everyday too.  Fresh, fresh, fresh and juicy.

On a diet?  In and Out invented the protein burger over 40 years ago.  All the other fast food places are imitators.  In California we called it a Rabbit Burger.  All your burger goodies stacked on whole lettuce leaves and lovingly wrapped.  Messy and yummy.

Animal Style - it's not on the menu but you can make your burger or fries Animal Style - adds grilled onions and more condiments.
On your fries it adds cheese, onions and thousand island sauce - Wow!  They (unfortunately) charge extra for it now.  Oh well, if you tell em to leave off the cheese they will not charge the extra $1.85 on to the fries though.

Top off your meal with a real made from ice cream shake.  Everyone else has finally followed suit on this one too.  Used to be you could only find ice milk being used.  I & O always used ice cream and still does.

Nice fat straws too - not those skinny ones that you have to suck your brains out to get a good slurp.

Pick up a cool t shirt and bumper sticker while you are there and show your burger love to the world!

Dang!  I've made myself hungry writting this reveiw.  Think I will head on over for some comfort food!


Sunday through Thursday 10:30 a.m.-1:00 a.m.
Friday and Saturday 10:30 a.m.-1:30 a.m.Mango wango is awesome. I have been here a dozen times it is fun, lively every time. Staff has always been good and nice.This place truly is a hidden gem, as described in previous review.  Had one of the best meals I have had in Las Vegas.  Was surprised at how nice the Lowes Hotel at Lake Las Vegas is. The restaurant has a beautiful lake view.  This place is real serious and reasonably priced for such a high quality meal.  The Opacapaca Lau Lau was exceptional hands down one of the best cooked fish dishes I have ever had.  The Kobe beef tartar with truffle oil was the best tartar I have ever had.  The sushi was all very fresh and high quality.  The deserts were also exceptional the Pumpkin Tiramisu and tempura bananas were unreal.  We spent about $100 a piece but it's easily possible to go and have a great meal for $60-75.  

My one complaint is the raw fish selection is fairly limited. I figured a master sushi chef would stock a wider variety of fish.  All the fish was of extremely high quality, I just wish the selection was larger. 

Basically what I am saying is this place is worth the drive and a must try.


*The hotel is now called The Westin Lake Las Vegas Resort & Spa.Campfires, Steaks and Country Music...

Well, I can do without the country music, but this place DOES set the mood for a 'home on the range' party.  I recently went here with my wife and her siblings and I was shocked.  I didn't know a place like this existed!

Basically, it is a few buildings placed in a huge circle.  In the middle is where you eat and have campfires and party it up!  Picnic tables are randomly placed all over, and a huge stage is set in the middle.  This place is open VERY late and is great for groups.

What makes this place so great? Fire! No I'm not a pyromaniac, but you go and get wood from a HUGE pile, you start a campfire in their metal ring pits, and then you go buy 'smores kits'... Yeah you heard me.  SMORES!  Smores and a full bar.  Could it get any better? Well, yes. actually. it can.

The food here is amazing.  I ordered a huge T-Bone steak and it was delicious.  It comes with salad, bread, and a couple of sides.  It was cooked perfectly and the quality of the meat was outstanding.

For originality, rugged location, and beautiful food, I highly recommend this place.This has been my favorite donut place-EVER.
I lived in the Philippines for a few years and cant believe that they don't have this here in CA.

So when we went to Vegas last year, this was my to do list..go to DUNKIN DONUTS!!!

I had to find this particular store in Fremont street...as Cait mentioned, it's hidden! 
But it's like finding gold at the end of a rainbow...except the rainbow is flashing lights from slot machines. LOL

Recommendations: Strawberry Glazed & Chocolate Creme. 
Try it!While being in glamorous Las Vegas I was pretty bummed to be shacking it up with my girlfriends in the Monte Carlo.  Sure we got a great deal for our rooms; however, other than that, there was nothing special about this no frills hotel it was just a place to sleep.  That is until we ate at Brand Steakhouse.  Impressed, I was!

Reservations were easy to make, and in spite of being almost 30 minutes late, they were still able to accommodate our group of 6 immediately upon arrival. Since we were with a semi large group and wanted to avoid the drama that comes with dividing up the bill, we decided to order 3 dinners for 2 between the 6 of us. 

First up, the bread.  For all you familiar with Filipino food, the bread tasted exactly like pandesal.  Except the fanciest, most delicious pandesal of your lives! Already, I was impressed.

Then briefly after came our salads.  I went for the cesar.  Simple romaine lettuce wedges evenly covered with the most delicious cesar dressing I've ever tasted! And garnished with a few shavings of fresh parmesan and two croutons.  I would have been satisfied had the meal ended there.

Then came out the creamed spinach with black truffles and the potatoes au gratin with a generous crispy layer of cheese on top-- all to be shared between me and my +1.  

And the steak... oh, the steak. So delicious and 5oz was just the right amount! They give two sauces. One was more of a gravy, and the other was more of a steak sauce.  There was also some sort of garlic herb butter on top.  None of the sauces were necessary.  The steak was perfect as is! Hands down, one of the best steaks I've ever had. Period.

Then came out the dessert! Between the mini donuts (which reminded of of a custard filled churro in donut form) and the creme brulee, after that heavy meal the creme brulee was a better choice but both were equally good.  

Dinner for two is really $30 per person, but if you're with a large group, add on gratuity, tax, and a glass of wine per person it came out to about $70ish. Not bad! The portions though very generous, was the perfect portion size for each equally hungry girl. The quality of the food was AMAZING, service was wonderful, and the meal and overall dining experience definitely will be etched in my memory until the experience gets topped.

5 stars, baby!deeeeelicious... 

we had the 80oz Ultimate Steak for 4 people to share... OMGGGGG it was the best steak I've ever had!  they soak the steak in BACON FAT!!!! the waitress had me at bacon but the steak was very tender and grilled perfectly.  

the sides we ordered were mac and cheese and asparagas... both sides were "large"  but I swear they were meant for a small group of kids or something.. the mac and cheese was delicious but there was like one spoon full per person...

=( that was the only down side to the experience but over all amazing!!!!Most likely the best Filet Mignon I ever had. Professional waiter and a nice ambience. A+++ in my book.First of all this place is pricey. LOTS. But then again, that's Vegas for ya. The hubs and I had dinner here on Friday and it was delicious. He had a Happa Roll and a couple of pieces of sashimi. I had the Jadori chicken and their roasted corn as a side. The hubby loved his food and so did I. So many sushi places just serve plane chicken but this was so delicious. I will try to post pics later. The roasted corn was SO yummy. It was definitely a small portion for the price (10) but delicious in deed. 

I had 2 cocktails, a pineapple and a strawberry. The drinks are pricey, $20, but they are strong so I could have easily had one. But hey I was on vacation. 

The staff was SO nice and courteous. There was no snootiness here like at some of the restaurants in the strip. 

And lastly, we sat outside and were able to enjoy the fountains. Just perfect, other than the price tag ;)What great service! All the guys were friendly as can be.. even to the grumpy customers.  Not even sure why try we're grumpy as it seems they were getting the service they were promised.  It's not the fault of Discount Tire you got a flat.  Anyway, they fixed my slow leak and didn't try to sell me tires before I needed them.  I will definitely come here when I do need them.  A+ here.  Oh yeah...I had a line of 10 people at the door in front of me and they got my information and looked at my tire in less than 10 minutes and promised work to be complete on 1 hour.It was GREAT!! The singing was Amazing!  I went in not knowing what the musical was about.  I still didn't know until 1/3 into the musical and they started singing songs that were familiar.  I was in awe-struck! You must see this musical.This place is the best for over all good old sandwich shop. the staff is very friendly and the food is priced just right for the quality and quantity. I tried the Gyros pita, Philly Steak, and the Chicken Greek Salad,  everything was very good and plenty of meat, this restaurant gives you good food for every pennie you spend. must go place.Real sweet tea! Great food, all u can eat sides. Had pulled pork sandwich & sampler plate. Very good and tasty. Good for the wallet too.So, I saw this place showcased on Food Network's The Best Thing I Ever Ate, so I decided to check it out on one of my day's off. Man was I glad I did!! This place was great! The building itself wasn't impressive, just a big metal building which was kind of misleading, but once you walk inside oh man! As soon as you walk in it is rows and rows of olive oil, wine, cook books, and cooking accessories. This place was packed to the brim. After browsing through the aisles I worked up an appetite and went to the back to get some lunch. After looking over the menu I tried the bruschetta platter. OK this didn't make a whole lot of sense to me. They offer 8 different types of bruschetta. They have a platter where you can order 3,5, or 7 different kinds. Well if you offer 8 why can't I try all 8?!! I was puzzled for about ten seconds and got over it. So I got the 7 platter one and bought the additional 8th. Their bruschetta was overall amazing! Great quality toppings on quality bread. I don't like hummus so I didn't like that one, heh. 
I ended up ordering the sandwich that was showcased on the TV show and next to it on the menu there's a sign, showcased on the food network, so hell I had to get it. It is the kalamatta sandwich. The sandwich basically is an Italian sandwich but it was very, very tasty. Great meats on a great roll, I was glad I went with it. While devouring this sandwich, they have a window into their factory where they make their olive oil. That was a very plea sent, and interesting sight to see while eating a nice lunch. 
After lunch I did a little bit more browsing through the store and found the olive oil tasting bar. That was frig gin sweet. I tried several of them, most I liked and some I didn't. I'm glad they had this sample station for me to try before I dropped the money on a bottle of oil just to find out that I didn't like it, always a plus in my book. 
With all things said I would definitely go back to the Olive Mill, and hell since it is out of my way to get there, I don't mind driving out of my way to go there, it's that good!! I will definitely be back there in the immediate future! 

P.S. 
Just for a heads up the outside smells like shit, ha haAfter reading the reviews, I had to mention that the Queen Creek Olive Mill makes olive oil.  Everything else is resale.  They make fresh olive oil from local trees in their own press.  They blend the oils to obtain different tastes in their extra virgin olive oil products.  This is the best of the best olive oil for salads and as a finishing oil.  Their flavored oils are made by running the other ingredient - garlic for instance - through the press with the olives.  The huge pressures burst the cells and release much more taste than if other flavors were simply infused.  So, buy and enjoy their superior olive oil.    Other stuff is sold as a convenience but is probably from California.  I do enjoy the different flavored olives and olive tapenade.  Just remember, they are an olive mill that makes fresh olive oil.  

By the way, don't fall for sampling "fresh" olive oil straight from the press during the tour.  It takes a long time for the olive juice and oil to separate in a decanting tank.  Fresh olive oil mixed with the olive juice is horribly bitter - just like eating a fresh uncured olive.  The tour is more of a half hour lecture about olives and how oil is extracted than a walking tour of a factory.  Very interesting information worth the time.  Just pass on tasting the fresh olive oil from the press.  

I don't have any problem with a company wanting to add on service and products.  Just don't expect a winery, cheese factory or fine dining restaurant.  I spend my money on their superb olive oil.  You can also buy their oils at AJ's Fine Foods grocery in the Phoenix area.So everyone bragged about this restaurant and I just had to try it....it was great!! I had catfish, grits and eggs with toast. I've never had catfish that I didn't have to put any sauce on which was good. I didn't think the grits would be good comparing them to my grandma's and they were good!! My hunny had chicken and waffles he said it was okay but his plate was cleared at the end lol I wish it was bigger to seat more people that's my only complaint.This is based off of the concerts series here. I recently saw Ziggy Marley at the beach and it was great. Nice warm night in the water with some reggae with the waves crashing against your legs, what a natural rush this brings for any concert here. The only downside is paying the hotel alcohol prices so it is common for me to catch a buzz before going to a show.I came to this place because of the new review. 

I just love to try new places and when I said Cajun, my partner said "Let's go!" We had a really hard time finding this place, but I'm sure it's because we aren't as familiar with that part of the city. The location is difficult to see from the road and the place was vacant at the dinner hour.  If this new business doesn't last it sure won't be because of the food, the service or the price. So I'm glad to Yelp and encourage people to find it. What do you know, my first 5 star food review!

We ordered Fried Calamari and hush-puppies for appetizers. I couldn't seduce anyone into trying the frog legs, maybe I'll get braver next time. Our appetizer was crispy, quick, yummy and fresh! 

Then we ordered a gigantic bowl of Jambalaya, another of Seafood Gumbo, one kid-size Catfish Strips and hush-puppies basket and three drinks. The large bowl of Andouille sausage based Jambalaya was divinely balanced with rice and celery and chicken and my partner loved it. Would eat it every day if we lived closer. The Seafood Gumbo was chock full of flavor, chunks of seafood, tender juicy shrimp, a very yummy, thick savory broth.  Neither dish was overpowered by some hot spice we couldn't handle. The chef made sure you were tasting the dish instead of begging for water. After eating half of each we got this wild idea of blending them both together in one bowl. OMG, that was an ultimate flavor sensation! I highly recommend it. My daughter munched on her catfish strips and hush puppies happily and even dunked into the roumelade she normally avoids. She didn't finish because she ate too much appetizer. I couldn't fault her there, the Calamari had just come in that morning. We packed a bit up to take home, but we couldn't avoid a slice of Pecan Pie. I liked the pie a lot, my partner prefers theirs sweeter. I wonder if I can buy a whole pie there? hmmm I forgot to ask.

Oh! The Service was spot on, I never wondered about my drink refills, every time I looked they were full, she was super nice, the chef came out and chatted too. They've been open about a month and it's been slow. They have their liquor license and everything, nice little patio around the outside, yellow walls, and tiled floor. Nice, clean place, very friendly. I really hope they get some traffic in that location though. The bill was $44 for everything we bought and was worth it. I wish they were closer to home and we'd make them a regular stop.
 
Their name says it all Chez Monieux if you don't try them out!Best Vietnamese food in the west valley!  Price is right too, and the owner and young servers are friendly.  Try number 52 for a special treat.  Includes beef,shrimp,egg roll, noodles and salad greens and sprouts with a dipping sauce. 
 Even served  cleverly in a boat.  Lots of flavor, very fresh....and we are picky.I ate lunch here 2 days in a row because it was so delish!! The 1st day, Deanna was our server. We loved her! She had a great knowledge of the menu, told us specials and even helped us order. We had the goat cheese and chicken sandwich and the corn and goat cheese flatbread.   She told us to go check out the rest of the place and when we did we ran into Robert, the manager and he said right away, "welcome to our home". How cute is that?  So, I decided to bring some different friends there today. The food was awesome again...we tried a BLT flatbread and a turkey apple wrap and a veggie wrap as well. All very good! The service however wasnt exactly poor, just wasnt Deanna. We heard no specials, no name..well, no personality!  Why didnt I just ask for Deanna, you say? I did, her station was full, (shes on the patio and its gorgeous outside) and we were on a time crunch. Ill know better next time. The server actually touched the lip of the pitcher of iced-t to the lip of my glass. Now if she does that to everyones glass, well, you get the picture and I get a cold sore! YUCK! Needless to say, I asked for my tea to go. All that said, Ill come back here time and time again!!I didn't expect too much from this place, but we were hungry Chinese food was our choice. However, I was pleasantly surprised. The service was decent, but the food was surprisingly one of the best Chinese food I've had in awhile. The black cod miso is a must try. For the meat lovers, try the Kalbi rib eyes. The sauce was just right and the meat, while a bit rare, was prepared perfectly. We liked the Chinese Chicken salad so much we ordered another one. Good job Woo!I was reluctant to go to the Kierland area this past weekend because I knew my wallet would take a beating. But my wife had a gift certificate and wanted to explore the Kierland area shops and restaurants.

We made reservations for 5:30 on the patio. We waited for about 5 minutes for our table to be cleaned and were escorted to our table on the patio. Talk about living large, a patio overlooking the shops and the courtyard which was accented with a bunch of palm trees on a beautiful 80 degree day. The ambiance alone rates an extra star.

We started off with the Trio for $9, which is 4 pieces of bread (which was refilled) and with generous amounts of Hummus, an Olive spread, and Goat Cheese. All spreads were delicious. My favorite was the Goat Cheese, WOW! My first time to eat Goat Cheese and I am definitely hooked.

We lucked out an had a great server, I believe her name was Bree. Kudos Bree! Bree helped us with the menu items.

My son had the Chicken Parmasean and didn't share any with me. So I'm thinking that was really good and I should order some next time. My wife went out of her comfort zone and ordered the Buccatini which is Short Ribs and Spaghetti, WIN! I ordered the Flank Steak which was topped with fresh Arugula greens. The steak was fabulous, they serve you what seems to be two steaks that are cut in strips. Plenty of food, I had a hard time finishing off the steak since it was so much. 

We then relaxed and had a great post meal family conversation. All and all, a very enjoyable evening out for $70 (no alcohol) before tip and gift card.A great experience. Celebrated our 23rd wedding anniversary last night it was great. Delicious food. Excellent service. Friendly staff. The fact that it was half price wine night was an added bonus. Considering it's a 2 Hour Dr. from our home in Tucson, we will still be back again.If you've read some of my other reviews you'll see a trend. 

Kohl's Department Stores.....Brewers spring training...... 

Yep, I'm a cheesehead. (But if you EVER actually catch me wearing a hunk of fake foam cheese on my head, shoot me. Really.) 

What can I say? I like Culver's. It reminds me of home. It's total comfort food. 

Got one of their Wisconsin Swiss melts. What other fast food joints offer burgers with Swiss on rye? The crinkle cut fries are always hot and fresh. And tasty. 

Culver's is known for their frozen custard. What Wisconsinite has not driven past a Culver's, looked at their sign, checked out the 'flavor of the day', and gone, "Hey, that sounds good!!", and quickly pulled into the parking lot? 

If you're from Wisconsin or the Midwest stop in for a Butterburger and some custard....it will bring back lots of good memories. 

Like another reviewer noted when he said he felt like he was in Iowa or something.....well.....that's the whole charm behind Culver's. You DO feel like you're in Wisconsin or one of the upper Midwest states. 

Granted I'm not the best person to review Culver's....I'm a little biased towards it. But if you want a 'different' kind of fast food experience and you've never been to the upper Midwest, it's a heck of a whole lot cheaper than flying there. 

Give it a chance....see if you like it.Wet Republic probably took me to a new plane of partying this past weekend. My boys and I hit twice while we were in Vegas for a bachelor. If your Spring for the Party Cabana it is definitely worth the extra money. There will be no shortage of talent looking to scope you out.The staff is super-friendly and attentive. 

When you're booking talk to Forrest. When you arrive ask for Yanette or Jessica. Don't worry about the large minimums for the cabanas, your dollar goes a long way. There is a great food menu to order from as well as tons of pitchers of drinks and buckets of beers you can order too. It made it really easy to host guests you might meet in the pool.

Now what you've heard is true it is covered with half-naked 20-30 somethings, but the vibe is right. I was surprised by how deuche-free the environment was, maybe a cabana has something to do with it. I'm not a big electro/house fan, but I am now. I found myself fist pumping and splashing water (literally, you'll see when you get there) to house beats. I had the time of my life both days.

The women were looking great. Fellas you def want to come in shape. It will set you apart from the rest of the crowd and the ladies will notice. We met some really great girls both days, who we ended up partying with both nights. That's what Vegas is about meet during the day, party at night.

If you're looking for celebrity appearances it has that too, Prince Harry and J Lo were both there on Saturday, but you'll be having too much fun to care. I couldn't imagine a Vegas trip without it. Wet Republic is easily the best pool party on a Saturday.

The next weekend, I sent one of my girls who is in town for a bachelorette party there, she text me telling me how great of a time she was having!

Don't miss it.Yummy!!! This place exceed my expectations for sure! The prices were reasonable and the food and service was outstanding. They had awesome healthy options too. And a good kids menu. The two year old I care for LOVED the veggie quesadilla!One of the nicer places I have stayed. The rooms were very clean, And very comfortable. We stay here every year when we go to the International Consumer Electronics Show. 
Internet speed is very fast, Just make sure you add that in to your room.. Otherwise its an additional fee when you get there.. 
Housekeeping every day, And an In room safe if you dont feel like trusting your electronics with them. 
The only downside is the balcony's did not open. Great view of Las Vegas, and more secluded away from the palms Casino. One of my favorites.The Summer Roll appetizer and the Mushroom Entree was delicious.  This is my first of many trips here. All Aces!My experience with Sprouts is pretty limited, seeing as how this is the first (and only) Sprouts location that I've had the opportunity to visit - and, at the moment, I'm relatively easily impressed since I'm currently living in North Dakota and the selection and options up here are pretty dismal.

That said... I was ridiculously impressed with Sprouts. Up here in North Dakota, you can't get liquor, wine, or beer in the grocery stores (*le gasp!*), so the thought of being able to pick up all the ingredients for a meal AND pick out a nice bottle of wine (or beer) to go with it is astounding. The selection is fantastic (you Arizonans don't know how good you have it!)

I can't say much about the employees, since we didn't really need to get any help finding anything. I was in town on vacation, visiting my parents, and the only reason we'd even stopped in there is because my mom was looking to find some fenugreek for a recipe she was wanting to try out. We found it in the bulk section - even though she forgot to grab the code so the cashier could ring it up. For me, the cashier was the best part... A smiling, dark haired beauty with ruby red lips. I think she was surprised when I offered to run and get the code off of the fenugreek; I don't think she realized that I was with my parents.

All in all, I'd quite happily visit Sprouts again - even if just to catch another glimpse of that pretty cashier. ;) Seriously, though... Coming from a current North Dakotan who has limited options, Sprouts is fantastic. I can honestly say that, when I finally get down to Arizona, Sprouts will be the grocery store I stop at first!I love this restaurant.  The staff was exceptional and the food was absolutely delicious.  We were a party of 13 and every dish ordered was full of flavor, tender, and just phenomenal.  We were celebrating a surprise birthday dinner, complete with a cake, and the staff was so accommodating and wonderful, making sure we all had an enjoyable dinner.  I definitely recommend this restaurant.Great dentist for kids...been going here for years. The practice is well run and managed and the dentist is super careful with the kids...they never feel any pain.Brain-dead.  Will consider updating this later...

o_OOh man, those caramel truffles are amazing.  Chocolates are made of some kind of purified version of awesome.

They won some major praise from consumer reports a year or two ago and for good reason- something like best value for chocolate in the US.  

If you aren't super wealthy or celebrating a special occasion of some kind, you can spend under $3 for a two piece box.So. Good. Everytime.
We're here on Monday nights because of the $5 Burger deal.  Great location for us ( we live near the AJ'S on Central & Camelback Rd.) and our 4 children.  Everyone gets a burger, however they would like it, maybe a soft drink if it's not too late and the tab is often less than $50 for the 6 of us.  The only drawback is finding parking some evenings, not that big of a deal though.  Try it, you'll love it.Excellent show.  He used many different puppets.  He also sung a couple of songs without the use of the puppets.  I was impressed with his charitable giving as well.  It was a lot of fun and well worth the ticket price.Holy cow --  so I found on their website that you can request a complimentary shampoo and style + DoCo makeup application with a 60 minute or + Facial treatment. SCORE!!

I was planning on using my recent Groupon anyways today, but a complimentary shampoo/style -- game on!

Maddie was my esthetician -- so friendly and did an awesome job on my 90min heavenly, pure bliss facial. 

Then I was whisked upstairs to Jamie & Ashley for the shampoo/style -- they also both rocked!

I don't know how you could wrong with Dolce. 

Just make sure that you request the complimentary shampoo/style at the time you book your facial. 

I totally scored an amazing pampering day at the spa, without having to take out a loan. Thank you Dolce --and thank you Groupon! 

(Plus I got 30% off my products today because of the Groupon special.) Me = happy girl right now :)Love LVAC. Mind your biz and you get things done. Lol not be here on a machine to talk on your phone and text and look for folks to talk to. :) if you're about it(putting in work) then you're good. :)huge forever 21. 2 floors. each clothing line were separated on each floor. I loved all the new summer/spring line. picked out bunch of clothes and there were alot that were on sale!  My mom and I couldn't finish shopping forever , definitely topped one of my favorite forevers. 

Thank god the security thing went off, because the cashier forgot to take off one of the tags. that would've sucked on my 12 hr drive home...

The mall in general is nice. big, spacious..options! i love options!Another great visit to Eddie's House! It was quiet last night as it was New Year's Day and I suspect that people were too hung over to dine out, but that didn't deter Eddie or his staff. The service was excellent and the food was spot on as always.  Eddie is also on Facebook and Twitter so if you are a friend of his, you can get a heads up on some awesome deals! For example, over the Christmas holiday, he offered 50% off on his gift certificates. So if you buy a $50 gift certificate, you only pay $25 for it. Awesome idea and let me buy several for friends while keeping one for myself. :) 

You can't go wrong at Eddie's House so don't be afraid to give it a try. It's very affordable for a Scottsdale joint and well worth the price of gas to get there!Great sea bass.  Try pulled mozzarella...yum!  Comfortable and quiet.  Fabulous flavors.  Loved it.Thanks to Todd, they found my package on Friday! My mail carrier just forgot to put the key in my mailbox. Again, couldn't be more pleased with the customer service!The Spa Bontanica was wonderful. Nina was great, she was a spa attendant and helped me with anything I needed. I  asked her for a mimosa and next thing you know there is one waiting for me on a table in the relaxation rooms with a nice note from her. I can honestly say the service is better than the spa at the Biltmore and the facilities are very comparable. The Spa Bontanica is a great place to have a treatment done if you live in the west Valley.You know that episode of Seinfeld where George eats a pastrami sandwich while banging his girlfriend? Well, if he'd been eating Pizza A Metro, I'd totally understand. 

So. Fucking. Good.

My friend and I split the cheese ravioli in a creamy tomato sauce and a pizza with sausage, broccoli and mozzarella for lunch.

The ravioli were like little pillows of heaven filled with the silkiest melt-in-your-mouth ricotta I've ever tasted. The pizza had that chewy-crispy crust thing happening, and the tomato sauce was incredible - simple, fresh, still a little pulpy.

Everything was homemade. And when I say "everything," I mean they make their own MOZZARELLA, people. Yes, mozzarella. I know how to make a lot of stuff from scratch -- bread, pasta, pastry dough, whatever -- but cheese? I've got no fucking clue. 

Not only does Pizza A Metro have a clue, but they're so goddamned nice, too. Case in point: After chatting with the owner throughout our meal, he brought out a slice of the tiramisu. No fanfare, no warning. Just set it down and walked away. We practically licked the plate. 

Go there. You won't be disappointed. 

But if you see me ordering takeout, just pretend you don't know where I'm headed with it.Sometimes you arrive at a restaurant, see the place, and feel like you should probably go try someplace else.  And if you go in, you figure there's probably a 50% chance your car turns up missing after your meal.  Pizza A Metro is one of those places, but it's good enough that you should go ahead and risk it anyways.

Set in one of the most unassuming strip malls they could have found east of the I-17, Pizza A Metro is a humble place that serves up some of the best pies in Phoenix.

I have had the capricciosa and whatever the pie with prosciutto is called (this place is so awesome that I can't even find their menu on the internet).  Both pies were pretty good, topping wise, although I would have preferred that they use fancier olives on the capricciosa instead of canned.

The crust was excellent.  One of the best I've had.  The sauce was right on as well.

Perhaps my favorite part is the bruschetta flatbread appetizer they give you while you're waiting.  It is delicious, and a nice touch.

This is definitely a rotation place for me.Love this place! Were from El Paso, TX & every time we come to Phoenix this is a must stop place for us to dine at. Try it, you won't regret it :)What a great place. Food from sashimi from fish of all kinds to the best Fois Gras I have ever had. It runs the gamut and I have yet to find anything that was anything short of delciious. I have gone there 6 times now and I think as we all seem to agree its about the best place to eat in Las Vegas. How about those Pork Cheeks!!!! thank you!Thank you, Raku, for such a delightful dinner, though it would probably be more suitable to describe it as a wonderful experience. Everything from your great service to dish presentation to flavor was impeccable.  

The meal started with a wonderful sashimi salad.  The sashimi pieces were big and the dressing was uniquely good.  Then came the homemade tofu, which had great texture and the homemade soy sauce and sauces complemented it well.  My favorite condiment was the green tea salt with the tofu.

The robata items were perfectly cooked.  The bacon you use to wrap around the mushrooms, asparagus wasn't too salty as is the usual problem for me at other robata restaurants.   The enoki was cooked to a chewy perfection, as was the pork cheek, beef tendon, shishito, chicken wings.  

Of all the items, I think I loved the foie gras egg custard the most.  The texture, the taste, and the presentation.  

The oden soup base was refreshing and you can add items to it a la carte.  We opted for the daikon, chikuwa, bean curd with mochi inside, and uni (which comes separately with wakame).  The meal was ended delightfully with a grilled onigiri in broth.  Perfect ending to a perfect meal.  Thank you!

PS.  The bathroom is also super nice.  Love the aquarium!!Absolutely amazing.

I know several friends who are absolutely crazy about this place, and with good reason. Tons of items to select from all of them delicious. It's always busy. I wish they had more seating because it's a bit hard to simply drop by on a whim, and they only take reservations after midnight.For best authentic Japanese ... Raku is still a top favorite since its opening.  

Now they have a cafe mainly - focused on desserts too!!!Enjoyed a burger and Key Lime martini at Vogue in early July with the Main Man... Fabulous! Excellent service...I wish this place was closer to me because I would be a regular for sure!  Came here to support Gabi K. because she was raising money for CF and for my support I got ice cream... yay:).  The owners of Sweet Republic are yelpers too and they were so wonderful for donating a 100% of the proceeds for Gabi's cause.  I tried the honey yogurt and I think it was a Mayan chocolate... they both were spectacular!  I also brought home some cookies for my sweetie which he loved also.   When I am in the neighborhood I will definitely stop by again.With pastries and coffee now well covered and plenty interesting enough to put Phoenix on my culinary map the next question was how well they did Ice Cream, and coming from the self-proclaimed Ice Cream Capital of America I figured I might as well just go for the best to compare head-to-head with the Jeni's, Bi-Rite's, and Toscanini's of the world - in this case, Scottsdale's own Sweet Republic.

Rated by Bon Appetite as one of the nation's 10-best and focused on small batch artisan flavors just like the rest of the list Sweet Republic is tucked into a small strip mall off Shea Boulevard and while not simple to find the products are also available by the pint at Whole Foods.  Not wanting a pint but rather to sample I made my way up the stairs to the small store to find it largely empty - a surprise since every parlor in Ohio is lined up out the door when it is 100 degrees out, but perhaps not surprising in Scottsdale where temperatures frequently reach such peaks.  Entering the store I was greeted by the smell of sugar, vanilla, and that all-too-familiar scent of ice cream cones and within moments I was greeted by a young lady ready with sampling spoons.

Not wanting to be greedy but certainly wanting to sample a couple before buying in my first two tastes of Sweet Republic's Ice Cream would be Tres Leches, a dense and flavorful but largely one-dimensional vanilla and next Desert Honey, a lovely bite not dissimilar to a frozen liquid Bit-o-Honey.  With easily twenty more flavors to taste and my server not seeming to mind my next two bites would prove memorable enough to commit to a double - one scoop of Honey Blue Cheese and the other of Salted Butter Caramel - for $4.25.  Waiting for the scoops as I browsed the shops collection of cookies, candies, and even bacon brittle I thanked my server for her assistance and sitting down to enjoy my choices I was very pleased by one and blown away by the other.

Beginning first with the Salted Butter Caramel, a flavor I try everywhere, this dense concoction with pockets of liquid gold oozing from the otherwise milky sweet ice cream was exceptional and on par in all ways with that of Jeni's back home - potentially even better though a side-by-side would need to be done to be certain.  Moving next to the Blue Cheese - easily a top 5 ice cream moment of all time with the sharp notes of the cheese aptly countered by the sweetness of the honey and the overall texture somewhere between frozen frosting and cheesecake; an absolute must try for anyone living in or visiting the area whether it is 100 degrees or not.We are huge fans! We often forego dessert when eating out and head to Sweet Republic. Be open to trying new flavors, be patient as scoopers attend to the whims of customers inner ice-cream loving child, and be sure to include a cookie or cone or both in the mix! Oh, and a roasted  marshmellow! Wait; also the brittles! :P YUM 
Don't forget to smile people. You're in an ice cream parlor for goodness sake. Put away your phones, grab a game, and share a sundae!With a fresh and "South Beach" like atmosphere, the Encore is quite frankly the nicest, hippest and most comfortable hotel room I've ever stayed in.  If you like contemporary design then you'll appreciate Encore's decor and ammenities.  If your tastes are more on the classic style side then you'll probably enjoy Palazzo or Bellagio more.

I've stayed at almost every single 4 or 5 star hotel in Vegas and Encore shines above the rest.  I will be staying here exclusively from now on.This is the best hotel that I have stayed in my life. 

If you go to Vegas, you wouldn't need to leave the hotel because it has it all. it means:

*It has the biggest club in vegas which is XS. It fits about 1000 people.  
*Casino is gorgeous and guess what? it doesn't smell despite people is allowed to smoke. 
*Room service is outstanding. We ordered pizza at 4:30 am after a wild night and it took 30 mins for them to deliver the pizza. 
*The pool is quite hot. Especially the people who goes to the European pool. 
*The rooms now have couches so they are called suites 
*Free parking lot with easy entrance from LA Blvd for those who drive from LA. 
*Drinks at the pool are very well done. Try their strawberry mojito
*Rooms are quite clean and neat.Beautiul hotel or the north end of the strip.  All the luxuries you need spa, restaurants and pools.  Not to mention clubs and casinoI have stayed at a lot of hotels on the strip, and I was totally surprised to find out that Encore is my favorite. 

The suite we stayed in was stunning- beautiful windows with a strip view, fantastic decor and spotlessly clean. Very well maintained. 

The casino had very little smoke and the clientele was higher class than some of the other casinos (helloooo treasure island). 

The stand out highlight is the spa. Amazing staff- my massage was outstanding. And the facilities are so delightfully decadent it is a crime to skip the chance at spending a whole day here enjoying the facilities. They have a recommended circuit- and everything you could possibly want. Sauna, steam room, great showers, other showers that have light therapy, a wall of copper cups and falling water, two long pools, one cold plunge pool and one cool plunge pool, and my favorite the heat tile lounger chairs. 

It is an oasis. This hotel- in every way is one of the best on the strip and my favorite place to stay in Vegas.I had the nachos asada at Barrett Jackson and they were great. Instead of a small over priced portion you got a great size serving covered in a awesome queso.Stopped in there for a late lunch....AMAZING! 

Really. Something for everyone and great lunch prices, not crowded, plenty of parking & excellent service (hot chicks in kilts and knee socks).

3 generations of Irish women go into a bar...no joke...we all thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. -I had the $9 grilled chicken sandwich (thick bacon, chicken breast on ciabatta with savory sauce lettuce tomato and salad greens) w/ a salad. My grandma had the $9 seafood pie (whole shrimp and scallops in typical pie filling/filo dough wrapped) w/ a salad. My mom had the $4 bowl of french onion soup. Then we split a $5 chocolate volcano and $5 apple crisp with ice cream.  ~And their coffee tastes like there's a little chocolate in it. mmmmm....

I used to go here for beer and the cheese and bread appetizer before movies, but now I think this is the best kept secret LUNCH spot.I love this place. My family and I frequent it. I love the bibimbap and the kimchi fried rice. They have great sushi also!My husband and I love this place! We started out with the smoothies (delicious) and sandwiches (very good- but the wraps are better) but we've come mainly for the unspoken stars- the wraps- are the best. I've tried others like the thai wrap and the buffalo chicken wrap, but our favorites are: cordon bleu wrap and jamaican jerk chicken- we split it and we split the smoothie too. You get the best of both worlds using our strategy. This is by far, my favorite place for wraps. I would love gift cards to this place! We've been to two other locations (w. charleston and e. russell) but lately we've been coming to this one the most. The service is always good here. There is a Happy Hour promotion on weekdays only at all locations. And don't forget National Flip Flop Day- done for charity, and is just around the corner.Very new and clean.  The facility is excellent.  Definitely would be coming back everytime I visit Vegas.Best place to relax after a long drive. They have so many different rooms to explore. Definitely will be back on my next trip to Vegas!Have bought 4 sets of tires here. Great service, friendly and helpful..Good value/prices,not to mention lifetime rotations..All rare traits in this industry,Took the time with my wife to explain everything that was going on, and why he was testing and how all the tests work...

Didn't mind that I was in the examination room and acting all worried about the exam. He was there to explain all the ways the eyes function and lose their ability to see over time, and really gave awesome explanations of it all.

Was very up front with options about contact lenses and didn't push to get extra work like a contact exam, instead told us to take time and get used to the first pair of glasses and then consider additional options.

Also took extra time to ensure that the final prescription was properly done, something we have had other doctors fail to do. Nice to be able to "test drive" the future glasses.

Great doctor. Very nice and genuinely COMPASSIONATE which you do not often get in this crazy world of ours.

Thank you over and over Dr. Roter for your help. 
You definitely have us as clients as long as we stay here in Las Vegas, and maybe even if we were to move out of town!I love this place!  Life is short - we'll start with dessert first:  I have not had a bad dessert here!  The Red Velvet cake is awesome, but once you've tried that, you HAVE to branch out to some of the other varieties.  My favorite so far has been the chocolate banana, followed closely by the chocolate peanut butter.  Did I mention that these are vegan?  I truly don't know how!  

The entrees have been really good as well.  The chicken curry was amazing, with just the right amount of spice.  The mac & cheese was very cheesy, but not really to my taste.  The quacamole appetizer is excellent, however, with some spicy jalapenos thrown into the mix. 

I've had the mojito tea a couple of times, and it's pricey, but really good!

We'll be back - again and again and again!!!To trash this place is to not understand what a good breakfast place is. The wait proves their worth and the dishes are prepared to perfection. The only real downside is showing up late on the weekend. And the OJ is not unlimited refill. All in all, one of the best in town especially with the local coupons which are usually B1G1Great Chicago style pizza!  A+ in my book.Highest of recommendations for this place.  Superb flavor, great prices.  Perfect spot to grab a bite before a ball game downtown (not near the rail line).  

Just know what to expect-- it's a deli counter in a middle eastern market in a "questionable" neighborhood.  The tables are aluminum and rickety, so I usually take it to go.

The hummus is the best in town, as is the pita.  I usually take an extra order of both to bring home for the week.  The baba ganaouj is good and very smokey, but I prefer the hummus.

I've tried every sandwich on the menu.  The best is the chicken shwarma.  Rotisserie chicken, shredded and seared crisp on the griddle, then folded into a pita with garlic spread, tomato, lettuce and pickle.  They are small and amazing, so I always get two.  The beef shwarma is also good.  

The kebab sandwiches are very tasty, but the pieces of meat are huge and difficult to eat in sandwich form.  Better off getting kebab plates.Shop here, shop here now.
Shop here, shop here, shop here now.
NOW NOW NOW NOW NOW.So apparently if you're reincarnated as a cow you want to be one of the Kobe sort, which is a special breed of Japanese cattle that is given beer daily and a massage so the meat is more tender (thanks Wikipedia!).  All of Burger Stop's meat is Kobe - nice. 

After reading Joseph A's review of this place my red meat alarm went off and I decided to check it out for myself, and they do a fantastic burger.  Everything is made fresh daily.  So for $12 I got a double patty, fresh cut thin fries, and a soda.  The bun was toasted and slightly crunchy.  Perky avocado and onions.  It was lovely.  

I forgot my camera but I'll post a pic next time.  And yeah, the owner/cook does look like George Carlin and although I did not overhear him say any of the 7 words you can't say on television, he'd probably make a good Vegas impersonator.  

The one complaint is it takes a little longer than say Fatburger to get your order, a good 15 to 20 mins, but there were a couple of orders in ahead of mine.  And it's worth it when you know its gonna be good.

Just a simple easy place to get a nice solid piece of red meat.  Corner of Trop and Eastern.It looks like this might be a monthly type of place for me. Being slightly over one month since last visit and with the economy sucking even more, I was curious to find out if the place was still open and if the food was still good. 

Yes and Yes 

I had the chicken salad on wheat, pickle and kettle chips. Oh and the cookie. The sandwich was good size, plenty of substance and tasted great. The kettle chips were good but I am not a huge fan of chips. The pickle was garlicky yum and the cookie was great. 

The staff is really cool. The younger server/hostess is a little rude seeming but I think it is her parents place. I can't blame her! 

See you next month.-- ONE YEAR UPDATE --

Still consistently good. Love this place. There is always a groupon available. Definitely a good deal. Me and the wife always get 2 meals out of one dinner here. MUST EAT!!This is my go-to grocery store, next to Smiths, that is. The store is always kept clean and neat. They have quite a few clearance sections and all sales are always clearly marked. The employees are super friendly.

Don't go when it first opens though. A lot of elders crowd the door the first thing in the morning to get the clearance stuff. You don't want to knock over your grandma, would you?! 

This store is highly recommended.Fresh and Easy is not your usual grocery store. The concept seems to be to severely limit the amount of staff and thus reduce prices by saving on labor/wages. 

With that in mind- I really like it. The store is smaller than a mega mart so options for some things are limited. The check outs are all self serve, and it looks like there are only ever 3-4 people working there at any given time. If you walked up and down every aisle shopping the whole store would probably take you 20 minutes. 

Their meat/produce is actually pretty good and reasonably priced- no kobe beef but its not exactly garbage either. They have lots of pre-seasoned meats for fast meals and useful gourmet items like precut pancetta that you won't find at a Smiths. 

They also oddly have a pretty big foreign food section - lots of British candy/food if you like that sort of thing. 

The freezer section is pretty limited due to size- not a great place for getting frozen meals or any of that nonsense. They used to have really good sweet potato fries but have not had them the last few times I was there.


And they have golf cart parking!Best locals bar in Vegas!  16 beers on tap! Nearly 30 bottled beverages! Friendly, fantastic bartenders! This is the 'Cheers' of Las Vegas - staff and clientele are super friendly and appreciate their business.  There's food, drinks, and sports.  Juke box, Golden Tee, Pin Ball, Pool Tables, Beer Pong, and Pop-A-Shot Basketball/Football.  They are great with groups and have special events weekly, including Karaoke, Comedy, Poker, and Pool Leagues.  This is a dedicated sports bar that will accommodate any request, if possible.  Give this place a try!Another yelp treasure. How else could I have known about this great company? Brent was great, helped schedule a quick appointment. Tile and carpet needed to be cleaned for sale of my home. Great job. They did come back once for a touchup but it was painless and very much appreciated. I would recommend them in a second.Gabe did a fantastic job cleaning the tiles in my house and color sealing the grout.  His work was very meticulous and he stayed late to get the job done right.  The price was very fair and Brent was very responsive to my needs.  He called me first when I had forgotten to specify what color I wanted the color seal to be.So I have been frequenting this shopping center since they started slowly opening a few places at a time a few months ago. This center is looking to be the creme de la creme of North PHX shopping and dining. Its better than across the street on the South side (Applebee's, Olive Garden and the worst offender Logans Roadhouse bleh!) Yes there are chains over here too but what can you do?? With the only Paciugo Gelato in AZ I cant complain! Check my Norterra list for a feel of some things you will find here. There are still quite a few places left to open like Ah-So for sushi and Miami Rice Pudding! It's definitely the best stuff we have seen up around these parts!!!I love this grocery store. Fresh prepackaged items.
They're lemon cilantro hummus is killer, I love it with they're pre cut packaged jicama sticks. They also have a fabulous and well priced wine section. The store is located right on the corner of 7th ave and Indian school, perfect location to swing in and grab a quick after work fresh meal. I love you fresh and easy;)I have only been to Covet once and that was because my hair guy-Joel Porter (formerly of Salon Jo-el right across the street) recently moved his salon into the Covet store.  The store seemed awesome and they have a great selection of men's shoes.  I highly recommend going to see Joel, Jamie or Cassie have your hair done though! And then you can check out the store!We got married here in June and it was a wonderful and positive experience all the way around.  :-)  Annie Singer was our wedding planner and she really worked with us to make sure we had the wedding of our dreams.  Every time we asked for something above and beyond, Annie delivered.   She was also good with offering a good and fair compromise when it was necessary to keep within budget or to adhere to MGM Grand policy.  She had great ideas and working with her was joy. :-)  We wanted our reception to be held at the Skyloft Suites at the MGM Grand and even though that's not normally done, they went out of their way to help us secure our room reservation at a good rate.  Additionally, the photographer was amazing.  He was charming, friendly and took the best pictures!  We didn't even need touch ups.  He looked very young (maybe 18 or 19) but you can't argue with quality!   Thank you for a wonderful experience.Seriously.. who can beat the prices?   They match online prices... good quality knowledgable service... cant beat it.  I send all my friends here.I went there for lunch the other day and had the curry goat and 2 beef patties which I did not see on the menu, but requested after seeing on this website that they had them.  Everything was excellent!  I usually eat curry chicken when I eat jamaican food, but at the bartenders recommendation, I tried the curry goat and was not disappointed!!!  I can't wait to go back for the buffet!!!I was given a groupon for a one hour facial and upper body massage as a gift for Facelogic. When I got there, I checked in on my yelp app, and a coupon for a free brow waxing popped up. They let me redeem it to use with my groupon with no problem, which was great! I've only had one other facial in my life so I don't have much to compare this one with, but it was a good experience. Jackie did my facial and she was sweet, professional, knowledgable & had great recommendations for my skin. The staff were all friendly, the atmosphere was dim, quiet and relaxing. I really enjoyed my time here and will probably come bak in the future.OMG!  My first 3 star expereience and my longest meal ever.  16 course meal for 4 hours.    Starting from the cart of all different kinds of bread to the full cart of petite desserts, I was so impressed that I forgot to take pictures!!!  ahhh.... 
Overall, it was definitly a great experience.  I wanted to steal that cart of dessert and bread home!!  
YUMMY YUMMY YUMMY!!!Opulent is defined as luxurious or ostentatiously magnificent and I can think of no better single word to describe Joel Robuchon.  From you moment you first step into foyer, you know this meal is going to be ridiculous.  Even all seating, walls, and decorations are in diffuse shades of purple, the majestic royal color.  Most of the starred michelin restaurants are french restaurants with not-too-dissimilar sounding menus, so you may as well go all the way to the sole 3-star restaurant because it's worth the trip.

We did not do the 16-course degustation menu (I have a reason to come back...).  Instead we opted for the "pick 2 main courses option" and all the extra courses surrounding that.  Here's what I got:

1.  First off, the bread cart comes around and there are literally probably 25-30 different kinds of bread on it.  You can pick as many as you want, all fresh and wonderful.  They take your selections away to heat them, and bring them back promptly.  I went with the milk bread, bacon bread, and rosemary ciabatta.

2. The amuse bouche was osetra caviar layered on top of a crab gelee with fennel cream.  Probably the most ridiculous amuse bouche I've ever heard of.

3.  Appetizer: King Crab in Avocado on Romaine Heart, with olive oil.

4.  Soup: Chestnut cream soup over chestnuts, foie gras, with bacon foam.  (Read that again... BACON FOAM!)

5.  Main Course #1: Duck Breast with seared foie gras.  This is easily the finest cut of duck breast I've ever had, and perfectly prepared.  Duck is so hard to get right, and even in NYC there are only 2 places where I really like it (Porterhouse and La Sirene), and this blew both of those out of the water.  Succulent, tender, flavorful.

6.  Main Course #2: Kobe Ribeye with wasabi spinach and malibu bell peppers.  Also, they served it up with a side of Robuchon's specialty whipped creamy potatoes.  They're like mashed potatoes, but your grandma never made mashed potatoes this creamy before.  I wonder if he patented some special machine to do this.

7.  Then the cheese cart comes out, and it is as full of choices as the bread cart was.  Remember, everything here is about luxury and extravagance, so you can take as many different cheeses as you want to try!  I posted a photo of it if you want to see what it looks like.

8.  Dessert: Pineapple Compote with Peanut ice cream.  What a unique flavor combination, but it worked really well.  The ice cream was as thick and creamy as you'd expect it to be.

9.  The crowning end to the night is the cart of Mignardises.  There are numerous pictures posted of this, and you pretty much have to see it to believe it.  If I thought the bread and cheese carts were awesome, then this set of sweets is absolutely incredible.  Save room because you don't want to miss this part of the evening!Worth every penny. 

Lots and lots of pennies.

Like, LOTS AND LOTS....

Would i come back here? Pardon my French but EFF YEAH. I can't wait to come back here.

Highlights: 

Bread Cart. 
La Langoustine. 
Le Canard (FAV!). 
Candy Wagon!!!!"No hassle.  Great Service.  Over and Out."
That's their slogan and seems to be the case!  PHX people may see their sexy cars touring round the streets.  I found it hard to classify this and though they can get Web Design done, they are actually a HOME SERVICE to fix any MAC computer issue you may have.  They leave the other Apple service companies far behind on all counts...I went for the first time today for their Sunday All-You-Can-Eat Brunch and it was EXCELLENT! Ang sarap! They had everything from tapa to tocino to arroz caldo and longganisa. I cannot wait to return and try some of the items on the lunch or dinner menu.Carmax = BEST. CAR BUYING EXPERIENCE. EVER!!

Previously I tried to buy a car at Showcase Honda and gave the car back out of disgust and frustration. 

When at Showcase Honda, I advised that I expected to leave with a full tank of gas. I was told they do not put a full tanks of gas in used cars.
Carmax had me double check my car before leaving to make sure there was a full tank of gas.

Showcase Honda did not wash my car before I left.
Carmax washed the carS BEFORE I TEST DROVE THEM. And then again before I took the car home.

Showcase Honda took 10 days to tell me that they had a different deal than originally discussed after I took the car home. And after that they changed the deal two more times before I finally gave the car back out of anger.
Carmax took 10 MINUTES to run my credit, then let me review each offer that came in and let ME pick which offer I went with. Yes, I got to pick my own terms and finance company. And then the deal was done. Finalized.

Showcase Honda proudly displays that the average time to sign paperwork is THREE HOURS. It took just over two hours to complete.
Carmax took 15 minutes for me to complete all the paperwork

Showcase Honda wanted 1 month of paystubs, a phone bill, bank statement and 10 references.
Carmax wanted 1 paystub and proof of insurance. That's it!


Some of you may have seen two other reviews I wrote about Milano Motors in LA and Showcase Honda in Phoenix (both reviews are in my list titled Never Going Back) and know I have a knack for picking shady dealerships to buy cars from. Carmax is NOT one of those shady dealerships.

Carmax boasts the tagline "The way car buying should be". It is absolutely, positively true!

I worked with Gavin B. first, found a car I liked, was qualified in mere minutes. So easy! Though the car I was trading in was paid off, the title still showed a lien on it so I had to get a lien release before I could take the new car home.

When I came back, I worked with Rob. I wound up finding an even better car that I LOVED, and was slightly more expensive, and got re-qualified for the more expensive car in a matter of minutes. Signing the paperwork took 15 minutes.
The car was washed and filled. The person I signed the paperwork was very thorough and kind.

I am so happy with my experience. I have no reason to ever shop elsewhere for a car.
If I could give 10 stars, I would!Great spot!  Food was excellent.  Had the prime rib which melted in my mouth and loaded baked potato, largest I have ever seen.  Great atmosphere at the bar and good service.My Schnauzer went it for a routine check-up and an ultra sound on a fatty cyst on her body.  I went to see Dr. Bower and he took the opportunity to look around some more and found bladder stones during the ultra sound and it was so bad, he recommended surgery immediately.  My baby was in danger. During surgery to remove them, there was a stone so badly lodged in her urethra that it required very skilled surgeons hands and experience to get it out or she would have been dead.  It didn't help that my baby was 13 years old at the time, so I was extremely concerned.  Dr. Bower saved her life and went in during the middle of the night personally to watch her very carefully -- not just leave her with a tech.  How many doctors do that??!  The care he gave her, the very complicated and difficult surgery he had to do (took three hours) has truly made him my vet for both my dogs for good. Also, the cost for the surgery was FAR less than any other vet in town and I'm grateful for Dr. Bower and his staff -- I'm a VERY happy customer.   I've known Dr. Bower for five years.  He is truly one of the nicest, caring, knowledgable and respected doctors in town and any pet is surely to be in the best hands.I was so impressed!!
I started with a cup of coffee, of course.  Ethiopian coffee is some of the best in the world and it was great.  We ordered from the lunch menu, which I thought was pretty extensive.  There were at least 25-30 different things to choose from.  Ethiopian food is served without silverware, and you pick it up with injera (a wonderful spongy flat bread).  It was a fabulous meal  We had a platter selection with two types of lentils, salads, cooked greens and a beef and green pepper dish.  All of which was wonderful.  The flavors are so dynamic.
The person who waited on us also cooked our meal.  We found her to be helpful and kind, and efficient.I don't think there's a golfer out there that would talk bad about this place. 

Once inside its easy to forget you're minutes from the strip. Service was top notch as you would expect from a course of this caliber. The guy that caddied for us was very laid back and friendly. 

The only thing I didn't particularly enjoy was the food. Save your money and eat somewhere else.This is one of the best chain restaraunts you can go to here.  My kids absolutely love this place for the atmosphere, peanuts, and those warm rolls with cinna-butter they bring to your table as your seated.

Staff here is always pleasant, and attentive.  The ribs here are pretty good and it is usually all I order when we go, went last night and decided to try something different.  I went with the sirloin tips served over sauteed mushrooms and onions. WOW!!!!  Absolutely delicious, much better than the ribs!!!  And for what you get, the pricing is right.  Portions are big and very satisfying.

We just enjoy this place, great for families!Our first visit was last Friday at the busiest hour on the busiest day and we were seated within 10 minutes.  The hostesses were wonderful and efficient.  The drinks were cold and delicious.  The service was great and quick and the server was very friendly.  The manager, Clint, was very attentive to everyone in the place and he stopped by our table at least 3 times making sure everything was great as we told him this was our first visit.  We will return often!  Thank you, Clint!
BTW... the food was DELICIOUS!The 11 oz. medium-well fillet was by far the best I have had, hands down.  The green beans were meh, but the garlic mashed potatoes were delicious.  A few Crown and Cokes and viola, $$$$, lol.  Expensive but worth it.  Will definitely be back.  Wonderful atmosphere, service, and most importantly, food.A return trip this past Friday with my parents.  Upping my previous 4-star review to 5 as the hostess with the attitude seemed to have had a refresher in customer service.  Again, everyone else on staff was excellent, the food delicious as always.We're all aware of the glitz, sin, and overall tempestuous nature of the Strip in Las Vegas. There are so many shows to watch, restaurants to be gluttonous at, and tables for money to be lost. But ever find yourself leaving a concert, like Boyz II Men at The Mirage, and have that groove, Motown Philly feeling reverberating through your whole body and soul?! Where you can no longer simply walk down the neon filled streets without your feet needing to tap and the tremble of notes urging to be spilled from your throat? If that's the case, hop into your cab/car/bike/tut-tut and head over to Chinatown just 4 miles away from the Strip to Karaoke Q Studio.

Deco: 5 stars

This place is found in a shopping plaza 4 miles away (about a $20 cab ride at night from the Strip) and doesn't seem like much from the outside, but the moment you walk inside, your ears and eyes are infiltrated by as much bass and darkness as any nightclub on the Strip. Signs advertising specials such as 2 for 1 sake deals are lighting up on clear signs reflecting ever changing neon glows. The walls are tagged up with graffiti frescoes of famous artists such as Tupac & Biggie Smalls. The air is clean, the furniture is fresh, and the atmosphere is alive. These are all the elements that welcome the beat thumping in your chest, ready to explode.

Rooms: 5 stars

The room selections they have are small, medium, and large and they're all LIES! The rooms are much bigger than you would expect. Although it says 5 people for a small room, without a doubt you could fit an extra two for that intimate feel. The rooms are also lit with disco balls, laser lights, and a sound system with as much bass as the subwoffer in a low rider. They take great care in cleaning out the rooms after each use and with extra napkins, two mics, and a tambourine, you're ready to party!

Food: 5 stars

Honestly, the food should probably be getting 4 stars but with the convenience of a full kitchen connected to this karaoke, you have the best of both worlds in this karaoke bar. You can get drinks, you get delicious Korean bar food like Korean fried chicken, ome rice, and donkatsu and all without ever leaving your room. The food is flavorful, crisp, and delicious. At least the Korean fried chicken was. Get it!

Service: 4 stars

The service here was very good. Perhaps it helped being Korean or perhaps they're always this friendly, but even with a busy list of people coming in to sing their night out, the wait wasn't too bad and service told us he'd call us when a room opened. Having some time to kill, my party and I took a hop, skip, and a leap next door to the bistro and had some tasty treats before heading back. Answered any questions we had and very hospitable. Even called us a taxi at the end of the night.

Price: 5 stars

With Las Vegas just a few miles away, you would expect the pricing to be quite high, but with a small room starting off at simply $17 on a weekend and $15 during the week, you won't be breaking any banks, or breaking into any banks for that matter, to pay for your visit here. You can simply enjoy your time and go buck wild for hours and hours!

Conclusion

Most people will never talk about a must go place off the Strip but Karaoke Q Bistro is a MUST for anyone who loves music, singing, and having fun. Your party can dance, sing, feast, and still have money for the slots later on during your stay in Las Vegas. So, find a great group of friends, get yourselves pumped, and go crazy at Karaoke Q Bistro. It's one night you'll have no hangover regrets over.


*P.S.: You also get a free small sake when you check in so don't forget to check in!*Awesome place to host parties or just to hang out with friends. Ask for Antonio he is really nice.The sushi is amazing.  It is made daily in the store by an authentic sushi chef.  The rolls are more beautiful and delictable than in most actual sushi restaurants.  Pricing is good too, 12 piece brown rice spicy tuna for $7.99 beats most happy hour pricing and the really fancy rolls are typically $8-$10.  

The produce selection is broad as well including an all organic section.

They also match competitor coupons.  I use the $3 of off $30 from Fresh and Easy when I go there.

They also have good prices on wine (larger selection than some wine stores)Best hamachi I've had. Their white tiger roll is pretty amazing too. All their ingredients are fresh and I am never disappointed here. The sushi chefs are friendly and funny, and the waitstaff is great. Try the Mexican for a change of pace!George's Gyros is the best! We gave it a try  a month or two ago and I have become a slave to their gyros since. It's quality meat and their bread is so fluffy and delish. I have attempted to finish a whole one and haven't been able to do so. They are really generous with the meat and its awesome because I usually save the other half for lunch the next day. I love their fries and they give you a good amount of those also. I love the original gyro but I have been smitten with the picado gyro since I love me some spiciness!  The staff is super friendly and it seems like they all work together as a team to keep the restaurant going. The cashier is very nice and periodically checks on how customers are all doing. She stopped and had a conversation and talked about how's my people become regulars (and I can see why!). I will be coming here for the rest of my life! Best gyros in AZ in my opinion!Think east coast sandwich deli, meaning really fresh, tasty, healthy sandwiches soups and salads.  All for around $7.  This place is hands down a great new lunch stop.

I've been looking for someone to open up a place like this near my house for years.  They opened last week.  Thank you Samz Market!

I'd describe the food as a deli, gelato, and specialty foods store rolled into one.  Spacious clean and locally owned its the perfect place for lunch.  I had "The Venice", which consists of French roll, delicious soft prosciutto, amazingly flavor full mozzarella,  and crisp fresh lettuce on tomato.  I'm going back tomorrow for one of the other sandwiches.

Atmosphere is clean-casual and relaxed.  Picture European style tables and chairs as you walk in, deli on the left, gelato counter in the back, and specialty food aisles on the right.   Bright interior with a spacious feel.

If you're tired of stuffing yourself full of greasy fast food or eating at the same place every day stop by Samz Market.  I cannot tell a lie, I fell in love with this place and I want other Yelpers to experience rare treats like this too.

Oh yeah and they have request cards so you can tell them what you like and have it magically appear in the market a few days later.I'ma go all out an give Ferragamo 5 stars for my two stops here last weekend.
Saturday, the mall is packed, not at Ferragamo, great service and water bottles to quench your thurst from the pounding desert sun.
Behold, the maroon with gold heeled boots I tried on in New York a few months ago and left behind not wanting to pay the $1600 price tag.
Last pair, MY size, $300!!!!!
Tried them on, swoon and put them on hold till later.
Yes, thats how I shop.
I mean, do I need boots in the summer? Living in the desert?
Yes, yes i do and drove back the next day.
Great service again, smiles, "Youre back!", tried them on again, swoon, happy as a clam, now they get to sit and look pretty until the temps go down again.Great happy hour. Food always the best.The nicest and most amazing people both servers and chef!  The lobster, filet and scallops combo is beyond delicious!  Also try the lychee brulee dessert!

Wayne GorsekI heart this place!!!!

It's an AMAZING place to go have dinner and then go straight to the club upstairs afterwards.  The club is super fun too!  I would suggest making a 9 pm dinner reservation & by the time your done the club is jumping-walla super easy!  I was impressed with the club's music and how nice it was!  The restaurant bar is good too for a pre-dinner drink they have a little lounge area where you can sit and relax as well it's complete with a separate DJ too!

The LAVO staffers are extremely friendly, very attentive and knowledgeable about the food!  The bouncers upstairs at the club went above and beyond. One showed me which way the restroom was, with his little flashlight, and almost basically walked me to the door.

Now the food-very tasty, in fact I have more visitors in this weekend & I had so much fun last weekend I'll probably take them there again.  We started with the beef carpaccio and arugula salad...they server garlic bread with tasty tomato sauce that I wanted to eat with my fork!  Was delicious!  We got the Kobe meatball and spaghetti dinner and I'd totally order that again.

This place is a go in my opinion.We love going to Paradise Bakery and now we have one even closer to us in the Goodyear Centerpoint (Pebble Creek & McDowell).  

Their food is very good, plenty for your $$ and different items on their menu.  Staff is normally friendly and they have a fequently visitor card to earn points too!

This location has outdoor seating and free Wi-fi as well!My kid wanted to go here for her birthday so that is where we went.  Jason was our server and was by far the best one we have had in a while. He was proactive and very attentive with a great personality. The food came out properly cooked and had flavor which is what one expects from a chain but doesn't always get. Definitely a great experience here.I love this place!  Disneyland for alcoholics!  This was my first Total Wine, but now I have one in my home state of Nevada.  Came back here to get Czechvar since they don't carry it at home, though, and was happy to pick up a 6-pack for 7.99 + tax.  Even better, I forgot to print my $1 off coupon and showed them the email, and the cashier instantly honored it without needing a manager.  Great customer service, great selection, great prices! (BevMo had Czechvar for $8.69+tax)Nice wine tasting event. Bought some new winesThis place is a slice of Italy. The service is awesome and only second to the food. Small, elegant and better than mama's cooking. Affordable and a little hard to find but worth looking for. Ask for John.We have been to the Nest and the Crypt but this one is our favorite!!This is a true gem! I took my dog there after bouncing around trying to find the right groomer for him. I read the reviews and gave this place a try. I was really happy with the customer service, the service performed on my dog, the fact I got a same day appt, and most importantly....my dog did not seem to be anxious or uncomfortable. He normally leaves a groomer stressed and not himself, but he seemed to be at complete ease here!This is a fairly new climbing gym and for the newness I was impressed. 
There were alot of creative routes which I had fun figuring out and also flailing on! It seemed that the walls were kinda short though, I am not sure how high they are but they seemed shorter than 30 feet. But all the fun routes make up for that. AND then there was the bouldering area upstairs. Boulder-er HEAVEN! It was huge! And I loved the caves! It made me want to be a boulderer again! 
All the staff was super friendly as well. My "climbing partner" bought a new pair of shoes from the little shop they have within the gym. The guy working there was really patient and helpful in helping him find the right pair of shoes. As those who climb know, the shoe finding process can take awhile! 
One very interesting thing about the gym is that they make alot of their own holds! As I was climbing I thought some of the holds were interesting and ones I have never seen before. I thought that was really cool! Alot of creative minds at this gym and I love it!
I will definitely be back to climb max. I just wish it wasn't so far away from where I live!D'Lisa is amazing. She is professional fast efficient, and very good at what she does. Her facials are wonderful and her waxing services almost seem painless with her conversation and making you feel comfortable.
I would reccomend her to anyone seeking waxing or facials. Her salon is fabulous and I give it 5 stars!Never had a brazilian before and to my surprise it didnt hurt that bad and it went by very fast. Would recommend to Salon D' Shayn to anyone!This little place just opened in a strip mall and you'd probably miss it if you didn't know it was there. Fortunately, I knew thanks to a well-timed coupon arriving in the mail.

The Cajun-inspired fried chicken is juicy with a crispy skin and just-right flavorings. I had coleslaw and mashed potatoes with gravy for sides and they were great. The gravy had just the right kick and the coleslaw was among the best I've ever tasted.

They also carry fried shrimp which I'll be back to try and they have many other sides including fried okra for those with the stomach for such things.

Friendly, helpful, and quick counter service in this to-go-only restaurant. It's small, but it has a big heart. It's part of a chain of restaurants, but this is the only one in Arizona so far. Here's hoping it's not the last!Amazing, amazing restaurant! My husband and I went here for my birthday and it was phenomenal. It was truly meat lover's heaven. There was filet mignon, flank steak, sirloin, sausage, chicken parmesan, and even bacon wrapped chicken all served by Gauchos with swords! Not to mention the salad bar is phenomenal! Huge selection. You definitely will not leave hungry! 

Before you go, sign up for the email club online and receive 25% off your first visit. Also, if you sign up, you get a complimentary dinner on your birthday! Pretty sweet deal!It's a little pricey, but well worth the extra $. Go for lunch on the weekends to save a couple of bucks. The salad bar is the best buffet in Las Vegas by far. Just remember to pace yourself and minimize the extraneous foods (salad, beer, etc.) to save maximum room for all the different meats. They're all delicious.Love this place!! I always get the #42 which is a kalbi and chicken katsu combo! It comes with rice, mac salad, 4 pieces of sushi (Cali crunchy roll), miso soup and a salad (that comes with their AMAZING house made dressing SO GOOD) Place is super tiny so if your planning on eating there you will probably not have anywhere to sit its best to call ahead of time and pick up like I always do :)This cafe was a pleasant surprise and hidden far away from the rest of the mall on the top floor of Nordstroms.  The atmosphere was relaxing, which was a blessing after spending a delerious part of the afternoon in the fashion show mall.

This cafe is essentially a cafeteria, but with much better food and all made to order.  I had an excellent grilled salmon nicoise salad, which the salmon was perfectly cooked and had excellent flavor.  The dressing was very tasty but not overwhelming and didn't drown the food.

I finished with a giant chocolate dipped macaroon, which was excellent.  Moist and not overly sweet.  I could barely get through half of it.

The food is much better than some of the tourist-trap restaurants on the strip for much less, and it's a good get break from the crazy strip and annoying tourists.Ive been eating here for almost three years and I've never been disappointed. Not only do they have great hot dogs and service every time but they are also a convenience store. Best hot dogs in Tempe. Id choose Thirsty Dogs over Teds every time! Less wait and juicier dogs!This is one of my favorite stores EVER! I've bought two pair of Smith sunglasses here, and both times they were ridiculously cheap. I got a pair today for $19.99 (I just bought a pair at REI for $119 that are almost identical) and a few years ago I bought a pair for $39 that had the $99 price on them.

I also love Spyder baselayers and ski jackets and pants. I always shop at ski shops when I'm skiing in Utah and almost always pay 3x what they're going for here.

If you like high quality ski clothes, this is a fantastic store! Can't wait for Black Friday!I think most women (and some men) know how hard it is to find a stylist that you can actually trust to not eff up your hair and I'm happy to say I have found mine!  Brittany Lehman is a Saint with Scissors (sorry I had to :P).  Generally my request to her when I go in is to "Make my hair hot" and she is always up to the task.  I'm always complimented after I've had my Brittany fix.  I'll follow that girl wherever she goes!The Malt House is simply the best bar in Madison. Well, it may not actually be that, but it is certainly the best beer bar in town and likely the state of Wisconsin.

My only complaint would be with regard to the amount of staffing. I have never (in approximately 7 or 8 visits) seen more than one bartender on staff (including Saturday evening visits). The option to bring your own food or have it delivered is quite considerate given the high octane quality of many of the beers offered.

I simply cannot say enough about the tap list and the regularity with which management rotates the taps. This is a bar worth visiting on a regular basis as the beers change at least weekly.I had the barg kabob and the masto khiar. Both were delicious. I even mixed some of the masto khiar with the rice to cool the jalapeño and it tasted great! The guy who ran the restaurant side was extremely well mannered and always made sure we were good. Also, every time he had an order up I noticed he always said "please" when speaking to the cooks! Finally, a place where respect and manners are actually practiced!!!Ever since I moved to Summerlin from California over a year ago I've been searching for a nail salon I like. I'm a very loyal customer once I find a place I really like, I won't go anywhere else. I had such a great experience at V Nails. The staff was nice and didn't try to over charge me or add things I didn't want and I never felt pushed. Also, and importantly the salon was very clean and they had a really good selection of colors. I did a gel mani and pedi and I go so many compliments from people about how the gel did not look thick and clumpy like some places tend to do. Thank you V nails!!The Sushi is the bomb!! Their sushi rolls are fresh and extremely yummy!! Gotta mention their sushi name is one of the kind. Kiss of fire, taste like my ex girlfriend, don't touch her mustache and way more creative names. Their services are two thumbs up!! I don't think you could found a better sushi place in Henderson area!!Great service and all the food was perfect.   Ordered the Ahi Crunchy Salad and it was amazing. Will come here again anytime I am in the area. I saw the Mac and Cheese2 and it looked great.I would not have known about this place, had it not been for the 'Best sandwiches in the Valley' edition of Phoenix magazine.  I decided to hit this place up this weekend, as I was planning to be in the area. It is tucked in to a corner of a little strip mall in Queen Creek.  If you blink, you might miss it, so pay attention.

We ordered the caprese salad as a starter, and it was delicious.  They make the mozzerella in house, and it was the best I have ever tasted! The tomatoes were fresh, and it was finished off with a basil pesto rather than basil leaves, which was a nice change.  I ordered the Italian Deli sandwich, it had salami, ham, provolone, black olives and some other stuff I can't remember. It was really good. My friend ordered the Cuban, it had ham and roast pork and it was AWESOME. Have you ever had sandwich envy? You know, when you taste what your friend has and wish you had ordered it yourself? Everything was insanely delicious with the exception of the potato salad.  I didn't care for it, however, it might just be my personal taste. We ordered some gigantic chocolate chip cookies to go and they were good, too.  Oh yeah, I forgot to mention that the bread is incredible...it's chewy and crusty and so good. 

The waitstaff were very friendly and I really liked the decor of The Deli.  It was modern, but relaxing at the same time. They have a patio for cooler weather, and it looks like they have opened a place next door that serves cocktails or wine, I am not sure.  Looks pretty cool.  I can't wait to get back to this place.  I have been in the valley for a little over a year, and this was the best meal I have had since moving here! Seriously, everyone needs to try this place. Just not all at once.  I don't want to wait 2 hours for a table.....Came here with my fellow Yelper Miss Lisa E, and very much enjoyed this upscale, fun, trendy restaurant.  Located within the W Hotel, makes a great spot for happy hour with friends, or a date night. The way the food is prepared, makes typically "scary" sushi a lot less intimidating for sushi rookies like me who don't typically eat things like octopus, eel, etc.  Everything I tried was quite delicious. I would suggest the fillet wrapped asparagus, and pretty much any of the rolls. The service was impeccable, its almost as if they knew we Yelpers, but seems like they are just that good! Looking forward to coming back.Found this gem through Groupon. The best dining experience we've had in ages. Food beautifully prepared and presented. Every course perfect. Appy's included Insalata Caprese and Calamari. For mains, two of us had the pan seared Alaskan salmon, served over a delicate yellow squash and zucchini risotto. One had Penne Pasta with chicken,(and lots of veg) and one had  Filet topped with crab and bearnaise, cooked perfectly rare. Wonderful wine choices. Service was very friendly and genuine. Would highly recommend this restaurant and cannot wait to return to share this with more friends.i've been making my way through the cheaper mexican restaurants around town for years and was just introduced to this place- I hope I'll never have to go anywhere else.  The tiny, rustic atmosphere makes you feel like you just left madison and wandered into mexico accidentally and the enormous delicious portions are so cheap- exactly the kind of unique experience that makes this place stand out.We were just yelping looking for a bar to hangout and saw promising reviews on the piano bar. The twins came up multiple times and we decided to check them out.

Turned out to be the best piano bar experience for me and my friends were very really happy. The two backup performers are better than the twins, hands down. 

Some funny facts: the pianos were actually keyboards carved into piano wooden frames; one of the backup pianist came out looking like a cheap restaurant chef but turned out to be more amazing than the twins; the pianists were dueling, so was the crowd - this time specifically it's Texas vs Detroit; everyone was singing along clapping standing up and having lots of fun.

To round up, if u are looking for a true happy hour look no further. In fact, make it 3 hours, or the whole night. U will love the crowd the pianists and the boisterous atmosphere. Highly recommend staying at least an hour for the backup performers who are the real stars - amazing piano dueling, great working the crowd, and adept at making you pay more for song requests while feeling awesome doing it!

Some tips: the twins and the backups take 1 hour turns, don't walk away if u thought what u saw was good enough; u can pay 10 bucks up for song requests, but be prepared to bid up!; it's only 5 dollar cover charge, says need 1 drink minimum but no one really check cos they are too busy having fun; take a walk around the area - great vibe; remember to stop by at the rockhouse open bar just outside the waitress is really hot.

Where happy hour is redefined.The cheapest fruits and vegetable in the valley.Food is not bad, service is good and bad, depends on what time during the day you are going. But this is the BEST place to get Boba in AZ!I am writing this review with regards to what this place is. It is essentially the nicest golf course/community kitchen and restaurant I have ever experienced. The clubhouse is very nice, and the staff is amazing although I have never actually dined in the clubhouse, just ordered for delivery. I currently live in Rhodes Ranch and (all battles with the HOA aside) this place typically outdoes itself with most items on the menu. 

I've only ordered from them twice. But....
Delivery is FREE for residents of Rhodes Ranch, they deliver all day until 10 pm...and here's the kicker, the golf course cart girls do the deliveries, and if you have never seen them let me just say they are easy on the eyes. 
The first time I ordered the Philly. It was decent but not amazing just because they failed to properly slice the steak up so it was a little tough.
The second time I got a Patty melt. This, I would definitely order again. Fresh toasted rye, and the patty was perfect, and it came with a side of shoestring style fries. ($8.99 & $8.49)

But this place is no ordinary club house sandwich kitchen. I've sampled their entrees ordered by my roommates like the build your own pizza or the chicken parmesan. 
You can even get a bucket of steamed little neck clams.
You can have steak and eggs, a glass of OJ and coffee delivered to your door first thing in the morning for about $14.
The food is priced in the neighborhood of applebee's but far exceeding in quality and quantity.
I'm not saying this is 5 star dining, but when you consider the Free delivery of a huge selection of items and it is coming from a golf course kitchen It is pretty amazing. I've never been to an elite golf course for lunch or dinner, and when I play courses I usually stick with a dog and beer at the turn. But if you are playing Rhodes, make the extra time to grab something after 9 or 18. You won't regret it.Came in for a return and had the best time with Melissa.  she was very helpful in selecting some tea.  always love coming in here.Today was my first trip to sunrise coffee and to say I was impressed is an understatement. I have known about the shop for quite some time, knowing that they have an abundance of vegan coffee options as well as breakfast foods. However, I have never made it over to the shop because the menu online, while offering a number of vegan breakfast options, never really hooked me. 
Well I finally went and... WOW! The staff was super friendly and helpful, offering up their ideas for what coffee I should get as my first. I went with a simple almond milk French vanilla iced latte and got my bf a regular iced caramel vanilla latte. Their fresh baked goods display hooked me, and I couldn't walk out without a chocolate coconut muffin (gluten free AND vegan!). They had an amazing array of vegan baked goods and their menu is even more extensive than shown online. I cannot wait to go back and enjoy another delicious iced latte such as the smores or Nutella flavor, and try a gluten free/vegan bagel. Mmm.What a great concept!  Fresh, healthful food with a wide ranging menu that offers plenty of options for vegetarians, vegans and omnivors. Could not be happier with every aspect of my meal -- delicious local greens salad; vegan pizza with rich tomato sauce on a tasty organic flour/spelt/flax crust; and a chocolate soy ice cream. Nice selection of organic and bio wines.  Very reasonably priced. The only complaint was a slightly wobbly table.  But for someone from Boston to be eating such a wonderful mean outdoors at 8pm in mid-Feb, it doesn't get much better.Always fresh food and the staff is always friendly and helpful.
The resturant and bathrooms always have been very clean also.
I LOVE the Quinoa Taboulleh salad! Yummy!
Its a nice change of pace for vegans, vegetarians and gluten free meals!Great place to take kids who love trains. We moved to Las Vegas in August and have been twice. The train ride is short but my 4 year old son loves loves loves it. The second time we went was for the Halloween train. It was a great experience both times and everyone is extremely friendly. We look forward to going back for the Christmas Train.So glad we found this place on Yelp. Seriously our favorite breakfast. So much better than The Place. My boyfriend is already making plans to go back tomorrow. Ha!I give this place 5 stars based only on their perfectly perfect Eggs Benedict and their flat white coffee. Both are so good that it's all I ever have when I go  there.I love this pub. I love the fact that no matter when you go in, you can get a friendly atmosphere, have a good laugh, and really enjoy your company. I love that when I come here, I dont have to make an effort, the feeling is so relaxed and laid back. I love that this place does great food - from burgers with as many toppings as you can think of to chilli con carne and rice. I love the pub quiz here on a monday evening. I love the banter with the bar staff. I love the secluded booths and the open seating areas where you really get to know everybody.

Over all, I love this pub. It is my most favourate in Edinburgh.What do you want from a sandwich shop? Well, if you can start with a love of sandwiches, it's a good sign. Caffe Espresso - Bingo.

The "Number 9" baguette has long been legendary in my workplace and so I toddled in with high expectations. When the lady before me ordered something simple, the man behind the counter served her with cheery mock-disapproval, claiming that the order was not a sufficient challenge. When I then asked for the legendary Number 9, he lit up. "The Number 9? That's my BABY!" he declared in delight, and immediately set about compiling its various delicious ingredients for me (grilled chicken, taco sauce, cheese, rocket and jalapeños).

I don't know about you, but for me, a fellow who can talk so passionately about a sandwich is definitely the person I want making my lunch.

His infectious enthusiasm led me to explain that this was my first sampling of the legendary Number 9, and his mood elevated still further. "It'll change you," he promised, and began explaining the spiciness options. I pondered a moment over Entry-Level or Smokin'. "You know what," he continued, "I'll do you a half-and-half if you like!"

Oh, I do. I do like. Thank you.

I had a moment at this point to glance around the weeny shop - about the size of my bedroom, the walls covered in boards reciting the most mouthwatering sandwich combinations imaginable and some pretty spectacular-sounding smoothies. It's homely, colourful and cheerful, with even a tiny bit of space to sit and eat if you can't bear to take your sandwich away from its birthplace.

For less than £5, I was - as promised - lifted to a higher plane of sandwichness. Another previously Un-Number-Nined colleague, beholding my delight as I returned to my desk consuming the legend, ran straight out to get one for herself and found herself equally transported. 

I don't think I've ever been so overwhelmed with joy by a mere baguette; while the enthusiastic service and jolly establishment go a long way toward this score, the proof of the sandwich shop is in the sandwich. The baguette: warm, crusty and soft. The filling: rich and perfectly balanced. Don't expect to eat it elegantly, though; there's a lot stuffed into that baguette and it tends to behave with the same wild exuberance as its creator.

I can't wait to try the rest of the options on offer, and some of those amazing-sounding smoothies. Until then... this has been a YUMinator review, starring Sarnie Schwarzenegger. And believe me, Caffe Espresso: I'LL BE BACK.One of my favourite pubs in Edinburgh with the Meadow Bar. Had a fantastic 29th birthday last year where I managed to reserve the whole corner upstairs. The bar staff are really friendly and you can get decent grubs. There's always some nice specials that cost just a fiver.

But I also think, surprisingly, that they make some of the best burgers in Edinburgh. It's surprising given the place is not reputed or marketed as a "food" venue, but it's worth giving a try.

It used to be my local pub when I stayed in Tollcross, but given the quality of what's on offer in Marchmont (never been a fan of the Earl and the Argyll), I'm happy to keep calling it my local. After all, it's only a 10-minute walk.I've been to Elephants and Bagels several times over the past yhear and it always delivers the same great service, tasty and decent prices.  It's linked to the restaurant 'The Elephant House' next door, but distinguishes itself through its bagels.  
The interior decor is inviting whilst the service is friendly and efficient.  They serve a range of sandwiches, soups, paninis and salads which all look delicious.  I usually go for the tuna mayonnaise sandwich which is served on tasty bread with kettle chips.  It only costs about £3 and goes perfectly with a cup of tea or coffee.
Elephants and Bagels is great for its central location, cosy environemnt and delicious food.The staff here were so friendly and helpful and really care! My coffee frap was gorgeous as usual and the views from this branch are simply STUNNING.The Museum of Childhood will always have a special place in my heart as it's where my mum used to take me every summer when I was little. My mum loves cuddly toys, dolls and even has her very own teddy bear collection so whenever I think of this place, I think of her... it's as if my mum is synonymous with the Museum of Childhood.

They have some amazing toys in here and best of all, a visit here is absolutely FREE! 

I've been here so many times that I've lost count but it was only on my last visit that I discovered a glass cabinet with three cheeky toy monkeys inside, there was a note beside them saying that they were the stars of the story; "The Royal Mile at Midnight" which tells of all the toys in the museum coming to life at night. I couldn't believe I'd never heard of this before so on my way out I had a look around the gift shop to see if I could find a copy of the book. I couldn't believe my luck when I found a copy in the bargain bucket for 50p! It's such a cute story and the next time I go back to the museum I'll think of all the toys in a different light. Especially the skeleton who is apparently partial to the odd cup of tea.Following Claire L's recommendation I thought I'd try this out with pals (as I am also gluten free) now I can't say I've ever been a big fan of chinese due to the msg thing but we were all delighted with the food, the choice was really varied and some new and unusual dishes along wtih what you come to expect! While we got stuck in to the free prawn crackers they brought us out a compliemntary starter of deep fried chicken with lemon grass (which they'd made gluten free especially for me!) and it was delicious - will definately look for it on the menu next time! 

The restaurant was a bit quiet to start with but then it got really busy and was a good atmosphere, there's some good areas for bigger or more private parties at the back. If I were being slightly critical I'd say that the sudden increase in customers meant our starter plates lay for a bit too long but that just meant they were all very clean by the time they took them away! The crispy aromatic duck was fantastic as was the duck in orange n cointreau, everyone ate far too much as it was just to good to leave! Finished off with a nice wee touch of complimentary ice cream - not exactly gelato but it;s the thought that counts! Will definately be back!HOLE-LEE-CRAP.

This place is expensive.
This place is fancy.
This place is limited in capacity.
This place is AMAZING.

You absolutely need a booking to dine here. I saw several walk-ins get turned away during the course of our meal, even parties of just two people. Regardless of the configuration, there's only 26 seats in the place. We were lucky to nab a same-day booking for an early 6pm meal, on the condition we be up and out by 8pm.

(We just barely it)

Everything about Dubh Prais is exquisite. The menu, staff, ambiance and most importantly the food are all fantastic and expertly executed. I'd be so bold as to claim that it doesn't matter what you order; it's all going to be good.

I had a large glass of the house red (a Spanish rioja) and it was insanely good for a house wine. My main - a dish of beautifully medium rare Angus medallions in a sauce of pure joy - was unparalleled. How the chef manages to prepare so many dishes so perfectly boggles the mind.

The desserts? Decadent. The coffee? Ever better. I was surprised when told they only did drip coffee, but oh man WAS IT GOOD drip coffee. With some raw sugar and a couple of free refills, I walked away full and utterly satisfied.This review is for the restaurant and bar only, not having stayed there. 

Eat and drink here. It looks like it would be a tourist trap but it's a lovely pampering and delicious treat. I would absolutely return here over the Witchery and even the Castle Terrace, two other restaurants not really in my price range that I can't believe I ate at. 

The whiskey recommendations were sound, the waitstaff was sweet, and the food was delicious. I ordered and/or poached from my friend the smoked salmon appetizer, the haggis, the dry aged beef with whiskey and cheese sauce, and the cheese plate dessert. Amazing. 

Seriously, eat here. I can't wait for my next opportunity to do so.If you ever find yourself in Edinburgh, make the trip to Leith; it's only a short cab ride.  This restaurant is worth the short trip and it's also located near the docks in area that has been revived so it's a different glimpse into Scottish "suburb" life.  The food is exceptional!  Thankfully, Scotland next to  cold waters so you are able to experience seafood and local fish that are so fresh they are bursting with unbelievable flavor.  You will not be disappointed.  The staff is attentive and strive to make certain that you are satisfied.  We brought our toddler child here, the staff was so sweet, we almost asked if they babysat.  We loved this place so much that we went twice in 3 weeks.  Oh what a find.  Had it not been for the kind, old gentlemen strolling along the boardwalk in Portobello, we would have never found this gem!!!One of my favourites - Fergus loves a visit here too. It's a great local, on our park route - and we get to walk home along the cycle path, through the old railway tunnel, which is always fab.

Great range of beers, with Black Isle always on tap (Blonde - stay away from lagers and try this beauty!) and a good range of wee cubby holes to sit in, the big room at the back if you want a more typical pub vibe, or the garden if the sun's shining.

For a real treat, I get a bowl of chips (classic chips, not curly fries) and douse them in vinegar (there's proper bottles of Sarson's - a good detail) to enjoy with my pint - and if Fergus is lucky, he gets a couple too.

The staff are regular (isn't it lovely, to see familiar faces?) and really friendly - they love Fergus and always welcome him with a wee biscuit, the lucky boy. 

There's always a great selection of people - and dogs - in the Cumberland; it's a real slice of New Town life.Good atmosphere? Check.  Great food? Check.  Reasonable prices? Check.  All things you will find at Tex-Mex II on Thistle Street.
Last night was the second time I've been there and since it was so good the first time I thought I would like to go back for my birthday dinner.  We went with the full intention of getting a pitcher of margaritas, a main course and one of their delicious sounding desserts (their menu is on their website).
I love the quaintness of this place, there are about 9 tables in total with a colourful decor, making for a nice intimate dinner.  We ordered our pitcher of margaritas while we poured over the menu of delicious selections, trying desperately to decide what to order.  
While the nacho starter was VERY tempting, I knew I wanted to save room for dessert so we both decided we were content with our litre pitcher of frozen margarita (you can get non-frozen ones if that is more to your taste although I'm not sure they do a pitcher of them or not!).  They also serve some amazing spiced popcorn as a wee starter to each table with a food/drink order.
I decided to get the Enchillada de la Casa while my partner got the Gaucho Grande.  We were not disappointed.  The Enchillada de la Casa is two tortillas filled with a choice of chicken, shredded beef, chilli beef or vegetarian with a "ranchero" sauce and cheese. The ranchero sauce was tomato based, with cilantro, green onion, lime juice and chunks of yellow pepper.  I went with the chicken filling, which was beautifully spiced. It was so tasty! I also wasn't expecting the lovely side salad/rice combo that you get with the dish.
The Gaucho Grande was equally impressive and equally tasty. You get a generous helping of the Chile Colorado in a tortilla bowl as well as a pork burrito.  It also came with salad, sour cream, guacamole and all the fixin's. I tried some and based on my partner's reaction as well, it was amazing.
There are very very few occasions where I can't manage dessert. This was one of those times. I love dessert but the mains were so delicious and so filling that we had to call it a night.  It simply means I have to go back and maybe just have the Nachos Grande and dessert for my meal!!  
For all this food and drink our bill was £33.50.  You just can't beat that for very quality food and a pitcher of margarita that the two of us got the better part of three glasses each out of.  I highly recommend this place but make a reservation!!!Damn good pizza at a fair price plus you can get beer or wine!!!!!! Really what more can you ask for when eating pizzaWe never travel west without stopping for breakfast in Phoenix at US Egg on Baseline. We love the quality of the food and especially enjoy the protein pancake. This restaurant is always quick and friendly. We started traveling in the west 20 years ago and have not found a breakfast to compare with what is offered at US Egg. Try it when in Phoenix, lots of location but we stay near Baseline and go to that restaurant each time.LBS has become one of my favorite burger joints in town! The food is great, the service is always good, and their booze milkshakes are always tasty.

Their Happy Hour is great too! Monday-Friday from 3-6 all of their appetizers and salads are 50% off, and their drafts are $4. They have some great appetizers too:
-Potato Twisters, a whole potato spun and unwound then fried and served with fry sauce
-Spicy Potato Twisters, which have a ghost chili and haberno pepper puree sauce poured over them, along with cheese fondue, jalapeno slices, chives, and sour cream...they're super spicy and if you're congested in the slightest, these will clear you up in a hearbeat!
-Zucchini Fries served with roasted red pepper aioli, they are delicious
-Warm Sourdough Pretzel Sticks with cheese fondue and spicy mustard

There are a dozen super tasty burgers on the menu too! You can get any burger on a white or wheat bun, or ask for it bunless and have it wrapped in lettuce instead.
-The El Caliente, which is my favorite! It has pepper jack cheese, lettuce, tomato, red onion, jalapeno, avocado, and spicy ketchup
-The Smokehouse is really good too. It has BBQ sauce, white cheddar, lettuce, tomato, pickle, smoked bacon, and onion rings
-The Steakhouse burger is another great pick, it's peppercorn crusted beef with swiss cheese, grilled mushrooms, tomato, mixed greens, red onion marmalade, and horseradish steak sauce 

As far as sides, I always recommend their sweet potato fries, they're seasoned perfectly! Their alcohol milkshakes are worth checking out too. My favorite is the Mocha Milkshake, thou the Grasshopper Milkshake is also very tasty!

The service here is always very good. The main hostess on duty is always very nice and friendly. I've always had good waiters too that make sure you are served timely and always check up on you and keep the drinks coming.

For those insane people, they have two burger challenges here. One is a 6-patty burger with just about every topping on the menu on each patty, and is accompanied with 2 pounds of fries. That one is $30. If that's too easy for you, there's the 11-patty burger with all the menu toppings and is accompanied with 3 pounds of fries. This one is $40, but if you're a machine and can complete it within the time allowed they'll give you $100.I went here today as usual. busy busy busy. I was walking round the centre nearly everyone was smiling. Most shops in which I recieved good service. One place in pericular within here was a chemist called boots. I was looking for something and got directed to the right place. When I got to the chechout the cashier was very social with customer service and ready with a smile. I rate this 5/5 because I go to this place a lot as it's quite local to me and the service usually all in all is very good.Bliss, bliss, bliss.

I was given a voucher for Pure Spa for Christmas. My eyes lit up when I saw it as I love a bit of pampering and my mum had also been given one so we could indulge in a girly day of luxury. I've been to Nirvana Spa before so I knew the drill there, but wasn't sure what to expect at Pure Spa as there is limited info on the website.

Terri B has mentioned the booking process which I agree with. It can be difficult to get someone on the phone but persevere as it is worth it.

We arrived for our treatments. Our voucher covered us for an infra red spa, facial, massage and foot treatment (£55 of peak). The set up from what I can gather is timed so that if for example two people are having treatments then the idea is that you go in (have the changing room to yourself as there is only two cubicles), then go for the sauna (again you have that to yourself) and then go to the relaxation area before going for the rest of the treatments.

I actually liked this set up. It felt like I had truly escaped from the world and was in my own luxury cocoon. Like Robyn Z, I liked the sauna - having dinner planned at the Bon Vivant that night, then being in a sauna that can burn 800 Cal's an hour, was more than enough incentive for me to stay in and sweat it out for 30 Min's. There is a shower in the room outside of the sauna so you can de-sweat and a jug of ice water is provided. 

The treatments were amazing! The foot treatment was a foot scrub and moisturising treatment but it was the facial and the massage which done it for me. I do get massages fairly frequently now, but that's more for aches and pain treatments, rather than relaxation. The facial was tailored to my needs - I do use some Elemis products and it is genuine products used, no watered down versions or inferior products in Elemis bottles. The massage was a hot stone massage which was wonderful. I was nice and toasty in the massage bed and the oil and the stones hit all the right spots in a lovely relaxing way. My facial came after the massage and I actually dozed off. I've never done this before and given that I've been a bit of a stress head lately with work deadlines, then this for me was a measure of just how good the treatment was.

Little touches were noted. Therapists take their shoes off and leave them outside of the treatment room. I suspect this serves the dual purpose of letting others know the room is in use and also it was so quiet during the treatment, it was like the therapist was floating around the room, rather than walking, so minimising noise. Service was fantastic. Showers do need updating but this was a little thing and I genuinely can't fault our day.

So, we have already decided we'll go back and do the mother-daughter pamper session again as it was sooo good.One of the best meals my girlfriend and I have had. From beginning to end, everything was fantastic.  We had the Peruvian stew,  grilled  street corn, flank steak and  creamy grits. The food was a bit spicy so be prepared. Finished with the churros and milkshake combo and it was great. Drinks were tasty and service awesome as well! Highly suggested.We came up to visit a group of friends for lunch after dropping our son at the University of Arizona in Tucson.  They had selected this place based on reviews and word of mouth but nobody in our party had been.  They will be frequent guests now and we will be wishing we were coming to Scottsdale more often.  Our waiter was fabulous - very knowledgeable; chips were never left empty, guacamole was something I will dream about; meals were just amazing (I had the pork tacos and they were the best ever); the pumpkin bread pudding was the lightest most mouth watering dessert I have had in a long time; atmosphere was impressive.  I would highly, highly recommend.  we are in awe!Best southwest/Mexican food I've had in years!I can only imagine how tough it must be to be in a warzone, but it's nice to see a business supplying goods which the army generally don't.

The collection of supplies is massive, every single live saving items for all your nightmare scenarios (which unfortunately some people have to work in). Sleeping bags, tents, first aid, watches and some knives that are more like swords. They also supply Blood patches which is rarity in most survival stores.

Everything is really cheap, I would imagine some smaller items are nearly at cost price. Don't go to Tiso, come here.The biggest computer game store I've ever seen, Gamestation on Prince's Street is perhaps by default one of my favourite shops in the whole city. It's significantly larger than any other branch I've visited, and with a well-stocked retro section, it's a good bet for finding old obscurities as well as newer stuff.

They still didn't have two very rare Gamecube games I've been trying to find for ages though, so there's always room for improvement.I picked Miguel from Flores Air Conditioning solely on his feedback on Yelp and I'm glad I did.  He showed up when he said he would (I know, he's supposed to but not everyone does!), was very courteous and fixed what was a little issue without trying to sell me anything that I didn't need.

I highly recommend this company, from the service to the professional appearance, it was a great experience.  I will be doing all of my servicing with Mr. Flores from now on!I still love this place! We had the coolest waitress (Kelly) when we went for lunch the other day.  The veggie tacos and quesadilla are still bomb and salsa to die for!SHHH! It's not all about the books, there's coffee too!

Ever wanted a latte atop a four-story bookshop? Head up the crazy winding staircase worthy of a Harry Potter movie set, and discover one of the most wonderful little cafes on Princes Street.

Surrounded by hundreds of books and overlooking the castle through large stone windows, this is certainly one of the more unique coffee experiences you're likely to have in Edinburgh. Buy a book or bring your own, and enjoy a relaxing hour cuddled up with a coffee and a story.I must admit, I only ever have the seafood pho, cuz I'm a pescetarian.  It is always great!  Everyone is very friendly!  It's always a great experience!

It's very clean.  The kitchen is open to the dining area.  And even better, I've seen the employees eat there!  So you know it's clean.

Can't say enough about it.Yet another place I have lived by for 2 years but only just found out about!! The outside is very un-advertising & to be honest I thought it was some sort of bank until I went up close to it!! their selection is awesome... loads of stuff for vegetarians/vegans which is unusual for most local style shops. They have lovely healthy options, meaning just because I don't have any food in the house I don't have to have supernoodles & crisps for dinner!! slightly pricey but as to be expect from the quality/high brand products they are selling. The staff are always friendly too!Brilliant. Recommended by Jane Davidson and ALC for alterations then I had to head here to get two pairs of jeans shortened.

They can do alterations (eg. like shortening jeans) within the hour so there are some changing rooms for you to pop your clothes on, get stuff pinned and then adjusted.

I put two pairs of jeans in - pro-tip is to ask for your jeans to be done original style as this then makes the jeans look like they've never been altered. I popped them in at 10am and was back after a pot of tea at Eteaket to collect them. All done and ready to wear.

They also do dry cleaning. Prices not much different to a local place I had used in the past - local was £8, here £10.50 and I didn't get original at the local. I'll definitely use again :-)Great food, cool atmosphere, nice waitstaff, two can eat and drink themselves silly for under $100. One of my favorite spots downtown.We just returned from a great meal at Kona Grill. The macadamia nut chicken and teriyaki ribeye were perfect.  From the moment we walked in the door we had outstanding service from Trevor and Bud.  We could not have asked for a better experience. Thanks for a great evening.  We will definitely be back!Man I love me some Tommy's!Simple and fresh atmosphere, great background music, and DELICIOUS, unique food. Even the water was delicious (cucumber).

My husband and I went on a Friday night around 6:30pm and were seated right away, but had we come any later there would have been a wait.

We didn't get any drinks (I'm too cheap) but I'm definitely going back on a week-day for their drink specials.

We ordered the grilled vegetables and hummus to start (which weren't on the menu) and I'm still fantasizing about them. This was my favorite part of the meal. Then we had the chickory salad, also delectable. I don't even know what was in it, but it's clear that the chefs are creative and great at what they do. To finish off, we ordered the chicken and waffles. This was 100% my husband's doing - I'm not a huge fan of fried chicken, but I was still so satisfied with the starter that nothing could ruin my meal - for fried chicken, it was really good. And I loved the cheesy waffles!

Also, service was great. Fun experience!Tuck Shop is definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Phx. Everything is superb from the service to drinks to food to overall experience. Definitely go soon!LOVE. This is a must in Phoenix. Reminded me of CA cuisine with the use of fresh vegetables and ambiance.

Pros:

-great use of space, love the architecture here. 
-comfy sofas to lounge in for pre-dinner cocktails. Reminded me of being in a living room.
-GREAT cocktails and HH specials. They do their own mixes. Dark & Stormy was great.
-delicious salmon special. If they have it (it's seasonal), you must order.
-was told their fried chicken is amazing but haven't tried, you might want to check it out

Cons:

-possibly long wait on weekends and during prime dinner time

Verdict:

-Go, go, go. This is an amazing hidden gem in Phoenix.Tuck Shop is rad. The food is great. Laura the bartender is amazing and John the GM is pretty freakin' cool too. The Happy Hour is great with Four Peaks beer specials and my absolute favorite cocktail, the Vivian Ward (named after the famous hooker Julia Roberts played in Pretty Woman). You have to try this place if you're downtown, or anywhere for that matter. Don't miss it.I wish I lived in Phoenix, if only I could go to Tuck Shop every week!  The pulled pork sandwich was to-die-for, and the sides that came with it were great!  While you'd usually find such fare at a down-home BBQ joint, this meal was as classy as it gets--I had a glass of wine to go with it.  Very classy place--perfect for a date night or fun girls dinner!We took our daughter out to celebrate her 1st day of school and she wanted pizza. We had heard about La Calabria and went there. They do NOT serve pizza, but the hostess (I think it was the owner as well) convinced her that pasta and meatballs would be just as yummy and thankfully, today our 3 year old wasn't her typical stubborn self and  went for it...much to our delight as we had been wanting to try this place. THANKS GOODNESS!!! It turned out to be an incredible find for Italian food, locally owned 'mom and pop' type of place so close to our home.

We had some wine which was very good and reasonably priced. They brought out some soft and fresh Italian bread with some of the most delish olive oil/seasonings dip I've ever had.

The chef (maybe the other owner?) came out personally to serve our daughter her meal. He offered her the parm sprinkled on her dinner, after the 3rd "yes" of offering her more, he asked if she just wanted the whole bowl, which made her very happy. Us too, it was some of the best parmesean cheese I've ever tasted. So fresh and tasty. She loved the meatballs, said they were as good as Nona's (her Italian grandma) so that says a lot right there!

My husband and I shared one of the daily specials, a penne with a sausage and mushroom sauce. It was a cross between a red and a white sauce, sort of like a vodka sauce but not exactly. I don't think they make their pasta from scratch, but my oh my, you couldn't cook prepared pasta any better! It was done perfectly al dente and the sauce was simply INCREDIBLE, if I had just one word to choose. I'm sure it was more calories/fat than I would care to know...but it was so good I didn't care. It was also great that for a small fee of $5 they let us share, giving us both our own salad. The pasta portions were still very big, we each came home with leftovers.

We decided to go for it all and end the night with cappuccino and dessert. The cappuccino was perfect, nice and large with a wonderful foam. They have 4 or 5 homemade in-house desserts but the gelato menu spoke to us. We got the bananas foster gelato which was just delectable. Perfect banana flavor, not too powerful, served a little more frozen than usual, so it stayed in a wedge shape, and half of it was dipped in Italian chocolate and nuts. My mouth is watering just remembering it. 

If you live in Gilbert, or nearby Chandler and are looking for a family run restaurant, with a casual atmosphere and wonderful food, give this place a try...my guess is you'll be hooked. We can't wait to go back. Prices are about the same as Olive Garden or the like...not cheap but not expensive...pretty much what you'd expect. Oh and the kids meal was a deal at $5 with about 2 to 3 servings for the average child, and comes with a 'surprise' which was ice cream and made our daughter very happy, a great ending to a milestone day for her...and us!I have visited the grounds on about a dzn occasions.  They really offer alot to locals, (moi).  {See Jaqequeline H. rvw which goes into depth of happy hours, ect}.

FINALLY stayed here last wknd.  Summer rates are $125 with a $50 resort credit (quickly used on the Thursday Spa Special: Martini, Manicure, Hair Wash, Set & Styled $40).  Kids Club is awesome.  Borrow the bikes and ride around the property to get a good look at it, otherwise it's ALOT of walking.  (and you should see it all!  beautiful).

I think i had the room with the BESTEST view!  (pic on their brochures, actually).  

Service at front desk prompt, efficient, curitous & professional.  (for some reason, I had a bottle of champange & chocolate covered strawberries in my room?!  YUM :-)  i took it and didnt' dare ask any questions!  lol

Fitness facilities amazing.  

Luv the reasonable Crave Cafe for quick munchies, breakfast, bottles of wine, doggie treats.

The only problem I had was the hidden cost of a $25 resort fee which was tacked on and never indicated anywhere at any time to me apon booking, checking in - just appeared on my bill - 
Grrrrr.First, I like this place better than Texas de Brazil.  

Via Brasil has amazing service and warm hospitality.  I have always felt that the energy is very frenzied at Texas de Brazil--they are always very crowded and interested in turning over tables. 

Via Brasil never stopped trying to feed us and constantly made sure our experience was positive.  They pay attention to fine details.  For example, they periodically bring you a clean plate to start over with when you have meat scraps littering your plate.  

The meat quality is excellent and the servers always tell you that if you aren't ready for a meat they have, they will be sure to bring it back around later.  Additionally, one person at my table wanted one last piece of filet at the end, and they fired up a fresh skewer of them, just for him.

We went without a reservation, which was refreshing.

GO to this place!  You won't regret it!This is a fabulous place to go for a fun themed atmosphere without having to go near the Strip. I checked it out with a couple of my friends and loved it. The atmosphere is fun and relaxed, the people are friendly, the drinks are awesome (watch out for the 160 proof rum). Would love to come back!This is one of the best local, 'dive', themed bars in Las Vegas. And that's saying something. The only real Tiki bar in town and as authentic as they come without an ocean or beach out front.

From the outside it kind of looks like a bunker and the neighborhood looks a little sketchy during the daytime, but at night the place lights up with an inviting pink glow. 

Inside its dark and intimate (and a little smokey if crowded) with classic surf and tki music playing. Several tv's play random mid century modern, tiki/surf classic videos. From the playboy club in the 50's to Gilligan's Island, classic surf movies and some pretty strange stuff!

This place has the best rum drinks in town. They are rated by 'skulls' from one to five. The mai tai will drop you if you're not careful, and the sweet creaminess of the kahiki kai will have you drinking more than you thought.

Collect all 8 of the custom Tiki Room ceramic mugs designed by well known tiki artists. At $20 (which includes the drink inside) these are a great deal since these are REAL CERAMIC mugs and not the cheap crap they sell on the strip.Are you freaken serious 10 stars for you!!!! I had two of their 5 skull tiki drinks and yeah... passed out at midnight. In vegas?! Thanks Frankies.I'm a big fan of Murphy's Law, I like this place it has a good feel - it's comfortable.  Currently at 5 visits for lunch only and each time I've tried a different menu item, and 5 times have I been extremely happy with the food. 

I think the corned beef and cabbage sliders are my fav tho especially with the sweet bbq type sauce on top... hard choice but I love those things.  The sweet potato fries are awesome and now my only choice of sides.  The Cloudy Day sandwich is great and the Au Jus is killer.  The beef is good and no fat anywhere on it.   The Beef Stroganoff was like mom used to make it.

The inside of the place has cool deco on all walls and ceiling and lots of dollar bills stapled up too.  Lots of flatpanel tv's around showing sports and funny pics from the web that helps keep any conversation funny.  The place is like a long thin corridor - I haven't been there at night but I would assume with a lot of people it'd be interesting walking through that to the back where the bathrooms are.

The waitresses are always nice and the manager / owner seems to walk around a lot and make sure everything is good and jokes around too... nice guy.

There's already been comments about parking in previous reviews... and I agree - not entirely their fault but there's a big gravel lot a 1/2 block away that has ample parking. It's not really that big of a deal.

Last thought:  Look up Murphy's Law address on Google maps and hit Satellite view and zoom into the building... ;)  EnjoyWhen I need a good mexican food "fix" and I'm at work, I go here. It is just down the road & it has always been good. I always get their chicken tacos. They hit the spot. 
Plus, I gotta say, their chips & salsa are pretty delicious as well. 
Yummy food!Delicious food at a reasonable value, super friendly and professional wait staff, very clean, and nice atmosphere without being pretentious.  The "Classic Dinner" options state that they come with Caesar salad, mixed vegetables, and baked potato, but they are very accommodating and you can easily substitute another salad and/or potato choice.

The wedge salad is great, assuming you enjoy bleu cheese... the bacon-wrapped filet, well, what can I say - when you wrap one kind of meat with another kind of meat, you can't go wrong!  Even the standard baked potato was delish.  For dessert, they have these great shot glass desserts that would give you just a taste of something sweet, but of course I had to go all out and get a full-sized dessert.  The name of the dessert I got was something like "Billy Miner Pie."  Mocha ice cream on an oreo pie crust sprinkled with toasted almonds - divine!

Try this place... it's good stuff!Went to this location for the first time today.    A very surprising experience.    The atmosphere is very pleasing; place is neat & clean.     Went there for lunch; $5.95; servings more than plenty and the food was excellent.       I go to a lot of Oriental eating places and found this food to be at or near the top of my list.     Outside of Flo's; J & K food is tops.         Have seen their sign while traveling on Val Vista south of Williams Field.         Highly recommend you try this place.     I believe you will enjoy the experience.             I am looking forward to dining there again soon.Love this place!  It's the people from Cheesecake Factory and 24 hours!  And, even though, it's in the Palazzo, the prices are not that bad.  Nuff said!Very clean store. It is very well organised. I often feel overwhelmed in these types of stores, by I was fine here. The associates were nice. I will be back to this location. I definitely bought more then I came in for!Ok, I do love this place. It's just fast food so I don't know why...maybe just a vacation thing...don't know but I really do. Here are some possible reasons:

1. GREAT service..always friendly and is that not a rarity these days especially fast food???

2. so inexpensive for some really tasty food.

3. hooked on animal style...the sautéed onions...the pickles..the sauce...what's not to love???

4. the milk shakes are super good and don't taste "fake" like all the other fast food chains where I won't even get a shake.

5. the fries are real french fries...not frozen things thrown into the fryer...some sit down restaurants don't have fries this good.

6. this location (the only one I've been to) is kept super clean.

7. and the most important reason...to me at least...is the fresh brewed iced tea...super good and makes the whole meal even better. 

Well, until this chain stretches to the east coast, I will just have to love from afar...absence really does make the heart grow fonder and I would really like to have a number 2 animal style right about now....I have been to several of these located in various major cities in the US and my experience has been the same for all of them: worth every penny!

Come hungry and be prepared to leave fighting for your next breath (because you are full, duh)

Word of advice, be judicious with your choices at the salad bar, or you my not be able to savor each cut of meat that comes around.  For some reason, that elusive filet mignon seems to arrive when you've nearly had enough.  The salad bar is stuffed full of things that are not salad (of course it has various salads and dressings too).  Smoked salmon, Spanish Manchego cheese, and various fruits to name a few.

Another thing, also do not scarf down the rolls they bring to the table the first thing you do when you sit down...they are so good you'll keep eating them.

Lastly, just forget counting calories or trying to be healthy... accept the fact that this dinner is a treat and you'll work out some other time.As good as it gets FOR chinese delivery! 

this is my new fav kung pao chicken- i ordered it extra spicey and suggest you do the same. the guy on the phone recommended the orange chicken but he's crazy, it's not very good. 

i will def be a regular w that kung pao, yum yum yum!!!This place is close to my parents house in Cave Creek and whenever I'd drive by the joint looked deserted; like and Iraqi restaurant or something... Big misnomer. I went a few weeks ago and all I can say is WOW. Fresh, tasty and reasonably priced. EVERYTHING tasted fresh and was cooked to order. The margarita pizza combined with spicy Italian sausage comes off a bit salty, but hey, that's how I roll. I highly recommend them! (yes I edited this review. I didn't like my first one)Eureka! At last, we have found the cajun food we have been long-seeking -- homey, authentic, real deal stuff. Not fancy foo foo "takes" on cajun food. Not watered-down,  dumbed-down versions of cajun food. Just the good, real, stuff, lovingly, and painstakingly prepared with quality ingredients.

Yes, the po' boys are good. The bread is spot-on, the ingredients cooked just right. Even the spicy tartar sauce (ya know, remoulade) is right. But po' boys aren't too much of a challlenge.

The entrees will make you or break you. Since I've only been once (so far!) I've only had opportunity to try the crab landry - garlic bread, sauced with crab stew, and topped with a few fried shrimp.

I could not stop tasting and analyzing that stew. It was full of layers of flavor - smoky, sweet, spicy, earthy, a slight hint of briny - all cooked down and blended into luscious deep brown brew of deliciousness!

The dining room has all the atmosphere of a hospital cafeteria. Can we get some music maybe, at least? But I can easily deal with that, for the sake of the food.Wow haven't had such a pleasant dining experience in quite sometime.  First off to be fair to other so called Cajun places in the valley while you are quite good, nothing compare to true Louisiana Cajun and boy that's what this is.  

To start this is literally a mom and daughter joint!  They opened last year and are starting to get quite the following.  The location is a bit tricky but take the ten to dysart road make a right at Rancho Santa Fe and go into the parking lot of LA fitness and Walmart.  The restaurant is located right in front of the LA fitness.  We made the mistake of going to the other side of the road as most people do.  

Inside the decor is quite simple chairs tables, condiment table with forks hot sauce and napkins the typical.  One side of the wall is dedicated to Louisiana State football so if your a Louisiana state football fan you are in good company.  

The food is very good priced.  I started with the gumbo which had all types of seafood as well as rice and an absolutely fabulous broth.  It has to be the best gumbo in town.  They don't put okra in it which kind of takes away the traditional gumbo taste but the cook told me that they do that because a lot of people don't like the okra around here.   I loved it all the same.  Today was the special gumbo and it had fresh oysters in it.  Melt in your mouth Gumbo!

For my main dish I had the catfish, craw-fish and the red beans and rice.  The catfish and craw-fish were both spicy seasoned not spicy hot.  Which helps with not to take away the flavor of the meat.  I was stunned at how both of these fish had no fishy taste to them at all.  It was as if they were caught on the bayou and served to me minutes after the big catch.   The catfish was specially good.  It had a homade cornmeal crust fried to perfection and not goopy take away the flavor fried but perfectly lightly fried.   The craw fish were fried in an absolutely melt in your mouth buttery salty spicy batter again not to over bearing.  The fried stuff comes with some special tarter that is oh so tasty.  The red beans and rice will make you wanting more.  The texture is right on and the flavor is that southern spicy mouth watering rich red beans and rice like mom used to make.  They are addicting.  My girl got the catfish and dirty rice.  Again if you love dirty rice and I mean in a traditional way this is right on the money.  

Overall I think I found a new eat out place.  It is well worth the money and the staff , flavor, and tradition of eating in a place like this makes me wonder how I can bring my self to eat at a chain.  If you want a good home cooked meal with southern hospitality this place is for you.This spa is located in one of those expansive mall shop areas but it is worth the find.  Very calming the moment you walk in and are greeted by the friendly staff.

The "first massage" discount got me into the doors.  I was in town on a tennis junket with a buddy of mine.  We really needed a good kneading and we got it.

My masseuse was Christina and she was great.  I had a sports massage.  My buddies masseuse was Sheli and he also raved how well he felt after the one hour session.

So we give a big shout out for blu sol.Crackers is our favorite local spot for breakfast.  There is usually a wait on the weekends but well worth it and they tend to over quote the wait time and seat you sooner. To start, they have delicious coffee which is always a nice way to start the morning. My favorite dish is the California benedict with avocado, spinach and bacon. The ingredients are fresh and theprtion sizes are hearty. I've also tried other dishes such as the cinnamon roll French toast and crepes which were also yummy. I haven't tried their lunch yet but am excited to!Food was great,and it's a clean environment. The smooth jazz and classic funk helps digest the food,I think? All in all a great experienceWow. I just came back home from my first cleaning at Simply Dentistry. Hands down the BEST DENTIST that I have ever been to! I walked in and Brittany welcomed me by name. She was extremely friendly (genuine great spirit) and it didn't stop there. Waiting room was quiet with great lighting and fridge with water for waiting guests. Dr. Tran came to me on time and gave me a tour of the office. 

They have WiFI for patients and also a computer to access if you need to. Dr. Tran listened to my concerns and immediately came up with affordable options for my Tooth Sensitivity. Dr. Tran then introduced me to my dental hygienist whose name I forgot but she is from Poland. She was very gentle with my sensitive teeth and extremely friendly. 

I can't get over how great this practice is and how AWESOME Dr. Tran and her Staff are. I've never been to a dentist as good as Dr. Tran and I look forward to my next cleaning in 6 months! I can't believe I'm giving a Yelp Review for a Dentist but that's how good this office is!!!!!!!!

Don't hesitate. If you need a great dentist, check out Simple Dentistry. I am so glad this office was recommended to me!This is our favorite place to eat in Las Vegas!  We liked it so much we had our Wedding Rehearsal Dinner here, and our family and friends still rave about it.

My wife and I found this place on a lark one Friday night after a long week and we were immediately hooked.  The decor is inviting and classy, but not overwhelming.  One side of the restaurant features a bar with a couple of TVs, but they aren't distracting from the rest of the place.  

The wait staff is friendly, efficient and knowledgable in both the food and wine menus.  Daily specials are consistently unique and delicious and the specialties of the main menu are the Gorgonzola Filet, Orecchiette & Sausage and the Roasted Pork (it's about 2" thick and you can cut it without a knife).  

Bottom line: The service and food is on par with MUCH more expensive restaurants at a reasonable price (about $50 for 2 entrees and wine).My girlfriend and I went here the other day. The breakfast place we usually eat at called OVEREASY has good food but AWFUL service, and it closes at 1pm. We like to wake up around 1pm, so this doesn't work for us. I found this place on the internet and it's close to my house, so we decided to go for it.

THIS PLACE RULES! They have FANTASTIC service! We were chatting with the waitress Stacy for quite a while, and she was so friendly and helpful. My girlfriend ate the biscuit and gravy, which was a meal in itself, and she loved it. I had the classic eggs, hash browns, sausage patties, and toast. My family is from England, and we love bangers and mash, so I am always skeptical about the sausage at breakfast places, but the sausage patties were very good. Kinda spicy. The toast was thick and delicious.

GO HERE FOR BREAKFAST.This place is legit. Been going here for 5 years now and invite everyone I know:)XS is high-up on my list of favorite clubs.

I catch myself comparing any club with a pool, a fountain, or a waterfall to XS. Mainly because no one did decor better than they did. As far as decor, design, and beauty, XS takes the cake! 

ENTRANCE: As a local girl who goes out several times a week, ease of getting in is quite important. Usually, I'll go on a Sunday or Monday, their industry night. Walk-in is pretty quick and the list I'm on gets me 2 drink tickets. God knows a Crown & 7 tastes so much better when its free. 

NO GL ON WEEKENDS: XS doesn't need a guestlist on the weekends. They have a cult following of partiers. If my friends don't buy a table or my other friends who work here don't walk me in--I won't be found at XS on a Friday or Saturday. As a local, fighting lines is not my style. And weekends are pure madness here. MADNESS. On occasion, they'll close the pool area, and the main club inside gets too crowded for comfort.

MUSIC: XS took a page out of Surrender's book. I'm guessing the music directors had a meeting and decided to start sharing headliners contracts? Afrojack, Aoki, Wolfgang, Skrillex, Dada Life, the list goes on! If you're new to the EDM scene and jumped on the bandwagon in the past year, the XS line-up of artists will be right up your alley. HOUSE HOUSE HOUSE.

SERVICE: Bartenders are quick and get your drink right the first time. I haven't had any issues with credit cards charges here. If you're thinking tables, in my experience, the girls have been quite attentive.

XS is doing it right!

Don't forget to RATE & FOLLOW! ;)I really appreciate this club. The open air and the good crowd, and the awesome bartenders. Much much better than Marquee. Plus, you can stay at The Trump or Palazzo and walk here!

If you guys have a horrible girl-guy ratio, then buy tickets online for everyone. You get to skip the lines and everyone gets in because they pay already. Definitely worth it (went with 5 guys 2 girls). And we skipped the line. Weird.Porter Robinson was tearing up the dance floor!!!!!  If I had on flats, I would've have been too, like getting a good workout haha
There were also some idiots on the floor who don't care if they hit people while they were dancing.  My friend had to shove one girl to get the hint.  Good thing she did, that made the girl go away!My dear girlfriends took me to Vegas for my 40th birthday.  I was not going to write reviews about places I've been to in Vegas as they always say "what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas".  However, it would be a crime not to share this place with my other Yelp friends.  We had a fabulous time and the most memoriable 40th birthday ever (not that I had another one after this).  We drank, danced, and drank some more.  The music was great.  Beautiful/young people were everywhere.  I felt like a grandma in XS but that's a different story.  This club was huge with plenty of outdoor sitting.  The dance floor was a very good size so I didn't step on that many guys.  There were pools outside so you could even strip off your clothes and jumped right in when you're too drunk to know any better.  XS exceeded my expectations.  However, the drinks were expensive.  You couldn't really sit down indoor unless you spent a buck load of cash for a table.  I didn't come here to sit down so it's not a big deal.  I will definitely come back for my 50th birthday.OHHH! soooo goooood. loved dining here!

this is my second time... first being a 3 star i would rate it... but since I haven't reviewed it the first im basing it off my recent experience!!

service- great.

food- GREATER. wild mushroom tart... so flaky and YUMMMMayy. oysters, average.. haha, filet with lobster... grilled to perfection!!!!!! it was so tasty UNREALLLL!!! dessert, pass-able... well the ice cream truck was below average....

i didn't really care that some stuff were not that great but the good stuff def won over my heart. liked it more than SW. 

going back again in december!!!I love this spot.  Extremely fun, great ambiance, and very good looking waitresses/crowd.

Yes there are a good amount of graphic-tee wearing muscleheads and bosom-bearing harlots, but any nice spot in Scottsdale you're going to get your fair share.  If you can get beyond this, not worry so much about other people, and be yourself, this place is a blast.

There are Bud Light tallboys that they serve in paper bags.  They seem to have a lot of theme-days, for example, I dropped by during Oktoberfest, and there is supposedly Halloween week and all sorts of shenanigans.

The big wheel at the top of the bar is a fun time, in addition to some crazy options like "Get Kicked Out of the Bar", there's winning money and getting drinks (girls only).  One of the funniest moments I had in the bar was when a bachelorette party won $25 bux and they "made it rain" in the bar, that was hilarious and awesome at the same time.

Awesome, one of my favorite bars out here.Great Happy Hour, great menu, great people, and the best night club in OT after 10pm Wednesday, Friday and Saturday!!!  

Happy Hour is from Monday - Friday with specials that cant be beat! Delicious NEW MENU!!! Happy Hour includes 1/2 off all appetizers and liquor from 4pm-7pm with extended Happy Hour on Fridays until 10pm.

Saturday and Sunday, breakfast menu is available until 2pm and they also have $5 Redbull Vodkas, Mimosas, Mojitos, and Margaritas until 10pm.

Don't forget to stop in and try the NEW MENU items! Some of my favorites are the Chicken Pesto brick oven pizza, the skinny burger, the Brisket Sandwich, and the Chicken and Veggies plate!!!I was looking for a nice place to take the family to dinner last night. After reading the reviews and looking at the photos I settled on this place. Great choice!

The ambience was perfect. Nice and quite so you don't have to talk loud so your guests can hear you.

I was really surprised that on a Saturday night this place only had a few other tables with diners. You'd think a place like this would be packed.

The service is what really made this place great for me. I would rate this place in the top two or three restaurants I've ever eaten in as far as service goes.

The food was good to. Everyone in my party  of 6 enjoyed their meals. I personally would rate my steak a 4 out of 5. But with the kind of service you get here I didn't mind.

The total bill came to 274 and change for a party of 6. That includes one bottle of wine and a couple of other mixed drinks. So really not a bad price for a place like this.

If you're looking for a romantic place to take a date or just a nice quiet place to dine I would highly recommend Carve!Great breakfast dishes. Believe it or not you can have any dish without eggs and they will substitute fruit.  All the staff are efficient and friendly, but Candice really stands out.I absolutely love this place!!! Donna was our waitress yesterday and she is fabulous. She regularly checked in to make sure we were okay, and our glasses were never empty. Can't wait to go back!The food was awesome!  And our waitress Donna was the best server I'd had in a long time. Thanks!Wow. Wow. Wow.

This little cafe was the perfect place for a light lunch this past Memorial Day Weekend. 

For starters, the cafe is gorgeous with it's vibrant red colors and it's gold decor. 

The coffee and other coffee drinks (white mocha specifically), delicious.

And the appetizer style menu is full of variety. Not to mention you are served your appetizers on the branches of a decorative tree.

Thank you so much Chef Sandra for sending us your favorite appetizers to taste. They were amazing!

We will most definitely return. Soon!Perfect.  The best $200 I have ever spent on an aromatherapy massage. Done by a world class therapist named, Jodi!  The decor is like being in a plush, extravagant dream.  I love you, Encore spa.Everything has pretty much been said about this spa. And it's all true....it's beautiful!! I've been to Korean spas in CA, Burke Williams, hotel spas, etc. This spa, and Qua at Caesars are def in the top 3. I came here Memorial weekend, and I was pleasantly surprised that it wasn't that busy at all. That's how I like to enjoy spas....which is one reason I wasn't crazy to go back to Qua this weekend....I went two weekends ago on a non holiday/Sunday, and there were people everywhere in the spa. The stone chairs were all taken and everyone had to wait their turns for them. I do wish Encore spa had a few more refreshments, snacks, and drinks around the place. They mostly have room temp bottles of water everywhere. The treatment I got was a 80 minute blended fusion massage and scalp enhancement. One of the best massages ever!!! During the massage, I immediately regretted not getting a 100 minute one instead. Amazing massage and amazing facility. Will def return next Vegas trip.What can I say. Every time we eat at POSH, we are amazed by Josh and his staff. They present the dishes and wines accurately with great detail to match the epic deliciousness of the food quality. Best place to sit...at the bar near the cooks. You can watch them with drooling envy as they make each dish. Don't be afraid to ask them about what they're cooking as well. The staff and Josh, our gracious chef, love to chat and be personable with their patrons. Don't forget to follow their facebook page. The chef enjoys doing fun "what's this ingredient" contest for gift certificates as well as host events like Ramen Night once a month where you can get a bowl of authentic japanese Ramen soup for $10. Can't recommend this restaurant enough!! REALLY. You'll love it!No Edinburgh visit witout the Castle, its really worth it. We had beautifull weather with a good sight, makes it perfect!I have tried all the Nigiri sushi. The quality of the fish are decent and served at slightly lower than the room temperature. The fish are fresh and they are cut  after the order are received at the bar counter. Whether you are sushi roll eater or the nigiri eater you will be able to enjoy sushi here!This place was nothing short of amazing. I cant wait to throw another party and get more mini b undt cakes! I got the assortment of their four best sellers, but my personal fav is the lemon!  Yum :-)This is a great Mexican restaurant in Cave Creek, alot better than the bigger one in the middle of town.  They have great food and a great staff.  Breakfast, lunch and dinner are all great.  The outside patio is really nice.  Just had my husbands birthday there with about 60 guests and it was perfect, great food and service!  Bill, the owner is very accomodating and is a pleasure to work with along with his staff.  My fav is the chili rellenos and my husbands is the green pork chili.I just got back from Maui last week and had great poke while there. I've been craving some poke hardcore since then but honestly I've always been scared to try this place. Poke in the desert? Plus I figured there's no way it could live up to the poke I had in Hawaii (oh yeah and I'm a bratty fish snob to boot!).

Well folks, this is honestly Hawaiian quality poke. Yeah it's *slightly* tastier in Maui, but not by much. The fish was so fresh tasting. YUM. The place was uber clean. No weird smells, no chewy fish. YAY!!

They had about 5 types of poke and then some fun containers they make themselves (I wanna try the seaweed salad next time!), plus they had warm spam/rice they had just wrapped up. Lots and lots of fun Hawaiian drinks, foods, shirts, etc, etc. A tiny place, but lots of goodies hiding all over the place!

I had a 1/4 lb of Garlic Poke and 1/4 lb of Shoyu Poke ($10.95/lb) and tried my friend's limu poke. All were incredible!! The fish was the star, but it was perfectly salted and the onions were so fresh and crisp too. 

They have a cute little bench area outside that's shaded where you can eat your lunch if you can't wait till you get home. Drink were reasonable too $.65 - $2 or so. 

This is definitely going into my weekly rotation - cheap , healthy, and tasty - LOVE IT. Thanks yelp for the killer find.Poke poke poke! If you do something good you don't need have to do anything else. This place does Poke right. Spicy, creamy, salty, they have it all!

I am some what addicted, and went here once a week, for the few months I lived in Vegas. This place will always have a special place in my heart.This place is great! We go for dessert several times a month. We love it because they have many options and love that you can make it all by yourself. 

It is really clean and the staff is always polite and helpful. 

The cups size can be a little deceptive so watch out how much yogurt you put in because you are paying by weight afterall!Everything was awesome!  The greek salad was so fresh and had loads of feta :)  My tuna melt was the best I've ever had and I loved the choices of sides instead of just the usual fries.  It was crowded but service was awesome :)  We will be back!Food fabulous. 
Blue walls, sea themed. 
Route 66 pictures. 
Cheap prices for great meals. 
Wait long, but food for a song. 
Everything looks good. 
People are regulars here. 
Host saw we had computers,
Got us a back table by the plug. 
Free wifi for a packed place,
We pinged 14 mbs up and down! 
Very friendly staff, 
Small place in a strip mall not much parking. 

We will be back next time we're in Vegas.Been here twice now and wasn't disappointed! The food is amazing and the people are too. The biscuits and gravy is amazing. The French toast is amazing. The Greek omelette is also amazing. Will definitely continue to return!First time here!  Service and food was awesome.  Staff is extremely friendly!  Owner is down to earth and interacts with everyone in the dining room.  Food was delish!  I recommend the country fried steak and eggs.  Definitely coming back next time we're in Vegas!Mmmm good breakfast I've had the French Toast and the California Omelet Both were great. If your looking for a quick breakfast spot try this one. Clean! Great Food for the $ and service w a smile.I could eat here everyday. The variety of different pastys are awesome!  Chicken tiki masala is definitely #1. The music gets a little weird but the atmosphere and awesome and the beer selection rocks. Not only that but they do have some of their pasty's in vegetarian form - so when you aren't feelin' meat you still get an freakin' awesome tasting pasty.Oh my Gaaawwwd. Kicking myself for not trying the Cornish Pasty Company sooner! This is a Mesa (or Tempe) "Must-Try"! 

My Dude and I have been here twice now. Reasonably priced delicious food, a wide variety of brews and attentive service all make it a great experience here. 

There's a hipster vibe going on, but that's not a bad thing. We like to joke that this place could pass for one of the pubs out of Harry Potter.

It's dark inside, with empty liquor and wine bottles being used as candles. Another great touch to the great ambiance. 

The first time we went, we got a table up front. 

Picky Eater Advisory: It should be noted that the Pasties are cooked to order, but you can't add or subtract ingredients. 

Also, be prepared to wait a while. Good food takes time! Just grab a beer and enjoy your company. 

Tried the Lamb Vindaloo and the traditional Oggie pasties. Both were absolutely delicious! Tender lamb, and the spices used weren't too overbearing, but I was sweating buckets. Which my Mexican thought was hilarious. Damn you, Dude. 

Love that they can wrap the other half of your pasty in foil to take home instead of boxes. 

We also tried the oven chips with jalapeño and garlic. Cooked to perfection, but not overcooked. Don't feel like the jalapeños contributed much and probably wouldn't add them again.

The last time we were here, it was crazy busy, so we sat at the Pasty Bar (not to be mistaken for the actual bar)! Change it up sometime, it was cool to watch the pasties being made. 

We got the Bangers and Mash and the Cheeseburger Royale pasties this time. Again, both great. 

Our waitress forgot to put in our order for oven chips, and was awesome enough to comp it from the check. 

Downside to the Bar? You can come across groups of people telling you to "move over" so they can fit their group together. Rude and annoying if you just got your Pasties, but this time not a huge deal as we were about to get our check and leave.

There's so many Pasties to choose from, which makes things overwhelming when it comes time to order. 

Look forward to working my way through their Pasty offerings and bringing my family and friends here for brews, good food and good times!i'm so happy i found this place.

when i heard the word pasty, it didn't exactly coincide with great food in my mind.  but that forever has changed,  the pilgrim was amazing.  hands down, best thing i've eaten in a while.  turkey, stuffing & roasted veggies with a side of cranberry sauce & red wine gravy.  like thanksgiving dinner in a little bundle of joy. 

dessert was delicious as well.  apple & caramel pasty with vanilla ice cream.  the pasty was fluffy and buttery and glorious and all of the things you want when you are feeling like a fat kid.  

nice beer selection.  i chose a trusty Guinness but i wish i had been brave & perused the beer menu a bit more. next time.

can't wait to go back.Can't say anything bad about this place.  LOVE everything I've had there!!My husband and I had our reception here and they are the greatest. Our coordinator, Fawn, was amazing. She went above and beyond, and we hardly needed to talk to anybody all night! They just let us do our thing!!

Great place for any kind of party.Service is always great and the food always consistent. My favorite location.Been with Fuzion for 6 weeks now and have put on 6 pounds of muscle and feel great! Brian thank you for getting me in there and setting me up with John, he's an awesome trainer.Great service ! After 7pm, and they sold out of their signature chunky chicken noodle soup. But the deli rep warmed up a small batch for us. Safeway has the best ready-made chicken noodle soup ! Chunky, yummy and just the right consistency and great service with a smile. The kale super salad was fabulous too ! Add a rotisserie chicken (or KFC :-) and voila a balanced meal.BEST PLACE EVER! Want to purchase all of my cakes from here.I love this place!I stopped back in to Marco's Italian Bistro again recently.

We were welcomed & seated immediately & the waitress was right there taking our drink orders & describing the night's specials.

I was really looking forward to having another one of their incredible Veal Dishes, but after hearing the specials, I decided to try something different.

I ordered up the Linguini Frutti di Mare special which is Over 1 pound of Shrimp, Mussels, Clams, & Calamari prepared in a red or a white sauce.  You can choose your spice level:  0 - 4.   I chose Red Sauce & a 2 spice level.

We also ordered up the Alfredo pasta with Chicken.

The meal was incredible & the spice level was perfect for us.  Two of us shared this plate as there was so much food on it.  Everything was cooked to perfection.

The Waitress never let our drinks go dry which is very important to me & the service & food were just amazing.  

We really enjoy the ambiance of this Restaurant and look forward to going back again soon to try more of their great menu.Yum! Yum! Yum! Need I say more... if you are craving Thai food this is the place you want to be... food so AMAZING you definitely have to come back for more!!!Everything about Island Flavor is great.

Reasonable prices, friendly service, excellent food, and great atmosphere.  People dine here reguarly and for good reason.

I enjoy the poke (furikake style) and I usually get the oxtail soup.  You can get a 2 meat combo for under 10 bucks.  Tonnnnss of food.  The qualiy of their food is really good.  Kalbi short ribs, katsu, shoyu chicken all very good.  

I believe on Friday nights, they have specials such as Lau Lau, etc.  

I also like how they play Hawaiian music in the background.Wow, awesome DOG-FRIENDLY hotel. I mean, super dog-friendly. No extra pet fees or deposits. Adjacent to a nearby park so it's easy to walk your dog anytime. There are also grassy areas at the hotel for your dog to relieve him/herself. The free breakfast is absolutely amazing. The eggs are soft, layered, perfectly cooked. There is usually a breakfast burrito (veggie and non-veggie) or breakfast sandwiches.  The egg white breakfast burrito was absolutely delicious.  You also get hot cakes and sausage on weekends. Pastries are flaky and delicious. Coffee is excellent. Rooms are huge with a kitchenette, large bathroom, living room area with a huge sofa. Bed was super comfortable. My dog absolutely loved this hotel. The staff are so friendly. To be honest, their breakfast was the best food I had in Vegas (see my other reviews of the Bacchanal buffet and Picasso for comparison!).  And it's really close to the red rock canyon for the outdoorsy type that don't just want to walk up and down the strip (which is also dog friendly btw!). It's near the Desert Breeze park and adjacent to another park with lots of people walking their dogs. I would stay here again in a heartbeat. Very reasonably priced and worth every penny.My friends and I decided to check out this humble place after looking on yelp. The food was really delicious and the service was courteous. I highly recommend it to anybody that is looking for some good eats .I have been going to Metta for about a month now.  It's a cozy space with fantastic teachers. The Vinyasa classes kick my butt and I love the Kundalini meditation class.  Totally recommend this studio for those who want to try different discliplines of yoga.A pasta place for meat lovers and truly a fantastic dining experience.  The food was original and perfectly executed, nice environment (not too big, not too small) and great service.  Cant wait to go back.Love the food and prices. The service was great and they refill your drink when it's halfways...Great food and wonderful environment. Sat outside on patio; very enjoyable. I had the chorizo brizza, breakfast parfait and OJ. (Yes, way too much food. I'm eating the rest of my brizza and parfait for dinner right now!) Highly recommend the brizza. So good!

Customer service was wonderful, too. I went inside to get a to go box, and was looking around for about 10 seconds. Before I had the opportunity to ask for one, I was approached by someone who worked there inquiring how he could help me.I love breakfast/brunch, and I've gotta say I found a place that really fits me! Scramble was everything I was looking for! 

The food is great, the people are nice, the location is adorable, and decor is fun/modern.  

I also like the way you order, there isn't pressure to wait for a server to come to you, you can get your refills as needed, and enjoy your experience without hoping that you get a good person and not a server having a bad day.I absolutely love this place!  

The breakfast burrito is soooo yummy!  The brizzas (breakfast-pizzas) are very flavorful, but my absolute favorite is the southwest Benedict.  Two perfectly poached eggs on top of jalapeño  cornbread cakes that still have a slight outer crunch even smothered under the delectable chipotle hollandaise sauce......

Love the hip Decor, friendly and efficient ordering style, and the cutest darn wifi name ever!I just moved into town, and needed to make copies of my house/mailbox keys. I looked up nearest locksmith's and found this little place right besides "Pasta China" restaurant (same plaza). The women in the front desk was super nice and the Technician was swift on making copies on my keys. The price was very cheap.

Literally like 3 days later, I locked myself out of my office room at home. I gave them a call and they showed up in less than an hour! "Jason" was the locksmith's name, and he charged me $70 for fixing the problem and making two new spare keys for the office room. 

Very professional and fast service. I would recommend these guys to anyone in the area.Dutch Bros. Is the best bros!!!  I go here everyday. The baristas are very friendly and always peppy. Love this place. They always make small talk and are super nice. 

The taste of the coffee is much better than the competition I feel. I prefer my coffee Americana so this is my spot!!!I went here for the first time for a mani pedi walk in. They were pretty busy but fit me in with little wait time. My nails turned out great! I will be back!Great friendly staff!
Food is pretty good!
Better than other shacks I went in saying they're Thai, when they really aren't. How can I tell??? I couldn't.  They all look alike and sounds almost the same language.
But hey.. Ingot me the Thai beef salad, it's off the chains!!!
Try it!!!So, how exactly do you rate your tax man?  My system is 1 star = I'm currently in jail, 2 stars = I will most likely be in jail, 3 stars = I will probably survive an audit with minimal monetary pain, 4 stars = I will definitely pass an audit, and 5 stars = the IRS would never discover what I've done and I'm driving a Bentley.

Seriously, I'm all for doing your own taxes if you're into that sort of thing.  And I did my own until I got married.  My husband didn't trust me to fill out a 1040EZ in spite of having a math degree.  I'm fairly certain the first guy we used was a scheister.  The second guy was with H&R Block-he had one eye, which would have been fine had he known anything about taxes.  I had to explain to him how to report my IRA to Roth IRA conversion.

Thomas Holly is my 3rd and final stop.  I just saw him today.  First off, he has both eyes so he can fully read the directions for the forms.  Second, he is competent, but doesn't come across as the "don't worry about what I'm doing...trust me" kind of guy.  Upon our first meeting, he let us know he is all for claiming every legitimate deduction you can, but is somewhat conservative.  Since I started working for myself, I have no desire to do my own taxes.  I can't really compare prices since he is the only accountant I have used for my business, but it seems reasonable given the number of schedules he has to complete.  His turnaround time is fairly quick to prepare the returns--usually about 2 weeks.  And I get the peace of mind that if I am audited, he can handle the IRS' questions for me.[walks around staring in amazement]

I've never quite seen anything like it.Loved Aria. True check in was a little on the slow side and disorganized and housekeeping horrendous but overall the hotel is great, and rooms were really nice and controlled electronically. The hotel has a diffferent look than all other hotel-casinos on the strip, without a theme other than a high end look.  Casino was on the dark side so was not really encouraged to sit at the tables but nonetheless great hotel, cool bars, great pool. Highly recommend this place. 
Most of the stores that are connected to the hotel have yet to open but many of the same can be found within or next to Caesars etc...
To the housekeeping issues, we would get back at the end of a day and true the room would not be made up. Furthermore when we checked in the bathroom was still somewhat dirty if you can read between the lines and some of the toiletries were not even placed to the point that we presumed "strange-they don't include soap here?".
Nonetheless still like this place a lot but over time it will be interesting to see if they sort out their issues and become top notch or if after a maturation process it goes downhill.One word: Elegant

Everything is contolled by a remote: lights, curtains, tv, etc. The bed is comfy, there's a lot of space, and a bathroom/shower like no other. 

The pools (yes more than one, actually like 3 pools and 2 hot tubs) are perfect for relaxing after a hard night partying and the temperature is just right.  Only 3 and a half feet but nothing to really complain about.Walking into this hotel (specifically the room) was like walking into the year 2020, no kidding!

We stayed here on a Thursday night and got the basic room for $120, what they don't tell you is at check out, you get nicked for a $22 resort fee + tax... But considering the rooms are usually $180-$200, the $120 price was decent.

You walk into the room, the curtains open and the TV comes on with your name on it, the Time and indoor / outdoor temps. The entire room can be controlled by one "tablet" looking remote that includes lights, curtains, TV, radio, all volumes... Pretty much anything with an on/off switch or is plugged in can be controlled by this universal remote, AMAZING. 

My favorite part, we set our "wake up call" to be the curtains opening, the lights coming on and the TV coming on... SO COOL! The bathroom was pretty standard, but stone everything...

PROS: Room control, modern look, location on the strip, 3 free pools and the bed was really nice and soft!

CONS: Wait time at check in (15 minutes), high resort fee, prices for things in the hotel were steep ($6 for a coffee), overall hotel cost was high (~ $140 after taxes and fees).

I would probably come back here, but not for the standard rate... But it was sure fun to do it once! If the price was a little more competitive to other hotels on the strip ($80-$120) I think they would make a killing!I think I'm staying at Vdara when I'm in Vegas from now on-- here's why:

- Valet service is free!  (Just tip them because they do a great job).  They were also very fast and friendly and asked if we needed directions anywhere.
- Check in mid week- no line at 3pm, easy, fast
- Check out was fast- done from the room
- Elevators- fast, close to check in
- Bag service- friendly, fast, and they noticed that we had some bottles of champagne that we had bought somewhere else and they made sure they were safe and taken care of.

- Walk way to Bellagio- close to elevator, clean, covered, under 5 minute walk- right into Bellagio hallway to main lobby.  At first we didn't see it and walked out of the casino, down the street, and all over till we finally got to the strip.  Then, we discovered the walkway right into the Bellagio and that made our stay so much more convenient!  It was so easy to get over there and not a bad walk at all, especially for the strip.

- Room (deluxe suite): two plasma/ LCD TVs, fridge (we fit 2 bottles of champagne and 6 water bottles in it with room to spare), microwave, stove top, free cookware and utensils, etc (just notify housekeeping), dining area for two, desk, blinds and black out shades controlled on wall, great air conditioning, closet space, living area comfortable enough for 4-5 people.
- Bathroom great with Aveda product, a separate shower and soaking bathtub, and lots of lighting.

- Housekeeping service was great, we didn't have any issues with that.  There's a setting on your doorbell (yes, doorbell) that you can set to notify them that you would like housekeeping services and when they come by, they know when to do it.  No annoying placards needed.

-Did I mention the view??  In our standard room, we had a view of the Bellagio Water show, Paris Hotel, and the strip, as well as the Palms and Rio, the mountains, and most of Las Vegas all from our huge panoramic windows!  Plus, there were black out shades and curtains controlled on the wall so that we could sleep in without the sun pouring into our room.

But, there isn't a casino in the hotel, so if you are the type that can't stop gambling all night or needs to do a couple of hands of poker between brushing your teeth and getting into bed, you might be a little disappointed by that.  Fortunately, the Bellagio is connected to the hotel, so you can always go there; plus there are other places in City Center to wander around at that are really nice.  There is a restaurant and bar there but we didn't go there while we were there.  There is room service, but with having a mini-kitchen, we didn't need that.  And there is a pool, but we didn't go to it for some reason... We did use the bathtub quite a bit though and that was very nice.

We were thrilled with our stay here and will definitely be back!had a corner suite. fully loaded kitchen, dining table, washer/dryer, living room, flat screen, and a plush/comfortable bed. The bathroom soo modern & beautiful, tub, walk in shower, dual sinks and Aveda toiletries. Super soft plush robes for him & her, two slippers, and black out shades. Plenty of towels which is a triple PLUS PLUS PLUS. Vanity table and you can hook up your HDMI chord if you bring and/or have a hdmi compatible laptop.

we checked in early at 11 a.m. went really well. No lines. No problem.
No problems from me for this hotel.

There was a problem checking out but didn't involve us. Some lady jumped the line and it went pretty ugly. 
The check out was a mess indeed, but c'mon its 11 o'clock, what do you expect? 

Oh another thing, park at Bellagio and walk your bags to Vdara. Valet is super super waste of time. Waited 30 minutes for a car, when it can easily have taken 15 minutes to walk to Bellagio parking structure.
Those valet dudes sure do work super hard. 

so worth the $200/night.
Check it out!Very clean and modern. Awesome that entire hotel is non-smoking. Also no casino but very close to others. Bathroom is really nice with big soaking tub. Great view. Comfy king bed. 2 flat screens. Microwave, small fridge and 2 burner kitchenette (we didn't use) nice staff and close to Aria and The Cosmopolitan. Stayed on the 30th floor and had a great view. Pool is super cool with lots of cabanas and day beds. Nice gym too. All the other hotels seem old and stink like smoke in comparison.Randomly decided to stay at Vdara and so happy I did! These rooms are super spacious (they are all suites) and very clean/modern looking. Beds and pillows are also super comfy!

I loved that I didn't have to wander around a casino for half an hour to find the front desk because there is no casino!! haha, you get to literally walk in and the front desk is right there. 

Valet only parking and there is no direct way to go from the hotel to the strip. You have to connect through Bellagio or Aria. I got confused a few times when i was heading BACK to the hotel! 

Now that I've stayed there once, Ive been getting lots of promotion emails from them and their rates are not bad! Would def consider staying here again!Without this amazing deal I found online, I can honestly say I probably couldn't afford to stay here. I was able to stay in the comforts of a beautiful one bed studio suite, equipped with the most amazing view, a huge bathroom that included a shower and gigantic tub and a kitchen. It had two flat screen TVs and a comfy couch that pulled out into a bed.

Another huge plus is that there is no casino at this hotel despite being right off the main area of the strip and theres NO SMOKING! So it smells ultra delicious here.

The pool is somewhat mediocre for being such a nice hotel, but at least its famous for its newsworthy death-rays that help with a 'killer' tan.

Even though we were staying in Sin City, staying at Vdara felt like an oasis from the craziness. After a night of wild partying, it was amazing to come back to a quiet and luxurious hotel to relax and detox.Vdara is a very luxurious place to stay.  The rooms are quite large, very clean, and have an updated/modern design.  The service is exceptional, and they really take care of guests.  By far the best hotel experience we have had in our five or six Vegas trips.  They check room keys at the elevator banks, even at like 3:00am, which is nice.  

There is no casino at Vdara, so depending on your perspective that is either good or bad.  To me, it's good, because it makes the hotel less busy with random people wandering around.  But if it's your first time in Vegas, it may detract from your party experience - it's really neat the first time to have a hotel right on the strip, where you can walk right out from the elevator and be in the middle of the action.  Anywho, Vdara has a tram that runs until 4am that goes to Aria and Monte Carlo for gambling, while the Bellagio and Aria are both a fairly short walk away from Vdara.  So, if you want to briefly escape the chaos for a bit of sleep, Vdara offers a somewhat calm escape that is very close to the 24x7 action.  

We stayed at Planet Hollywood the last night of our trip, which offered a stark contrast to Vdara.  While Vdara is clean, modern, and customer service oriented...Planet Hollywood was congested with mobs of people, and definitely showed its age.  Planet Hollywood wasn't the worst we've ever stayed in, but I definitely wish we had just stayed another night at Vdara instead.Stayed at the hotel last year and had quite high expectations and Mandarin Oriental was not a dissapointment. We had a nice view of the strip from our room wich had two large beds and all technical things anyone could ever need like a "custom set alarm" where one set the preferences for the lights, curtains, music etc and what time the alarm with these settings will go of. It was nice waking up to the curtains slowly opening up and letting the sunlight in while the radio was playing soft music. 

The room had a large bathroom with a seperate shower and tub and of course it wouldnt be Mandarin Oriental without integrating a tv set in the mirror. One plus was the large wardrobe where we could get the luggage out of the way. 

All in all a nice, modern and sleek hotel experience with great service but since this is a non casion hotel its nothing for the big gamblers. Would love to stay here again.Beautiful room
Top notch service
Amazing Spa
Away from the loudness, gambling, chaos
There's nothing I could possibly complain about here. Loved it!!!!For a place that advertises a cheap quick lunch I was completely blown away! Almost immediately after I ordered they came out with egg drop soup Full of carrots peas corn and tofu It was very good, light on salt so easily pepped up with some Soy sauce just like I like it. I ordered the Mongolian beef. It was perfectly seasoned just spicy enough to tingle my palate. It came with a generous serving of fried rice that was very good.  I ordered lemonade with my meal and I was initially concerned because it was taking a little while to come out, it even came behind the soup. However I was quickly surprised and made very happy when they brought my lemonade out. They normally do not offer lemonade and they freshly made some just for me! What amazing service!!! Two very sweet ladies were serving the tables and I watched As they kept a close eye on each table and repeatedly asked to make sure everything was okay and brought extra napkins etc. absolutely AMAZING service. I will be back over and over again.This is hands down my favorite go to AYCE sushi spot in town! I've been coming here once a month for the past year and I never get tired of it. For such a busy place the service is decent and the waiters are friendly. The sushi is sooo fresh and I enjoy the large variety. If in the chinatown area definitely worth a visit.Took my dog to a new day care ranch for the first time and was waay out of my neighborhood.  Yelped a couple massage places to kill some time and this one looked good, called and, they were able to get me in for an immediate appointment with Amanda, just 50 minutes but, better than nothing. right?

Recently, I have made the switch to the Asian Foot Massage scene where you can get 90 minutes for less than $50 and its really good almost always.

If this place was closer to me, I would switch back to the in and out full body.  The receptionist/owner, Kathleen was nice, the therapist was in my top 5 of all time, and the facility is super clean and comfortable.

The price is reasonable and yelp saves you $5 more.  They close early 3-4 nights and the prepaid only saves you about $4 a massage but, if you live near here I highly reccomend this place.

This place is so good that I would not review it if I lived closer.  Wat????  Yup, selfish of me but, I did this with one spot and after a while the receptionist was ALWAYS saying  "Im sorry but, we are booked for today.  How about Friday at 9 am?"  The cat was out of the fxxxxxx bag!this was yet another great off strip find for us! we will be back! the appetizer ribs are sooooooo goooood! fell apart like butter! the apps were awesome, and the food was delicious. the staff was nice and welcoming, and the ambiance was perfect! the seafood pasta looked great (I watched my new husband eat that since I am not big on scallops) but the blackened tuna! amazing!We had dinner there on February 8, 2014. The food, wine, service, and atmosphere was great! I've been to New Orleans and this place made me feel like I was there once again! We had crab cakes, alligator tale, calamari, Atchaflaya crawfish, petite filet with bearnaise sauce, and bread pudding. All dishes were fantastic. We will definitely return!Awesome place!! Very friendly people. You will love these hot dogs hit the spot.Great hot dogs, super juicy and a great set of toppings. One of the best hot dogs you can get. If you have to wait a while, you can look around the antique shop. The owner was there and very nice.Somehow during every trip, any time of year, we catch Con te Partio as our last show before heading back to the hotel for the evening.  It's the first show we ever saw (at the grand opening - which was also our wedding anniversary) and it's remained (by luck) the last show we see every trip.  The best view, of course, is street level, center stage.  

Some of the best performances are 'One' (from A Chorus Line) and 'Your Song' (the Ewan McGreggor version from Moulin Rouge).   Any song with a more dramatic ending will lend to a more spectacular explosion of lights and blasts from the fountains.

The ultimate romantic backdrop.  Want to see it without a trip to sin city?  Rent Oceans Eleven (the Clooney version).I was in Vegas for NYE 2010, and upon exploring the Strip, a girlfriend and I sidled up to the fountains. She, being from SoCal & a regular Vegas visitor, had seen them so many times before, but she thankfully obliged me. As we stood there, me woefully underdressed and shivering like a loon (I had just come from 4.5 feet of snow in Philadelphia, so despite the weather reports I was praying for sweltering Vegas weather!), I joyfully listened to the music and stood entranced by the dancing water. We have something very small "inspired" by this in Atlantic City, but woah, this was amazing! I'm not sure I'd go totally out of my way to see this unless I was with other first-timers or little kids, but I would love to catch it again at night. 

Also, it's free!! Can't beat that!It never gets old.  Ever.

Read Tim W's review for the extensive show and music list.

If you go to Vegas for the first time, you must go see this.  Period.These don't get old! Awesome peaceful show along the hectic strip! 

It's hard to believe this awesomeness is produced by MGM Resorts (some of their other properties are total dives!!).Basically when you think Vegas you think Bellagio fountains. Amazing at night, not so much during the day. You can usually get an upgrade at any hotel that has a good view, this will make sure your room has a fountain view. It is a nice touch if you don't do Vegas often.Beautiful and free! If you're looking for something to do for a few minutes it's worth waiting for the show to go off. The fountains are in sync with the music and it's just beautiful. Even just walking or driving past and seeing it is amazing.Needless to say, this is Best water show in the world.  And the best part is, its FREE!!! I had a Great View from my room in Bellagio.  According to the Discover channel, this is the most expensive hydraulic system out there and I am not surprise at all.I think my favorite part about Bellagio are the Fountains. Sure the flower encrusted ceiling is fascinating but the feng shui is horrid. 
The fountains, however, are perfectly placed. See them while brunching at restaurants like Mon Ami Gabi or Sugar Factory or even better, stop by for the evening show where an anonymously beautiful italian voice sings harmoniously with the movement. Imagine standing hand in hand with your significant other and gazing at the fluidity. Its quite romantic and makes for such a pretty sight.My favorite buffet in Las Vegas, or maybe even anywhere!! I used to love the Wynn buffet, but this place has so much more variety and they probably taste the stuff they make.

Nowhere else can you find pad thai, chow fun, and sweet potatoes. I was amazed at the selection! I had eight plate fulls before I finally left after two hours. =) 

They also include free beer and free coffee drinks (espresso, cappuccino, etc). You just have to get up and get it yourself. 

The dessert bar is the best I've tried. Love the little dessert cups, but the mango and coconut sorbet was probably the best. SO heavenly and actually tasted like you were eating the fruit! 

I am so going back every time I go to Vegas!I gotta admit that this is the best buffet I have ever tried. I make it a point to eat here everytime I go to Vegas. It's about 10-15 miles away from the strip but its totally worth it. I just went back there this past weekend and took a friend with me who's never tried it. He said they had the best prime rib he's ever tried. We were using a butter knife to cut the slice of meat. They also serve bottomless beer and wine. What more can you ask for? Quality food and drinks. Crab legs and prime rib for the win! I can't wait to go back there!LOVE this buffet. Have made it a priority to stop in here my last 3 Vegas trips because I was that satisfied. I came once before summer season and the Sunday Seafood Brunch was $28. Came again in mid-July and the price came out to $34. They have everything that I would want at a Vegas buffet. Prime rib and crab legs are my fav! It's pretty hard to get to all the stations before tapping out. You'd have to get really small portions, but how can you resist?! Everything is so good!!! They even have sushi and sashimi salad! Any place that serves all you can eat sashimi salad is awesome! Also, my sweet tooth is IN LOVE with the dessert buffet. So many options and...gelato!!! They also have all you can drink beer and wine. Since I usually come on Sundays I'm done partying and pass on the alcohol. But if you're down for some unlimited drinking AND eating buffet this is the place to go. During the busy season be careful for the long lines; usually during noon and 6 pm. Waiting is all worth it though. Studio B Buffet at the M Resort is my absolute favorite buffet spot in Vegas.Locals always talk about how this place is awesome. And yeah, yeah I'll have to agree with them.

It's not a pretentious, over-the-top type of buffet with Grecian pillars or floral murals or anything. It's just a clean and circular space with a whole bunch of your typical buffet fare. 

Food quality was great. Service was also good. Price is never too steep because they give out coupons all the time. 

My only gripe is that they need to step up their fruits selection. I'd like some strawberries (chocolate covered), grapes, etc. etc.I could not even consider giving this place less then 5 stars. First, the selection is diverse, and the food is of great quality and fresh. There is not only a wide array of various food types and styles, but the dessert bar is also amazing, serving up creme brulee' and gelato! My 2 favorite points:

-All you can drink beer and wine! 

-The price per quality is out of this world. $15 dollars for what I received was unreal
(Lunch price). I thought it was a trick, and was expecting a National Lampoons style buffet. I was pleasantly surprised when i did not receive it. There are many great buffets on the strip, however, the food here is amazing and given at an unmatchable price! Enjoy at your own risk!First visit but not the last.  Great value for the quality and variety of food. Everything tasted wonderful.  Desserts are wonderful.  Lunch line was long but it moves fairly quickly and so worth the wait.This was so good the food was 5***** all you can drink wine&beer!! You have to goBest buffet in Las Vegas on weekends! They used to make it work to eat crab legs but now cut them in half for you and still super good.almost 200 things to eat and make sure you save room for dessert because they got it all from gelato,creme brulee, eclairs, to cakes and crepes tira misu and flan just to name a few.I really enjoy pizza and wings fro Barro's Pizza, and to think I found out about this place through my lady!  :-) They are also exceedingly fast at their delivery service (which is very good to me, prompt service that is), and I can also remember one time when my lady had placed an order, and they were running late, well when they got to our home, they automatically "upgraded the order" to a Large Pizza instead of a small one! Thanks Barro's.....  You are the bomb !!!  :-)Love this place.  Affordable rates, clean rooms, nice casino.  Lots of penny slots, FANTASTIC buffet, awesome pool.  Sign up for a club card to get great deals.This place has great Chinese food along with one of the best managers MIKE F! So thoughtful and such great customer service!!! Thank you!!!We just went here today for a work lunch and it was wonderful! I had a salmon sandwich with cucumbers and dill sauce on sourdough. My coworkers had a panini. The flavor was great and is owned and operated by a French couple. We had a crepe for desert and it was good.Artisan Roast is without question the "founding father" of good coffee in Edinburgh. Here, they know their beans; they know - inside out - the intricacies of the right grind, the right tamp, the perfect pour and how to get the milk just right. And thats not just for espressos -- if filter coffee is more your thing, then you're in for a taste sensation here. Artisan Roast is passionate about coffee, (but not snobby!) and it shows.


 My coffee was delicious. The place has real ambience... and "The Mooch", out the back is a cosy place to spend an afternoon.


 If you love coffee, this is the place to go. If you're not the biggest fan, this is definitely the right place to go to try it again.... you may be surprised at how different, and how gooood, the coffee is when it is made by passionate individuals who really know their stuff. Being a barista is a career choice for these guys... not something they're doing to bide their time.


 If you need further proof of excellence, Megan, one of the Baristas was a semi-finalist in the 2011 UK Barista Championship.I love this place!  I have been for breakfast many times, so I have not tried their lunch menu yet.  The food is Fantastic, the prices are great & the staff is always friendly.  They have great healthy options & rediculously delicious UNhealthy options too :) Even when they are crowded, we never have to wait too long.  Plus as a bonus, there is usually a 'BOGO' coupon in the LV Weekly!Poppa Maize Gourmet Popcorn is incredible!  Not only do they have a billion flavors to choose from, they are SO NICE!  I work in events and they have sponsored events for The Boys & Girls Clubs of the East Valley as well as The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society.  I also know they do several charity events a month!  What a wonderful (and super tasty!) addition to our community!Nancy has been styling my hair for 16 years now and she has never done me wrong.  She is very professional, knowledgable, and skilled in her profession.  Her salon in very clean, private, and inviting. She only uses quality products and also offers a beautiful jewelry line. If you are looking for a stylist that will take the time to listen to your needs and provide you with excellent service and care, then you found your girl. You will receive great service with top of the line products in a non-intimidating and peaceful setting. Plus your hair will look fabulous!Best seafood / fish shop in Edinburgh. I first heard about this place when my friend said his Dad would travel from perth to pickup seafood for his restaurant once a week. After coming here for the first time in the late 90's I think I have been hooked ever since. I am well fussy about buying fish - sustainability, where it was fished etc all play a part in my purchase.

The pleathora of seafood available here is amazing from Gambons to proper scallops from Islay way and amazing fish. The shop itself is a standard looking fish mongers with lots of addition choices and staff who offer up recipes and couldnt be more helpful. 

Things I buy
- Scallops
- clams
- mussels
- sea bass
- sushi grade tuna
- Salmon
- John Dory
- Wolf fish

TIP Get in on a Saturday Morning for Mrs Eddies Sushi.Beat kept secret of Tempe!!This is my absolute new favorite restaurant! Everyone needs to try this place at least once. I love the outside patio. The service is always good. The wine deals are great. And the food... oh man... definitely the best part! Portions are big so be prepared to share. 

Be prepared with cash to tip the valet though. Not a lot of other parking. Awesome place.We stopped by here after a recent Diamondbacks game and couldn't have enjoyed it more. I wondered if they would be able to replicate the great atmosphere and tasty food from the original on Campbell but I shouldn't have worried. 

New and delicious wines, perfect bruschetta and really down to earth and friendly service means I will be back here for sure with friends.

Tops my list of favorite places to hang in PHX.I've been here twice. I'll be upfront and tell you that my review might be "tainted" because both times I ate at Postino's I was able to order anything I wanted and I did not have to pay for it. 

Each time, I ordered a bruschetta board for myself. So yes, you might find me gluttonous, but I don't regret it for a single moment. The bruschetta are unique with their toppings and every bite is worth savoring for minutes because each mouthful is so delicious. I prefer the savory toppings (no pears, apples or figs for me), and I love all of the different combination possibilities. I think my favorite is either the warm artichoke spread or roasted peppers with goat cheese. Or maybe it's the Tomato jam & fresh sheep's milk cheese? Smoked salmon with pesto was also tasty...and let us not forget the burrata, bacon, arugula & tomatoes...although that one is probably the messiest to eat. Not that I care. I'll get messy if it means all the food is making it to my mouth.

I also ordered the Italian Picnic Salad. 1) I love golden beets. 2) I love goat cheese. 3) The salad also includes walnuts and bacon. Add these things together and we're talking about a good salad. 

The most recent time that I was at Postino's, I auspiciously ordered myself a bottle of wine, forgetting -for the moment- that I needed to leave two hours later. I only drank half the bottle, and started to advertise its availability to my co-workers. Thankfully, the waitress heard me, and informed me that I could just take the bottle home. And so I did.Love, love just love this place! Always busy but always good service! Phenomenal food and wine selection. Staff is very attentive and knowledgeable to recommend wine pairings. It's great for date night or hang out with great friends!I had a lovely evening catching up with friends at Postino last week. It was my first time ever going and I was excited because I had heard so many good things! We went on a Tuesday night right in time for the wine and bruschetta special. We must have good timing. Mmmm! I love bruschetta and wine, it was like I came to my happy place and they knew what I wanted to order! My favorite was the Brie & Apples with Fig Spread. It's the perfect mix of sweet and savory. I could eat that everyday - no problem!

The restaurant was crazy busy, but they offered valet parking, which was a nice touch. There isn't much available parking so I rather leave it to the professionals and take the stress out of my night! I think the wait staff was a little overwhelmed because it took awhile for our food and drinks and our server seemed in the weeds, but I can be patient when enjoying time with good friends! I'll definitely be back!Dr. Kohls is amazing.  She is warm and friendly and explains everything really well.  I leave the office amazed by her attitude.  Doctors like her are hard to find.  I highly recommend this office to anyone.Great tofu and spicy squid. Friendly hostess and nice room Highly recommended. Ate there twice on our trip to Las Vegas.Got my tire fixed quickly. Friendly associates. Affordable, which is good enough I didn't bother calling any where else.I loved this place.  My husband and I showed up early to this place and got some good seats at the bar.  The live piano is awesome and the bartenders can sure sing.  I ordered a gentlemen's jack and coke, my husband ordered a Coors light and the total cost was 13 bucks.....well we had a few of these orders.  I definately look forward to stoping by this place again.I love this place because its away from the touristy strip and the Bartenders can sing!Hands down my favorite pizza place in Vegas. Their pizza is delicious and typically made to order as I most often take advantage of their "two slices and a drink" special. Hard to beat that value as I am stuffed for under $7. Rare in this city.Mojo Yogurt is terrific! I took a group of about 100 (13 teams) volleyball players to Phoenix in June, and every single player just loved the awesome yogurt & toppings!This is a good, clean Target. It's not a Super Target but they have groceries almost like one. The people seem happy and are helpful which is always a plus. 

Store is clean and prices are right. 

Can't ask for anything more from a Discount store.I started coming here once I switched hair salons and needed someone to wax my eyebrows.  After a while, I decided to start getting my legs waxed as well.  Never having to shave my legs is such a relief!  Rachel is a pro and it hardly hurts when she pulls the hairs out.  I try and recommend European Wax Center to any woman I know, especially because first time visitors get a free wax, no strings attached!  You can't beat that!Best in Phoenix and it's not even close.  Location leaves a bit to be desired but the food is always excellent, variety unmatched.I'm from Los Angeles. I've been to many, many sushi restaurants. 

I'm visiting my uncle in Phoenix, decide to try the place next door to my hotel. 

AMAZING. hands down the best sushi I have ever had... GET THE LAS VEGAS ROLL!!! You will immediately evolve into a dashingly handsome full grown Charizard, after eating this evolution stone called sushi.

You will literally become the President of Your mom after eating here.

You will go home satisfied and ready to fight the war on terrorism.After watching an Indie at the Film Bar, we wanted to find a place to pause for awhile and, lo and behold, Moira.  Mind you, it was past 9 PM on a Tuesday night.  And I thought it was so awesome that it was still open for those of us who despise going home right after seeing a movie.  The place is so chic, great ambiance, food and service.  It was kinda dead given it was a week day night, but still happening in a quiet sort of way.We had dinner here to celebrate my husband's birthday. Its one of his fave places because the view cannot be beat and the service is fantastic! It is absolutely GORGEOUS there!!! 
Veloce overlooks the pool and The Strip and once the sun sets and the lights start to twinkle you really feel like all really is well in the world!  
We had an eclectic group of friends and family, all ordering very differently and the waiter handled us very well! The busgirl was fab too, refilling the bread and water many times.
My husband had the crab cakes and I had the M Girl Roll and both were delish! Of course, I enjoyed one of my fave Chardonnay's from the region of Carneros (one of the BEST regions for Chardonnay and Pinot Noir in California) and the waiter and staff even cut his cake (we brought it from the outside, with permission, of course)and served it for us! Once again The M Resort has done a great job! ;-)4/7/2013  We went there for my 66th Birthday today and the food was fabulous.   Best Shrimp Scampi I ever had.  There were 4 of us and we each had something different.  Each of our  meals was fantastic and the service was great.  We drove all the way from San Tan Valley and we will definitely be back, the long trip is well worth it.  I saw the program on Restaurant Impossible and new we just had to try it.  I am so glad we did.  Had the wine, and dessert, it was all great.My husband and I were never Elvis fans, but you have to expect that coming from young adults in their mid 20's.  We have seen almost every single cirque du soleil show in Vegas being that we travel here almost every other month and Elvis was our most recent.  We had awesome seats courtesy of hubby's host here at Aria.  For some reason I was super excited to see this performance.  No offense to those who were expecting another "Ka", "O" or even "Mystere" but come on!!!  Seriously, this is about Elvis!  He was a famous singer, how can you expect all of that?!  It is more of a musical but it was still great and my husband and I absolutely enjoyed it.  AND for the first time, I realized how hot Elvis was when he was young, definitely some major eye candy!! Which made the show even more enjoyable.One of a few reasons why we take at least 3 trips to Vegas a year is because Dunkin Donuts. It sucks that they don't have a franchise here in Cali. I make at least 2 stops here while we're in Sin City, ya I gotta make it well worth my stay!  ha ha 
I love, their donut holes, specially the chocolate. I can't get enough. Their coconut donut is also yummy! 

Normally on our way to the airport before dropping off our rental car, we'd stop here and get a dozen to go and an order of donut holes. Ya, i may sound like a piggy just about now but we make sure we have enough to last us for a day and give us more reasons to come back and get more on our next trip! 

I hope DD opens a franchise in California soon!!!One of my new favorite places to hang out on the strip, the atmosphere is incredible, and eaten at lots of great restaurants, have to check out the exit of the parking structure, the reflective walls are really cool.I am In Love.

We had the spinach enchilada and the pollo rico, lunch portions. There was enough to take home. Really good, all the right flavors and textures.

I had the Heat Wave Margarita, SPICY but oh so good. Be warned it is spicy.

Service was excellent, fast and accurate. Good job Maria. 

And that is all I am gonna say about our experience.the manager David the manfull really takes interest in his customers. beside the delicious dessert, there are lots of delicious people here. ie Kevin. :)  come here for a good time and a good laugh.OMG I came here for breakfast on a Sunday morning can I just say YUM!!! I intended on eating something breakfasty but the menu had so much to offer and I was so undecided until I saw the dessert part of the menu.  I ended up with a mimosa and the Creme De La Cream Cheesecake which was HEAVEN!!!! So I guess the mimosa was the breafasty thing.  I asked the waitress, who by the way was the coolest nicest person I met on my whole trip to Vegas, if the cheesecake was a NY cheesecake she replied "Yes, and its life changing!"  LOL that was all I had to hear I was all over it. This cheesecake was HUGE and was NY cheesecake at its best. I even had two people come over to my table to ask what it was.  Very creamy not too sweet had a nut crust instead of the typical graham cracker.  No way can one person eat it.  I ended up taking the rest to my room and had leftovers that night and in the morning and shared it.  The restaurant has great seating that looks right over the strip and we lucked out and got a perfect seat that was right on the edge.  There are also lounge type areas with heaters and is a really nice place to hang out.  All the dishes are large and the variety of the menu has something for everyone.  Come to eat or just for dessert either way you wont be disappointed.  They also have a walk up window in the back if you don't want for a seat you can order to go stuff there.  Come and check them out if you are in the area.The place is extremely clean, the staff is friendly and have always been able to accommodate me, even on short notice.  You know it's a good sign when your dog walks you into the place! He has such a great time and always comes home exhausted.

I love the webcams. I travel quite a bit for work and its very important to me that I'm able to check in on my boy. Really helps with the mommy guilt! Thanks for always taking such good care of my furr-person, I'm a customer for life.I started talking with Amelia C about two months before my wedding. I had been putting off booking a hair and makeup artist because it's not an area I know a lot about or am very comfortable with. Amelia C could not have been more helpful with the booking process and figuring out the planning and details of the morning of. Her staff Lisa (makeup magician!) and Christa (hair goddess!) were so energetic and on-top of it despite the 6AM report time at our hotel. They both listened extremely carefully to what each individual girl wanted and never pushed us to do something trendy or something we weren't comfortable with. We kept each other laughing all morning and the atmosphere in the room was so lively and fun. Lisa offered an unlimited amount of touch-ups while she was there and gave each girl a little "emergency kit" with some extra matte powder and lip color should a touch-up be necessary. Christa was a master with the curling iron and made my Japanese friends stick straight hair hold a curl for 9 hours. It was all-in-all an amazing experience and I am so happy I decided to go with Amelia C. The company is the embodiment of professionalism and I am so happy that I decided to use them as a vendor. I cannot recommend Amelia C enough and encourage any bride in the Las Vegas area to look into her services. The price is extremely affordable and almost feels like it's too cheap for the quality of work done. We all would have easily paid 3x the amount for how beautiful and vibrant we all felt after spending a morning with Lisa and Christa!Used this service to re-key my new house.  Levi was great, showed up on time for our scheduled appointment, and got everything done quickly.  He even pointed out one of the doors that wasn't lined up so it wouldn't lock easily - and he was able to fix that inexpensively (I didn't know it could even be fixed, much less cheaply!)  I was impressed, and grateful to have found him via Yelp.I tip my hat off entirely to yelp for this find because without the yelp reviews, I would have probably never driven by this shop in the first place and if I did, I probably wouldn't have stopped. But thanks to the world of yelp, I know better! 

I can finally say that after months and months of reading up on the yelp reviews, I have officially tried The Meat Shop. The verdict? A+. A+ indeed! This week, we were celebrating a birthday and a birthday calls for the finest of feasts! Since we decided to make it a night in instead of a night out, I knew that it was time to check out The Meat Shop. I arrived at 3rd and Buckeye and passed it the first time by accident, but I quickly turned around and pulled into the parking lot. The only indication that it's there is a small sign and a large painted pig on the front. I walked inside to find a very humble store of only a small entry, counter and a large window that let me look straight inside to the butcher chopping his meat in front of my very eyes! It was definitely a sight and especially since Phoenix lacks many butchers in this fine city. In fact, I can't name many other shops that are only butcher shops. It's a lost art. 

I went to The Meat Shop knowing that their beef is top notch and their bacon is a must-try, especially after reading up on Scott W's review and seeing the pictures on yelp. Sadly, I am not that well-versed in my cuts of meat, so a butcher could have sold me a cow's right ankle saying it was filet mignon and I wouldn't have known the difference. But luckily Paul the butcher helped me out and he steered me in the right direction. Paul suggested I get the Tenderloin and a filet. The filet was for me and I asked him to keep it small (several weddings this summer so I must watch the waistline!) So he disappeared into the back to grab the meat and came out with two beautiful cuts (pictures included on the page). What caught my eye was that they were wrapped air tight and ready to be frozen if I chose to. Paul also pointed out that the cuts had barely (if any) fat on them, so they were very lean. Good for my waistline then right? All the meat is also locally raised without any added hormones, etc. 

So I had my meat, but I couldn't leave without some bacon. Did I need bacon? No. But could I visit The Meat Shop without buying bacon? Nope. I asked Paul which bacon was best and of course he brought me out all three styles and each style looked tasty. There was the bacon slab, sliced bacon and buckboard bacon. I ended up purchasing some with the excuse that "of course homemade three cheese macaroni could use some bacon..." So yes, I put bacon in the mac 'n cheese. 

The purchasing experience was extremely pleasant and I was appreciative to Paul for walking me through my purchase and helping me with my meatucation. He also told me that the meat would keep in the refrigerator for up to a week and then could be frozen as long as I liked.

I got home and first fried up the bacon. I've never seen bacon sizzle so perfectly. Imagine what the bacon looks like in a Christmas movie when it's frying in a pan. This is what it looked like. Completely perfect. It tasted just as perfect (I had to have a bite!) It was like I was in my own Christmas movie with the beauty of this bacon. The next day, we grilled the steaks and after adding olive oil and garlic salt, the steak was ready to eat. I was told that a good steak doesn't need A-One sauce. Did this one need it? No siree! 

I will definitely be back to The Meat Shop, but the only downfall is that it's not exactly cheap and it's kind of a drive for me, so for that, I will leave my visits to The Meat Shop for a special occasion.

Discount alert! When I was there, I also saw a sign for 50% off the meat that they had to freeze. Deal worth driving to for!This is my go to spot after work. The Buffalo chicken wrap and Island Green smoothie are a good choice for a light meal. Just tried their new cucumber mojito smoothie and it's pretty good. The staff here is always friendly and you can call in your order for pick-up. I love that it's open 24/7.Great deal (it's free!) and quite the collection. Loved spending my lazy afternoons here as a student and young professional.What an amazing experience........HIWOT IS AWESOME!!!! She is so incredibly 
After having a miserable "FAIL" experience with Vision Salon in Spring Valley (STAY AWAY!! EMILIA IS HORRIBLE!!!), I was nervous that I wasn't going to have a place to do my hair for my wedding....

My mom had an appointment with Hiwot the morning of my wedding and she asked if Hiwot could also do my hair.  It was a busy Saturday for her, but she fit me in no problems.  She did exactly what I wanted -- a beautiful partial up-do in rollers....I looked and felt like a princess.

Color By Michael Boychuck is a really lovely salon -- the atmosphere is relaxing...they pamper you with champagne...and the stylists are all so fun and down-to-earth.  They did my mother-in-law, my mom and two of my friends' hairstyles and they all looked fabulous!!!!!!!

Yay, Color!

And, a thousand thank yous, Hiwot. I absolutely love you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Beautiful, clean salon. Decor is impeccable. Very pretty and feminism. Lots of great products for retail that I would usually have a hard time finding. Annie does amazing color and style. I come here at least 4 times a month to have my makeup done. They can do airbrush or normal. They use Kevyn aucoin products. These girls do incredible work! Never have I been so pleased with my makeup! Kate is an incredible artist, no matter what the occasion is this woman can execute it flawlessly. She is my favorite mua out there. Reanna is also an incredible artist! She used to make foundation, so her eye is on point. Color palettes she used and products she recommends for me never fails. I love this place. Evetytime I leave I feel completely beautiful and satisfied.This is the closest, newest major gym to ASU. Five stars for that alone... but there's more!

I've been working out here for more than a year now, and I LOVE IT! Having been a member with the chain for more than 10 years and having gone to about 10 or so different locations around the country, I have to say this is my favorite location of them all, and not just for its spaciousness.

Yeah, it's one year new, so of course the equipment and amenities such as the free weights, pool and basketball court are top-of-the-line compared to other 24 Hour Fitness locations. Ellipticals and other cardio equipment are plentiful and modern.

Regarding the chain itself: it's not Crunch, Golds or any of the more fancy chains, but it is accessible to the average joe and more national -- which is important if you like to work out when you travel.

The classes are average, but the Mesa location gets MAJOR points for scoring a few appearances from local Ali Vincent (winner of The Biggest Loser) to co-teach a boot camp.

And did I mention the ASU crowd that frequents this location??Loved every bit of my Spa Day at Kierland. You get to take advantage of the whole facility, gym and pool (unlike some other fancy shmancy resorts).

The massage by Tera was amazing and I utilized every inch of the spa. Started with a great work out, went for my 2 treatments then on to the sauna, jacuzzi and out by the pool to order lunch. Ahhh! 
Thanks for a great day Agave staff.Loving Hut is adorable! The name in and of itself just screams it. 
When you enter, you look at a menu, decide what you want, and go up to the cashier and order. They encourage you to pay with cash to keep food costs low. They have a variety of food items, all of which of course are vegan. Non-vegans, I encourage you to try this place, because they do not skimp out on flavor! I tried the Vietnamese sandwich and it really tasted like barbeque! They also have very yummy and interesting drinks. When we sat down they gave us complimentary soup before our ordered entrees! 
I was pleasantly surprised by Loving Hut and plan on visiting again!I'm giving a 5 to the outdoor BBQ they do FRI - SUN.

For $5, you get a freshly grilled to order burger.  It is huge, on a fresh bun, and there is a help yourself fix-ins bar (lettuce, tomato, onion, pickle - nothing special, but the burger is so good, you don't want to drown it).  For $2 more, you can get two side dishes - cold salads, hot beans, fries, or chips.  The quality is excellent and the burger is really, really, tasty.  They also have bratwursts, pork, and chicken sandwiches.

I'm also giving a 5 for the pizzas.  You wouldn't think AJ's was the go-to place for pizzas, but WOWZA.  They will custom make pretty much any standard pie, and they also have some gourmet ones available as well.  No matter what you choose, it is hand formed, brick oven baked, and don't even bother to order extra cheese as they are overly generous to begin with.  All fresh ingredients for toppings, and humongous pizzas.  You would be hard-pressed to eat 2 slices in one sitting.

But, the pastry has really slid in quality lately.  I think because they don't do a bustling business, they don't have the turnover that commands fresher pastry.

AJ's is really the place to go if you need an unusual ingredient, as chances are they will have it, and if not, then they can order it.  The meat, seafood and poultry are all top quality, but you'll certainly pay for it.  AJ's isn't the place you go for your weekly food shopping (unless you have money to burn, then you won't care).

They also have a superb deli counter that has hot and cold items, and some really cool ones at that.  Potato pancakes,  chicken curry,turkey meatloaf, antipasto salad, etc.  They also always have hot entrees for lunch and dinner that you can buy a la carte, or with side dishes for a full meal.  Salmon, prime rib, those kinds of things.

But, this is also a cool place to hang and sit outside and eat and people watch, as it's North Scottsdale, and there's always something/someone interesting to look at.  lolBig fan of DNA. Most local bike shops seem to think they have to be rude in order to get people's business.  That LBS mentality is slowly dying, but it is dead at DNA. They are a Specialized Dealer, so that needs to be what you are in the market for, but they have great stuff and great people.Should definitely try the stuffed chicken wings ! The soup is very authentic. Not overly sweetened like all the other Thai restaurants trying to make it tailor to customers other than Thai. Very authentic I would say.This is the absolute best frozen yogurt in town. I am not a fan of yogurt but I can eat this stuff, it is tasty, not too sour and they always have the best flavors. 

The red velvet, root beer and banana are highly recommended! I LOVE ALL the employees that work there, they are always so kind and they actually remember you and what flavors you like. I am a Loyal SpoonerI really love this place. It's small, it's clean, and it's delicious. The prices are very reasonable and you can find their coupons EVERYWHERE (at least in all of the local coupon books) My favorite is the buffalo chicken pita or the falafel and hummus. Whatever that lemon sauce is, I could eat a bucket of it. It is SO good. Their delivery is always within a reasonable time, and they deliver very late! Love love this place. Actually, I want to go there for lunch right now!My moms friends over at zappos kept ranting and raving about this place so we decided to try it. I'm from ny and I've been.craving a philly cheesesteak for like many years! I just tried theirs and omg is it amazing! There garlic fries are super yummy! TUphanx Brian! :)What a great brunch/lunch place.  The decor was great...The breakfast burrito was excellent, and the servers went above and beyond to satisfy the overly particular freak I was eating with.  I am definitely going back again, without the freak.  If I owned a restaurant/bar establishment, I would hire these two young ladies away from Bacon, in a heartbeat.Great food and drinks. This place has a great atmosphere for any occasion. The guacamole is off the heezy.Gallo Blanco doesn't need another glorious review, but it certainly deserves another. The atmosphere of this place is just really cool, and the menu is full of delicious-sounding choices. I settled on the corn and a couple of tacos, with pork and shrimp. Overall, the food was delicious and presented in a great way. This was my best meal on my visit to Phoenix - very impressed!Alma is the BEST! Always finds the perfect fit.  Yes, they are pretty expensive but I think it's worthy every penny because your clothes will come back perfect.  Have tailored suits and jeans, everything looks great! Also have a nice reward program, too.We used Just-InTime Moving to move and they exceeded my expectations.  They showed up on-time the morning of the move, and were ready to work!  They were friendly, courteous and professional.  They are really a great moving company, their prices are reasonable and I would highly recommend them to any of my friends or family members if they needed movers.Outstanding quality, great prices.  I can't say enough about how awesome everything we have tried from there is.  We discovered them at last weeks parade on Water St.  Very friendly and helpful staff and as mentioned in one of the other reviews, Chef Flemming popped his head out to say hi as I was having my order put together.  I have a feeling that (since I'm off of work every week on Sourdough day - Thursday) that this may become a weekly trip for me.My favorite breakfast burrito in town...  Fausto's is good, but when you want green chili sauce, Carlito's is your place!  For cheap$$, they will smother anything you order in the green chili if you want, and I always want!  It seemed extra spicy this morning which was perfect, but I could only eat half.  The other half will be in the toaster oven later and will still be delicious.  Sunday is 2 for 1 breakfast burrito's all day. Too early for the $1 beer special, but I have taken advantage of that before as well.   If not a breakfast burrito, then the carne adovada with the calabacitas is my go to burrito... smothered of course.   And when I want to go low carb, they do it in a bowl and it is fantastic.  They usually have a line  but it moves fairly quick and is worth the wait.Two of the people I was with, who lived in New Mexico, proclaimed this place to have amazing New Mexican food. Who am I to argue? I will agree that the food is fantastic and inexpensive. But, if you're sensitive to spicy foods, watch out.

If you're hungry, get the combo burrito ($5.95). It's a veggie burrito with meat. You get your choice of beans (I opted for pinto) plus rice and calabacitas. If you're like me, you'll probably have to ask what that is. Calabacitas are sautéed squash, onions, corn and peppers. I also went with the pork verde as my meat choice. If you do want it spicy, get it smothered with your choice of red or green sauce or both. Without the sauces, the food is perfect for people who don't want their mouth on fire. It's probably one of the best burritos in town (at least from what I've tried) and a great value.

Order at the counter and they'll bring the food out to you. Even during non-peak hours the place can be busy so don't be surprised if you have to wait for a table. But, it will be worth it.I thought again about our visit and you are right Dave - 5 stars is what it was. Service was right up there with the perfectly cooked food!2nd trip for breakfast! Wow even better. It was early Saturday morning after I finished a project in the neighborhood so I found myself all alone in the place. Greeted right away. Had my favorite huevos this time with chorizo. Wow spicy good enjoyed every bite. Still have a the navajo taco on my bucket list. Maybe tonight. 

Greatest green chili in the valley hands down!Posh is amazing. My family has been going here for 4 years and we are in love with them. Everyone is so friendly and amazing.

A pedicure includes a hot stone massage but the upgrade pedicures are all worth it as well.

A full colored set is 25 and they always look amazing. They do so many different designs some traditional and some very unique.

The colors are ordered, so if you are looking for a purple, all the purples are together, all the blues, pinks, and so on. It's definitely easy to find the exact color you want.

Posh also has nail designs throughout the salon so that if you need an inspiration for a different design, you have easy access.

The owner is Susan and she is so friendly. Amanda has worked there for years and she does amazing work as well. All the other employees are all great as well.

There is always a new movie or show on the large flat screen.

Waxing and facial services are available at a reasonable rate too.

They are closed on Mondays and prefer appointments so keep that in mind. Also, they only speak English in the shop.I have been here at least 10 times and have never had a complaint.  The staff is friendly, the food is great, the atmosphere is lovely.  

My favorites - the LB lavosh and spicy cottage cheese.

I will continue to come back to Local Breeze again and again!Fast, Fresh, Healthy, and Cheap teppanyaki.One of my favorite places with good prices and an even better taste. It's worth the drive if you're looking for something casual and tasty.Absolutely love this place! Great atmosphere, nice people and don't forget the Yum Yum sauce.I can not believe how great it is to feel at home. I love this place. The owner is so knowledgeable on culture and current events.JUST WOW! I love all the high end boutiques...and the overall look and feel of the place is absolutely glamorous. 

There is no doubt that Crystals is setting the trend for the Vegas of the future!Plush!

They completely renovated the entire theater. The seats recline fully are comfortable enough for even the most discerning rear. This theater is as nice as the green valley galaxy theater.

If you're in the north part of town, you have found your go-to movie theater.I've either lived or had friends in north town for the last several years, so this theater is one that I've frequented multiple times, so trust me when I tell you this is a place you want go be. 
Originally this was your run of the mill movie theater, even a bit on the dumpy side, and not anybody's first choice, but then they became a luxury+ and everything changed. For those who have been to the Henderson location, you already know the amenities. For the uninitiated, I'll make this short
-recliners, so you can lean back 
-giant screens, like IMAX giant
-beer and wine, because there's no situation made worse with those
- really good hot dog bar. Like good enough to be its own spin off joint
Best of all, the movies are the same price as everywhere else
PS: two random pluses that I likes but might not matter to most; there's an external entrance, so no need to go thru casino
And the have. Popcorn flavoring for free. It always annoys me the theaters that charge for itI woke up to a backed up sewage line.  I called five companies and EZ Flow was the first to respond.  They told me 10AM and JD arrived at 9:45AM.  The clog was fixed in less than 30 minutes.  Since they were already out, I had them replace the cartridges behind the shower handles.  I have an older house with 'questionable plumbing' and obsolete components.  JD did an excellent job of explaining the issues to me in advance so that I wasn't surprised by the pricing.  Based on previous experiences with plumbers, I think that their pricing is very fair and reasonable.

On a different note, they also email you a notice with the name and picture of their plumber who is going to come out.  While I personally don't care, this makes me feel much safer if my wife needed to handle this while I was out of town.We hit Cartwrights last night for Restaurant Week & had a PERFECT, non fussy, meal from the grilled quail in blueberry sauce to the smokey au gratin potatoes & perfect grill pork chop to the amazing truffles.  My husband's ribeye was devoured quickly & I found his fork in my delicious potatoes!  Ah yes, the service...?  Even better.  Our server, Denise, made everyone in the room feel like her guest.  She brought us a taste of her favorite Shiraz.  Cartwright's is in our "favorites" list, along Denise!!  
PS:  The friendly little hostess even seemed to love her job!!   She told us about the upcoming History Dinners where they'll feature a famous Arizona historian/story teller along with a special Chef dinner.  We'll be back for Bob Boze Bell's storytelling & another special dinner!!   Yum.5 stars for the best nachos on this planet.
The red pepper queso sauce on them, magical.
Love that the chicken on the nachos is shaved thinly.... so perfectly compliment the chips.

LOVE!Great nachos! Great service from Lauren.Historic wonderful place to stay at or just have lunch or dinner. Love the setting and the service.I've eaten here three or four times as its very convenient to where I live. The food (in particular the pizzas) is good. The service is excellent also. I think we have been a few times where deals have been on offer (birthdays etc) so keep your eye out for a special deal!Met friends for brunch here today and can't wait to go back. Loved the comfortable, kitchen-table seating, friendly, quick service but the food was the star. 

Two of us had breakfast, one an omelette and one a plate of chili espresso steak hash with basted eggs; two had lunch, one the No-Meat meatloaf and the other the New Mediterranean sandwich. All four of us commented on how the food was perfectly seasoned and cooked. With the exception of adding catsup to the potatoes with the hash and omelette, there was no need to adjust the seasoning at all. The person with the hash was impressed that the basted eggs were correctly cooked. The absolute best part was the carrot-parsnip-saffron cupcake - it had a moist, tender cake with crispy, caramelized edges, a tasty cream filling, and a light, sweet icing. Mmmmmmm. Delicious as it was the mocha chocolate came in second. One great thing about the cupcakes - they are incredibly good and very satisfying, but are a reasonable size, just right for one person. It's nice not to over-eat something wonderful because a treat is larger than your fist.Wood fired Pizzas & Pitchers of Craft Beer.

I recently had dinner at the Parlor with a big group of friends before going out to a concert at the Rhythm Room. The Parlor doesn't take reservations, but we were quickly seated at a six top directly across from the wood fired oven. The atmosphere was hip but casual. As a big group, it was easy to share everything from the pizzas to the pitchers of beer. The  favorites were the pitchers of Four Peaks Hop Knot,  and the sweet corn pizza. All the pizzas were a knockout, but it's the sweet corn pizza that keeps me awake at night. 

I'll absolutely go back to the Parlor.  Cheers.The Parlor, I loved it in so many ways because they take care of you on all levels, food, service & it's a nice spot to hang with your friends. Thanks Yelp, I would not have known of this place if it was not for you & my fellow Yelpers. Yep, as good as it gets for sure.Great pizza, wine , and service! I made my own pizza which is the best way!This stores is a potpourri of cheap booze!!! I would recommend this store to buy alcohol over any other place in Vegas!! Whether you are a local or visiting from out of town save yourself some money and get waaaay more drunk.It can be lonely being a cafe enthusiast in Waterloo. For six years I've had to endure a city with a makeshift coffee culture. To make matters worse, my Coop terms take me to Seattle and New York to enjoy the best cafe culture around only to yank me back to KW every 4 months.

Today I'm enjoying an Americano on King Street in Uptown Waterloo. Any other day I would be at Heuther's or my oh-so-favorite Second Cup. Not today. On the corner of Dupont & King there is a fresh infusion of coffee culture into mundane Uptown life.

This new cafe is appropriately called Coffee Culture and I have the best seat in the house! It's the red leather couch in the corner by the window. I can see the little old ladies in the street plastering their faces into the window wondering what this new place is. After walking away they are back literally 10 minutes later with their husbands to try it out.  

The lineup was short but the wait time was long. The cashier was new so I forgive him. I took in the menu instead. Oddly it's spread out the whole length of the bar making it hard to read everything while standing in line. After ordering and taking my super awesome seat the barista came by. She asked me exactly how much water I'd like in my Americano. It might not seem like special treatment but it is. The last time I had this custom a coffee made for me it was at bauhaus in trendy hipster Seattle.

The prices are low priced to fair here. I have a feeling they will rise to match everyone. Coffee shops are always more expensive to run than initially thought as well. Still, they are definitely competitive with Starbucks, Second Cup, Heuther Hotel and even Timmies. They have plenty of food. If I had money to spare I'd try it out. Though, the smell of it is enough to convince me to come back!

The place is sparkling clean. Sure to please my parents when they come for a visit. They never did like the grungy hipster makeshift house cafe's I generally drag them to. The couches are leather and the chairs and tables real wood - not plasticy Timmies style - though you knew that by now. They even have a nice big screen television so I can enjoy a game while getting some work done - free wifi hurrah!

Oh look, even a cop walked in to try it out. This place is destined for greatness :p So long Timmies and good riddance.

One new cafe may not be enough to turn KW into a thriving cosmopolitan city overnight. But with a new cafe, I feel better that coffee enthusiasts in KW aren't a dying species like first thought.I'm normally not a fan of Indian food, but this place is AM-AZ-ING! We ordered a ton of food and gobbled it down like vagabonds who had been starving in the desert for centuries. I highly recommend the Chicken Tikka Masalla and Okra dishes. PS: You definitely can't judge this book by its cover.My husband and I went to have some dinner and we didn't realize the time. The restaurant was actually closed and the owner Prakash welcomed us and gave us the option to order take out. We really appreciated that, and we were worried that his staff would be upset with us for ruining their closing routine! Prakash was so nice and he took our order and we even ordered extra sides after we had put the original order in, and he still accommodated us. He didn't even charge us for the extra sides. We will definitely come here again within hours when we are in town next time. The food was amazing spicy like we enjoy.The only one!A friend took us out here and it is truly some of the BEST thai food i've ever had. Every dish was so flavorful and authentic tasting. Now, i'm not thai, but you could really taste the complex flavors and cooking style were not watered down for americanized taste buds.

I ordered the Thai Basil with steamed tofu and the sauce was just to die for! perfect balance of sweet, salty, basil flavor. The eggplant basil dish was also mind blowing. The eggplant was slightly caramelized and meaty. The drunken noodles had soft, succulent noodles. the Pad thai was so different from the overly-peanutted(is that a word?) dishes I've had elsewhere. Lots of great flavor & texture everywhere. 
We also orderd a pot of tom yum soup for the table which was fantastic. However, please be warned, those are not green beans in there! it was a 5 alarm fire in my mouth for a minute when i took a bite into one of those chiles!

The prices are great - $4.99 lunch specials during the week and $8-$15 entrees otherwise. Everything was out of this world delicious. Don't miss this place if you are in Vegas and have a hankering for Thai food! I wish I had a place like this near home.

oh, also, it's in the Chinatown area off the strip so you can also go get foot massages at sketchy places across the street. ;-)Definitely a great value. Food quality is great. As good as some of my best experiences with sushi. Tuna firm and flavorful. Soft shell crab fantastic and rustic in presentation. All rolls expertly prepared and super quick. 

Friendly and attentive staff. 

This was a really fun time with great food. 

Thank you Masa for a great experience.It was only $15 with the coupon from their website.  The man that did the smog check was friendly and fast, you couldn't ask for anything more.Still great.  I have been dragging co-workers there left and right.  Everyone loves the food.  Duma is a great host.  Be prepared to smell like grease when you leave though..  But the food is worth it.  The Jerk Chicken Po Boy is good, but the shrimp is hands down my favorite.Stumbled (quite literally) into this beauty a few weeks ago while visiting Edinburgh.  A group of us was bouncing around town trying to find a bar that was staying open to watch the NFL playoff games (Seattle/SF wasn't going to end until 3am).
The bar itself is pretty nice, I mean, it's a bar.  Large on the inside, lots of booths, TVs for the game.  Obviously it wasn't packed as this was late night Sunday, but I can see this place filling up on weeknights.  

The staff was really what made the place though.  Such cool guys... Marty and Cian were awesome.  I found people to be generally pretty nice in Scotland, but bartenders usually make or break a bar and I can't say enough about these guys.  Absolute all stars.

The bar is a bit off the beaten path and has a cool location under a bridge so if you're looking to get off the Royal Mile or out of Grassmarket (which you should), 100% pay a visit to Dropkicks, you'll be happy you did- and tell the guys Brian from Seattle said hi, they may hook you up with a Bloody Mary shot!Excellent dinner.  Pricey, but worth it!  My server, Michael was wonderful!  Everything I ordered from sashimi to uni risotto to peking duck was delicious.Still recovering from the meat sweats and maybe lost a couple days of my life from all the food I ate from the excitement, increase in blood pressure, and overall detrimental affects to my cholesterol but IT WAS WORTH IT!

Came for the $79 signature tasting menu and it was awesome to say the least!  

http://www.arialasvegas.com/files/dining/Jean-Georges-Signature-79.pdf

They have a $49 tasting but as you peruse the menu choices, you'll clearly see that the $79 is value wise the way to go!

For your appeteizer, you must get the Bacon Shrimp, Papaya Mustard, and Cilantro.  It was one of the best things i've ever ate.  NIce, plump juicy big shrimp wrapped in bacon with the perfect bite of saltiness from the bacon.  I almost done wet my pants bfore my steak arrived.

Next came my 18 ounce rib eye...Insane amount of food.  They were very nice to offer 2 complimentary sauces on the side.  I highly recommend the Homemade Hot Sauce.   We also go thte Soy-Miso Butter which was also good.

I like to eat my steak plain usually but it was nice to alternate bites between the sauces.

In addition to the pre-fix, we also ordered the Black Truffle Mash Potatoes - SITM "S3X in the Mouth" alert!!!

I can't stop raving about this place.  If you're looking for a fine dining LV strip steak house, check this place out.   If i was ballen in the mix, I'd be up here all the time!I'm definitely a fan of Jean Georges at the Aria! Great food, excellent service, and an all-around great experience. If you're looking for some good eats at the Aria and want to venture off in some of the fine dining they have to offer, Jean Georges is definitely one of those places that delivers.

The Place -
Jean Georges is located inside of the Aria Casino on the Promenade Level (2nd Level) across from The Buffet in this, sort of, horseshoe next to a few of the other restaurants. While Yelp describes the place as needing "dressy" attire, you can definitely enter the place with a "business casual" type of a dress code. If you enter the place with a t-shirt or shorts, you will definitely feel out of place. The restaurant itself is fairly dark and intimate, which is expected with any type of fine dining experience and the furniture and decor is very modern. The bar is a fairly decent size; however, the seats at the bar are spread out spaciously so that you don't feel like you're sitting in someone else's lap when you're enjoying your beverage or eating your meal. At the bar, you're treated with two flat panel TVs mounted back to back to take care of both sides of the countertop. The restaurant itself has a fairly big footprint and can definitely accommodate for any party size. Very cool place, Jean Georges!
*****5/5 Stars*****

The Service -
I was in town for a conference and the last session ended at 5:15pm. Jean Georges's only service is during dinner with doors opening at 5:00pm. Immediately, after my last session, I went straight to Jean Georges in hopes of being able to just sit at the bar as a walk-in. I checked out their digital menu that is mounted on the wall right outside of the restaurant and after a few brief minutes, I approached the door where I was greeted by several hostesses. I asked if Jean Georges is reservation only or if I could walk-in to the bar and they politely let me know that the bar was open seating, offering the full dinner menu, and that I was more than welcome to have a seat. Hostess interaction is really important to me as it's usually the first impression that you get of the restaurant and Jean Georges delivered flawlessly. I sat myself at the bar where I was then promptly greeted by the bartender, Thomas. He asked if I was staying to eat and gave me a menu to glance over. After that, he gave me the drink menu, gave me a few minutes, and took the initiative of getting me a water in the meantime. I came during Game 1 of the World Series and they had the game on the TVs and the bartenders and patrons were participating in general conversation regarding the game and were all really down to earth. The excellent service continued throughout constantly checking up on me making sure that I was ok. The service in a restaurant is just as important as the food they serve and Jean Georges definitely delivered. Thanks, guys!
*****5/5 Stars*****

The Food -
Goodness gracious, where do I begin? As I was looking through the menu attempting to figure out what I wanted, the bartender(not Thomas) came around and gave us popcorn (See Picture) to snack on. Now, some of you probably just snickered at the mention of "popcorn" at a fine dining restaurant, but trust me, this is popcorn you DEFINITELY wanna try. The popcorn, in addition to it being buttered, is also dusted with Cayenne Pepper and Rosemary giving it a savory kick to your tastebuds. The taste is absolutely addicting and wouldn't mind if they made it available for the public to buy and have it shipped to their house haha. For my main dish, I ordered the Soy Glazed Short Ribs (See Picture) and the Truffle Mac & Cheese (See Picture). The Truffle Mac & Cheese is nothing special, but delicious nonetheless. It's very creamy and cheesy and the truffle is present throughout each bite. The Soy Glazed Short Ribs were nothing short of amazing. The short ribs were perfectly cooked not needing a knife, only your fork, to cut it. The accompanying apple-jalepeno puree was a sweet and savory accent that matched perfectly with the apple slaw that was served on top of the short ribs, which I could've ate just by itself all day haha. The Soy Glaze on the short ribs was absolutely delicious and is definitely what made these short ribs some of the best I've ever tasted and I've tasted A LOT! Haha. The glaze was sweet, tangy, and did not overpower the rest of the dish. It was well-balanced and I HIGHLY recommend it if you're in the mood for some delicious short ribs! Tres bien, Jean Georges.....tres, tres bien!
*****5/5 Stars*****

Overall -
I'm glad I was in vicinity of this restaurant. There are many places to choose from in Vegas when it comes to a steakhouse. In fact, I believe each major casino on The Strip has their own steakhouse so it makes it hard to choose. If you're in the Aria as a visitor or a guest of the hotel, I would HIGHLY recommend checking out Jean Georges! Thank you for the great food, great service, and a memorable experience.We had an amazing experience here. There were only a few other guests here while we were dinning so things were very intimate. The food and service was beyond 5 stars. 

The ambiance is amazing. Dark, intimate, and classically modern. Being here just felt right. 

They have a million people on staff. One person brings you to your seat, another person pulls the chair back for you, another bring silverware, another does drinks, etc. you get the point. Their fresh baked breads were amazing and constant! They had bacon bread rolls made every 20 minutes, they were amazing. 

The Amuse-bouche was a tuna tartar that really set the tone for the evening. We ordered the Wagyu tartar and sweetbreads for the appetizer, they were insanely good and fairly priced. 

The Wagyu was served with a chocolate crisp and mixed with the most delicate of ingredients topped with an egg yolk. The sweetbreads were lightly battered and confit in bacon lardo, the sweetbreads go down as one of the best dishes I have had. 

I had the veal cheeks, I have had veal cheeks before and this is by far the best that I had. They were cooked to perfection, I cannot say anything bad about my dish. 

This place truly deserves its Michelin stars! The prices are so good considering what you get. There were 4 of us, we had 2 apps, 4 meals, 2 bottles of wine and dessert all under $400?! This is insane for 4 people at a Michelin rated restaurant.Sat with Bond. When I was figuring out how I like my steak, he recommended that I get it "perfect". That shall now be how I ask for my steak cooked

The Maine Dayboat Lobsters are magnificent. A unique blend of flavors that screams for you to slow down and enjoy the interplay of flavors on your palette. Almost like a bespoke surf and turf.

Australian Wagyu Sirloin with La Ratte Potato Purée & Confit Baby Raddish
Was horrible! Well, it horribly ruined my ability to accept blasé steak with traditional sauces. The sauce reminded me more of a braised/stew dish and was pleasantly tasteful and different from the norm.

Rhubarb Tart with Oatmeal Crisp, rhubarb ribbon and creme fraiche sorbet. The perfect dessert to top off a perfect meal. A delightful blend of sweet and tart flavors with an incredible texture mixture. There are almost too many flavors but right when you feel pushed to the edge, you take a moment to slow down and then everything comes together and you realize each element is in its perfect place.Ok, this is a legitimate 5 Star Restaurant.

Located in the beautiful and elegant Aria Resort, Sage is everything I heard it would be and more.  The decoration has been described as sexy and that's a pretty good assessment.  It's gorgeous.  Serene and relaxing.  A great environment to eat amazing food.  Our server was kind, knowledgeable, and attentive.  

We started off with a delicious arancini (fried rice ball) from the kitchen.  My wife ordered the chestnut soup with pork belly.  I tried it... phenomenal.  I started with a poached farm egg with black truffle and toasted bread.  Simple and yet mindblowing.  For dinner, my wife had the gnocchi with braised rabbit and black truffle.  It was great.  I had the scallops which were cooked perfectly in a salted caramel sauce... not too sweet but enough to bring out the flavor of the scallop.  Outstanding.  For dessert, my wife had the liquid pumpkin pie... fantastic flavor.  I ordered the nut tart that came with espresso ice cream, crunchy glazed peanuts, caramel, coffee crispies, and mandarin orange.  No bite tasted the same but all were blissful. 

I really commend the chef for allowing the sauces to accent the food without over taking the flavor of the proteins and starches.

I really can't recommend Sage highly enough.  This is the type of restaurant in which you want to take your time.  You will really want the experience to last forever.We had excellent service, the food was mouth-watering and the ambience was pleasant.

Aria is very well-decorated in general, and this restaurant lives up to the rest of the hotel. It is modern, well-lit and tastefully done up. 

The wait staff was very attentive, helped us to place our order and refilled our water glasses regularly .

 Being Indian, our palates craved spicy food but were advised that on a scale of 1 to 10, 4 was already pretty spicy. So that's what we picked and it was a good decision. The order included chicken satay (perfect and wonderfully presented), Thai yellow curry(very aromatic and garnished with toasted coconut), mushroom basil fried rice (yummy) and cashew chicken (tender and flavorful). All this for a total of $56.00.

Afterwards, while boxing our leftovers, the waiters included utensils and napkins, which was thoughtful.Cheap, quick, and freakin awesome! Oh did I add that they have free access to their vacuums. It's the worst when you pop your quarters in and you have just a lil more to go and bam- it shuts off. Definitely don't have to worry about that here. Also the cherry air freshner rocked my world and the lil wipey they give you to wipe your dash off was a lovely smell as well. I can't remember the last time i was eager about getting my car washed, but definitely running through there the next time I'm due for another car wash.I've been a loyal costumer for two years, their lemon chicken is amazing! Their boba is great (I suggest the avocado, it's the only one made fresh)! Their service is great and their food is very good for its affordable prices! My go to when I'm in the mood for Chinese fast food!I've had pretty good luck trying places with few reviews but high ratings, and Nunthaporn's is no exception.

We went at around dinner time on a weekday and found plenty of street parking right in front of the restaurant. 

The inside is Thai reminiscent without being over-the-top or wannbe-trendy.  Plenty of seating and I didn't see any 2-top tables, which I like because I generally eat with a friend of mine and between the amount of food we order and how tall we are 2-tops generally make me claustrophobic.

The service here was great, prompt seating and order.  The menu is as expected for a Thai restaurant with about 60 dishes in all in various categories.  I had the red curry and my friend had the yellow.  We also had an order of 'Thai toast' which was a lightly fried pastry with chicken inside and covered in a sweet & sour sauce.  

The curry was delicious, though the menu lead me to believe it was going to be a little more spicy.  I have fond memories of eating in small restaurants in southern Thailand and having my tongue chemically removed by spicy seafood dishes.  Next time I will try the only item (that I saw) on the menu with a four star spicy rating.

On the way out I saw two separate large parties dining and they had ordered some dishes family-style, which came in large two-tier serving bowl/platters and looked extremely tasty, so I would definitely recommend bringing larger groups here.

The prices were very reasonable and I was really happy with the quality of the food.  I will definitely be coming back often, especially since Char's on Rural / University is gone.  Overall this restaurant is probably more of a 4.5 star, but I will round up this time to keep the rating :)Love this place, the staff is always so friendly.  My favorite dish is the smoked salmon pasta, truly tastes like a dish I had in Italy.  Even better, my boyfriend "hated fish" until I made him try this.  Now, we got back specifically for this, but always grab some jalapeno crab-cakes, loaded quesadilla, or decadent caprese skewers.  the food is always delicious!I have been going to iFocus since it pretty much opened and am very pleased with my experience each and every time I go for my annual eye exam. This year's eye exam came a little bit early due to an incident where my ass broke my glasses in half while I was taking a nap on the couch. I called on Friday morning and they were able to squeeze me in at 11am on the same day! I can't lie, I was pretty excited about getting a new pair of glasses (I think I have a fetish for them). As usual, as soon as I came in I was greeted by the receptionist and was checked in right away. While waiting for the usual prescription check, I browsed around for some new frames (I love this part) and was taken to the back within 5 minutes. It was a pretty busy day for them, but Dr. Velasco still saw me within 15 minutes of my arrival. If there was a gold standard for doctors, I think Dr. Velasco is it. She is so pleasant, personable, and at the same time very knowledgeable about what she's doing. She makes you feel like you're doing a great job reading the letters in front of you despite the fact that you're doing a really crappy job and missing half the letters. Anyway, I have recommended my entire family, my ex, my current, and my coworkers to her. Lol For every person I recommend, I get a $25 credit. Win-win, right? Thanks Dr. Velasco!All right guys, I'm getting a little concerned. I see the reviews and that's all well and good, but every time I go into Sonora, it's empty! After the loss of Karey's Kitchen, I feel I have to take a more proactive approach. I went to Karey's Kitchen when I was hungover all the time, but apparently a restaurant cannot live on Georgeann G.'s hangovers alone (I know, it shocked me too).

Next time you think about going to Chipotle, come here instead! They can share the massive line Chipotle has from open to close every day! Don't get me wrong, I love me some Chipotle, but I don't want to lose Sonora, so I want to share the wealth a bit.

That's enough of my plea. Still 5 stars. If you look at the picture of the to-go order that I just inhaled while watching a Hills marathon in my living room, you'll see why. Delicious!Excellent Sonoran style food, very friendly service, and very inexpensive.  It's a small place run by the owner herself, and the quality comes through.Great muay thai!!! work outs will kill you!!! instructors seem very knowledgable. good, well maintained equipment. very clean.This place is awesome. The trainers are skilled and very detail oriented. They will push you to the limit every time you go. This place is not for the feint of heart, so be prepared and excited to learn and work, and you will have a great time. If you want to disappear into a crowd of people learning kickboxing while punching the air and standing in place, go do Tae Bo. 

Their schedule is great, with classes all day everyday. I work a typical 9-5 and could make it to class every day if I wanted. They've got gear for beginners to use and will sell you your own set of gear at a reasonable price if you would like it.

The trainers are great, and the general atmosphere in the gym is always positive. Other students will offer help while you are learning, so listen and learn. If you're coming in with some skill this is still a great place for you to learn and grow.

I've had a great time here and would recommend this sport, and particularly this gym to anyone interested in learning.Absolutely my favorite place to be!About 2 years ago a girlfriend took me with her to class.  Two years later I'm still going and it has changed my life.  

As a collegiate golfer I had practiced yoga in a number of different settings.   Nothing could have prepared me for what I have experienced at Sumits.  Whether you are an advanced yogi or it's your first class the teachers at Sumits are welcoming and ready to guide you.  I went from a student who could barely finish a class to a seasoned yogi that looks forward to practice each day.

The room studio is HOT and takes some getting used to.  But once your body becomes accustomed it's an opening and detoxifying experience.  The well orchestrated classes are the same each time and help build strength, flexibility, and balance.  The practice is as much about mental healing though as it is physical.  It's the one time of day when you can truly let go of everything in the outside world and focus on yourself.

I'm of the opinion that this type of yoga should be a part of anyone's routine who is looking for a well balanced body and mind.  I can't say enough good things about this studio and it's staff.Darn this place.  I wasn't a big fan at first.  Their drinks are good but they serve iced drinks in paper cups, which I find annoying.  But the kid likes their smoothies and the fact that they give her a lollipop and a whipped cream dollop on her straw.  So we go.  THEN ONE DAY.... wait for it.......... we order the Green Apple Smoothie.  Wow.  Wow.  Green Apple, Caramel and, if you really want to go over the top, whipped cream.  Now, all of their smoothies are super sweet treats.  But the Green Apple thing is different and wonderful.Not only is the coffee great tasting and the chai delicious, but the friendliness and customer service is awesome.  My friend frequents this location (every morning before work) and when he's needed a ride due to his car being dropped off for work done I have driven him here on the way.  To attest to the quality of the place, he drives daily to this location despite the fact that it's about 15 minutes (without traffic) past his workplace - where they greet him by name and have his usual orders memorized.

I have enjoyed the freezes, coffee, and chai (which is my favorite).  Drinks are full flavored and although their menu is limited, they have something for pretty much everyone.  I haven't tried any of their food items, but he does get a muffin in the mornings which looked pretty good.

It is a small location on the corner with a drive-through and a side window for those able to park and pick up their coffee in their limited lot, but it's friendly and has a very pleasant atmosphere.  When I'm craving a nice spiced chai, I head over to this location even though it's past some other coffee shops for the flavor, consistency, friendliness, and service.I love this bar! 

It's trendy and cool and stocks great booze - Swedish cider! It's ideal for a date venue, a casual place to meet friends or a place to show off to someone and be like "yeah, this is one of the best bars in Edinburgh and I totally know about it as I'm cool & hip!". 

If you want to start your night not too far away from town then this place is ideal! In my opinion, it's the best of the nearby bars owned by the same couple (Sofi's, Boda & Joseph Pearces) and has a fab DJ at the weekends. My only complaint is the music was a bit loud, however now I'm feeling old & crusty writing that... :(

It also a fairy lights.... and you can't beat a good fairy light! :)I need to update my review. Today I decided to speak with a manager and let them know about out experience. Billy invited us back this evening for a meal on him. I couldn't be more grateful. It was a much better experience than the night before and it was nice to know that the Outback cares enough to make it right. We have been going to this establishment for a while and we will keep going. Thanks Bully and the entire team who helped make our night enjoyable.I came here for my boyfriend's birthday meal with his mother and aunt.  They had all been here before and had great reviews so I was very eager and excited to try some tasty thai! 

The location of the restaurant is nicked away behind the castle. Apparently they were previously located at a much smaller location near the Usher Hall.  I immediately felt welcomed when I had entered and the smell of the food was very enticing. 

The food was delicious! I particularly enjoyed the coconut rice.  Our waitress was very friendly and indeed funny - she made some very clever jokes! 

Tip: When heading to the bathroom make sure to look out the window - excellent view of the city!Nifty bar overlooking the pool at Encore. The drinks are creative, service quick and firendly and the atomosphere classically Wynn/Encore. Lush, lascivious and yet refined.

There are really two areas here, the bar that lines the edge of the casino and sumptuous lounge.  The bar gets pretty hopping about 11pm.

HINT: If you want to see the parade of hotties headed from the valet to the nightclub XS, this is the perfect place. Like long legged antelopes, they head to the range. Later in the night, you'll see them limping back, often with their 6" heels held in their hands, dangling by their straps like grapes from the vine.amazingggggggggggggggg!!!!

love, love, love, loveeee the show! the costumes were jaw dropping and the music was excellent! 

the place is pretty small and the costumes are pretty big so you don't have to sit in the front to get a good view!

i got a student discount by showing my school ID and my ticket was only 25 bucks!! best 25 bucks i've ever spent!YOU MUST COME SEE THIS SHOW BEFORE IT LEAVES VEGAS!

OMG, I've seen many shows in Vegas, but this one is the best one I've ever seen!  The costume was wonderful! It's also kid-friendly and nice to see that Vegas is not just an adult-only place.  Obviously, the story line is what we all expect :) 

I've always heard that for this show, you need to sit as far away as possible.  And I'd have to say that there is no such thing as a "bad seat" for this show.  Again, the costume was what made it!  My boyfriend and I were amazed by this show.  In fact, he had such a great time... he started singing along! (OMG...) Yes, he was singing and I had to hush him up!!  

If you're looking to catch it before it leaves (or any show in that manner)... make sure you try to buy the tickets from "Tickets 4 Less" or something like that.  It's a place where on day of or maybe the day before the show, you get a chance to buy show tickets at a discounted price.  

Again, it's Vegas, so pre-drink before because the drinks there are EXPENSIVE!  I didn't even want to get a diet coke after looking at those prices.  Luckily I had "snuck in" a bottle of water :)i have been going to Tawana since 2007 and love my nails. I always receive compliments on my nails.I'M BACK!!!
New year New Beginnings!!!
I have always loved my nails when Tawana did them. We just had some issues that made me choose to leave. While being gone I could not find one that did the work as she did. I found someone that tried and was nice but, not the same. After getting a message from Tawana regards to my YELP review it got me thinking. She was very sincere and I choose to go back.
She is now in a new location which is BEAutiful!! Love the decore and Ms Bessie is still there on her donut pillow!!
My nails are wonderful and I am so happy to have come back and to stay from this day forward!!! Tawana  knows and loves her job and puts her whole heart into it and it shows. I before have never and even now have never had a nail break or lift and I get so many compliments.
Give her a shot you will be thankful you did and wont want to go anywhere else. She is very creative also. Her prices are very reasonable and she does guarantee the work 100%.

Thank you Tawana!!!Great little Japanese market with tons of goodies-Fresh produce, bento boxes, sushi, and musubi,  aisles of cool and wierd snacks and treats...we even tried Japanese cola and peach drinks which tasted good with a funky texture, like drinking jello...we also snacked on some musubi and baby tako.

The staff are always friendly and informative every time we've visited. I wish
they had another location near me...ALOHA!!!My husband & I have been coming to this Village Inn since 2008. We really enjoyed it. The food there is excellent (I normally eat their breakfast meals) and the service is good. I love the new look they have now. They remodelled the inside of the restaurant since last year. It looks fantastic. I love the new colors too. Great place.Truely as good as it gets for clubbing with a hook up in Las Vegas. No charge to get on the guest list, we always have ladies free and local gents free but I know that can change based on the club, night of the week, special events. We just have to arrive between a certain time and get the perks. Chris is amesome and responds right away. We were approaching the line to get our passes at the palms and there was a guy standing next to booth texting away on his cell, I told me fiance that has to be him, and it was. Great guy! So glad I found this promotor, wish I would have known 6 years ago when I turned 21! Palms is the best for great dinner and great clubs...Oh yeah check out Moon and take the escalator that is inside the club up to Playboy. No lines/Cover to chill out at Playboy if you go via the escalator!

N9NE is delicious and not your normal restuarant atmosphere, feels like a lounge with hot music playing and excellent food. Server was awesome and comped us and himself a shot to cheers to for being in the industry. 

Great Night! Free Vegas Club Passes is for REAL!Chris was awesome and I will not go to Vegas clubs without contacting him first.

We went to Pure at Caesars palace and it was awesome. The line was short and girls got wristbands for free vodka drinks until midnight and no cover.  Guys were only $20, which was worth it for this club. Chris texted us at 5pm to confirm and give the details on when to arrive, prices, and guest list information.

Chris was nice enough to answer my texts and let me know the hottest spots for both nights and not to go to certain clubs on ceertain nights, which was great. Only the locals would know where the best clubs are each night.

Recommend to everyone.Because of Christine's glowing review, I decided to try Angel Eyes.

MY HOUSE IS SO CLEAN!!
:)

And let me tell you, it was dirty.  For realz.
but now.... 
now.....
now it's so clean!!

I'm so happy.  
I wonder how quickly me, my man, and my two furry babies will be able to soil this clean house.

I thought that the husband and wife team that is Angel Eyes were friendly, reasonably priced, and great cleaner/organizers!

I will definitely be calling them again in the near future.Love everything about this restaurant. Freshest food ever!!This was my first and definitely not my last all you can eat Korean BBQ experience. Everything is served buffet style, and your table has a grill on it where you cook your own meat to your liking. I absolutely loved all the meats that I tried, but my personal favorite was the galbi (short-ribs), bulgogi and the spicy pork belly. So freaking good, OMG! The side dishes were pretty decent, but I used most of my stomach space on the real substantial stuff. I truly can't wait to go back the next time I'm in Vegas... wish we had a place like Sura BBQ in Utah.Service was excellent.  The waitress made sure our drinks were ever empty. She also came by occasionally to make sure everything was good.

The food was great.  The meats were marinated perfectly and there was a good variety. Definitely coming back the next time I'm in Vegas.Excellent food we've eaten here over the last couple years, food has always been great. Service is good but if you want the best service every, ask for the Hawaiian Barbie ( Maxine) she'll take GREAT care of you. She is the real deal, very friendly and very helpful. She will make your dinning experience outstanding.Okay, before everyone gets mad at me for adding yet another new entry for Wynn, here's the catch.  The Country Club @ Wynn Casino is NOT the golf course.  It is the bar/restaurant at the golf course.  As of today, you will notice that all 23 of those reviews were written by people who have never played the course.

When it first opened, the Wynn Golf Club was open only to hotel guests for the staggering price of $500 per round.  Later, as the economy soured, it was opened up to anyone who had the pocketbook to afford it.  More recently, they have begun offering discounted rates to attract enough golfers to keep the caddies busy. $300 will get you on the course Mon-Thur.  The rate goes to $375 Fri-Sun.  This includes a caddy, rental clubs, rental shoes, golf cart, bottled water and various sports drinks.  Actually not a bad deal in my book.  I played the course twice in the same day as the replay rate was only $200.

The layout is tough.  Only one of the par 4s is less than 400 yards.  That hole is 386 yards but has an optical quality to it that will make you swear it's the longest hole on the course.  

Many courses are not memorable because all the holes look the same.  You will find it difficult to remember this course at times because each and every hole is incredibly different.  Between streams, bridges, ponds, bunkers and even waterfalls, each hole is a little piece of artwork.  Go to the Wynn website for pictures and more information.

This is a must-play, even if it's only once in your entire life.  At times, it is impossible to believe your right on the Las Vegas strip, with only the  towering Wynn and Encore casinoes to remind you where you are.  The staff will treat you like a celebrity from the moment you check in at the pro shop.  A personal concierge will escort you to the locker room and ensure everything is taken care of. 

A few final tips:

Bring a camera
Bring your own golf balls
Bring a change of clothes (they have showers in the locker room)
Enjoy yourself regardless of how you playWe bought cake pops for my son's graduation party and they were a HUGE hit! I think I may like them better than the cupcakes. Just the right amount, moist and delicious.Go here! If you don't leave a little bit happier & lighthearted then you're the Grinch incarnate.

I want to come back when I have more time. I didn't realize they were closing in 15 min when we pulled up at 5:45. It was a spur of the moment visit to check out a new place.

I walked in and...
"Ohhh" *giggle*
"Ahhhh" *sigh*
"Look!" *squeal*

I could feel myself reverting back to being 6 or 7 & being overwhelmed by goodies of all kinds. The lunch boxes caught my eye right away. I wish I could go back to grade school & be the kid with the coolest lunch box ever!

I watched a young boy who was about 9 almost frantically decide what he wanted. His mom told him he could get 1 thing. Man, the look on his face! There's just SOOO much to choose from. Poor kid lol

My friend & I checked out the photobooth pics on the wall. Funny! I wanted to do the photobooth but my friend didn't :( I'm the adventurous one.

Some of their prices are ridiculously cheap. 5 cents here, 25 cents there... Other things I thought, "I wouldn't pay $2.50 for a candy bar I can get anywhere."

I bought a sour green apple & a peppermint stick. 50 cents each! nom nom nom

My friend found a pin button he liked. Those are $1.

Great little place. Just by the outside you feel like you're going to walk into Candyland come to life. Makes me think this is the PG version of Easley's with tons of new school & old school candy.Fun candy and novelties!  I am 12 again as soon as I go through the doorThe best (and, I think, cheapest) fro-yo around. Luckily it's about a two-minute drive from my parents' house! A must whenever I am visiting.Have been going there for several months for arthritis, neuropathy and help with knee replacement scar tissue. Danielle is great and has made such a difference. I joined and have a monthly membership, but actually go twice a month.This place rocks!  Great fish and great prices and the people working there make your experience fun.  Ask D for his secret monkey ball roll or ask for the off-menu garlic edamame!I went there after reading the Yelp reviews.  I have to admit, I was somewhat skeptical of all the great reviews.

I went there and had the AYCE.  Wow, nice service and friendly staff.  Went for lunch on a Saturday at about 1:00 and the place was about 75% full.

The fish is fresh and the chefs are accommodating.  I asked for a roll combination that was not on the menu and they made it for me.  They don't rush you at all and I wound up watching almost an entire ball game.  

Two Thumbs up.Love them the girls are so nice. They have energy to get you hyped up. They appeal both to females and males also. They way they dress is sexy but not trashy like other casinos.I read some of the reviews for this place and had to laugh. Most of the people who said the food is terrible are probably used to Sonoran Mexican food. This is Mexico city style! I grew up on the Mexican border in Texas and spent a lot of time visiting family in Mexico. I have to say after moving to Arizona 3 years ago I had given up on "good" Mexican food because I hate Sonoran style food. I stumbled upon this place stopped in for dinner and fell in love! I felt like I was finally having a taste of home. The food is authentic and the service is great! Staff is friendly and attentive. Also I read someone say they charge you for refills on drink which is no longer the case! Everyone looking for a change from the usual Sonoran style of AZ should try this place!I've now been here quite a few times, most recently last week for lunch with a coworker. This place is solid and consistent in every aspect. Great service, the food is amazing and tastes like "home" - every time. I love being on their mailing list, as they often send updates on off-menu specials, live music and more. Can't remember if it was May or July, but I know their one-year anniversary was recently. The first of many, I hope!We are always impressed with our meals at Mimitas. I have tried several things on the menu, but always migrate back to the Medianoche sandwich! All sandwiches come with classic Cuban sides including yuca frita or margaritas! Both are delicious. Highly recommended hidden gem.Nikki was great! she did a great job and i felt very comfortable!Fantastic salon with great energy. Everyone is very friendly. Ask for Michelle McKee, she is awesome. Michelle is one of those people you like instantly. She is very friendly and a great stylist with a lot of experience. Go see her!This was our first time trying Russian food and it did not disappoint.  
We started with golubtsy and for the entree I had stroganoff and my husband had the Hungarian goulash with homestyle potatoes. We shared the praga cake for desert which was a chocolate lovers dream. The food was presented beautifully, can't wait to go back and try more!Our world is in a funny place right now. The economy is, well, questionable at best. Many people are struggling with providing for their families. As we are confronted with fast food restaurants on every corner providing cheap, quick and not terribly healthy fare, we can sometimes be conflicted with dinner choices. Most families I know are looking to make more meals at home in an effort to ensure that they know exactly what is going into the food and also to save a few pennies here and there. The problem with that for some can be a limited amount of knowledge in the kitchen and knowing how to prepare a meal using foods that are in season in an effort to get the most bang for your buck. I think I have found the solution for you - AndyFood, a culinary kitchen experience, located in Scottsdale. Chef Andy Broder takes the guesswork out of the menu for you and provides all the tips and tricks you need to cruise through your kitchen effortlessly!

My initial intention was to observe Andy's class and do a quick interview when he had time during the cooking portion of the class. The ever-charming and energetic host suggested that I participate in the class as well and I am so glad that I did!

Upon arrival, I found myself in a warm and whimsically decorated kitchen gleaming with the state of the art Viking appliances. As Andy had a class leave less than an hour prior to the start of the next class arriving, the kitchen was bustling with activity. As the staff hurriedly prepped the cooking stations, Andy greeted me with an "air" handshake - he is a stickler for kitchen hygiene.

I continued to observe the prepping as the night's students began to file in. Everyone found their places at the two tables, dressed with a welcome pack that included the evening's menu with complete recipes, lemon-infused water and pumpkins as centerpieces which fell in line nicely with the autumn menu.

As everyone was seated, there was the time and opportunity for introductions and friendly conversation. Soon, Andy introduced himself giving a quick synopsis of his background. He is a native of Arizona, having grown up in Tucson, and started his career as a lawyer for 12 years. He switched things up by graduating from the Scottsdale Culinary Institute and traveling to the LA Times for his externship. After returning to Arizona he headed up some cooking classes and 7 1/2 years ago, AndyFood was born.

While enjoying an amuse of grilled chicken and cucumber tzatsiki, we went over the evenings recipes. Andy took special care to give brief lessons in the specific knife skills that would be used in each recipe, as well as providing important tips for preparing the foods at home. We were given many tips and tricks along the way - which I will not reveal here as you should really do yourself the favor of attending one of Andy's classes; you will be glad that you did.

After everyone had a thorough hand washing, the class was off to their stations and so began the experience. The staff was always available for any questions or concerns that came up. Sous Chef Sandy Lieberman was an absolute delight and had a joyful and maternal way about her.

I had the opportunity to, sort of, hop between stations and it was really great to see complete strangers working together, laughing and thoroughly enjoying themselves and the experience. It makes sense that 70 percent of Andy's business comes by the way of team building and corporate events. What an amazing way to convey teamwork outside of the office!

Once all the courses were complete, the meal was set up buffet style. By this time we all felt like old friends, so we grabbed plates, loaded up on everyone's creations and returned to our seats to marvel in our achievements.

The dinner was delicious: simple and elegant at the same time. My hands down favorites would have to be the Spiced Apple & Brie Tarts as well as the Individual Chocolate Pecan Tarts.

Chef Andy's enthusiasm and interaction with the class certainly made the experience for myself as well as other students that I spoke with. This is most definitely something you do not want to miss. Andy's experience, professionalism and obvious passion for his profession are apparent the moment he introduces himself. The care that is put into the menu selection is just the beginning of the journey. Sign up today for one of the many classes offered at AndyFood by visiting andyfood.com. I know I am!

http://phoenixbites.com/2010/11/01/an-evening-of-cooking-at-andyfood-culinary-studio/Excellent breakfast with consistent 5 star service. I have had breakfast all over Scottsdale in traveling for work and the Steel cut oats here are awesome! Plus, they give you both walnuts and pecans, plus strawberries!

Great job!My favorite friend chicken.  I have not yet been to their new location but  their food is SO good.  can't wait to visit again.I met Lo-Lo for the first time this weekend and boy was she beautiful. I can't stop thinking about her golden brown hair and her soft butter lips which tasted ever so sweet. 

It's a shame she lives 5 hours away. She promised to bake me some of her delicious cornbread the next time we meet. Mmmhmm.Friendliest service I have ever got at a tire store, including other Discount Tires.  I dropped off my vehicle with a nail in the tire, but not yet flat.  I got a call about an hour later saying my car was ready.  When I picked it up, there was no charge.  Tire plugged and everything good to go.  When I asked "no charge"? I was told "just think of us next time you need new tires".. Reminded me of how service was back in the good old days.I'm going to guess that at least a quarter of my closet is from this Kohl's location. Every time I stop in even if I just want to browse I can't help but find amazing deals. Yesterday I picked up a dress, two shirts, and a pair of shoes all for $25. That's cheaper than most shirts are at certain female clothing store (and after you wash them once start to come apart!) 

There are so many racks to go through, and sometimes it takes awhile especially if you try your choices on. But soooo worth it when you go home knowing you have a few new outfits and you didn't even have to break the bank.Pho won't be the same for me anymore. I like my pho like I like my women, cheap, hot, and authentic. Best value for the price.This is a great show!! The new venue is really nice and there is not a bad seat in the house!!

The girls are sexy and a great addition to the show!!! Who wants to just see the same old three guys in front of a brick wall?

It has music, variety, and comics that you notice from tv, and the price is pretty cheap.

If you dont have a great time in this show you need a new sense of humor!Well, after a mere month, I'm updating my review of Petit Fromage to reflect that they are the Five-Star shop I knew they could be.  I just stopped in for lunch and hade one of Lara's "Petite Snacks" for lunch, and am radiating happiness for having done so.  I can only refer to Petit Fromage in superlatives based on my experiences there over the past month.  Customer service is tip-top, the selection is great, and the shop really fosters a sense of community.  Life is good with a cheese shop such as this in the neighborhood.I have been looking for a good place to get my haircut since we moved here in Vegas a few months ago, and for the longest time I've been hesitant. I had a hairstylist that I went to all the time in DC and since we moved, I've been worried that my hair will not be styled as well as before. 

I have very thick hair and it's not easy to find a stylist that can understand what to do with this tremendous amount of hair that I have. I knew I was due for a haircut a long time ago, but because of my worries, I resorted to tying it back all the time. It was horrendous! 

So this morning, I called and asked if I can get an appointment. The lady who answered the phone asked me if I have a particular stylist that I want, and since almost every review here talked about James, I thought, "Why not him?". Unfortunately, he was fully booked for today and I wanted to go today so I just said anyone will do. She said my stylist will be Keturah. I read one review here about her and it was 5 stars so I was very hopeful that everything will turn out okay at least.

When I arrived, Keturah was just about finished cutting a guy's hair. When she came to me, she asked me about my preferences, and I really told her what I wanted and told her about my hair. She was very patient and friendly all throughout the process. I felt very comfortable with her work. She's very nice and friendly too. She asked if I wanted coffee or something to drink, and she asked if I wanted magazines to read. :)

My hair is really difficult and occasionally, she would joke, "You have so much hair!" and I know that it's not easy to deal with it but she was very detailed and she really did a fantastic job! I really love how my hair turned out and I really will be back. I'm am really fine with not being able to book James. I've found Keturah and I'll be back for her. :)I was recommended to John since I've been searching for years for a new hairstylist. Everyone I've attempted to try has either cut it wrong or my hair grew out very odd. I was told to try John as he cuts really well and is fairly fast, which I love having my hair done as quick as possible.  I can't stand sitting in a chair for more than an hour. From start to finish, I was done with my haircut within 20 minutes including wash! What the?! I was sooo happy! Not only was the cut great but it grew out fantastic. My hair is a bit of a weird mixture of curly, straight, bipolar. So for someone to know how to cut it properly is extremely hard for me to find. He's definitely my go to guy from now onWhat a great experience - and a great value for the minimal cost! 
This was my 2nd visit to the Paul Mitchell School Salon. 
My first visit was in January for a deep conditioning and trim. They did a great job, and the tranquil shampoo room was comparable to a high end spa/salon. 
For my 2nd visit this past Saturday, I went for the works: foil highlights, deep Awapuhi conditioning treatment, significant cut (new style) and blow out. Four hours later I left the salon looking, and feeling like $1m bucks and 10 years younger  :-)  

Chris was my student stylist this time. About 30 minutes into the service he confessed to me that I was his very first "live" client. I could see he was nervous when he first started to work on me, but he had great support form another more seasoned student, as well as the instructor who stopped by periodically to check on his work and offer suggestions. as we reached the blow out stage, his confidence increased, and by the end I could see his joy and pride in his finished product!
He really did a great job, and 2 days later, at work today, I am getting one compliment after another! 

Please don't expect a quick / fast appointment; they take their time and as I said, I was there for over four hours (I arrived for a 10am appt on a Saturday, and left shortly after 3pm).
It's worth your time though because the atmosphere is very nice and it's a great way to relax and enjoy the experience! And all for an unbelievably low price. My total for the "works" was only $64! (Compared to $300 or more at a salon)This is one of my new favorite drink spots. Great view and awesome martinis in a chic lounge.

This bar on the 23rd floor in the Mandarin Oriental in City Center is very small as far as bars go. There's a center bar and then groupings of booths, seats, and tables on either side.

When available, always opt for a seat by the floor to ceiling windows overlooking the Strip (duh!). And I have yet to go here when I have not be able to get such a seat. This little place never seems to be very crowded.

The decor and lighting lend itself to what you might expect from an upscale ultra-lounge. But it also has this laid-back, casual vibe thanks to the lack of crowd, low music, and friendly servers.

Don't let the cocktail menu send you into sticker-shock. The martinis are expensive (around $20). But it will be one of the best martinis you have ever had. The bartenders take their time making the drinks - no rushing and nothing pre-made. Everything is delicious and fresh - and so well-mixed. And in flavor combinations you've probably never dreamed of.

And there's free bar snacks too!Second visit to this wonderful spot!  I was worried that my husband would not be as impressed (especially with the high prices for drinks), but he even ordered a second round of drinks (so we could try different and fun cocktails)!   The cocktails, service, and views are amazing.  I really, really love this bar!  The drinks are unique and amazing.   This is a fabulous place to visit in Vegas!!!!!Amazing! Michael & Mariana took great care of our group. Great drinks, incredible food, stunning views & incredible service. Thank you!!!Great view, great drinks and a great place to spend a night with some friends or a date. Try the Lychee drink, it was awesome.this is a great service. They are prompt; the vans are clean and well kept. Their price will beat any other company. They know their way around traffic delays and drop you off at the terminal right where you need to be. The most they ever have is two stops per vehicle, so you aren't sitting in the van while other customers are dropped off or picked up. In the multiples times we have used them we have had the van to ourselves each time. And they don't charge extra for the jokes! I enjoy spending my money with this company.I am very sad that the Green Owl doesn't live here in Milwaukee.  It's fantabulous!  Great food, warm atmosphere, nice people, what's not to like??

We ordered the TNT (tempeh bacon, lett, tomato w/ avocado) and the curried chick'n sandwich.  Both were fantastic with flavor and the sides were tasty and original (crispy Kale chips?!).  The TNT sandwich was a little on the small side, I have to say, but the flavor made up for it.

Great local beer selection, nice staff (Heather was very accommodating and quick!), cute decor.  If I was a Madisonite, I would be at this place several times a week.One of my absolute favorite restaurants in WI... Heck, anywhere.  A vegan paradise!!!  Love the food, the atmosphere... we've met some friends here as well.  The TLT (Tempeh, lettuce, tomato) sandwich is amazing.  I have yet to try anything I didn't like a LOT, including coconut cream pie... mmm... pie :) - ONLY drawback for me is that the coffee comes in a french press...  I love coffee, hate french presses.  For vegetarian dining in WI this is as good as it gets! :)5 stars! Oh my if you're looking for great fresh and hot Down home SoulFood 
look no farther you have came to the right place. This past Sunday, Oct. 6 2013 my mother and I came in here from church I order the catfish dinner with my choice of three sides: rice with beef gravy, collard greens and yams. Everything was dellicous the only downside if you can even call it that is the small potion of cornbread.  Maybe their trying to help us save on calories? lol I  could tell by looking at it that it was going to be awesome which it was. Next time I'll  order more cornbread I was in a bit of a hurry due to having goceries in the car.Oink! completely redefines the quality standards that you should expect from a fast food restaurant. The hog rolls are absolutely delicious cooked with quality fresh ingredients that will leave you craving for more. Located just around the corner from the Grassmarket area it is a mandatory stop in Edinburgh. Because it delivers in style everything that it sets itself to, it gets 5 stars. Probably the best fast food I have ever tried.This is my favorite place. I go here every weekend. FRIDAY!!! The staff is amazingTotal Wine is one of the best beverage shops I've ever visited. The prices are reasonable; however, it is the staff that makes the difference. I'm come home with fantastic (and reasonably priced) Irish Whiskey, Potato Vodka's and Scotch as well as wine based solely on recommendations of the staff. They never try to up-sell, but spend the time listening to what you like before they make recommendations.I have a dark and shameful past...Yelp is probably that best place for me to let it all out and begin the healing:)

Before I became the humble software marketing genius that I am today, I was a suit...a corporate stooge...I wasn't workin' for the man...in most cases, I was the man:)

During that time of my life, I picked up some very unsavory habits...including one of the most unsavory habits ever visited on self-important executives...fountain pens:)

God help, me...I still love them so:)

I still have every one of them and I still use them with regularity (I know, I make my living with the keyboard...more or less...but when I write for pleasure, it's usually on a fine Rhodia #19 graph pad, with one of my 73 lovely "writing instruments":)

There is something both soothing and exciting about the flow of ink on fine paper...sometimes, it's the only way to get a really coherent sentence together:)

Some of my pens, I can refill from my inkwell, but many require cartridges...cartridges that they don't always sell at Staples or Office Depot...

That's when I set off for the far reaches of Old Town Scottsdale and swing by Scottsdale Pen Company...home of all things pen:)

It's like a head shop, but for a different kind of addiction:)

What a gorgeous and glorious selection of truly marvelous writing instruments, writing instrument related paraphernalia and objet d'art:-)

They have the cousins to my Mont Blanc's, the younger brothers and sisters of my beautiful Parkers and Waterman's and Sheaffer's...they even have the utilitarian antecedents of my everyday Lamy's and Rotring's:)

They have beautiful new Acme's, Pelikan's and Pilot's and mechanical pencils, like my Faber-Castell Fat Boy:)

Oh, and the paper...lovely leather bound journals and tablets, beautiful Rhodia tablets from France...I get goosebumps! :-)

Finally, they have ink...lots and lots of ink...in cartridges, in bottles...and I need ink!

They had cartridges for my Cross and my Rotring, when I thought I was going to have to go to Colorado Pen or something...so glad I didn't have to go that route:)

It was definite "win" for me...I get to support a wonderful local business...I got to "use" a bunch of new pens (try that at Pink's)... and I got a whole new place to hang out and indulge my pen fantasies...at least until they get the restraining order:-)My husband and I got married at the grove on 9/8/13. We had a large wedding ( 200 people) Our coordinator was Zina, and she was amazing!!! Amazing in every sense of the word. From the moment that we booked until we walked down the aisle, they answered every email very promptly, answered every question that I had no matter how miniscule.  My rehearsal and wedding day went off without a hitch. It was perfect. We got married in the almond orchard, the background music was perfect, it was all perfect perfect perfect. The price that we paid was ridiculously good. The food (I've heard :-)) was wonderful. Amy at Cake Couture did a great job and our cake was beautiful. We used our own florist, minister, photographer and videographer. But the DJ, the venue, the lighting... all of it was gorgeous. I recommend the Grove to anyone.Definitely the best cut downtown. I'm very picky with my haircuts, so much so that I've started cutting my own hair. However, I felt like trying them out.

I went at lunch on a Friday and only had to wait a few minutes before a barber finished up and got to work on me. He did exactly as I asked, great attention to detail. 

The shampoo left a bit to be desired. Still, its not a Salon so I guess I should have known. All in all I am very pleased with the cut and will be going back. Looking forward to trying a shine next time as well.Looking for hiking that's close to the city, but still makes you feel like you are in the middle of nowhere?  Try the McDowell Mountains!  Just 8(ish) miles past Fountain Hills, it only take about 25 minutes to drive there from the heart of Scottsdale, and you literally feel like you're out in the wilderness.  There are covered picnic areas and restrooms at the base of the trails, and the trails are excellently maintained.  Some paths are wide enough to accomodate horseback riding, if that's your thing.  It's pet friendly (just clean up after them!), and the trails go on for miles.  You can do a 3 mile trekk (to the top and back), or even go crazy and do the 20 mile loop!  It is rare to run into others on the mountain, which is a nice break from the chaos that is Squaw Peak or Camelback during peak hiking season. I can't remember the name of the trail I like to do, but it's about 3 miles long and takes you to the top of a small mountain that has a beautiful stone bench at the top where you can sit and enjoy a sunrise or sunset with 360 degree views.  It's remote, and absolutely stunning.  I took my boyfriend there for a romantic sunset picnic on his birthday, and we had an amazing time!  I definitely recommend this place for all nature lovers and hikers.The grinders are what I always go for, but nothing beats their pie after a long night of drinking and karaoke at Dino's next door! I have had the Philly, and it does not disappoint. Today I went for the eggplant parmesan, and it is amazing! The bread is fresh and delicious, the sauce is great, and it's buried in cheese. Perfection! Fiancee always gets the party melt and would probably eat one every day if allowed to.Hula's Modern Tiki is awesome! We went there for brunch on Sunday morning and we have zero complaints. Lets start with the all day happy hour on Saturday and Sunday.... who can be disappointed with $2.00 mimosas? They were in a small flute which went down quite quick and easy, then we went for the house made bloody mary - simply delicious!! The food was great... ahi eggs benedict & the hula hangover was what we finally decided on, but can't wait to go back to try the next thing on the menu! We were also excited to see it was on the metro-lightrail route. The architecture was cool and it was a beautiful day to sit out on the patio. We couldn't stop talking about it the rest of the day... it was yummy and a delightful experience! We highly recommend it :)The decor is awesome, I remember when it was just an ugly abandon building on central, now it is an ugly with great personality building with food. 
The civiche is TO DIE FOR. Almost for that reason alone I would give 5 stars. The pulled pork is another of my favorites. I had the basic burger once, and it was not so good.
The staff have always been helpful and friendly. With its easy access off of the light rail, and great service and food, I definitely recommend this place.Glazier's basically takes your traditional grocery store and makes everything better.  Instead of starbucks they use illy; the deli counter is enormous and stocked full of boar's head cold cuts; the meat and seafood departments offer great looking food.

Everyone in the store is helpful and friendly and the produce section along with the entire store seems so clean and neat.  As Misti stated in her review the store has several ready-to-eat counters and you can easily grab a quick meal to eat there or take with you on a quick work lunch.  Overall, I'm very impressed with Glazier's and plan on making it a place I visit frequently.Best grocery store in Vegas!  It is really far from my house so I'm lucky if I get here once every month or two.  The reason we went the first time was because we heard they carry Jay's potato chips from Chicago.  We went and they didn't have them in stock but we fell in love with the store.  They have a great deli.  I love that you can order from the kiosk and they will text you when your order is ready.  Their seafood and meat section is awesome.  They have 6 kinds of bacon!  We can make our own bacon flight!  They have everything for Chicago dogs from the poppy seed bun to the celery salt and everything in between.  If you are a homesick Chicagoan check them out.  They also carry Green River soda and a few different frozen deep dish pizzas, Uno's, Lou Malnatis, etc.  The frozen pizzas weren't great but I was happy they had them to try.  I love this grocery store.  I wish they would open one in Henderson.Great massage every time!  I'm a regular client at D-Stress Zone and have two regular therapists, Sari and Wendy. I also see Karen sometimes and have seen other therapists over the years when they weren't available. I've never received a less than excellent massage no matter who I've seen.  Check them out. You'll be glad you did.Mozell is the best hairstylist in AZ! I recently moved from Los Angeles to Phoenix and was seriously considering flying back to LA to get my hair done because it didn't seem like anyone knew how to do hair out here. But, I knew that would be doing too much, so I took my time to look for the best out here. I have been on a healthy hair journey to grow my hair waist length and needed to find someone who knew how to do an excellent press and curl while still keeping my hair healthy. I have natural hair and she treats my hair with so much care. She's extremely gentle, which I absolutely love and she's very affordable. Also, ladies out there who are a college student like me, you'll get 10% off every visit. I feel so blessed to have found her first and am sooooooooooo happy I didn't have one of these other "no good" hairstylist do my hair. If you care about your hair then go to Mozell!Best Pho ever! The broth is Pholicious! No need to go anywhere else.Sooooo good! The friendliest service and homemade and delicious food. The owner is always out and about visiting with the customers. You can't go without having the Mexican corn on the cob. I don't know how he does it, but any time of year, they serve the most tender white corn with all the delicious street-vendor white sauce and cheese. I sometimes order two of these and soup - they make delish albondigas soup. Great chips and salsa, free of course. Wonderful fajitas and sopapillas too!Feeling like GOOD Mexican food for dinner I had the idea of eating at Leticia's. We loved it so much the time we ate here before despite the ordeal we went through (see my previous review for details) that I knew it wouldn't be long before I had some of this yummy food in my tummy.

I was so pleased with the "Happy Hour Menu". It runs Mon-Fri from 3-6 pm. You can get margaritas 50% off! They have other food items starting at $2.50. We tried the "Cheese Quesadilla" and "Chorizo Taco". Both were well worth the regular menu price but getting them and just a great discount is just a bonus! They had other things like nachos, toastadas etc.

I tried the "Carnitas & Carne Asada Tacos" tonight and they were just so tasty. The rice that comes with it is good but the beans are the winner. The beans are thick and have great flavor.

The "Fried Ice Cream" is very yummy!

My experience as far as service and the food and restaurant are the same. Excellent.

I wanted to update my review to let others know about the happy hour menu and the quality and consistency of Leticia's.Great food and the owner very talented , she came and said hello to me and family at our table . Best Mexican food hands down...
Awsome food great place ....Some of the best Mexican food we've ever had! We love going here. Great atmosphere, wonderful service, & the food is delicious!
Everything we've tried is so good!So freaking delicious. Chips and salsas are to die for. Fried ice cream nom nom nom wish I lived in Vegas so I could come here more often. Homemade Mexican food. Had the carne asada and chili releno with beef. Chili releno was good probably get cheese next time and the carne was spicy and soo flavorful! Can't wait to come back!!Some friends and I had driven past this brewery several times, wondering when it would finally open. On a whim, last night we called and found out they had been open for just over a week so we decided to stop in. We stayed for about 2 hours and had such a great time talking to the owner and brewmaster, Rob.

Just to set it straight, this is a brewery first and foremost. There is ample seating throughout the open design, including some luxurious and not-yet-beer-stained couches and enough room for about a dozen beer lovers to belly-up. Since they have only been open for 10 days at this point, it was disappointingly not packed out at all. I realize that Four Peaks is just down the road, but that place is usually over crowded to the point one might think some patrons would wander this way to check out Sleepy Dog.

Each of us started off with a flight of their 5 currents beers. The samples were a nice size and it only cost $3 per flight. That's amazing to me! These were the beer types: Pilsner, Hefe, Pale, Irish Ale and a Scottish Ale. They were all very good for their respective beer types. As my buddies both agreed on the Hefe for their ensuing pints, I favored the Scottish Ale. While we sipped on our brews, the bartender, Jen, prepared our nachos and hotdogs and made sure we did not run out of our beverages. Rob, graciously unfolded the story behind the Sleepy Dog name (sorry, you'll have to go to find out for yourself) and how he started brewing in his home until he became serious about it and went to school, as well as travelled abroad and throughout the states, picking up experience and touring breweries.

From the bar, it is wide open into the brewery itself, so you can see where your beer came from. Rob mentioned that on Sundays they are giving tours of the facility, will have beer specials and throughout football season he will have many of the games on. He saved no expense on the flat screens...they're very nice. And because they are a microbrewery and not a brewpub, he encourages people to bring their own food if they like. Their short menu is just enough for someone who is really hungry or just wants nachos and/or a hotdog. Very soon we should also begin to see other brewerys' beers on tap as well as a cold box with bottles or cans of other varieties.

The beer was delicious-bottom line. I believe they're cooking up an IPA as well as another type, that should be ready in a couple weeks. Sleepy Dog Brewing provides their beer to many restaurants and other brewpubs around the Phoenix area. Although, it is not your typical growler, they do provide a unique receptacle for taking beer to go and they sell kegs, with a very modestly priced deposit.

I hope to see twice as many people in here next time I go, which will be soon. And I hope that people really get behind this local microbrewery. I know we are. Cheers.This place is awesome and I am so glad they are here!  Had the Scottish - malty, caramely, perfect carbonation.  The milk stout my husband had was pretty wicked - nice heaviness, hints of chocolate.  Got a taste of the barley wine, which was also pretty great and will be outstanding with aging.  Wish I wasn't so full from dinner and kind of a lightweight, but I look forward to trying the IPA and pumpkin hefe next time. 
Great atmosphere too - perfect for watching some futbol or the winter Olympics (showing their great sense of humor, they had Shaun of the Dead playing when I visited).  Like the dog theme.  Friendly bar, some nice couches, no loud music, wifi, perfect for hanging out.  Oh, and you can bring in your own food. And to top it all off Rob the owner, and his assistant Sue  Ellen were great company,  Enthusiastic about brewing and the city, and intelligent with other interests they were happy to chat about.  
I wish this place all the best, and I for sure will do my part to try and bring them success!My bf and I went there last night to celebrate my new job. Boy were we glad we did. 

We started off with drinks. I had a Retail Therapy and he had their Manhattan. Gotta say two of the best drinks we've ever had. Delish and dangerous. My bf called them panty droppers lol. 

We had oysters and they were awesome!! I had the 8oz Filet and bf had the 18oz Bone in Rib Eye. Both were cooked to perfection. We also had the roasted Brussel Sprouts with bacon, super yummy!!

Our server was Bradley, it was his 6th day but you'd never know it. Excellent server!!
Looked like a young Steve Buscemi seriously could play him in younger days!

We had a weird moment with diners sitting behind us as they proceeded to talk to us after they had quite a few cocktails but it didn't ruin the night just made for a funny story.All Hail the Dutchess of Total Wine, AMber W!

Total Wine is probably my favourite (For Nathan S.) place on the planet. For reals, yo.  You can waste a whole entire afternoon walking around looking at new wines, spirits, and beers. It never gets old!

They have such a huge variety, and in every price range... single beers, 6-12-24-30 packs... single serving bottles up to kegs... they even have multiple gluten free beers and ciders for me! 

Excellent customer service, great prices (generally $1-2 cheaper than walmart or the grocery store, on average), perfectly located next to Chipotle, and they always have the product I need readily available. 

I tried asking once if they would let me bring a cot and just move in, but I got denied. Perhaps one day my fantasy will come true!I am so excited this opened!

This is a little market that is focusing on local and sustainable items, so if you are in need of a box of frosted flakes this is not the place to go.

They have amazing produce and a great selection of vegan and vegetarian items.Hands down, I just ate the best bagel I've ever tasted. I enjoy lox so much that I buy the Philadelphia cream cheese with salmon in it because it's the closest substitute I can afford on a regular basis.
I've had good lox in New Orleans, but I really haven't been thrilled with the bagels I've had here. That changed, however, upon my first visit to NY Bagels and Deli.
There was a constant flow of patrons, and the wait was negligible. The place is clean and the tv (bonus pts for having ESPN on) was without volume, keeping the noise level appropriate. They had almost every kind of bagel in stock, including blueberry, jalapeno, spinach, and the standards like everything, sesame, salt, etc. I chose the Nova on an onion bagel, which is smoked salmon, cream cheese, capers, red onions and tomato. The salmon portion was very generous for a $7 breakfast. I don't mind paying that much for a sandwich that doesn't skimp on quality ingredients! As others stated, the bagel has a great crispy exterior and fabulous, fluffy interior. I highly recommend this place if you're on the north side of Phoenix.So I've been here 3 times now and I still love it as much as I did the first time. You have to try it, if only for the AMAZING shampoo where it is a spa like setting and you will feel totally relaxed with the scalp, neck, and shoulder massage. Christine does my hair, I feel like I've known her for years, she's very lovely. I just walk in and say do whatever and love it.Lacey is the best! 
Salon is amazing. Professional. Total spa experience. Best shampoo EVER. EV. ER. They send you in to a dark, silent room and massage the stress out of your head. Pure love. Was in and out within an hour, which makes me very happy! Everyone helps each other out, which I love. Total professional family environment. And LACEY is an amazing artist. Made my next appt already. YAYYYYYY
https://www.kellycardenassalon.com/las-vegas-salon/lacey-dapice/Excellent selection and the food court is fantastic.  You need to go to LA to find better.  Best in Vegas.The best samich I've ever had. I'm hooked on the turkey bacon ranch sub. I love going here, they are friendly and never get my order wrong. I definetely couldn't work here, I'd be fat as I don't know what.Love the seats and assigned seating. Very clean was surprised at how much it had changed since the last time I was there 16 years agoSUCH a beautiful park. The first time I walked around 1) the lake 2) hiking trails I couldn't stop smiling. Probably looked like a cougar ready to pounce on her prey haha 

Went close to sunset so the colors of the skyline were amazing over the water. LOVED the natural beauty of the hiking trail and the wildlife animals that adorned it. Definitely recommend this place to visitors and residents. 

Family friendly, pet friendly, exercise friendly, and all of the above!Great little frozen yogurt place! The place was super clean, and the staff very friendly.

I got the raspberry-pomegranate which I highly recommend if you don't like flavors that are overly sweet. There are tons of toppings that you can add, including tons of freshly cut fruits, and also the typical candy/nut topics.

The berries and kiwis go great with the raspberry-pomegranate!A great place to go for great food.  

Location- It's a small space in a strip mall but that's not the draw of this great restaurant.  

Food- Awesome, large burgers, Chicago style dogs (from an owner who is a Chicago native), Italian beef and a variety of sausages.  I had the double bacon burger tonight and it was a big portion of amazing, fresh veggies and good quality beef.  You know when you have a cheap burger where even the pickles are gross, well here the pickles are thick cut and great, the bacon is really tasty and everything else is perfect.  

Note on food- They also have a burger challenge where you have to eat a 9 patty burger in 10 minutes to get your picture on the wall and a t-shirt.  I haven't tried this yet but want to soon.

Owner- The owner was working when we were there and he takes real pride in his food and his product.  He talked about how he fresh makes all of his fries to order because he never wants people to have soggy fries. He also gave us a big basket of fresh fries for free because he didn't want to throw them away and would not serve them to a later customer. 

More reviews to come as I try more of their great food!Great burgers... Pretty good fries.  Nice Chicago style hamburger place.  Very comparable to what you would find in the Chicagoland area. Service was good as well.  Best burger I've had in a while!Haze good music hip hop top 40 and some edm the vip staff is always attentive and makes you feel royal the security at your VIP table is always there for you making sure your safe and not bothered by the ones that just can't hand there alcohol the venue floor plan is perfect and there light display is epic this is a must go too nightclub aria casino is amazing and the industry party Thursdays is where you want to be thursday nights at haze I'll see you there dance floor table.What can I say? Eating at Wendy's is like going home to a good home-cooked meal. My husband and I eat here OFTEN!! Everything here is delicious; the ingredients are fresh and there are so many healthy dishes to choose from!!! 
There is really no time of day when it's not good to eat here. My husband and I have eaten here when it opens at 11am - congee (typical Asian breakfast), lunch, ordering noodles or rice dishes and dinner, ordering any number of items on the regular or special menu. 
My husband loves the Fu Chow Fried Rice and Shanghai Dumplings - he literally orders it EVERY time we patron Wendy's. He also LOVES the hot french style coffee but recently his new love is the ice cappuccino drink specially made for him. 
I, on the other hand, would order anything from the menu - I've especially enjoyed: 

Beverage: HK Style lemon tea and Red Bean drink - both EXCELLENT 
Appetizers: Chicken Wings, pan fried rice cakes, Shanghai dumplings, and fish balls in curry sauce 
Main Course: Baked Seafood Spaghetti, Seafood & Meats with rice noodles in broth, HK Style Chow Mien, Duck (with rice, noodles or Peking style) and Chicken, salty fish with egg plant - ALL EXCELLENT 
Dessert: HK Style egg custard; fresh fruit Napoleon and the best is the Red Bean with shaved ice... DELICIOUS! 

I would recommend Wendy's Noodle Cafe to anyone. Food is excellent, service is outstanding, restaurant is clean & stylish, and dishes are very creative, it very much resembles authentic HK style cooking. Oh, and when you go in for dinner, remember to ask for the Chinese soup - it's different each time so you can't get a specific kind but all their Chinese soups are absolutely delicious!! 

Definitely 5 stars all around!!My husband and I have driven from SD to Phoenix twice to have work done by Mikey.  We love the quality, his traditional is fantastic, and it's always worth the extra effort to make it out there.When one thinks of the Wild West, the state of Arizona is usually close to the top of the list. Playing an important part in the development of the Southwest, Arizona has some wonderful places with historical significance for all you history buffs.

The Vulture Gold Mine is one of these places. Just outside the town of Wickenburg, the Vulture Gold Mine was discovered in 1863 by Henry Wickenburg. Although Henry sold the mine after a few years, the mine went on to become the most productive gold strike in the history of Arizona and sparked the development of Arizona and the city of Phoenix.

The fee to participate in the tour is $10, but it is a small price to pay for the sheer volume of information and artifacts that are on the property site. The tours are self paced and on-your-own. When you visit the tour center, you receive a comprehensive overview of the mine and it's history from the current caretaker, as well as a map that identifies the points of interest.

Most of the buildings, while in various states of disrepair, are still standing. Many contain original furnishings, machinery and reminders of everyday life such as cooking utensils, cans and bottles for coffee and such. One such building with a large variety of these items is the Assay Office, where the gold was stored prior to shipment. 

There are some areas of the mine that are not open to the public, but since my grandfather worked at the mine, the caretaker gave us full reign to wander all over the property. The schoolhouse where my Uncle John attended school is still standing and contains a piano that we are certain he played as a child. The swings, slide and teeter-totter are still there and my mom could recall memories about those days despite the fact that she was just a toddler when they lived at the mine.

If you ever have the opportunity to visit the Vulture Mine, take it. I am an Arizona native with family ties to the mine and I still learned a ton of information about what an important part the mine played in Arizona's history.

PS - While you are there, don't forget to scratch Olive the burro's ears!We were on our way to Las Vegas and read about the The Vulture Mine in Wickenburg, AZ.  We decided to stop by and take a tour of the town.  You better have your batteries charged and enough memory on your camera.  I literally took over 300+ pictures here!  Definately a ghost town with awesome photo ops- buildings, old cars, vintage furniture, etc.  The pricing is very cheap and well worth the visit!Love this place. Great food, cute bartenders, and a decent beer selection.If you're particular about freshness of flavor you MUST do yourself a favor &  go. The sugarcane chicken is always a must start not only fresh the yummy chicken on sugar cane you grill at the table but the plated loaded with fresh mint, cilantro, lettuce & other goodies that comes accompanies it. For less adventurous eaters their basis Pad Thai is as equally fresh but I stress to try something you never have. You will not be disappointed.
My dad is not an Asian eater but his Salmon in Basil Ginger sauce was sublime & now he'll go at the drop of a hat.
Another fabulous fact...amazing cocktails & happy hour price of $5.00 for a normally $9.00 drink ...wonderful!!!!!Burrito Drive, I've been there once and loved it.  Its just off of Willy Street on Brearly, not the best location in the world and I fear it will get overlooked for that reason.  Regardless they're food is great.  Its not authentic Mexican, but it doesn't pretend to be - this is new Mexican food in all its glorious well combined tastiness.  I had a sweet potato burrito that was phenomenal.  They serve beer as well and have a nice little dining room.  You gotta check out Burrito Drive when you get a chance, maybe next time you're doing laundry since the laundromat is right next door.This place is a hidden little jewel that apparently only locals know about. Since I am now a "local" I know too. Amazing is the only word I can think of. All fresh ingredient and made with love. I had the house made Margarita with no refined sugar at all. Just Tequila and fresh citrus. That's it! Then leeks with fresh mozzarella, bread crumbs and egg on top. Also rock shrimp, razor clams and cheese plate. Wow!  So European and yummy.This is my new favorite restaurant in the Phoenix area.  The carefully chosen and fresh ingredients are the star of the show here.  However, they are really accentuated by the balanced and sometimes unusual combinations and preparation.  The staff is extremely friendly and attentive but not stuffy and without the slightest whiff of pretense.   The prices are high but, I think, very reasonable for this kind of restaurant.  My wife and I had one appetizer and two entrees and we brought our own 
bottle of AZ wine which came to $70 not including the tip.Delicious!!  Polenta is great.Loved the food, loved the atmosphere, loved the service!!! It is the best Mexican eatery I have been at since moving to Madison.I love this place! This was my second visit, and although I want to try other things, I can't help but order the meatball sliders!! Deeee-lish!! The place is clean and the young people that work here are super friendly. I just moved around the corner, and this is one of my new favorites!! Gotta love the Meatballz!!Great food! Great service. We say in the back area, super cute!! Loved it! I will definitely be back.Happy hour or not, I love 5th and Wine. They have a great selection of wine ($5 on HH,) the service is always great and the food is tasty. There are few better ways to spend a Friday afternoon than sipping on a glass of red and nibbling on apple/fig bruschetta. Delish. Did I mention $5 glasses of wine?! They have a nice patio and it's a great way to enjoy Old Town Scottsdale. 5th and Wine, you hold my heart and taste buds in the palm of your hand.Great staff, great service, very knowledgeable and considerate. My three cats and I go here as they were highly recommended by one of my co-workers. The staff is super friendly and always willing to listen to my questions and concerns. They also have a specific room just for cats, which is really helpful, and they are always great at making them (and their human!) comfortable. I also love that they take the time to explain everything to you and they are not pushy in the least - they outline services that are available and that they recommend, and they give you a choice. I also love that the staff is knowledgeable about species appropriate pet foods (read: carnivores need meat!), which is a rarity for vets. My cats and I are so happy to have found a vet we can trust and I for one am glad to know they will always be in good hands.I have had a tooth ache on and off for almost 6 months.  My doctor had me on antibiotics to fight it, at the same time I am fighting with terminal cancer.  The other day the pain got so bad that I couldn't sleep, eat or think of anything else but that throbbing in my mouth.  My sister called her dentist and he took me in right away.  He decided to do a root canal and am I ever grateful.  It was painless!  He was so patient and was sensitive to my issues.  I would highly recommend Dr. Michael Grode.  Wonderful, friendly staff too!Where do we start! We LOVE this place! An Australian wine bar that recently relocated from Chandler Fashion Square Mall to the new Lakes area at McQueen and Warner. Its hard to believe they've created such a wonderful atmosphere in an old Baja Fresh Location! Amazing! Phil, Rodger, Josh and staff have worked very hard transforming this new location and it has kept it's quaint, casual and comfortable atmosphere. Wine selection is reasonable priced, compared to Pesto's in Chandler. New steak on menu is FANTASTIC, try with blue cheese crumbles! Yet another place that carries my favorite local beer from SanTan Brewery! If you love wine and enjoy exotic foods this is a place to try!My parents go to Vegas all the time and have been raving about Julian Serrano for months. If I trust anyone's opinion about good food, it's my theirs, so I decided to give it a try. 

Oh. My. Gosh. This place is amazing.

We arrived for our reservation at 9 and were promptly greeted and seated in the beautiful dining room. The lighting was perfect, and it felt open and airy yet cozy and comfortable. And the chairs were so comfortable - I could have stayed there all night.

Anyway. Onto the food. I'm a huge fan of tapas in general. I think it's so nice to be able to order several small plates and have a taste of them all. It feels relaxed and comfortable to share food with friends and family and get to ooh and ahh over the same stuff. Plus, there's no awkward lingering jealousy when someone gets a perfectly cooked steak and you just ordered overcooked chicken. Not that anything was overcooked at Julian Serrano. Quite the contrary. Everything was cooked to perfection.

Here's what we had - complete with letter grades:

Seared Scallops and Romesco Sauce: A+
The scallops were to die for. Melted in my mouth. They were naturally sweet and paired brilliantly with the romesco sauce. Probably the best scallops I've had - and I eat a lot of scallops. I can never turn down scallops.

Pork Belly, Petit Pois Puree and Molecular Mozzarella: A
Perfectly cooked, perfectly seasoned. The cold pea soup offered nice contrast. (I hate saying things like that.)

Duck Leg, Orange Sauce and Fresh Orange: A
I sound like a broken record, but perfectly cooked and seasoned. Delicious.

Wild Mushroom Risotto, Manchego Cheese and Natural Jus A-
Creamy and flavorful. I scraped the plate shamelessly.

Mini Spanish Pork Chorizos, Garlic Mashed Potatoes and Garlic Sauce: B+
These were great and had they not been served on the same table as the pork, duck and scallops I'd probably remember them more clearly. 

I think we also had black rice, but I didn't care for it too much (FYI - it was my dad's favorite, so don't not order it on my account!)

I also had the sangria - they add brandy to theirs so it has a great depth to it. I'm no sangria expert, but I'd order theirs anytime.I really like this place alot. their pizza's are really different but really good! I wish i could say i had a favorite but ive liked every pizza ive gotten except the portabello mushrooms cause i dont like mushrooms but other than that they have an amazing beer selection! Major thumbs up!!This place easily has some of the best pizza crust and a good selection of unique pizza types. Every time I eat here I try something different. Service was good and reasonably fast. I also like the drink and beer options as they differ from most restaurants.FINALLY! Found some tacos worthy of my time. They offer regular size as well as the mini "street tacos" size. Prices are really cheap and everyone loved what they got. This has become my destination for tacos.Awesomely relaxing ambience, good music, and amazing food. The wait staff is attentive without being invasive, the food is excellent while affordable, and the decor is Thai yet modern feeling. One of the best Thai restaurants I've been to.I love this place. Nick name for this place for me and my g/f is, "our spot".

The food is amazing. Reminds me of being back in San Fran. Definitely a great Thai restaurant in the Valley. The prices are reasonable and the atmosphere is very chill.

For me and my g/f, definitely our #1 place for Thai.Beautiful outdoor shopping experience!Wow, were us mid-westerners excited to see Jimmy John's here in Tempe!  It's a staple in Michigan, and for a reason.  They do it right!

I love the "Slim" options, which are plain subs without the meat ("Slim 6") or veggies for us picky ones.  I'm not sure what everyone else ordered because I was scarfing down mine...but all were happy!  

Service was fast and friendly too.  Now, if only we get get some of the people chowing on burgers and fries next door at 5 Guys to come over and order a healthy sub instead!Wonderful Decor, wonderful drink menu , wonderful service , amazing filet , amazing Brussels sprouts , delicious truffle Mac and cheese... Shall I go on? Ok go here it's amazing . Hipsters everywhere unite!Coffee is boss. Go there when you want damn good coffee and food.Everything in this shop is delicious!This place is a gem. It has a very friendly atmosphere -- the owner will even remember you by name if you're a regular. The amazing Illy coffee -- consistent, flavorful, and smooth -- is the best I've had in Vegas. They even have organic milk, soymilk, and half-half available -- and you bet these high quality extras make a huge difference in the taste of your drink. Their food is delicious: quiche, omelets, salads, paninis, among other things. The only downside is that it's closed on weekends, but hopefully they'll fix that soon since they are getting more and more popular.After 17 check in's, it somehow has slipped my mind that I have never reviewed this place.  Go figure!  

Olivier is a doll.  I initially came back to this place on my way home from the doctor's office and hadn't been back in 2 weeks.  Immediately, he says, "Hello, Kimberly."  (I had paid with a card the previous time.)  I was floored.  This place can get packed.  There are tons of regulars, and he remembered my name after I ordered a cup of coffee and a bottle of ginger ale one time to go?  My order changed from iced tea to go to a salad and iced tea for dining in.  I figured I could read through some things there.  He sees my laptop and asked if I needed wifi (free and secure).  It sounded good to me, and the password is just so upbeat and positive like the vibe you get in the shop.

As for the food, everything I have had there is DE-LISH!  I've eaten my way through the salads.  My favorite is the one with the jimica.  The soups change daily, so be sure to ask if the listed soups are for today.  All of the sandwiches and pastries are amazing.  Everything is always fresh and organic.  If you're there and the quiche isn't sold out try it!  Also, I've heard the chocolate twist are a must try.  (I don't like chocolate.  I know, I know.  Something is wrong with me.)

Lastly, the drinks...  The ginger ale that they carry is a favorite.  It's not homemade, but it has real ginger in it.  If you are a ginger lover, check it out.  The espresso and brewed coffee are both Illy.  I am not sure of the brand of iced tea, but it is fantastic and never over steeped.  I've also seen families come in on a three day weekend and order hot chocolate and swear that it's one of the best in the city.  I wouldn't know but wouldn't doubt it either.Well this is almost iconic in nature. The Welcome to Las Vegas Sign is a must for everyone's picture groupings. You will find a variety of possibilities here, with things varying from day to day and season to season. Stop by, take your pics and put them in you slide show, video or Facebook presentation. The sign is just a requirement of the trip! Check!I came here with a group of my friends and it was one of the best clubs I have ever been to. We were able to get in the VIP list and so both guys and girls were able to get in for free and also girls were able to get unlimited free champagne and rum for the first hour, which was awesome. The music was a lot of the top 40 with a good beat. The dance floors were very big and unlike other clubs I've been too it wasn't too crowded to dance. Definitely worth it to go if you're looking for a fun night out with friends.I love popcorn girl !!!! she always has everything i need for my events !!! not to mention she has great popcorn in every flavor under the moon lolololA popcorn fan. Enjoy the savory popcorn flavors. The staff is friendly and helpful . Have special ordered for work functions and was a hit. I have been back and will continue to do so. Remember popcorn makes up 2 of the 3 food groups depending on the flavors you choose.This is THE BEST popcorn ever! They have tons of different flavors. They will also let you sample the flavors before you purchase them. All the employees are friendly as well. The location is a little out of the way but well worth it!!I think that this is the retail arm of the wholesale business already on Yelp. Since I am a retail customer I have added this business info.

I have got to say that is shop is soooo good. The staff really know their stuff and are great at making suggestions based on your likes and your needs. I must say that this is a very strong rival to Mellis - perhaps because it has a real family feel to it as opposed to the slightly more "chain" feel that Mellis has these days. I love that they also sell other high quality produce you may want along with your cheese - crackers, chutneys, quince, olives, bread, anchovies etc. I have not tried their pastries, but their croissants look HUGE!! 

This is a great shop for gift buying, and the family Christmas cheeseboad is always stocked from here! A true gem in Bruntsfield.The Patrick Sieben duo was awesome. Two man band playing lively modern hits. If you haven't been here or it's been a while, it's time to try again. Good timesBought a groupon- they washed my car. My car is clean and I am a happy camper. Friendly and fast for a great job. People just like to complain on yelp! This is a good car wash and great deal with grouponOMG. OMG. OMG.

You like crappy cigars, bad service, and not having wifi? Then stay away from this place. 

Charlie is great and the high ceilings mean there's not a lot of lingering smoke. It feels upscale, but the prices are mid-level. Every time I go back to Henderson, I'm making a special stop here. Plus, they have cool bricks to light matches from. If my four chest hairs didn't make me feel like a man, lighting those matches sure did.Husband and I went here for horseback riding. They pair you with a horse according to your experience level. I was a beginner and got paired with Barkley. Barkley was extremely sweet. He pretty much knew exactly where to go, what to do, and made me feel at ease since it was my first time.  I was a little bit freaked out at first. (What if he just takes off?!?) My husband and I liked the trail, especially going through the Verde River. We didn't think they would take us through the river, but we did and loved it! It was around 75 degrees, the sun was hitting us, but the river made it much more cooling. Good for horses to take a little water break, too. We would definitely visit again! Oh and a little tip, to prevent extreme soreness, try doing lower body workout a couple weeks before horseback riding. I did not feel any soreness on my legs afterwards besides the seat part not being cushioned and being bounced around. We plan on wearing biker's bottoms next time.Just got back from having 2 front tires mounted & balenced. C & R is a new installer for Tirerack.com, which I ordered my tires from. Prices were exactly what was listed on TireRack. Scott was great to deal with, and as it turns out I will bypass Tirerack when I get my other pair of tire's as C & R can beat the price ! I had an issue from a couple of years ago, just as he had started managing the store, that I expained to him and he actually listened and assured me that many changes have been made. I have played with cars for 40+ yrs and had my own shop for a couple years, so I can pick out BS pretty fast. I have been outright lied to at one time or another from 3 different places over the past few years in the Valley..from now on I will be going to C&R for any work I can't/don't want to do on my own from now on.I loved, loved, loved it here! We stumbled upon this place on our way over to the mall from the W hotel. One look at the menu and I was super excited to try it. Everything looked so good, I was already making plans to come back before we even ate there so I could try everything. 

We got the chips and onion dip to start. It was SOO good. We pretty much devoured it on the spot. (we were hungry). I got the smoked chicken salad (minus the Gorgonzola) and my husband got the turkey pastrami sandwich. I was excited he ordered it because it was my second choice. Both the salad and the sandwich were awesome. Usually when I ask for no cheese, somehow there is always cheese. We could see when our order was up and saw a server thoroughly inspect my salad for cheese. I was convinced they made a mistake but when the salad was brought over, behold, no cheese! In fact, the server was inspecting it to make sure there was nothing in there! 

We were too full to get dessert and never made it back there during the trip, but next time we are in town...I know where we are going!Love the atmosphere and personalized attention from staff. Great food and upbeat clubby back ground music. Great stop.There is nothing not to like here.  Must try the fondue pretzels.   Sit at the bar if you can for good interaction and people watching.Best NY style Chinese this town has. They have Chicken Chow Mein; not Lo Mein as others have.We came here for a date night dinner a while back and it didn't disappoint at all. The food was amazing, the steak was delicious and however they season the potatoes is to die for. It was a little on the expensive side but the food, service and atmosphere were great. We have been and will continue to go back!Wow! this place is scrumptilicious!!!

Food: Just amazing. I had the Cau Cau and my sister had the Lomo Saltado. Mine was delicious, but the Lomo was incredible. I kept eating the Peruvian peanuts they bring out as snacks. 

Scene: We went around 3 so the lunch rush was over, so there weren't that many people. It's a cozy spacious place, large enough for a big party for sure. They had two football/soccer games going on.

Peeps: The waiter was super nice and definitely welcoming. 

I have to go back and eat some more. nom nom nom.I've eat here a couple times and it was fantastic. The menu is nice and short, but you can't go wrong with the selections. Save your decision make for what to drink. 

Location: Great view of the Capitol right in the square. The restaurant itself is small but cozy. You be sharing stories with your neighbors. 

Food: I've only had lunch but the Poutine was yummy. I can't believe we didn't invent that before the neighbors to the North. Turkey sandwich Is fantastic and nothing beats homemade chips. 

Drinks: if you can't find something you like then there us something wrong with you. 28 beers on tap with over a hindered in the bottle. 40 different wines if that is your poison. I had the Hennipen from Coopers Town delicious.My cat, mz pickles, looked absolutely great!  I'm so glad to have found these groomers.  DalePita Jungle is the bomb!! The Cilantro Jalepeno Hummus is awesome. It has great flavor and not to much heat.WUV WUV WUV.

I always hit up ABC stores for some hard liqs/bubbly for my Vegas nights! The bottles are not extremely overpriced and the selection cannot be beat. They also have a good variety of snacks; some that you cannot even find in NYC (Hot Funyuns baby!)

Also, if you are a broke phi broke college student like I was my first time in Vegas, they also sell some decent prepackaged sandwiches for something redonks like $4. Not a bad option if you are trying to save some moolah :)

Choice of free Las Vegas tote or mug if you spend $100+!

I also bought this ridiculously adorable Hello Kitty in a flapper costume in front of a slot machine key chain from here. Amazing.An ABC store in Vegas? I thought they were only in Hawaii!

That's the first thought that came to my mind when I saw the ABC store in Vegas. It still has the Hawaiien feel with the Hawaiien flowered shirts uniforms and other Hawaiien stuff throughout the store with and the occasional Vegas souvenirs with the skyline on shirts and other merchandise. I mostly come here for the cheapwater and beer, it's also fun to browse around and see what other crap they have. Shopping here will save you so much money compared to the hotel lobby stores. They also have a hard liquor section located behind the cashier with excellent pricing and a great wine selection.So far, best donuts I have ever had in Vegas!  Fresh, light crisp, tasty and  a total melt in your mouth experience.  They're open early, so I buy some for my group every once in awhile as a great morning treat.  They just love them!  I have had a few co workers ask me where I buy the donuts from because they are so good.  I especially love their old fashion chocolate donuts, chocolate donuts, and the glazed.  When you come in the morning, make sure you come early as the server is a bit slow because he packs the donuts in the box literally one by one.  But he gives you some donut holes for free, but not all the time so it is not consistent.

But try this place if you are looking for quality donuts.  Yum!  I am craving one just thinking about i!This place has to get all five stars. Ok, the area is a little suspect I will admit; that can be countered with the excellent food and excellent prices. This is the kind of food that goes for $12 - $15/plate if it were located in an upscale area.  They have done a great job with the interior and the food is really wonderful.

5 Top reasons I love La Condesa:
 ~ Beautiful food. Unique flavors. 
 ~ Great salsa bar: aver a dozen lovely hand made salsas; I liked them all
 ~ Price: you can spend under $7 and have a really good meal
 ~ Convelient: It is only a 2 minute drive from 24th & Camelback.
 ~ Atmosphere: the interior and the service create a great place to dine.

***We eat out several times a week, and this place is now at the top of the list for my wife and I both.***I can't be sure how "authentic" this food is compared with others in the valley.  All I know is there's nothing unsatisfactory on the menu and it's truly a "family" establishment and that love is part of the food.  It's simply addictive and causes severe cravings requiring repeat trips.  I fell in love with the food in high school and remain a loyal customer because the food is consistently delicious.  The only bad thing is, I still have not tried everything they offer, as it's very easy to develop favorites early on!  Go there and enjoy!!Highly recommended! This was my first time at Hash House. Went for brunch and thoroughly enjoyed my visit.

There were many folks waiting out front and we were told to wait 45 min, but we were called within 10 min. Go fig.

They would not seat us until our entire party was there. The hostesses were very lovely and helpful. Our server was very polite and quick to provide service.
The menu was very diverse. I decided upon the sweetened mango iced tea and the chicken and waffles, yum. The iced tea was not OVER THE TOP sweet as other places tend to make it. It was just right.

The chicken's fry batter had rosemary and other delicious seasonings, not common among fried chicken. It was good. The chicken pieces themselves were two large plump thighs, perfectly cooked and juicy. These two thighs were served upon four bacon waffles. It looked like they slipped several slices of bacon in the waffle iron while the batter was being poured, mmm. Finally, a large steak knife and and a large sprig of rosemary were stabbed down into the two thighs and layer of waffles to hold the tasty tower in place. The entire dish was drizzled with flash fried green onions (yum!), small diced veggies, and a ginger Teriyaki sauce. Weird call on the Teriyaki sauce, but it was good to dip the chicken in every now and then.

The best part of the meal was the price. About $35 for 3 people and HUGE portions. Definitely worth the price and worth another visit.Huge portions, delicious meals, best breakfast 24/7!  Tried it 3 times in one week! First had the "basic" for $8.95, 2 eggs any style, mash/hash potatoes and I had my eggs over easy. They were perfectly done, all fresh and great service. Second time, had the mushroom and Swiss burger- photo added. It was delicious but giant! Nearly ate it all, but just couldn't ;) strongly recommended!!!Five stars for awesome food. Huge portions it's ridiculous how much is on one plate. You can seriously share with three people. Anyways I went here last year during the summer time with my cousins around the time of my 20th birthday. Yes 20 years in Vegas (nothing to do) lol when we ate here our waiter dropped my sisters food near her and ended up in her hair I remember her hair smelled like syrup lol But it wasn't a big deal. He made my sister a new chicken and waffles plate (huge portion and so delish). Over all good service , great tasting plates and good restaurant vibe. I recommend this place to anyone who go to Vegas.Great authentic food!This place has awesome food and drinks.  They have different options for salsa and they are very accommodating with options to eat.  They have a friendly staff and is great with kids.  

I would recommend this place to all!Fast, friendly and frank.

I work in the same area, walking distant, and I visit at least once or twice a week. Kinda $$ for the size, but still good. I am starting at #1 and going down the list....skipping the 14 because..its all veggie and a complete waste of money for the price it is at. I'll update once I am done. I am in no rush so it will be a while. So far I am at 4 and i cant say I would buy any of those again.

R\_ 

NOte: Lunch is busy with a line of 8 or 10. So be ready for that.I am not a big sub sandwich eater.  I've tried many of them - Subway, Quizno's, Jason's Deli, Eegee's......etc.   Besides Eegee's (which is really good), I just thought they were all decent sandwiches - some better than others.  But I have had Jersey Mike's a handful of times now, and their sandwiches are much better than the others.  Just get it "Mike's Way" and enjoy the tasty food you receive.

But just as importantly, the customer service I have received at this store has been impeccable.  The people are always very friendly and patient and that makes a huge difference to me.  

I must say that their sandwiches are a little pricier than others.  I get their "Giant" size (ok - so I'm a big eater....) at it runs about 12 bucks...yikes!   But as delicious as it is, it's worth it.

Try it - you won't be sorry...Excellent service, knowledge, and a genuinely helpful staff!This is the best place to go out for a date! The food is just amazing!! We got the all you can eat and it was just terrific! And of course we finished with desert. The banana foster is the bestI just experienced a wonderful meal at this establishment. I would say there was a mid-century modern flair to the establishment, with an extremely classy twist. Our server was a gentleman by the name of Eric Baily, and I use the term gentleman loosely...kidding of course, as this man had a great sense of humor, and would truly appreciate a joke as such. He was amazingly attentive.  Our table was also assisted by many other staff members throughout the meal, who were also very helpful and attentive. Everyone was definitely friendly, and seemed excited about the restaurant and what they had to offer. We also spoke with a bar manager for a bit, Luciana, I may have spelt that wrong :(. She had a radiant personality.  They offer a great cocktail and wine list. We tried a key lime martini...yum, and they had Duckhorn Decoy by the glass, for a respectable price...so I had to try it. The bar is beautiful, several stories in height, layered with a beautiful collage of bottles. There was a great open air feel to the restaurant, yet it still maintained a  wonderful level of intimacy. 

Then of course comes the food, solid, simple, and of high quality. Judging from my one experience...that seems to be what they are going for. We had a chilled lobster cocktail and oysters on the half shell for starters. Seriously...amazing oysters...I am in the middle of the desert....eating amazing oysters. The lobster was also great. For our mains we had a steak that came out on a 400 degree plate, hot as can be....I know because I touched it, even after I was warned not to ;P Perfect med rare...perfect med rare for sure. My lady had a crab cake dish... a little ballsy to order such a thing coming from living outside of Maryland for some time. Yet...it was much success...top notch fresh crab meat. I guess you gotta thank modern times and next day air, cause everything we tried was super fresh and very tasty. Again, dishes were very simplistic...but with fresh flavors such as that, you'd only be doing an injustice by masking it with complex levels of flavors.Excellent 

Came here with a party of 30 so I got to sample everything. We reserved their private dining room and it was fantastic. Service was great, the room was perfect because we could be as loud as we wanted, and the food stole the show. 

Must have....... would be their seafood platter. It's a 3 tier platter that comes with dry ice giving that smoky, cloudy look. It came with oysters, shrimp, king crab legs, and lobster over a bed of shaved ice. 

The bone in rib eye, bone in Kansas city, and bone in fillet were all perfectly cooked and seasoned. Do not get the fish here. The sea bass was a little overcooked and dry. Then again, why the hell would you order fish at a steakhouse? 

Lobster mashed potatoes was great but not when this cost more than the entrees. I was told that this dish was featured in Entourage and a few other magazines. 

We celebrated 8 birthdays so the staff gave us 8 individual desserts which was very nice of them. Their butter cake was to die for. My God that was good. Their bread pudding and apple crisp were also very delicious.Hands down one of the best steaks I've ever had.  I was thoroughly impressed with the quality of the food and how good the waitstaff was.  They even comped us some deserts and a portion of our meal due to a couple of the guys being former military.  If you're looking for a good steak, this place is for you.I have four gorgeous mutts---all shapes and sizes!  Michelle absolutely captured each of them invidually, as well as all of us together!  I had been wanting to have pics with my girls taken for years and finally did it!!!  
Michelle came to the house and did an amazing job!  We actually took a picture in the bathtub and she made it look like we were all in a sleigh!  EVERYONE I have showed them to absolutely adore them!  I plan to use Cow Dreamz in the future --not sure where or when, but I will!  These pictures made many people happy! (not to mention...ME!!)  Thanks Michelle for a great experience - - for my furry babies and their Mommy too!I have always had a great lunch experience with Tiffany, Keri, and Tina. The staff is friendly, the service is great,  and the food is always outstanding.  We are always in and out and back to work on time.On our way to Flagstaff, we stopped by the area for gas and a late lunch on a Saturday....
Luckily, this place was still open... What made us try it??

Cop Cars: If 3 cop cars were here eating food...then it must be filling and good. The place was almost empty so we got seated right away. The ambiance had a definite shabby chic/ country feel to it....

True enough...we got our money's worth for our orders. Nothing beats eating breakfast on a non-breakfast hour....

Cory got the Lumberjack and the serving was enough for his appetite. and trust me. It's hard to fill his growling athlete's stomach. He savored every bit of it....And i too got a taste of it. It was good, packed with meat...and the eggs' texture was great and the flavor was amazing. 

I, being the more traditional one, got my most favorite breakfast (you can even include lunch and dinner to that)...Bacon and Eggs with Toast. It came with potatoes which I was too full to even touch. I liked how it came with 5 long strips of bacon that were perfectly fried and not too salty. The eggs i ordered came out just the way i wanted. Over-Medium. 

If eggs were a topic. This diner makes the best out of their eggs.

Service was excellent and the food held our hunger for the rest of our trip to Flagstaff...with a stopover at Sedona.If you would like to buy a car from Chapman BMW, Ciaran, a sales associate specializing in internet sales is your guy! 

This was my first time buying from a BMW dealership, and Ciaran went out of his way to make the sales experience a positive experience. I was interested in a very specific vehicle, and he put together a good deal and even offered to go above and beyond--even to deliver the car to my home. He and the finance officer even found a pretty bow to put on top to take home and surprise my wife with a new car. 

Overall, kudos to Ciaran and Chapman BMW for the nice sales experience.I needed a haircut and a shave. It is 5:50 on a Wed. Those lame chain barber wannabe's won't do it right. I found Buzz Boyz on google and made the drive. First thing I see is that this place is serious about what they do. Old School barber chairs, Wood all around, and TV's everywhere I look. Jonathan the Owner and Barber offers you a cold drink when you walk in (Amazing). The service is top notch. I got a hair cut.. a hot lather shave.. and walked out with my wallet not feeling like it was drained. This is my new barber.So sorry that there are bad reviews on Ocotillo animal clinic. This is a top notch vet office with the most friendly staff you will ever meet.  I have taken all my animals here for eight years.  I have always been made to feel like my pet is their most important client. They even came to my house to put my dog to sleep.  And the care and concern was above and beyond.  I can not say enough good things about this vet office.  I would never go anywhere else.This place is great I don't care what any of these other reviews say! 

I bring my bosses van here every two weeks. The people are very nice and friendly  everyone here knows me I come so often, and the prices are very good for the quality of work they do.

There are always package deals and coupons on their web site as well; today I got an upgraded car wash for the same price as the basic because of a coupon on the web site. I also use their punch card and after so many washes I get a free wash which I use on my own car. You can also use the free wash as a coupon and pay the difference to upgrade to a better wash which I do often! 

If your not happy with something and just point it out or ask nicely they will fix it no questions asked and they will do it right away! 

One time I came with my car and I had a Chapstick that melted in my middle counsel and some papers and change was all stuck in it. I pulled up and asked what it would cost me to get it cleaned out that I didn't care what it was that I just didn't want to do it myself. The sales guy was super nice and was like don't worry about it we will take care of it. Didn't charge me to do it and I promise it was nasty!!! I gave a nice tip for sure that day. 

They have a little shop and I always find unique cards for my family for birthdays and holidays and such. Also the kids zone is great I bring my bosses kids with me and they color and play with the blocks and the Xbox kinect here! There's also free popcorn and coffee every day! 

I am a customer for life and I always tell my friends this is the place to go!Took my 6 year old son here for his first eye exam. Dr. Carlsson was amazing. He was patient, funny and did a very thorough exam. My son felt very comfortable and is excited to wear his new glasses. I like how they go over the cost before hand and give you different options to fit your budget. The office itself is organized, very clean and comfortable.I love this store. Even during the busiest time of the year, everyone is still smiling and making you feel comfortable. I usually come in to send fax. You wouldn't believe how unpleasant experience that can be, especially when store is busy. I've never experienced any sort of discomfort, wait, or anything negative in this store. Definitely recommended.Absolutely loved this place.  I experienced the best service I've ever had at a doctor's office.  Phone and office staff were all super friendly and got me in to see the doctor right away.  Office was clean, but didn't feel cold like most offices.  It was nice, open and everyone there genuinely seemed genuinely helpful and friendly.  I had a great experience with my PA-C and I feel like she really listened to me.  Easiest doctor's appointment I've ever had.  I would recommend this place to everyone.This place is amazing. its cheap and fast and they do an amazing job. At some high end spa waxing places that i have been to they still leave hair and just send you on your way. At this place they actually take the time to get all of the hair out! I had a brazilian and my eyebrows done. Very sterile and clean. The prices are the best that i've seen in AZ or CA. If your a first time client you can get a free wax - eyebrow, lip, or underarm i beilive. I am now a huge fan of the hard wax that they use it barely hurts at all! i couldnt believe that it actually got the hair out without the pain of hotwax! Great place and I think that everyone should give it a try. it would be a great place for first time brazilian waxers!! SO gentleThank you ladies who helped me in the pharmacy tonight. I'm glad you're open late at the same time I'm sorry you have to work late  Everyone is always so nice here when I've come in. I didn't catch both the ladies names in the pharmacy but Katie was on my receipt. Thank you again!!! Very nice and friendly.I use to do those internet orders for V-DAY for flowers. However those roses always blew. That and the fact that she's going to school out in Phoenix and I'm in SD made it a little more difficult.

No problem, the good folks here took my phone order and my request, and delivered on time. The fact that they were definitely "gorgeous" according to the recipient was plus.I had John out to my house for an air conditioning servince. He arrived on time, his truck was in good condition and clean, and he was dressed nicely as well. He was able to make sure the A/C worked well all summer long. I felt he was very trustworthy and honest and will be using them in the future.SInce my last review I have been back to this shop with my new car and my husbands car. Again, we have received the most excellent customer service and maintenance on our cars. I know going here as a female that I will not be over sold or ripped off. That makes me feel so much better!They actually gave me 2 options, a cheap one to get by and no time waiting, or the other, where I fix the problem for good, but they did explain everything and I made my decision. I feel good doing business with them because at other places they just try to take advantage of the situation and try to get as much as they can from clients. Plus the service was great!This is the most authentic Thai you'll find in Arizona! Simple, powerful flavors and genuine service. I love it here. It's the closest thing to going to Thailand. Recommended to me by a friend from Chiangmai, I take all my friends who would appreciate good Thai food here.  and you have to have a coconut sticky rice dessert .. whether its with custard or mango, its so so so good.
dont tell any one else to come to this little secret place though.I love this place! 

Their Pad Thai, coconut soup, and pineapple fried rice, are my absolute favorites. Food portions are huge, perfect for sharing.  I frequented this place at least once a week when I lived in the are (7 years), and every time I'm in town visiting family this place is a must. I honestly have nothing but good things to say about this place. I've never been disappointed by the food quality or the service. 

This is one of those "hole in the wall" places you do not want to pass on.

 ¡Buen provecho!I'm so surprised to see the negative remarks with this branch located off carefree highway. I am a business owner and have all my operational accounts through Wells Fargo. My five children all have their teen checking and savings here as well. Without a hitch I highly recommend this branch!  All the tellers know my business, know my children and my wife all by name. I'm very pleased with how Ira handles my accounts and has opened ALL my business accounts. When I call with a question he quickly answers it. If he is not available he returns my calls promptly. The branch manager is kind to my children as he had a hand in opening their accounts. Drive through tellers are quick, swift and very professional!  Again I'm very surprised by the negative remarks with MY branch. I can't speak for everyone BUT I can speak on behalf of 18 business and personal accounts that are within my home and business. 

Thank you carefree highway!  All of you rock!! Keep up the great work and see you all during bankers hours lol lol lol - April (Moms on the go)This is THE best Starbucks. The service is always fast whether you go through the drive thru or walk up to the window. I go a few times a week and they always remember me and joke around with me as if we've known each other forever. The coffee is always good (I'm from Seattle, I know good coffee..), the food is typical Starbucks food (sandwiches, bagels, sugary treats!) and the staff is really just amazing. They never mess up my drink, unlike the Starbucks down the road, which is why I'll drive the extra couple minutes just to come here! 
This location is mainly a drive thru location. You can walk up to the window, but you can't go inside. Convenient if you're driving through town and need a quick pick me up. OR...if you just want someone to smile at you. ;)I love this place! Compares to Barros but better and cheaper! Me, my hubby, and our kids all love the pizza and wings here. The wings are meaty and definitely better than Buffalo Wild Wings. To feed a family of 4 when 3 out of 4 are men/ boys you can't beat it! Screw the pizza huts and papa johns chain pizza joints and check this place out. Delivery is fast and they are always nice. Our delivery place since we first tried it and from now on.This Goodwill is much better than many I've been to, in fact it may be my favorite one, and I really know my way around the Valley's second hand stores...  The store is clean and bright, the employees are very friendly, the aisles are organized and it doesn't smell like grandma's underwear drawer.  

A big bonus for me is their $1 Thursdays: Everything with that day's colored tag is $1.  You can find some AWESOME stuff for just a buck.  SCORE!This is a Goodwill store that I will go to more than once. It is clean and well organized for sure. I was looking for some wires to hook up one of those wonderful Electronic devices.
I had gone around to serveral Goodwills in the Valley. I could not find one anywhere. I even went to Big Lots, No Luck!

So I finally came to this location. It is clean ,which is  a great thing.
Everything is in order.Plus, guess what !  I found the wires and hook up bits that I needed. Plus there is just so much to look at all the way around.
Great place, great deals. Lots of parking in the lot. 
Employees are great People and very helpful!Had my first appointment today.  Best dental experience ever!!  Everyone was friendly and professional.  They mailed me the required paperwork which saved time when arriving.  I was in the chair 5 minutes before my actual appointment time.  I highly recommend.WOW!  What a great little sandwich shop!  Tried for days to get my wife there for lunch. Finally she consented. Well, she wasn't disappointed.  We usually split a sandwich, which was plenty for each, plus a side of quite good pasta salad. You get a side with your sandwich, so the cost was quite reasonable for 2. We saw Apple Crisp in the pastry cabinet, so split one of those as well.
Bread was fresh, oversize slices. Wonderful 'house spread' on the sandwich (delicious, the wife says) lettuce, tomato, red onion, pickle on the side. Really good.  Sorry we didn't try it sooner, will make a point of going back before we leave town for the next winter destination.Highly recommend!!! A locally owned and operated coffee shop that can use your support. Come for the fresh coffee, delicious sandwiches and fish tacos stay for the great personable friendly service.This Kohl's is a hidden little gem :)
It's a bit out of the way, there's nothing really around there yet, except for a Chase bank & a Wendy's.... so basically everything you need when you go shopping, lol!
This location is always very clean, well stocked & there's hardly ever any lines!
All of these things make it my favorite Kohl's location :DGreat service, excellent hair dresser! Highly recommended! The price is affordable and you got superb result. I love to go here Everytime and this is my fav salon! Hair cutting, coloring, they keep track of your records and know how you want it to be done! Love love love this place!!!Kathy is extremely friendly a good at what she does.

I had her alter my daughter's prom dress. Everything went smoothly--Kathy was well aware of the timelines involved in the various area proms and made sure everything happened in a timely manner. She was very nice to me and my daughter, and made sure to explain appropriate things to each of us.

Make sure you call ahead if you decide to use her services! I think she works by fitting appointment only, and only on certain days of the week.This review is exclusively for Adam S., pharmacist. I think the "S." stands for Sweet-as-Pie, as he is MAYBE the nicest human with whom I have ever interacted.

I've been going to this Walgreens for about a year now, and I see him almost every time I stop in (monthly). Adam has always been super nice and helpful, but this time he thanked ME for being "pleasant". WHAT! amazing. I'm sorry for yell(p)ing.. but I dont think I've received a compliment on my manners since I was 6 years old, and it was the sweetest thing! I'd really just like to say, Thank YOU, Adam S. I may be "pleasant", but, it takes one to know one.I stop here frequently on the way down to the 'Rents house. What else can you say about a bank? It serves my needs.My husband and I went a week ago to the day. My husband needed a new (used) car, and saw a Nissan Juke listed in the used car section. We had not intended to buy from here as an Avondale dealership was actually the first choice based on mileage and cost but it had sold. Luck and fate would have it we went to Airpark Dodge Chrysler Jeep and had the best car buying experience ever! We got taken care of by Jordan Bailey - very sweet, kind and easy going gentleman. We ended up talking about dogs and rescue (which is what I am in) and we all hit it off very well. He was still training but we felt very comfortable with him. Even with the other guys working there we felt very confident we were not getting scammed. This was not only the quickest car buying experience but overall the best! My husband and I highly recommend it here!Amazing food! Best Mexican food I have ever had. Only down side is they aren't open for dinner. If they were I'd probably be here 5 times a week!I'm not a huge fan of hookah but my brother is, so last time he was visiting we stumbled onto this place. 

The location was small and comfortable. The owner of the shop checked on us constantly and gave great recommendations. 

The music was amazing. The owner explained all the different musical themed nights and I fell in love. It's a lovely place to relax and read and smoke. 

Also, the bubbles are so fun! What a fantastic idea! 

Sadly I dinged a whole star for lack of drinks. I think a soda fountain would be a fantastic investment. The cans of soda were expensive and I think I might have stayed longer and replenished my hookah a few more times had I not been so thirsty and not willing to pay another few bucks for a can of soda.

UPDATE: The fact that the owner of this hookah bar reached out to me, to explain to me WHY he doesn't serve fountain sodas completly earns the 5th star. But for someone who is a big drinker of liquids, I'd love buy 4 get the 5th free or something. 

Does anyone know? Are outside food and drinks allowed?I went to Arizona Language Center to brush up on my Spanish skills before i moved to live in Mexico for work. I had taken some classes in high school, but needed to be able to live independently. Their staff was very helpful finding me the right class. I started by taking an assessment test to determine which class would best suit my language level. Once i started classes, my instructor was great. He took his time to make sure we understood the lesson before we moved forward. The small class sizes were also very nice. It was just what i needed to make the transition to a new language. Because of my experience, i referred my good friend, who was looking to teach abroad to their TEFL certification program. She was also very pleased and is now teaching overseas. I would recommend Arizona Language Center to anybody looking for a great experience with great teachers.Amazing customer service. The guys were super friendly. I was super stressed moving and they helped me check in and out lightning fast. I would highly recommend them and will definitely be going back if I ever need to move again.  :)Very nice lingerie store. I love their Red Cherry faux lashes. They last forever and are made of real hair. They have a wide variety of sexy outfits to choose from for whatever your style tastes may be. The ladies who work here are very sweet, helpful, and always make me feel at ease. They have a great selection of thongs in a variety of colors and styles. *Note: Mention you are a dancer and receive a 15% discount.Good solid NY style pizza.  Ordered over the phone for pickup, basic large cheese. Arrived 25 mins later, was greeted at the door and checked out immediately $15 and some change, pizza was ready and piping hot.  Pizza tasted very good, authentic to NY taste, awesome NY crust, stretchy gooey yummy cheese, no complaints everyone loved it.Love this Kohls---Love the employees!!!!!As far as fast food goes it doesn't get much better than this store. Service is great, food is always fresh and hot!  Dining area and restrooms are always clean. Drive thru is 24hrs, so at two or three in the morning after having a few, there are always plenty of  hot and fresh tacos and chicken sandwiches to be had.Got the 20oz "Dirt Clod" - a hot white mocha with a chunk of dark chocolate thrown in. The coffee was delicious! Not too bitter or over roasted. The chocolate didn't really mix in so I got a nice chocolate sludge when I finished the coffee, which I enjoyed. Overall, pretty decent. 
The inside really appealed to me - a great space to study or just hang out and read. Tons of cushioned seating, art, and just generally aesthetically pleasing. It felt homey which is always a bonus for a place that you'd want to stay for longer than it takes to get a coffee to go.
I'd go here again if it weren't so far away (right across the street from PVCC).Dr. Falcon is the best! This was my second visit to her in the past 2 years and I will keep going back to her. Not only is she extremely knowledgeable and professional, she is extremely friendly as well. I have never had a doctor give me the one-on-one attention Dr. Falcon gives me. It's truly amazing. 

Her office staff is awesome as well. I got fitted for contact lenses today and the woman assisting me was extremely patient and extremely helpful. Last time she also helped me pick out glasses and gave me her honest opinion as far as what looked good and what didn't look good. She also knows the various insurance plans very well! 

As far as their frames, they have many designer frames to choose from, which are all up to speed with today's styles. 

If you're looking for a new eye doctor, look no further! Dr. Falcon is simply the best!From reading some of the other reviews reflexology is somewhat different that a regular message.You do not get undressed down to your underwear.  You should wear comfortable loose clothes. You sit in a chair that is a combination  reclining lounger, with an opening for your head like a message table.
My wife and I have gone to several reflexology places and this is by far the best one we have been to. 
If your not into a very firm massage you must speak up. Most places have there own style. Pampered Foot hits all the necessary spots that have tight  mussels in your feet and in your shoulders. 
There are several times the masseuse leaves the room to empty the water your feet  soak in and they also get a hot towel to wipe down your feet and legs.
It maybe misleading that it is a 60 min. message for $30 but in my opinion even if the session is between 45-50 min. It is still worth go to Pampered Foot Reflexology .
We have gone here for several years and we will go again when we visit the Metro area next year.Used the for a new years eve open house and my guests loved the food..I had orange chicken, mushroom chicken and walnut shrimp and chow mien noodles..excellent choice for a buffet.Russ and Marcus are top notch.  They have helped me several times with my caliber srt4.  They are very knowledgeable and really know how to please the customer.  I will refer them to all my friends and continue using them!  Thanks guys!This store is 100% AMAZING. It is clean, neatly laid out, lots of friendly birds and the owner and his staff are absolutely wonderful!

I have a bit of a story on how I came to this place.

For Christmas my son decided he wanted a bird. A cockatiel to be exact. I went to another store in the valley. Nice people but it didn't specialize in birds. This was my first mistake.
We picked out his bird the day after Christmas and he brought him home. It was not hand trained. This was my second mistake.

My son worked every single day with his bird. Reading to it, playing his clarinet to it etc, he was meticulous about the birds food/water/cage etc. After a month (so just recently) the bird would get on his hand and eat out of it. He was SO proud.

We found his bird dead in the cage Wednesday night (this bird I was told was less than 6 months old).

Needless to say he was pretty heart broken.

I called Birdz and Beyond. We had a long discussion about what happened, the environment the bird came from, and the bird was in at and how he was being cared for. Some times things happen and sadly there was not much we could have done to save our little friend.

My son decided he wanted to try again, and Birdz and Beyond just happened to have 8 week old hand trained cockatiels in stock, so off we went.

The owner was amazing, he took all the time in the world helping my son pick his new friend, explaining care, and picking out all of the new equipment we would need. (Didn't want to take chances with the old cage etc). He was able to tell him the birds birthday as well which is important to my son.

They decorated his new cage together, and my son was so excited to bring his new friend home.

I will go back here for supplies, grooming of the bird and they also do boarding if you need to be away from your friend.

He spent most of the evening last night cuddling with his little friend and making sure he was all tucked in and ready for bed. 

I am going to be a regular at this place with absolutely no doubt, I may even buy a bird for myself.

If you have any bird needs, or you are looking to get a new little friend go here, I cannot rave enough!Tony and his team did a great job!  

I was a first time customer, and asked for an oil change.  Not only did he change the oil and check all fluids, he also checked my A/C, found out it needed a pound of freon and added it, checked my brakes and informed me I had about 10k more miles before they needed replaced, and doubled checked my tail lights to confirm all was in good order.  Final price?  only the cost of the Oil Change.  The rest was complimentary!

The world needs more people like Tony Stewart and his team.  Honest and Trustworthy.  Thanks Tony!Hand down - the best place to buy pool cues (and other supplies) in the Phoenix area. Excellent service. Great selection. All price ranges. The owner is well informed and has a great amount of pride in his business. Don't waste your time looking elsewhere.Great location, employees have always been super helpful and friendly, my pizza is always cooked perfectly, and delivery is always really fast!It doesn't get any better than Bloom. What wonderful treats--superb selection, wholesome ingredients, and reasonable prices for the provided quality and delight. :)Wow, this place has amazing food!  It is so refreshing to see vegetarian food with variety, flavor and creativity.   I wanted to eat every single thing on the menu, and so did my friend.  We decided to start off with the hummus of the day (Butternut squash), and split two meals, the vegan tacos and the burger of the day (Sweet potato and Mill).  The tacos were filled with a spiced walnut "meat" vegan nacho cheese and sour cream and served in red cabbage cups.  They were soooo good, I would have never thought to use walnuts as meat substitute, brilliant! The burger was another big winner! It had a jalapeño curry sauce that was so flavorful, and it paired nicely with the sweet potato and avocado. On the side were yummy baked fries with homemade barbeque sauce... still licking my lips!  I'll definitely be back, again, and again, and AGAIN!Wow, the food was really really good.  I ordered the brunch special: breakfast quesadilla with tofu chorizo and pumpkin latte.  The food was seasoned so well.  Everyone in my group enjoyed their food.  Busy busy place, but worth the wait.  I will definitely be back!I went there to get a manicure and a change of polish on my toes. The manicurist called Nancy did a fantastic job. She took her time with me. The place is clean and smells good (even though one of the manicurists was doing gel nails). Right before I left, Nancy gave me her card and a warm goodbye. I will definitely be back!Loved it here!

My best-friend and I stayed in the Wrap-around suite 2 months back and i have to say, it was amazing!
Beautiful decor!  Very modern!  
Total sex hotel!  From the master bedroom, there are NO doors to the bathroom and who ever is showering, they are in plain view of anyone in the room.  
I took a bubble bath my last day, and it was great.  So relaxing!
There is a full kitchen that had not only a sink, but a freakin' oven and stove! I mean, I don't know who comes to vegas to cook, but damn was that impressive.  
They even had a washer and dryer...crazy.
My absolute favorite part was the BALCONY! Our view was spectacular!  I had a view of the entire strip.  On the living room side, was the City Center/Aria then on the other side Planet Hollywood was right in front of us and so was the rest of the strip.  Best view of my life!
They also provided us with a turn-down service.  Legit.

The casino is very fancy but gets very busy since its such a new hotel. 

We didn't go clubbing but I heard that people who stay at the Cosmo get in free to Marque.  I'll be back in a couple weeks to see how that goes. =)

I did think it is actually quite small for a hotel, but if you stay in their wrap-around, you'll never want to leave your room. =)John MacFarlane from concierge was extremely helpful, if you need anything ask for him! I needed a giftcard for my stepmom out in las Vegas,and even though I'm here in Chicago he helped me through all of it! What a great guy! Plus they have an amazing cosmopolitan!Stayed in a lanai suite and it was perfect! The rooms are very well decorated and have a very masculine feel with leather strap decorations and bold manly colors. This is the first time that I've stayed at the Cosmo and let me tell you that they do everything in they're power to make you feel fantastic! Gorgeous rooms and the casino, well that is a whole different story. It is elegant, sexy and luxurious! This is my new Vegas property from here on out!I LOVE this Salon. It is clean, relaxing and even better, ecofriendly. The other day my boyfriend asked me why I was looking so forward to my hair appointment and I told him it was because having my hair done was like going to the spa. Brittany is one of the most positive people I have met and actually took the time to listen to my desires and then created everything I was asking for. She does amazing, natural looking highlights. I've had repeat pedicures that are great too. I highly recommend Creative Salon and Spa!Expert Tailor is the best!  I bought my wedding dress in LA, but when it arrived, the dress was incredibly short.  I didn't have time to get a new dress and so when I came to Ella I needed help fast.  She brainstormed some ideas and finally landed on trying to find the exact lace from my dress to sew as an extension.  She actually found a perfect match!!  She texted me updates as she went and the dress turned out amazing, no one had any idea that the dress had been so short.  The work was beautiful and service fantastic.  Highly recommend.Was trying to find a good place to get my Golden cut.  Took him here and was very satisfied with the way he was groomed.  They matched what we had asked for down to the last detail.  This will be my dogs groomers for a good long while.First and foremost. I was there when the person who gave them 1 star and complained about the door hitting them and what not. That didn't happen. Also, that review was left by an employee of the business next door to them, not a customer. I don't know what there beef is, but it's still a bogus review. 

There are many groomers in Las Vegas. Most I'm guessing deserve a 4 star rating. The reason we continue to return here is simple. 

When you walk into Bev, it's obvious they are a small operation.  That being said, they don't pack their kennels full of pets awaiting pick up or grooming. All dogs are treated separately with equally high attention. This is due to their ability to keep the scheduling tight yet not overloaded. Quality not quantity like other corporate groomers. 

We watch our dogs behavior closely. Never have we had the feeling they were treated poorly in any way through the process. It's never easy to leave you're little heart warmers behind for even the 4 hours it takes to be groomed. I should mention it's 4 hours for us as we have 3 and our smallest is under 5 lbs. Her name is Samba and she's just 2 years old now. My wife and I have difficulty even lifting her lips to inspect her teeth on occasion. Yet the kind folks at Bev are able to shave her chin very short with no trauma. How do I know this? Because when we pick them up all three dogs seem proud to show off their new look and fresh smell. Complete with bows and or scarfs if you like. All 3 cost 100$. We always tip. 
If you don't believe me, feel free to walk into the reception area and watch them work for a bit. 

Customer service - A+

As long as we live in Vegas... 
Our dogs go to Bev.Per my previous reviews of Sew Little Time anyone can tell I am a fan. This time I asked Amelia & David (owners) to professionally embroider my grandson's initials on a stiff/thick nylon duffle bag. I asked that the font and thread color match what was already on the bag -- it is perfect! And it was done lickity-split in time for mailing for Christmas. I have a home-style embroidery machine and was afraid my machine and I just weren't experienced for the nylon fabric. I am very glad I asked them to do it, and I will be back for professional embroidery -- and all the other goodies offered at their store.I took my car here on 1-5-11 to get the windows tinted.

A friend of mine recommended this place to me since he got his tint and alarm installed here. They also install audio systems as well, and they sell HID headlights, license plate frames, and other accessories. Pricing for the tint was really cheap, $99 for a 3 year warranty and $139 for a lifetime warranty. Prices will be more if you have a larger car or truck. This place offers 35%, 20%, 15%, and 5%. I got the 35% in front and 15% in the back windows, and they also threw in a free 15% glare strip for the windshield, which was a $50 value. The install took about two hours, in at 3:30 and out between 5:30-6. I was able to watch my car while they were installing the tint, and there was WiFi available as well. While my car was in, they updated me on what was going on and what they were doing with it. 

I got my car back, and I was impressed by how well they did the tint. It looked perfect and at a very good price. 5 years from now, if the tint starts to bubble, I can take it in again and they will fix it for free. I will be getting my alarm installed here in the near future.One of my all time favorite Mexican restaurants and all time favorite owners. The food is fresh. Everything tastes like its made from scratch. And its consistently good.
If you must have a burger try the Phd. Its awesome . Its worth the drive.
Cheers to good food and good friends.This is seriously the best pizza I've ever had and I've tried a lot of pizza! I love that they have so much variety and the pizzas are a great size. The Caesar salad is really good too.  The romaine is fresh and it doesn't get soggy like some. Every time I've gone in we've been seated within 5 minutes and we've always received great service. Only downside is the parking lot is always packed and you have to drive around for awhile to get a spot.Every summer as a child I would vacation on the sandy shores of Ocean City, MD with my family.  We'd eat tons of crab, soak in the sun, and at night hit the Boardwalk for amusements and snacks.  Without fail on our first night we'd stop at Fisher's Popcorn for a tub of their sweet & buttery, hot & fresh caramel corn.  Our initial purchase usually carried us through the week, and before we left we'd get a refill (at a discount by returning with our tub,) so we could savor the flavor on the car ride home.  But this review isn't about Fisher's, it's about Dyer's in Las Vegas.  But how?!

My parents continue to vacation in Ocean City, and every summer they ship me a tub of Fisher's.  But this summer will be different, as I plan on turning down their generous annual gift and instead send them a bucket of Las Vegas' own - by way of Chicago - caramel corn from Dyer's Gourmet Popcorn.  Finally, a year-round fix dessert fix in the desert that captures all the popcorn goodness I fell in love with as a kid.

An unassuming strip mall storefront along West Flamingo, you can almost see co-owner Carlton's friendly, helpful, beaming smile from just driving by.  The inside is small and clean, with the the top-sellers on full display - Caramel Pecan Delight, Cheddar Cheese, and the "don't knock it 'til you try it" Cheddar/Caramel mix that first captivated the owners back in Chicago the way Fisher's wowed me.  Add in their selection of more exotic flavors - like Cinnamon and White Chocolate - and there's surely something for everyone on the menu.  Proudly, Carlton will tell you, "our popcorn is real popcorn, our caramel is real caramel, our cheese is real cheese;" no artificial mumbo-jumbo in sight, just the good stuff.

A few tips... they close at sunset on Friday's and re-open at sunset on Saturdays (for religious observance,) and are closed on Mondays.  Buy a refillable bucket for $3 and get over a gallon of popcorn at the reduced large price whenever you want, and trust me, you'll want it often.  It's definitely cheaper than a trip to Ocean City, MD!Thank you to whom ever put this location here. We have had car trouble for the last five days or so. Good ol Ford Mustang, once my baby hit 100,000 miles it was just falling apart. 
We had to call and order a part it was there on time. The staff was very helpful everyday making sure we had the proper parts and helping us figure out what was wrong with the car even though it wasn't there in front of them. At the end of everything they knew who we were and were happy to help.My whole family probably get their hair cut here. Wendy is the person you need to look for. Any hair style, combover, punky, spikey, long hair, whatsoever. She does all of them. She's been my hair dresser for the past 7 years till now. Never let anyone touch my hair. Guaranteed trusted and will recommend to everyone!!! Bring a picture too and she can do it. Done it to my son and now he has combovers lol really chill place and friendly atmosphere. Walk-in is welcome too. A+!!!Rapid Rehab is a great facility for PT.  They have exercise equipment to get you warm, pilates reformers, and experienced, innovative staff.  There is also a pilates studio where PT patients can get a discount after their PT is done.  They will work with you even if you they aren't a provider for your insurance so call them to see if you can work something out.  Appointment scheduling is flexible and the the facility is clean at all times.I'm back at figaros come see me and I'll take care of you like I always have same days and hours hope to see you soon thank you.IMO this is the best chinese that I am use to. Love their lunch specials. I work down the road and for lunch at $5.25 you get a soup, crab rangoon, entree, and rice the portions are big so I usually have left over for the next day.Took two of my dogs here.  Both bichon mix and was really happy with Anthony's job.  Funny bit: my mom was complimenting one of my doggies as she was being brought out, completely unaware that it was actually our Roxy, even saying she'd wish our doggy looked like her... it wasn't until she was told it was our doggy that she took in the great job Anthony did.  Thank you bunches.Dr. Lemone is great. His office is hard to find- so what the heck, but once you get there, you will be very happy. One of my young sons went there with tooth pain and well, he's my boy, but he's a bit of a cryer. My wife took him in last week and next thing I know he had a baby root canal and didn't complain. I asked him about it and he was all stoked about his fake temporary tooth (Good job doc selling it to him to not be worried about it!) and my boy told me all about the procedure- and this from a kid who used to hide in the closet worried about doctors. Dr. Lemone- you have my vote. Great vibe at your place, thanks! I wanna tell everyone about how you do it!I"m a big fan of any thrift of discount store. This one is one of my higher ranking stores. Usually a quality selection of items at great prices. Especially in comparison to a store like Savers who's prices tend to be a bit higher for a thrift shop. 

I love the huge room at the back of the store, there's a ton of random items back there for the finding! They usually have a good holiday selection for decor and more. 

The staff here is nice, the store is neat and orderly and the bathrooms are clean. Great place to find that awesome bargain! will shop here again!!!Yum!  Best doughnuts I have had in Vegas.  Make sure you get them early when they are fresh and not the last of the pickings as they are super busy through the day.  Great family spot too!Awesome place ! I moved here about 2 months ago and the staff is friendly and helpful !Amy is the bomb!!! So knows her stuff,so very knowledgable. Always has the answers to all my questions. Lia is awesome! Always there to assist me.
Overall it is a great place to get my supplements.First, sign up for Gold Club.

I used Hertz at McCarran airport in Las Vegas and it was, from start to finish, a pleasant, efficient and wonderful experience. I'll use Hertz again.

I will, however, endeavor to avoid getting a Dodge Avenger as it is a real, fuel guzzling, piece of junk. Not Hertz's fault but nonetheless, part of the experience.

Cheers to Hertz for a great rental system.BEST SANDWICH IN VEGAS!!!! This is hands down the best sandwich shop in vegas ive been vegas for about 4 years and have been searching for a place like this real hard roll real deli meats and cheese and homemade salads im from the SF bay area and i have worked in various Delis for over 7 years there  so im kinda of a sandwich snob lol anyways its nice to see a family owned shop i recommend the Pauly walnuts 
(all the sandwiches are named after soprano characters but they dont have the SILVIO lol maybe i can help with that)
definitely give this place a try 
ive been there 4 times in one weekI get a mani/pedi at this salon every 2 weeks. I typically can call and make an appointment that very same day. A variety of nail technicians have done my nails here and they all do an amazing job. They have a large selection of gel colors to choose from. I get compliments on the sparkly colors on my toes all the time. And the pedicure lasts longer than 2 weeks. Very satisfied every time I walk out of the salon !I recently had virus problems on 2 laptops that happened on a Sat. afternoon. Joe took care of right away, called  me on Sun. with the problems and the cures. Both computers were ready on Mon afternoon.
I was originally going to Geek Squad @ Bestbuy . They take way too long and also send your computer out for repairs.
This was my first time using Simple and they are near were I live.I found this studio through Groupon. I recently moved from Los Angeles and I had only practiced Bikram once. After reading some of the reviews I became scared and begrudgingly went to my first class. This changed my life! 

Belonging to this studio has enhanced my Vinyasa practice and my life in general! I feel taller, happier and focused! I'm able to be in present. For someone with ADD this is quite difficult.  

Although Bikram carries a variety of mental and physical benefits this studio is specifically special. The instructors are understanding and supportive. They encourage pushing the limits. We do come here to change, right? 

I have found a yoga home in this studio. Namaste.We love this swim school!  All the instructors are exceptional!  They are all so patient and are great about getting on the kid's level to explain what needs to be done.  I love that they focus on the fundamentals of swimming and teach proper technique.  They teach water safety and pool rules.  My 2 and 3 year old love the water now and are becoming great little swimmers!  We have taken the Express Swimming program, baby swim, group lessons, private lessons, and even used the Parent's Night Out.  I would recommend any of the programs.  We love them all!We decided to "live on the edge" and try this place even though the reviews weren't that great. I called and they were very accommodating over the phone. Had an appt for the next day! (Three other places were only free in another week!) when we got there, the lady at the front was super sweet! Got all of my information and even took extra time to ask about medical concerns and odd behaviors they would need to know about. After that, the groomer came out to meet me, talked to our dog and then asked how I liked her cut. When I picked her up, our dog was VERY happy and the cut is perfect!!! All in all-I say- the complaints on yelp are bogus! This place is great!This is a place I heard about from many locals and I finally got a chance to check out one. I'm not really a fan of Mexican food, but their chicken taco was something else! I wish there were Roberto's in Seattle...but then it would probably taste like Taco Bell. In any case, the next time I'm in Vegas I'll be eating here more often.

Service was polite and quick, bathrooms were clean. It's all I ask.There are several reasons why I love getting in shape at Gilles studio. The first is that the studio is not too large or intimidating. In the words of Goldilocks "It's Just Right". The second is that Gilles is extremely knowledgable and quite efficient at assessing your individual needs. You got it. He writes your plan just for you. The class may have four other people in it with you but you are working on your on plan at your own pace. No getting lost in the crowd here. The third reason I love Gilles so much is because he cares about his students and that they are getting results. He doesn't take " I can't for an answer" but shows you that you can. The biggest reason I love Gilles and working out with him is the results I see and the results I feel. My husband loves the results he sees as well. Thanks Gilles!!!I originally went because they had a 3-1 oil change on groupon, but I noticed every time I went the customer service was extraordinary. I then started going for other services and they've never disappointed. I brought in a vehicle to replace an oil pan over the weekend and the service was not quite done on time, so they fixed an A/C issue I mentioned for free. Always remembered who I was and everything about my vehicle. Good, honest mechanics at a great price. Don't know what else you'd look for!I have to give this place a five considering I spend more time here then at school or studying etc. So far this place has been great I'm 20 years old and love this place cuhz I can come at 12am and be here alone some people may say it's an old folks gym due to size period bt I just think those people are looking for excuses anyways I think if you have the  determination and time you will be fine anywhere this gym is just a great gym for me cuhz I like to lose myself and be alone so if you think this might be the place for you go on down check it out for yourself meet the staff there all pretty cool people and will work out a plan for you. Just do it!I had a similar thought as to one of the posters about not trying this place for a long time.  Having lived in Centennial Hills for three years, we always get their menu that have coupons.  

We ordered Mu Shu chicken, chicken chow mein, butterfly shrimp, vegetable egg rolls, fried rice, fried won tons and a teriyaki bowl.  All of this only came to $40 and we had a coupon for a free order or orange chicken on top of that. 

The portions are so huge that we'll be able to eat this for the next several days.  It's nice to find a neighborhood place that is different than pizzas and subs.  We can easily get the bill down to well under $30 next time since we won't have as many people at dinner and still have lots of leftovers for lunches and dinners.

Excuse me while I go take a nap now!After losing my insurance most pharmacies could care less about me and my discount cards. Your Pharmacist Matt not only showed me that there still is customer service out here but that your store does still care about the person. Kudos for having staff of that caliberI've gone to this location 4 times now. I  am a new tanner and have literally no experience or knowledge about tanning beds. Girls are always really sweet and helpful. Shayyane is the one who signed me up and has been helping me to know how long to tan in the bed. She is very knowledgeable and has been extremely helpful in explaining how the beds work and the different lotions. Ac is always on so it's nice and cool. I do believe they work on commission so they are a little pushy about trying to sell you the lotions. But no way I'm gonna buy a 90$ tanning lotion. I've bought them on amazon for a quarter of the price and they work just fine.I had my hair and makeup done by Tanya and Courtney for my wedding. They were on time both days (trial and wedding), did an amazing job, and were so much fun! I have vitiligo and have some spots on my face with less pigment - after Tanya finished you couldn't even see the spots! Amazing. I felt so beautiful. I showed pictures to both ladies of what I had in mind and they were able to do exactly what I wanted. It was a great experience all around!I love my dad, but he has never been the best with financial stuff and he's always had the uncanny ability to put his head in the sand, ostrich-style when it comes time to deal with this stuff.  When I found out that he was in trouble with the IRS, I knew that was no joke-- they threatened to take his paycheck, clean out his bank account, and seize his house (which is the only actual thing he has!).  I called Tax Crisis and Dana was great.  He got us in right away (I insisted on coming so I knew my dad would resolve it).  We met with Angelique and she was incredibly honest, straight forward, and didn't sugar coat the situation.  We knew this wasn't a small hole dad dug himself into, so it was nice to hear a professional give it to us straight, particularly after some of the other places we called promised us the moon.  Tax Crisis sorted out his issues for him with the professional and expediency you hope for when in these types of situations, plus Dana and Angelique were always there to take our calls and reassure us when we had any questions.  I definitely recommend TCI to everybody I know who's in deep with the IRS.  If they can straighten my dad out, they can help anybody!A 5 star restaurant all the way around. Vic & Anthony's Steakhouse is really the pinnacle of great food.

The wait staff knows exactly what they are doing. Our waiter was able to recite a long list of delicious sounding specials from memory and was well-versed in proper dining/serving etiquette . 

I ordered the salmon and was truly blown away. I was expecting great, but what I got was on another level. Top 3 all-time on the salmon list (and I eat salmon a lot!). Wild-caught Alaskan salmon which a creamy sauce. Yum! 

The atmosphere is very similar to what you would see in a nostalgic Brooklyn mob lounge, upscale with just enough lighting to see your partner across the way.

The price is not cheap, so don't go to Vic's unprepared. But for an exceptional restaurant away from the strip, Vic's is the place to be.OMG! Loved it.  Pub and Dining are segregated, so I can take my 4month old.  Not to mention, 2 other couples appeared w/their little ones (all well behaved and quiet I may add).  The menu has an awesome variety, we didn't even get to the Irish dishes.  The nachos (i'm latina) were off the hook!  We both had The Ruben and it was the juciest/most tender, succulent corned beef I have ever tasted!  For you Ruben fans out there; Marble Rye!  our server was very nice and accurate.  Quick service from the kitchen as well.It's free no sales and you get to watch tv. With an unending barrage of unwanted sales pitches everywhere you turn in some casinos this offer is refreshing because you don't do anything but give your opinion. After you watch the show you take a survey that takes about ten minutes. They never ask for any of our personal contact information. The only personal info they ask for is your age, state and zip code, and nationality. If you are looking to fill sometime and want to sit down to rest your feet I definitely suggest doing this.I gave tire works a call today in regards to getting my brake fluid flushed and an oil change. They sounded polite on the phone and made my way down there. The staff knows what they are talking about. They seem to be very sharp and noticed a couple of minor issues i was not aware of. They didnt up sell anything. I even said if i need wiper blades ill get them. They were honest and didnt change them. my car is modified and i have issues trusting people but i will be back! Brakes feel awesome. Oil change was needed. And the price wasnt bad at all. Thanks guys!

RomanoI'm not sure if I should be happy or upset that I found this place. I can only get a taste of their bomb drinks when in Vegas. 

Thanks to Yelpers' tips, I ordered the mango slush with boba and jelly. 
Having had countless slushes, I never knew they are supposed to taste this way using real fruit. 

The lady at the counter was super kind. 
There was a line of people waiting, but it was oh so worth the wait. 

By far the tastiest, most refreshing slush I have had.Only dropped a sports coat here, but was responsibly priced. Employee was very nice AND they give free bottled water to everyone!

Will go again!AY ya ya ya yaaaaa!!

I LOVE THIS PLACE! I'm totally used to the whole Mexican owned mechanics since my dad was always at them haha. I cam here for a full sized tire since I was rolling on a donut. The guy was pretty busy but got to us quickly and helped me. He got my tire size and found me a nearly new tire!!

I paid 30$ for the tire and labor!! HELLA CHEAP! The guys are totally nice as well! I forgot my keys on the table and he ran and got them : )

There was a lady there who said she drives 45 mins just to get her truck worked on, that she'll NEVER go anywhere else! 

The place is a typical mechanics/tire place, smells like oil and all that!! Go here for an awesome deal and great customer service!!Seriously one of the best staff ever. Everyone I delt with was awesome. I highly recommend this place should you need your eyes done.  They have an awesome selection of frames as well!After twenty years repairing and supporting computer systems, I have a chronic painful nerve in my right wrist and forearm.  Doctors and surgeons say it is the start of carpal tunnel syndrome.  Physical therapy and being careful has prevented the need for surgery.  After a couple of visits to float in an Epson salt saturated bath, nerve inflammation has subsided.  While not a cure, this is the first time in years I have not had a painful right arm.  I'm now a true believer in True Rest.Finally got to stop in and see what all the Yelpers were talking about....Sin City, along with Sushi Mon on Silverado Ranch and Maryland are my Favorites for AYCE joints.....Fresh seafood, awesome service from Jesse(Wayne's son) Jimbo, and Milton
and NO LONG WAIT(like it can be @ Sushi Mon) was even nicer!

We sat up at the bar and met up with Jesse...Immediately we get introduced to the rest of the Sin City Staff and not even 5 minutes later, we are given a plate of marinated baby tako(octopus) which was very tasty and was devoured in 5 minutes...Sin City offers a pretty extensive menu from your familiar nigiri action to sushi rolls and sides, and while browsing the menu, Jesse says, "you can order off the menu, or we can just feed you" COOL!!! Omakase style????We're DOWN!!!

So the boys start off by sending out some rolls(no half roll options here)
Tiger
Wet Dream
Volcano
After Round 1, the sides start coming
Baked Greenshell Mussels
Agedashi Tofu
Jesse's Oyster Shooters
Next, we move on to some Nigiri action
Uni(the best looking "tongues" I've seen and tasted!)
Hamachi
Saba
Ikura
Hotate
Now for some Hand Rolls...
Salmon Skin(Chicharron)-so good, one of my new favorites
No Name-fried calamari, tuna, avocado, crab, masago and eel sauce
Dessert Time...
Red Bean Mochi Ice Cream
Tempura Banana with Vanilla Ice Cream

Overall, great first time at Sin City....We'll definitely be back...ALOHA!!!Excellent service and sushi! We did all you can eat and the owner was one of the sushi chefs, he kept recommending different rolls and foods to try. It was amazing. They have a huge list of special rolls that you can order. The "Wet Dream" , "Vampire" , and mussels are amazing! :)

I'm going back every single time I go to vegas!I love this sushi place! The chefs are very friendly and helpful (they suggest to you what's good and what's popular). The vampire, ugly and stacie are my faves. Their baked green mussels, the screaming 'O' & soft shell crab are also super yummy. I mentioned that their unagi are not so fresh so I just kept in mind that I won't be ordering any rolls with unagi but since everything else, i.e. the fishes, are really good and fresh, I still give them 5 out of 5! :) I think I'm a regular here!Great food without the typical Americanized flavors. Service was very good and at times it felt that we had 10 servers checking in on us. Been there twice already!This place is AMAZING you get your burrito exactly how you want it and the food is always super fresh and the staff is super friendly I'm so glad I found a place like this.Got to say that Deb and Dave are putting out 200% effort to make this good. I went to the original Frog in Cave Creek since it opened in the 80s. They worked there for years and got it right when they opened this place.

The drinks are well made (ask for the Bloody Frog), the BBQ terrific, the beans, fried chicken (WOW), everything has always been good when I've gone AND.. you've got to try the sandwiches. The Wild turkey sandwich with Jalapeno bacon, the torpedo, and patty melt. How does this place do everything right? They've got specials, great prices, salads, and great desserts.

The old place was nice but this i might like even better cause it's smaller and more "neighborhoodie". They got tons of screens for sports and the people are super. It's a weekly stop for us and it's worth it. Great value too.

DISCLAIMER - No, I don't work there but wish i did. Then maybe i could eat for free. THANKS for opening this place again.So glad there's finally a place in town that does beignets right!  And the food's not bad either!

My husband and I went in just for beignets and coffee about a week ago (Excellent!) and tonight we went to try the actual food.  I had the BBQ Chicken Po-boy with sweet potato fries and my husband had the Gumbo.  Both were awesome!  The tzatziki on the po-boy was a pleasant surprise and the gumbo had a ton of sausage, chicken, and bits of ham in it.  Their sweet potato fries might be the best I've ever had - there's something about the way they season them that is just so good!

And of course, there's no Beauregard without beignets for dessert!  Once again, absolutely perfect!Had a great meal here on 4th of July....could see fireworks all across the Valley from our table, and had a superb meal.  I had heirlooms and burrata, to start, the filet mignon, and nice Pinot.  Every course was delicious, including the bread, and dessert was quite a pleasant experience.  The croquettes were borderline life-changing (in a good way), as were the hazelnut, chocolate creme lollipops that came with the check.  Waitstaff was classic 4S in terms of hospitality, and seemed like quite bunch of foodies themselves.Dr. Berschler is the best!  Signed up for a dental plan (HM0) but found out Dr. Berschler was not on the plan and was very disappointed. Went to a dentist on the plan but had a lot of problems with the office and now I'm back! I can't say enough about Downtown Phoenix Dental.  Everyone is top knotch and I'm sorry I even considered a change. I'm recommending this office to all my friends.This is my local neighborhood froyo store and have been coming here since they opened up. It's funny to read the negative reviews dating back to 2010/2011 implying that they won't make it. Well they're still around so must be doing something right! 
I believe they did change ownership a few years ago and that was a positive thing. We come here as a family regularly (2-3x month) in the warmer months. The kids LOVE it, and I am happy with it too: clean, always. A dog-bowl filled with water for the pooch. Staff is always nice. A nice selection of flavors and a good selection of toppings. I know that some other stores have a bigger selection of toppings or flavors, but I've never felt the need for many of the crazy toppings anyway (full sized twinkles or candy bars? no thanks.)
All in all, I recommend this place. They have groupons from time to time and coupons in the money-mailer that save you $ on your troyo fix.Resort Tanning and Spa rocks! Their beds are always clean! I have gone to a few tanning places, this one is my favorite! Defiantly recommend going here! You wont be disappointed!Very good pub for an informal dinner and high quality beer.  Had the New Amsterdam Burger and it was fantastic.  Try the Firestone IPA, but be warned that it will spoil all following drinks as they will pale in comparison.  Our server was very nice and offered good advice on food and drink choices as well as brought samples of comparable brews.  Will certainly try this place again on our next visit.Came across this pub on accident.   We tried going to wolf gang pucks .unfortunately they were closed and we came here.  They have an awesome happy hour and our waiter chris oneil was superb. We would definitely cone back and dine here again.  Lobster roll is on point and the burger was so juicy.  Definitely give this place a try.I've been shopping here since they opened and I'm definitely a regular.  All the items are easy to find despite the size of this store.  Parking is great.  Good southwest location.  Prices are awesome.  They sell a good amount of stuff for the entire family.

I also like how they're connected to Home Goods.I have been here a handful of times for Happy Hour after work and dinner once or twice after work.  I do recommend it.  GREAT happy hour deals!  All the bartenders I have dealt with are very friendly and attentive.  There is a bar area, a quieter restaurant area and also an area where there are some couches and tables to hang out and play board games or watch one of the multiple tv's in that area.  Nothing special and exciting about this place but a great area for happy hour and just hanging out with a few people.Have you ever walked into a bar or restaurant and instantly felt at home?  That's how I felt when I walked into the Grind last night.  The place has a great vibe, fantastic food and cocktails, and a friendly staff.  Some of the highlights of what we ate last night...  The burgers are phenomenal, the cable car drink was unusual and tasty, how could you not love donuts, and the bacon... oh the bacon...  I highly recommend swinging in for lunch or dinner so it become one of your favorites as it is now one of mine.Amazing authentic Lao/Thai food. Based  on years of eating in North Eastern Thailand and Laos, this  is as good as it gets.  The curries with pumpkin are exceptional.  The chicken "laap" is outstanding and the waiter kindly brings extra lettuce leaves to cup the "laap" in.  The sticky rice is hot, fresh and  served very "handily" (Pardon the pun).
Service is gracious and excellent. Soon Lao-Thai will have a beer/wine license and one need not travel to Laos to enjoy Lao beet along with  the best of Lao cuisine.Biggest selection I've ever seen. It's like the Costco for alcohol. Brought my friend in who'd never been in before and he was amazed. They also have a humidor for cigar purchases. CHEAP prices, much cheaper than our prices here in Washington. I wish we had one here.Huge selection and impressively organized so everything is easy to find and you're not cramped as you roam the store. The staff is always friendly and knowledgeable! And there seems to be free tastings happening every time I'm there - total plus!I.  LOVE.  ATOMIC. #7.  I first heard of it last year at Bite of Las Vegas after finding out I was allergic to dairy.  I about had a mental breakdown when I thought I couldn't eat ice cream again.  It was like a mirage in the desert when I saw it was DAIRY FREE!  I ordered the almond milk cookies n cream (I think) and yum!  It doesn't even taste that different from regular ice cream either.  I can't wait till they build one in the Summerlin area but I do make the drive waaaaaaaay out to Hendertucky just to get some of their creations.  The King in a waffle cone topped with hot fudge is one of my favs.  The banana split is tasty too.  Damn, I think I'm gonna have to hit it up this weekend....my mouth is watering just thinking about it...I just bought a house, the inspection didn't turn up any termites, so I figured I was ok when it came to bugs.  Well when I was painting a room and took off the outlet covers I discovered little black specks that could only be one thing... bug poop.  I'm not super squeamish about bugs, but a big pile of poop in the wall is not ok, and where there is poop, there are things that made it. I scanned Yelp for reviews and came across Lights Out--the reviews were all great so I gave Jason a call.  

I told him about my poop discovery and he knew right away what we were dealing with--crickets! Seriously, I came from another state and never considered them as a an issue before.  He was able to set an appointment for that weekend and came out.  Good thing he did, I had black widows and roaches too.  

He has a special spray that gets the bugs out of the walls and kills them. It was kind of exciting watching the crickets, spiders, and roaches scurry out and away.  Jason really knows his bugs and how to get rid of them, he even offered advice on what I can do to keep them from coming back into the walls.  He even offered my sister advice on how to bug proof her apartment.  

He let me know that when I get ready to do some landscaping he would be happy to give me advice on plants etc. so that I don't encourage the bug problem.

His prices were fair and he was knowledgeable and professional, when I notice bugs creeping back in he'll be the one I call.I can say without a doubt that Daniel made our recent trip to Vegas what it was.  Our group had a subpar ratio (5 guys and 3 girls) and we wanted to hit up a lot of the best clubs, so we knew we needed more than just a call to the hotel concierge or an e-mail to the club.  We had booked some stuff through another VIP company, but they were not following up with us and couldn't promise what we wanted (ie, they could promise a table but not one in a good location).  Luckily, the guy who hooked us up with our hotel room (a whole other success story in and of itself) let us know that Daniel with 702 VIP was the guy to call.

Daniel was a great sounding board and advised us not only on the best clubs, but the best tables in those clubs.  Sure enough, Friday he whisks us through the VIP entrance at Marquee in literally five seconds (and that line was massive) and walks us to our dance floor table for Porter Robinson.  Saturday night we hit up XS, and we got the same deal...back entrance with literally no wait, dance floor table.  As those are the two best and most in demand clubs in Vegas at the time of this review (and they were prime weekend nights), we were stoked on how connected this guy was and how we were able to walk right past the insane lines outside the club, and then again walk past all the tables next to the bathrooms or miles away from the floor.  Best experience ever.  We felt like celebrities.

Not only does this guy really know the people he says he knows and can deliver what he says he can deliver, but he is genuinely nice and made a point to get to know everybody in our party, not just the one whose birthday it was and who did most of the booking.  Plus his watch is seriously the most impressive watch I've seen in a long time hah.  He's admittedly not a bargain and he doesn't pretend to be (because this is Vegas), but we still got deals on both tables and paid less than people that had to wait in the table line.  We will never go back to Vegas without giving this guy a call first, cannot wait to see what else he can pull out of his hat.George is fun to work with. I had several issues with my home and building project that seemed insurmountable. His knowledge and proffesionalism were a welcome relief. He was prompt efficient, knowledgable and a spectacular value. I appreciate the little extras that come with good solid service, and a sense of humor. I reccomend this business to anyone who wants real value, and a great finished project.so, i now work in their delivery area. i ordered my sandwich on line @ 11:31am. delivered to me, in my hands, at 11:39! unreal!!! great fresh ingredients, fast service with a smile. cant beat it. plus its the same price as subway but fresher, friendlier AND FREE delivery! sold. thank you JJ's.This place was parked in front of my building one evening, so I had to give it a try. First off, the truck itself is super bad ass, and it gave my boyfriend a comic boner just from looking at it. 

We both got a single slider (we had dinner just a couple of hours earlier, but knew we had to hop on our chance to try this place out). I got the Barby, which is pretty much like a mini bacon cheeseburger. It was pretty tasty. My boyfriend got the pep pep which he said was the best slider he's had in his life. We shared a large bag of sweet potato fries. I was surprised to see they coated them in brown sugar, which was yummy! 

We only had to wait about 5 minutes for what seemed as super fresh food. Hopefully I find this truck again!I WANT TO TELL YOU A STORY ABOUT THE BEST HOSTESS AND WAITRESSES  IN PHOENIX! THEY ARE AT ZINBURGER!! 

Danielle (the Manager) and the Hostesses and waitresses are the best. In fact...the last time I was there (tonight) we walked in the door...were seated and 2 minutes later...Danielle brought me my usual: root beer float overflowing with extra chocolate ice cream!!! Before I could even ask for it!! I wish I had taken the name of the waitress because she was wonderful too!

PLUS ZINBURGER HAS THE ABSOLUTE BEST HAMBURGERS AND FRENCH FRIES OF ANYWHERE I HAVE EVER BEEN TO...albeit...I have cravings every once in a while for in n out burger...which I give in to a few times a month! Zinburger is right across the street from where I live: A DREAM COME TRUE!The kobe burger with the wild mushrooms is a must!  Also recommend the milkshakes and the zucchini fries.They did a great job at serving us at 9 o'clock at night, even when we were the only ones there, they were really happy to be there. They even seemed happy even when the rush start coming in. Speedy service, great food, and amazing pancakes. I've been going here for a while and I've always enjoyed it.I bought a new puppy recently and had tons of questions and dr Griffith answered all of my concerns without making me feel dumb. Dr Griffith is amazing. She genuinely cares about the well being of the animals. Both my dogs love her ;) thank you so muchPopped in for a quick lunch today.  The menu is quite extensive.  I ordered a mushroom brie wellington, not because I am a vegetarian - because I'm not - but because it sounded awesome.  It was.  Inventive and extremely tasty!

Servers were all smiles.  The atmosphere was a little noisy.  We were a bit underdressed, but no one seemed to mind.  My five year old loved the place, too!

I just realized that in the commotion of trying to get a business card to leave at the B&B for future guests that I may have stiffed the staff on the tip!!  If you work here and are reading this, contact me!Really really good ! Just moved to East Vegas, wanted a good restaurant ! Found one.   Had: Crab Cheese Rangoons (delish) Chicken Satay (fabulous) Chicken Yellow Curry (perfect taste & after taste) Spicy Mint pork with...I love this Gold's, always clean and never too packed. People don't stare and hang out like they do at LA fitness. Personal trainers know what they are doing (Matt R.) Staff is always friendly. Get the $40 membership it is worth the parking and towel service!This is a delightful place for dinner; it's an adorable bistro in the arts district, neither on the strip nor in a strip mall, an unusual and charming find in Vegas. The menu is fun and inventive, with quite the range of options, and the service was very friendly and attentive. I started with the lentil soup, which was a touch salty but very tasty, and then had vegan, gluten-free sliders, which I was tempted to try despite my non-vegan, pro-gluten tendencies, due to the fried plantains that were promised in place of bread. I was not disappointed. They were a tasty combination of flavors and textures; definitely a dish I would order again. Lemon ricotta cheesecake was outstanding.This Hawaiian food is great! The Chicken Katsu and BBQ Mix Plate are my favorite. Fast and Friendly service, food is very consistent.I live right around the corner and decided to try this place after a year! It is delish! I had the spam, eggs, rice, and macaroni plate...portions are a-plenty, food is awesome, prices are great, and service was fast! I'm going back today!Where to start...I love this place. I really really love their bread and salad. I have not had anything there that I didn't like. This place is my now go-to Italian place.Alway good food  and service. Love that its a local restaurant. The salad and bread is a meal in itself. Lunch specials are a great price.The salon is so cute and all the girls are great!Every self respecting fashionista makes an effort to visit Topshop regularly and we're very lucky to have such a lovely branch in Edinburgh. The shop was given a much needed make-over two years ago and now it's a wonderland of cool. Laid out over two floors (three if you include Topman), this shop can easily satisfy all your fashion needs - shoes, clothes, lingerie and accessories, you'll find it all here. There's even a personal shopper to help you piece together the perfect outfit. 

On the lower ground floor there's a great little section selling clothes from up and coming designers (the Yuki stuff is fab), stock is limited so you'll be unlikely to bump into someone else wearing the same item.Spent our ONE NIGHTER here for NYE 2011 and it was AMAZING!

My friend had a free night and when we got there and checked in they said they were completely booked on regular rooms and hooked us up with an EXECUTIVE SUITE!! I thought my friend was just kidding as we were walking into our rooms. I was like yeah whatever...

Once the door opened the four of us we're like on the first episode of the Real World when they first see their house! We were running around screamin no way, this is awesome!!! I've never stayed in such a huge room. Even tho it's an older hotel we still had like 5 couches, two bathrooms, a tub, his and her sink & closet, king size bed, a bar [which we were standing on hahaha] and did i mention it was all for FREE?!?!

It was the best way to ring in the new year! I wish we could get that room all the time :[ Prob theee best one nighter yet!!!This is my new favorite place!  Great coffee with fast and friendly service.  The music and ambiance is also very nice.NOTE (regarding previous posts):  I wanted to point out that the Badger Cafe is next to but not part of the Rum Rummer Lounge bar next door. It is self-contained now behind a nifty hermetically sealed glass wall (due to recent anti-smoking laws). Anyways, I just wanted to review the food/restaurant alone and separate it from the rest of the bar.....However, that being said, the option to order food and get it at the bar is totally up to you and your tolerance for tobacco smoke. Vice versa, getting beers from the bar is totally separate as well, but drinking has to be done in the bar AFAIK. 

FOOD: This ain't Kobe beef, but save yourself the trouble of high LV Strip prices and come here for a solid 1/2 pound burger. I've eaten here many a times back in the day when I lived in Las Vegas (05' - 09') and when I used to drive long distances to visit Las Vegas (02' - 04'). This place deserves a shrine. I always recommend this place to friends, but it's not for the faint of heart. If you abhor grease, battered fries, chili-cheese fries, and all things from the griddle....look elsewhere. Otherwise, if you call yourself a "grease aficionado", welcome to nirvana. Cheap prices and a 24 hour availability makes this place dangerous for the waistline. Get a few beers next door and you'll praise the sedentary lifestyle soon enough. I've never had their wings, but have heard decent things and they're cheap. I always go for the build your own burgers starting for under $3 - add some Ortega green chiles, a slice of cheese and take all the fixin's (ask for a pencil and request everything on those 4x11 order sheets) and then enjoy the cheap bill b/c it never costs you more than $5 even if you get the fries for 75 cents. Seriously, take a trip off the Strip (if you're a visitor) and enjoy a part of LV flavor. If you have time to spare, knock off an hour or two and see some rhinestone glitz at the Liberace Museum as well.

ATMOSPHERE: It's in a strip mall with a dance studio, a Korean resto and grocery mart - but what Las Vegas place isn't in a strip mall? Lot's of blue hairs, Packers/UW fans, pool tables, shuffle board and tons of characters at all times of the day. As mentioned above....Look for the "Rum Runner Lounge" to get that review and ask for Birdie when you're there - she's the bomb. Again...if you hate smoking, the anti-smoking laws (as mentioned above) won't keep you separated from your greasy spoon cravings - just eat at the cafe. 

HINTS: If you order at the bar, be sure to tell the bartender so he/she can flag down one of the BC waitstaff. Otherwise, order at the cash register next door and bring the food in. I find that if you play on the VP machines, you'll usually get better service right away. Another added advantage is "comp drinks" - if you put a $20 in the VP machine and play at max bet ($1.25), the drinks are "free" while you can enjoy your chow with those nifty bar wood block tables. (Food isn't free - so just pay your BC waitstaff separately).I have to give the BC 5 stars. 

Before I moved away from Vegas, my fiance and I ate here at LEAST once a week. 

Building your own burger is highly recommended as well as the KickA$$ hotwings! 

The staff was ALWAYS friendly and upbeat. The cook would sometimes come out to ask if everything tasted good...which I've never seen anywhere else, but found it refreshing. 

Since I have moved to the South, there are only 2 food items I crave from Vegas. Other than Roberto's rolled tacos, I frequently get a hankering for a juicy Badger Cafe burger.

Whenever I visit, I WILL definitely visit the Badger.I love going to this Harkins theater, there usually aren't a bunch of loud teenagers here and most people in this area actually show respect while at the movies and aren't on their cell phone texting the entire time. My boyfriend and I always come here and we're here about once or twice a week catching the new flicks! The popcorn is always fresh, the snacks are great and the staff is super friendly!I love Costco!  Even as a single guy there is plenty of things I can stock-up on and save money off my grocery bill.  I come here to buy things you know you'll go through so paper products, contact solution, tooth paste, etc...

Sometimes they even have decent brand named clothes for cheap.  Need a pair of jeans to do work in? They have them for under $15.

My membership pays for itself with the free tire rotation you get when you purchase tires from the Costco Tire Center.  You first save money buying tires here, second you save on not paying for rotations and any flat repairs.  Totally makes the sting of the $45 membership fee disappear.

You also gotta love the food court, $5 can buy you a stomach ache with $1.50 hot dog combos and giant slices of pizza!

The only disadvantages is how crowded this place gets on the weekends and how they change products frequently, so if you like a certain product don't bank on it always being offered.I went to this buffet for a mini-UYE with Rand H., Jeromy H., Mike C., Robyn N., and Brian S. As I entered Walking Stick, I was wondering if this buffet can top The Buffet in Harrah's in Maricopa, which before this was my favorite buffet. I must say that Walking Stick Resort and Casino is truly impressive and Wandering Horse is definitely deserving of its place here. Well-appointed and brightly lit, the buffet's dining area offers a grand view of the scenic Scottsdale Mountains. The servers are very friendly and very efficient, and the food is superb! The offerings included carved meats, American, Mexican, Asian, and Italian dishes, plus a cornucopia of desserts. There are too many items to mention here, and I tried to get a little bit of as many of the items offered, loved all of the things I tried, and regret that I ran out of room before I could try a lot of the offerings - which is a good thing, because that means I can look forward to lots of great new things to sample during my next visit. So ... The Buffet in Harrah's - I think you're really great but you'll have to move over; Wandering Horse outshines you.The best place for a men's haircut downtown hands down.  Trust me I have tried every place downtown and there is no competition.   I have been going to Adrian for about 8 months now and he hooks me up and treats me like a VIP every time.  His prices are reasonable and he will keep you laughing for sure.I should jus copy and paste my review from upper crust this place is very similair ok exactly the same (seen staff from uppercrust there) either way this place is great and now it's only a 3 min drive great for lunch 2 slices and a soda for  less then  $6I live in Albuquerque and want a 'Duce location here!!  I was in Phoenix visiting some friends for my birthday and went here for breakfast/lunch on a Sunday.  I love the old converted Airstream kitchen and the antique and vintage touches all over the place.  The food was excellent, atmosphere so fun and the service was super friendly!!  They even heard us talking about it being my birthday and brought over some amazing s'more sweet potato cheesecake with a candle on top and sang to me!  It was too-die-for!!!  What a great place, although I did feel a lil' guilty watchin' the people in the room next to us breaking a good sweat doin' a circuit-training class.  But they all were smiling and happy to enjoy the delicious menu after.  On my way out I wandered over to the clothing shop side of the restaurant and bought a cool funky t-shirt.  I am sold on the whole building and vibe of The 'Duce and can't wait to come back!!I am about to start gushing about a grocery store.  Friends of mine that live in Phoenix had told me great things about Fresh & Easy.  However,  I don't usually make a practice of stopping at grocery stores while visiting Phx. What brought me to making a stop this time was a fantastic wine that my friend KD introduced me to.  This sparkling red wine from F & E was so enjoyable that I made the stop on my way back to T-town.  
I walked in the door of this groovy little market and I will have to say it was love at first glance.  I was walking down the produce aisle and it was a beautiful sight! I really thought I was only going to buy the wine and be on my way, but thats not quite the reality of the story.  I started pondering what I could bring back to Tucson that would stay fresh sans a cooler.  That meant I could not purchase the chipotle ranch dressing that looked super yum.  I picked up some produce because their tomatoes were too beautiful to not purchase.  Stopped at the sample table and met Mary, who had raspberries with crème fraiche and they were lovely!  I did some purchasing of trail mix (great selection), cereal bars, veggies and wine.  Their wine selection was super fun to discover.  I bought two bottles for a grand total of $11.  That is pretty darn phenomenal!  I left Fresh & Easy blissed out and will come prepared with a cooler on my next jaunt to Phoenix.What is not to really like about this place?
Nothing that I can see.
It is a great place to come to ,if you live in the Valley, or anywhere else in the world.
 It is as great as any casino resort in Vegas.
 I think we are lucky to have it here close by.
The rooms are nice, there is covered parking. Great pools, nice grounds.
 The Buffett is one of the nicest around.
Nice place for out of town visitors to stay as well.
A t in my book.How are you guys not giving this a five star rating? Yes they may not be the best buffets in vegas, that is a given but together with the powers of 7 buffets combined it is indubitably the best deal you will find. I got the buffet pass around brunch, only because we were leaving after brunch the next day. If I were to base my experience around buffeting I would probably do dinner to dinner. 

Planet Hollywood was my surprise pick this was because they had Alaskan king crab, who would have known? I'm glad that we skipped out on Caesars because from the reviews, the place sucks. 
 
definitely hit up Paris for Brunch, they serve Champagne, which you can also get at Rio for brunch as well, but quality if food feels higher at Paris. 

It seems like most people on here are only able to complete 3 rounds of buffeting, I guess I'll aim for four next time.I've been using this place ever since I moved to Edinburgh 4 years ago. It doesn't like much from the outside, in fact the entire shope is squeezed into one tiny little room, but it's definitely a case of quality over quantity.

I come here to get my cartridges refilled; I always knew it was cheaper to refill than buy new ones, but I never realised how cheap until I used Capital Cartridges - I paid £9.50 in total for both my colour and my black and white, and the guy can't have taken more than 5 minutes to do it. 

While he was doing that, I had a (quick!) browse and although I'm no computer expert it would seem that this place stocks literally every possible accessory you could ever need for you computer. They had everything from the most bling, sequin-encrusted mouse I have ever seen (I'm fairly sure if Jordan could work a computer she'd have one of these), to at least 15 different types of A4 printing paper, and everything in between. I think I'll be popping back in soon to get myself a webcam, they  had some great value ones in that I spotted on my last visit.

If you're a student, take you're snapfax - you'll get 50% discount on your first visit and 25% discount after that. Although it's such good value anyway you'll almost feel a bit mean asking for it!First off, I only review burgers.  Heard about this place from my friend Les.  Went here with my mom who is NOT a burger fan.  I wanted to order 2 to split with her so I could try 2 burgers so I was going to pass on the fries.  She said, get the fries, I'll eat my share.  After the food arrived, she appeared to be enjoying the meal.  I asked her, "What is the best burger you've ever had?"  Her answer..."This one."

Update: Buns are like honey glazed dim sum baked Cha Siu Bao.  PERFECTION!  Currently the undisputed best burger in the Las Vegas area for me.

WHAT I ORDERED: 

Ronin Burger - 5/5 very juicy and flavorful!

Shogun Burger - 4/5 also very juicy and flavorful!

Kalbi Burger - 4/5 solid!

Garlic Salt & Pepper Fries - 4/5 awesome complement to the main attraction

Truffle Parmesan Fries - 3/5 ok...not sure what the brown sauce was. 

Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries - 3/5 ok, but not memorable enough to order again


STAFF: 
Nice.  Our waitress was quick and friendly and sported some cool tattoo work.

WAIT TIME:
Went a little early on a Friday afternoon and there was no wait.

PORTION: 
Good portion. Just the right size. 

BANG FOR YOUR BUCK 
The portions and quality of burger match the price well.

WOULD I RETURN 
Yes!Wow, amazing! Came here with a group of girls and we pretty much ordered like 6 burgers and tried them all out. My fav was the banh mi, of course. 

I really like the casual and laid back atmosphere however was in a random part of town and in a strip mall. Inside, you feel like you could be in San Francisco or LA.Rarely do I give 5 stars to any place but this is a great burger place. My friends and I ordered the oxtail chili cheese fries, pork belly sliders and Chicken nuggets thing for our starters. The pork belly sliders we could've done without but the other two, were freaken tasty as hell! The fries were tasty to another level, The chicken nuggets things were so good, I pretty much ate the whole plate by myself. 

I ordered the Ronin burger which had all kinds of delicious on it! It had an egg, cole slaw, onions and all kinds of other stuff that I can't remember! It was too good. Everyone should come here and eat here!!!Do not let the pretentious look and vibe fool you.  This place has great food.  And unlike what I've heard from other reviewers, the staff is friendly and willing to help in whatever way necessary.  They'll cook it however you want it.  They'll add items or hold items if you want.  They will go out of their way to make your experience great.

Everything we had was amazing.  The shrimp chips and truffle fries were great.  Everyone had a different burger - all were outstanding.  Even my 5-year-old's kids plain cheeseburger was great.  

One caveat...  If you're anything like my wife and aren't an adventurist eater, stick to the "build your own burger."  You'll get a great burger made how you want it and you won't be disappointed.

If you're in the area, stop by.  I'm sure you'll love it.Update: went back with the husband this time. Still such a great place. We pretty much ordered the same burgers I reviewed. This time I tried the oxtail chili fries app. AWESOME! Fried egg yet again. Their oxtail chili was really good. Wish they put more on. Definitely a place I hit up everytime I'm in town. :)Great taste, wide range of choice at very affordable prices. Special recommendation -- the cold noddle. Wow! it's the breez for the summer in the Sun Valley. Both my son and daughter love it. My wife and I like its set lunch, so many different choices and we just came and every time we ended up getting something great. So, just come and try it out yourselves. ;-)This place could be one of the reason that I am heading back to Vegas.

We found this place after a long day of climbing/hiking. It was 10:30pm, all we want is some delicious Korean food, but Yelp pointed us to this place that is totally outside the normal Spring Moutain stripe, but we were like what the heck. I have to say, Yelp didn't dissapoint. 

This place open late, similar to a Japanese izakaya, this is a drinking place that came with good dishes.

We tried:

Their special which is sprout, pork belly, squid cooked in spicy sauce. Yummmm!

Korean saugage that came with cold cut liver. Yummmmmmm

Kimchi fried rice, yummmmmmm

Rice noodle with spicy sauce, yummmmm

The thing is that no one dish is the best I ever tasted, but the varitey and how each is solid on its own made our tummies really happy.

Drinks:  they have good selection of draft beers, about 6. We had a pitcher of morimoto buckweed beer. Their beers are really chilled that went down really smooth.

Service: Our waiter is fantastic, came by a few times during our meal to make sure things are cool.

Decor: casual and cute.

We walked out happy, and this place is added to our usual vegas, drinking, clubbing, shopping, climbing, eating itinerary.Hotel Missoni is absolutely the best hotel in Edinburgh and one of the best in the world - not that I knew all that when I booked it.  In fact, I didn't realize it until I was flipping through one of the coffee table books in our room on "Best Hotels in the World" and came face to face with a ours! lol! Honestly, I was looking for a W Hotel and when I found that there wasn't one in Edinburgh, I did a couple searches and read up on reviews and found Hotel Missoni - a hotel that encompassed the swankiness of a W, but with it's own distinct feel and style.

In the midst of old town, it's exterior fits in well, but the interior is just as modern as modern can be.  It's centrally located, so you can get to the shopping of the Royal Mile within steps and see such attractions as the Edinburgh Castle and the Palace at the other end, not to mention Mary King's Close (which was cool, but totally freaked me out! lol!).

Hottie bellhops in Missoni-printed kilts greeted us at the door before we were ushered up to our super posh room - awesomely decorated and uber comfortable.  The amenities were great with fabulous bath and body products, large closets, and complimentary beverages in all the fridges!  There's candy downstairs by the check-in counter as well if you want a free sweet treat as well.

While we didn't eat at the downstairs restaurant because we had reservations elsewhere, we were told that it was one of the best in the area and certainly worth trying.  Perhaps it's another excuse to get back to Edinburgh - not that I needed one.  Visiting was one of the highlights of my travels on this trip.  Can't wait to return.Isn't it funny when food tastes better when it isn't yours? Well, there is a similar experience with the coffee here because you know it's fairtrade and thus better for the world. 
There's quite an earthy feel to this place, as you would imagine there to be, and the staff are nothing short of wonderful. Nice job.
Although the things they sell are probably on the more expensive side of things, it's worth it to save the planet from corruption and globalization, right?Food is delicious (pancakes for my companion, egg roll w tomato, onion & mushrooms for me).  Coffee is superb (I had 7 cups in 2 days and Fair Trade stood out)  and the atmosphere can't be beat. 

Don't let the corporate coffee shop down the street drive this place out of business! 
Added bonus - the chef is yummy.  Ladies, get in there just to have a hot guy make you breakfast.STK is hands down 1 of my favorite restaurants to eat at in Vegas. The atmosphere is always amazing from the staff, to the music, to the patrons. The 8 oz crab oscar filet is absolutely 1 of the best steaks I have ever had. The tuna tartar is incredible, as is the Mac and cheese and the corn pudding. The environment in STK is always so energetic. The wait staff was very friendly and the service was impeccable. I couldn't have asked for a better dining experience. True professionalism is all that you will receive at STK. The drinks aren't too bad either. Make sure you try the tuna tartar app and make sure you don't pass on the bread with blue cheese crumbles. Melts in your mouth. Enjoy.Shady rolled into his go-to spot in Vegas for another go-'round with his favorite lady servers in the business. Stephanie and Amy just plain kick -ass over the competition. Genuinely friendly, beautiful, great at what they do, it makes suffering through the 150 decibal sound system all worth it. And Shady has to admit, with all the scenery the food is actually very good. This year Shady took down the lamb chops which were cooked perfectly and delicious on one night, and the sirlion on another. Coupled with some nice red's, the great girls behind the bar, and the scenery all around, STK is just a great night out in Vegas. Shady has been a regular here since it opened 3 years ago, and as long as Shady's ladies are there, so is Shady. Just please, after 1000 reviews suggest you lower the music just a tad, please listen to the people.I'm new to Phoenix, AZ, but glad I checked out Yelp for the good reviews.

I visited Ken's Nails and Spa for the first time today. The place was busy, but Ken was super nice about me walking in without an appointment, he was very accomodating! 

Ben was so sweet and did an excellent job with my Deluxe Spa Pedicure and I am so happy with the way he did my acrylics (he did them just as I asked)! 

I'm really glad I tried out Ken's Nails and Spa and I definitely will be returning.

I also recommend Ben for any and all nail spa services, he's great!!Great customer service. Very clean facility. Love that their utensils are sterilized and individually bagged. Will def come back again if im in this area of town.So polite & professional! Beautiful job on my nails and toes.. and no problem with special requests!! Cindy did my nails.. LOVE HER!!I decided to visit after reading about it in the Las Vegas Review Journal.  I had the Chilean hot dog and the ice cream waffle.  Both were very good.  I'd planned to eat only half of the waffle due to calories, but I failed.  Although my college days are three decades removed, I also enjoyed the subtle, hip music.   There is no doubt that I will return.The infusion burger is all you need to know. The signature dish! Great staff, they really pay attention to your dining experience. Awesome happy hour, Sunday football is perfect. Sound for the game you're watching if you need it.My very favoite place in town square. Drank Strawberry Fields, amazing. Ate perogies and Carmel mousse, delightful. Had 4 of the 6 bartenders wait on us. Wonderful service. Never had to wait for even water or a dirty dish to be cleared. It was a great experience. Especially since we were there thru a busy Friday night dinner time and still had great service. Def  going back frequently. Try it, you'll be impressed.Fantastic food, their lunch buffet is something I have indulged in more then most would consider safe or reasonable.  Delicious food, and a great value.I ate here a few times when I moved into the condo complex upstairs and was unimpressed with Nourish.  Last week, I revisit nourish and was presently surprised!  So surprised, I need to update my review.  The menu and food have improved.  I had a protein burger and it was very good. My side of avocado/sweet potato salad was excellent as well.  This place will accommodate any food need (allergy/preference).  As a vegetarian, in plan to eat here more frequently now!Super cute place, friendly service and decadent food!!! The cute French guy that served us completed the experience! European sized food portions are perfect! Quiche is to die for... As is everything else!Chez Vous Crepes can either be rated 5* or 3*, depending on your expectations.  I choose 5* because I look at Chez Vous as a casual creperie, as indicated by its business hours which do not include dinner.  If you are looking for fine French dining, with each dish packing "WOW" power, you will probably find it modestly disappointing.

But as a destination for a thoroughly enjoyable breakfast or lunch, Chez Vous can scarcely be topped.  The room is bright, clean, inviting, and comfortable, and there is an outdoor patio as well if the weather is fine.  The look, feel, and service would not be out of place in France.  The menu contains a good selection of both sweet and savory crepes, some French-inspired sandwiches such as Croque Monsieur, quiche, and a few salads.  The food is flawlessly executed and does not disappoint in any way except perhaps in inventiveness.

For example, I had a crepe "overstruffed" (no complaint) with ham, Swiss cheese, mushrooms, and creme fraiche.  Whether by design or not, the four ingredients were not completely mixed, so each bite was different, one dominated by salty ham, one by mushrooms, etc., but each having some of the other flavors in it as well.  Delicious!

By all means, give Chez Vous Crepes a try, leave your fine dining expectations in your car, and just enjoy living in Paris for a few minutes.

HINTS:
1.  It gets crowded - try slightly off hours.  If the day is too hot to eat outside, there are only about six or seven tables available.
2.  The dessert crepes do not appear to be as good as the savory ones.  We had a pear crepe and it had no complexity of flavors.  They have other deserts too, such as lemon pie the day we were there - might be worth a try.  Save room.
3.  The salads looked pedestrian but we didn't try one.Do you need some Chocolate Merlot Mustard?  How about some root beer mustard? Or some jalapeno mustard?  All of these can be bought at the mustard museum.

At the National Mustard Museum, they have the world's largest collection of mustard and mustard memorabilia.  Prior to visiting the mustard museum the first time (which was almost a year ago), I didn't really think that I liked mustard.  Now I know that I had just tried bad mustard in the past and that there are so many delicious mustards out there.  

The nice people who work at the mustard museum will let you taste any of the mustards that you would like.  They will happily let you try dozens of them if you want.  

Downstairs is the museum.  They have the mustards in the museum labeled by state (or by country if they are not from the US).  They also have the Mustard Piece Theatre where you can watch a little movie about mustard if you want.  While the movie isn't that engaging, it's also only a few minutes long.  I think it's worth the few minutes it takes to watch it.

Their new store in Middleton is great!  It seems quite a lot larger than the old store and of course, it's nice and new!  In the museum, you can see the different mustards better because the display cases are quite a lot larger.  Upstairs, you can shop easier because there is plenty of space to move around.  The new store is definitely nicer than the old.  

I'm sure we will be back here whenever we pass through.  The new location is actually more convenient for us than the old one, which is excellent!Las Vegas has seen a few "hardcore" arcades come and go. From Race for Atlantis, to the Golden Age of The Orleans, to GameLand (rest its soul), there has usually been at least a decent spot for locals to get their gaming fix.

The arcade scene in Vegas, unfortunately, has laid dormant for some time now (since the closure of GameLand and the Adventuredome's VR Center). The Orleans has maintained a decent selection of fighters, but Bemani fans have been largely out of luck outside of the occasional new DDR or hacked In The Groove machine.

Today, I visited a newly-opened arcade called Gemini Arcade Palace. When I saw pictures of the place, I was frankly in disbelief. DDR X, DDR Disney Rave (I know, but come on), three ITG machines, DrumMania and GuitarFreaks V6 linked for session play, and two Taiko No Tatsujin machines under one roof? Be still, my Gamer heart! Naturally, I had to get down there and make an informed decision about this new contender.

After being woefully misled by Google Maps, whose directions led me to an apartment complex, I found Gemini Arcade Palace at the southeast corner of Flamingo and Sandhill. Walking in, I knew I had found -- at long last -- the successor to my dearly-departed GameLand.

All the aforementioned machines were indeed present, along with a PropCycle machine (PropCycle!!) and a few others I don't recall. I sat down at my distraction of choice -- DrumMania -- and plunked down fifty cents for a three-song session. After a few games and conversations with old arcade scene friends, I wiped the sweat from my forehead and left as satisfied as I ever had back in the GL glory days.

Any budding local business will live or die based on how well they listen to their customers, and thankfully Gemini seems very open to the suggestions that have been offered by its earliest patrons. There has been discussion about adding Bemani games that aren't currently present (namely Beatmania IIDX, a highly sought-after machine for many local enthusiasts), which will help to please potential arcade-goers who aren't already convinced.

The suggestions I have for Gemini are to get some high-powered fans or a good A/C system to keep the dancing game fans feeling and smelling rosy, and to get some popular fighting games in there to bring in a wider audience. The establishment seems to be catering to Bemani fans right now (which is fine with me personally), but they need to broaden their horizons if they want to get a diverse (and large) local following.

I'm giving Gemini five stars based not on its current offerings, but what it means for the future of the Las Vegas arcade scene -- that is, that it isn't dead and that there are still business owners out there who want to build a local and loyal following by listening to its customers and giving them what they want.Our favorite place on cheat days. Fresh fruit and chicken strips. But everyone loves Chick-fil-a! Staff here is awesome and friendly. On busy lunch rushes, they even have people outside taking orders to speed things along. Awesome customer service!I was staying at South Point for a couple of days earlier this week and was looking for something to eat at around 10:45AM. I really wanted to try Steak 'n Shake, and decided to pass on Del Mar Deli and wait for S'NS to open. I mentioned this to my good friend Jay F. later that day and he said "Dude, Del Mar Deli is legit" and claimed they had the best bagels in Vegas, and better than the beloved Bodo's Bagels from our college days in Charlottesville (UVa). Those are big words and a high recommendation coming from a NJ native. So we agreed that the next morning, when he was taking me to the airport, we would meet at Del Mar Cafe so I could see what all the fuss is about. 

The fuss is well-deserved. I ordered a Bagel and Lox sandwich on an egg bagel (toasted) for breakfast. It seemed a bit pricy at $10, but the sandwich had a generous portion of lox and cream cheese, and the bagel was oh so good. 

Sandwiches here also looked amazing, with nice large portions of meat, and the desserts were HUGE. The tiramisu was the size of your head - literally. If the rest of the food tastes as good as it looks - and as good as the bagel I had - then Del Mar Deli is definitely a winner.I recently relocated back to AZ from the Washington D.C. area. It was there that I got into Bikram yoga -- love the heat! Well, this hot yoga gives you the detoxifying heat that you love from Bikram with power moves like planks and push ups . What a fabulous work out. The instructors are excellent and each class is different and challenging. I'm so glad I found this studio.The clubs on the Wynn properties are always the best! The setup and music is always great, always busy but still with room to hang out at as well. As a local I tend to forget how amazing the places in the city are. 

Stop by whether its your first time or your 103rd time, you won't be disappointed!Great food and fantastic service. The staff made sure I always had naan and water in my glass, and the food was excellent.My husband and I saw the great reviews on Yelp.com about this place and decided to go there after hiking to Humphrey's Peak. We got there around 7:30pm on a Saturday night. It was busy, but we got seated right away. Immediately after entering the restaurant, a nice man greeted us and said he'd clear a table right away. The staff couldn't have been any friendlier or attentive. We were totally blown away by the selection on the buffet and that we got tandori chicken sizzling served at our table that came with the buffet. They also brought awesome garlic naan and had mango lassi on the buffet to drink as you like. The price was amazing and we're wondering just how they stay in business with prices that low! We tasted everything and nothing disappointed us. The food was delicious! We really can say nothing bad about this place. It was amazing! We live 3 hours away, but we'll definitely go back when we're back in the area!This is a review for their buffet. Mmmmm this place is very good! I like how all the food was fresh and the service was great! They made us feel very welcomed and were really nice. Everything I ate was delicious, there wasn't one thing I didn't like! The prices were also very fair. We will be returning very soon, even again this week.The service was wonderful! Not to mention their food is delicious!!! Definitely coming back soon.Potentially the only thing you need to know: the breakfasts here are awesome. 

And they're served all day. And they're awesome.

You want more? Well. First off check out the photo I uploaded of The Big Yin breakfast. Does exactly what it says on the tin. Served in a frying pan, there was the BIGGEST SAUSAGE I HAVE EVER SEEN (that's what she said, I know.) And then the home-made tattie scone. And just SO MUCH FOOD. This wasn't even my breakfast and I was in awe.

I went for the Tattie Stack. Two home-made tattie scones with some black pudding and bacon, and a 'happy fried egg' on top. The black pudding was awesome-sauce and the home-made tattie scones really made it. Happy as Larry was I, and judging by all the food that was demolished from the frying pan opposite me, I'd say we both were.

I love all the names on the menu too. The Big Yin for a start. And The Nutella Fella (a chocolatey dessert). Loads others that I can't remember, but the tongue-in-cheek menu is a nice touch.

The staff are also super friendly and down to earth. And they have scrabble! Another one to add to the board game / scrabble Yelp List.

They have some outdoor seating on a quiet side road, which we made use of. Unfortunately some overhead birds also made use of it, and were quite generous with their own offerings. On one of us (not me). The hazards of dining outside. I guess it goes with the territory of the Shore and seagulls close proximity to the Shore?!

So as far as a day-time gastopub goes, Roseleaf gets 5 stars. This is somewhere I'd love to be my local too, as judging by the friendly staff it'd be a great wee boozer in the evenings too.

Perfect for the Diamond Jubilee Day off.I've always love this beach club!!!
Came here for a bachelorette party. . .free entry and when we arrived there was barely ppl inside so we got first dibs on the spot we wanted to claim.  
All the employees were very friendly and accomodating.  Thanks for your help and taking millions of pictures for us! hahaha
Everything abt this place is amazing! I love the ambiance of it.
The music was awesome too.  Lots and Lots of beautiful ppl! It wasn't as crowded as TAO nor cramped.  
When we ordered drinks the bartenders make all the drinks pretty stiff tho the price for the drinks are pretty up there, but hey its vegas!
I had such a blast here.My wife went to Fresh 52 and bought the best corn on the cob I've ever had and I've had a lot over my lifetime. She also bought berries and cherries and I'm not a big fan of those, but these were an eye opener for me, VERY TASTY & FRESH!!!

I would rather get it fresh from the farmers than let it go to the supermarket and all the hands that touch it.

We will be back at FRESH 52 this Sunday for sure!!!

CHECK this out, its free and its more than just food.

FRESH52.comTonight's show was amazing. My wife and I have been to 2 blue man group shows,  2 different cirque du soleil shows,  medieval times twice and a few other dinner shows and this was by far the most entertaining show we have seen yet. The way these guys brought the use of colors into their show took it from just a dance show and created art. These guys are amazing. If you come to Vegas and don't see this show you are seriously missing out.It's hard to not give this a five and I may just end up doing so just to frustrate people that hate seeing perfect scores: Seriously I was skeptical but after what seems like a streak of  3 star reviews I finally have something good to report on the end of the food chain I can speak to:) 

Is it the best chili cheese dog I've had? No.The best  chilli-cheese fries? No.Most extensive selection of sodas? Again no but truly this place adds up to more than the sum of its parts.It has nearly the best of all three  in one friendly, clean place that I'm looking forward to returning to. 

Their Chili-cheese dog takes Sonic's to school and steals its lunch money. The texture of  fine ground meat  / amount makes it easy enough to eat and theirs actually has flavor in the chilli, you know  unlike every chain that tries to sell you the same thing. 

When added to cheese and the  fries it was really great  though my preference is for fatter fries this was a great portion for the money.  

Wife's  bare lettuce and meat burger was tasty with maybe a slightly enthusiastic shake of the seasonings  but to be fair if it was a fully dressed burger I bet it would be hard to tell.

Kid's Cheese burger ,oh yes, very very good and hopefully he appreciates now why we keep him away from that clown. 
  
Really the choice is great, the soda's great,  friendly people that ask, and really seem to care, if you liked the food give this a 4.5   rounded to five.Ahhhhhmmmmaaazziing! I had the mexi-burger and it was probably the single best burger I have ever had. Perfectly juicy and crisp. The fries were also very good. and oh my the soda selection. I did the math and there is about 500 different sodas. A must go in my opinion.I simply love Pizza Express. there's not one thing on the menu which I wouldn't like. My favorite at the moment is Da Morire (which means 'to die for'). They also do great salads and pasta. The only thing missing is steak I think. 
I am signed up with my email address and they always send me vouchers, without them the place might be a bit pricey. 
Its a great place to take kids for lunch, they have piccolo menu for about 7 pounds (dough balls, small salad, pizza or pasta, dessert and a little frothy milk), kids just love it.
Always feel very welcome there. 
Recommended!The Pickle Juice with the Margarita flavors goes well together.

Try the red velvet! ...And dont forget to get a punch card. Buy 9 (any size) and you get a LARGE one for FREE!July, 2013. My daughter and I will drive to LV to get it EVERYTIME!...  I'm normally a big fan of "shaved snow" here in LA, but PPenguin's shaved ice can match it well!!  Definitely add the ice cream to your shave ice!! See you next month!!I bought a Groupon for my daughter and her friend (both 10 at the time) and they loved it! The class was small and the instructor was very helpful and patient with all the students (most children). The girls loved that they could both create and paint their own pottery, instead of just painting like most pottery places. My only complaint is that it is SO far from my house in the far southwest Valley. You have to make three trips out for one piece of pottery (one to make it, then to paint, then to pick up after it's been fired). Regardless of the location, we'll be back!Omg!! My new favorite place on the face of the earth!!! Happy hour is 2 for 1 drinks. Drinks all inspired by candy! The food was also great! I wish I could open one in my hometown just so I can hang out there all day :) :)This was the best candy store of all time. They had such great stuff. I bought all kinds of things for my wife and my niece my nephew. I think it was a great store. Hopefully other people going shop at this place.First off would like to thank my fellow yelpers for directing me here. I needed to find a place to get the new whip's windows tinted since I couldn't talk the dealership into doing it for free. Boo. I was able to get an appt. fairly quick, weekends were tough to get in so I was able to get in on a Monday. Very satisfied with the way my car looks, they offer a very good warrantee. While I was there I saw that they also did window services on homes, I've been interested in the film that goes on windows that is supposed to help hold shattered glass together should someone try to break in. Had Bryan come out to do an estimate and had work done the next week. Bryan gave me lots of information on the product and the company and I feel much safer now that I have this film on my downstairs windows. Only regret is I wish I would have done this sooner! This also comes with a lifetime warrantee should anything happen. Also received a thank you card in the mail from Courtney and Mike, nice touch! This is a great family business.This is the only place I will get my windows tinted from now on. 

They quoted me a 2 hour wait and my car was finished in 1 hour and 45 minutes! I love how dark the tint is and how cool it keeps my vehicle in the Vegas heat. 

Five STARS! and I will be referring all my family and friends from now on!WOW!!!

I go here every trip -- Hand rolled and finest quality money can buy.I must have poor taste when it comes to Mexican food based on the review below because I think Big Burrito is pretty damn tasty. Their carne asada fries are bomb and I'll come back for them time and time again.

Carne asada fries consist of carne, cheese and french fries. No sour cream, no guacamole, no bullshit - just meat, cheese and deep fried potato - fuck yes.

My boyfriend has gotten the rolled tacos (guac on the side) and he's also gotten the taco plate. Both of them have gone over well.

When you have a hankering for inexpensive mexican food and you're in the neighborhood, Big Burrito is a good choice. :)The service, food, and drinks are amazing! If you Iike Sangria you will love theirs! It's not too sweet...we also tried the habanero salsa and it was sneaky hot. 

I live in Ahwatukee and this place is definitely a hidden gem! If you like Mexican food you have to give this place a try!Tammy is an amazing massage therapist and I highly recommend her to everyone.  One of the best massages I have ever had.  She is also a fabulous person with a gentle spirit.  This makes the experience with her one of the best you will have.Like everyone else, I'm going to blow sunshine up the ass of the Venetian Poker Room. Good tournaments, always have cash games running, solid staff, good cocktail service.

5 stars for one of the better poker rooms in Vegas.My first visit and I was impressed!  It's a great space...roomy...great for a happy hour with friends...and fantastic for a late dinner (the kitchen is open until 1am on Friday & Saturday nights).  I started off with the Lobster, crab and artichoke dip...hot, cheesy...great with the accompaning chips for slices of pita bread.  I drank my dessert...that is, I had a half and half...Youngberry Chocolate!  Half raspberry beer...half chocolate stout...it was a fantastic melding of flavors in my mouth!  The beer list is extensive, so I definitely have this on my list for my next trip to Vegas!

For dinner, I had the grilled cheese (three cheeses on sourdough bread) and organic tomato and basil bisque.  WOW!  That was a fantastic combination of cheeses and soup...the fried basil leaf on top was the perfect accent.  Along my main course, I ordered a side of truffle fries...these were divine!  If you've read any of my other reviews, you'll know that I LOVE anything with truffles...this definitely didn't disappoint!  Perfectly fried shoe string fries...sprinked with fresh herbs, salt, black pepper, parmesan cheese and truffle oil. YUM!!

This meal definitely didn't disappoint...my only regret is that I don't live closer!Birthday Dinner for my good friend Melissa Chupa...Happy Birthday!!!I've been to Yardhouse during happy hour and regular hours! I personally would rather go during happy hour, prices are of course cheaper and they give generous portions. I've ordered three to four plates during happy hour and it cost around 20 dollars! Now during their regular hours I've spent 50 dollars on four plates. Sitting inside the restaurant can be very loud, I've found myself yelling across the table so my friend could hear me. Outside seating wasn't as loud but since it's Vegas it is hot! Customer service is great! They're always nice and I love how they check up on you!This is probably some of the best fusion food i have ever had.

I will start by saying that i was skeptical at first about Korean and Mexican cuisine mingling together in one dish. It just seemed like an if-y kind of idea to me; but after my first bite into a chicken fusion burrito my mind was completely made up and my taste buds were in awe.

The chips are made by order so they are nice and fresh when they get to your table. (ASK FOR THE GUACAMOLE! IT'S INCREDIBLE)
I have enjoyed the spam mousabi, chicken fusion burrito, the chicken fusion tacos (my boyfriend and his friend absolutely love the fish and shrimp tacos).
 I am a complete fan of any fusion item on the menu. 
BUT....

I am not a fan of the Mexican burrito and the carne asada fries aren't that good either.
BUT DON'T LET THAT STOP YOU!

the food is truly amazing as well as the owners and the people that work in there. the food is beyond reasonably priced and there is no reason why you shouldn't go there RIGHT NOW!
go go go!Highly recommended ! The place is small but the food is AMAZING!This was our second visit for this vacation trip. We found Komex a few years ago on Yelp and have gone back every time we visit Vegas. 
I tried the chicken fusion lettuce wraps with kimchi. Very good...I love the red hot sauce on the table. 
Can't wait to try the 2nd restaurant that will be opening later this year.It's Mexican.

It's Korean.

It's both.  And I love it!

This is spot is small.  It's cramped.  There's no signs of the warm welcome of corporate American name tags or signage.  There's just really good, unique fusion food.  And most of it is cooked on the hot grills right out on display.

The fusion flautas, fusion Bulgi tacos, and kimchi fried rice all combine for a meal that I was not expecting.  It's sweet hot like Korean. But it kicks with a Mexican spice and flare.  I wasn't totally sold on fusion before this place.  And my Korean friends cringed when I asked them what they thought of the idea.  But after they tried it, it was all smiles.

Its tucked into a small strip mall so you may have to search to find it.  But you should search, because it's worth the find.In short, it was professional, good quality work, and I will definitely do business with nufilez again.

We came in to transfer our wedding video from  a couple hd minidv tapes to dvd. This was the best company we find in Vegas. The process was quick and pleasant. We are going to do business with Nufilez again soon.Brenda at Balanced Organizing Solutions is a miracle worker! I brought her in before doing a major remodel of my business space and it was the best thing I could have done! She helped with coming up with a new layout, where things could live in the new space and gave me rules to figure out what really wasn't worth my space - I still live by those rules not only in my office but in all my other spaces! She is fabulous, does wonderful work, takes the time to understand what your priorities are and comes up with ideas that are truly helpful!Best bread in town!  Normally when I eat banh mi, it cuts up my mouth, but not here at Mr. Sandwich.  The bread is till crispy on the outside, but soft on the inside and so yummy!

My favorite is the banh mi siew mai (the meatball).  Their dac biet is great too and they have a creative take on the banh mi pho which has all the fixings in pho (Vietnamese soup noodle) minus the noodle in a sandwich.

And who can pass up a cafe sua da (Vietnamese coffee)?I absolutely loved this place! Let's see. It's cheap and really great Greek food. The owner was wonderfully sweet and generous with the ouzo (yum!). 

There was two of us at dinner: everybody starts with free pita (omg, amazing) and tzatziki (very creamy and refreshing), we got humus for an appetizer with a side of feta (more yummy pita, humus was good, more thick and chunky, and brought out big ol' slabs of feta), along with spanakopita (sooo very good, try it!). Boyfriend got a gyro plate which was absolutely huge (veggies, pile of wonderful lamb, more pita, feta, olives) and I got the chicken souvlaki sandwich (more yum). We finished with a piece of baklava (which had more cinnamon than usual, but really good). All of these deliciousness came out to what? $24!! 

Do go to this place, it's wonderful and the service is very inviting and warm. One note: The place is not open on Mondays at all, as we regretfully found out.best lee's sandwiches i have ever been to in my life!!Amazing ramen.  The broth was just an umame explosion.  Buttery, porky, hints of sesame oil.  The egg was perfect.  The pork was perfect.  The ramen itself was only ok but the broth is what the dish is all about.Monta is fantastic...a fantastic real Japanese Ramen house hidden in the middle of LV. Everything here is authentic, tasty, cheap, fun and fantastic. If you are looking for a small, real Japanese noodle house in LV, this is the place. enjoy!I have tried pretty much all the ramen place in LA n this place is like the #1 ramen on my list (daikokuya in little Tokyo is #1 tooo!!!) The soup base for the ramen was incredible i've never tasted anything this good (not too salty, n rich in beef flavor, plus the soup is not like liquid, its a little bit thick n jelly-ish). I also order the fried rice.... holy mother of monkey balls.... it was so good I didn't know someone can cook fried rice to this level... this place is incredible. 

A MUST TRY ramen if ur in vegas.The Best Ramen in Las Vegas

I have been a regular here at Monta Ramen for quite some time and have been recommending this noodle house for many. 

Pros: Monta Ramen provides a traditional Japanese style ambiance with transparent view in kitchen that portrays confidence and quality in its product. Monta's Tonkatsu style ramen is delicious and perfectly prepared. The broth never gets old and is always ready to fulfill. Monta offers perfectly balanced side dishes (fried rice, gyoza, etc) and options to upgrade ramen dishes.  Service is quick and generally helpful. 

Cons: The size of the restaurant is small and can be an issue when hosting larger parties. The wait time especially during prime hours (lunch and dinner) can be an issue. All parties must be present upon seating. Be weary of writing your name down on the clipboard; my party got overlooked recently and the host sat three parties before mine. 

Overall, the quality of food trumps the service.  A must visit for tourists!What a treasure!!!! The pizza is outstanding. My husband had the Philly cheesesteak. Although the flavor of the sandwich was good it was sparse on the meat. Had the Sal's pizza and wings both very good. We will be back.Unassuming business park location knocks it out of the park with competition style BBQ.  

You may ask yourself "What does competition style BBQ really mean?", you won't find ribs that fall off the bone, dainty plating or complex flavor profiles BUT what you will find is high grade meat, cooked to perfection with a down home side dishes and menu options using fresh alternatives.  This BBQ Joint brings a wicked burrito stuffed with beans, cheese and whatever kind of meat you want (Pork, Beer or Chicken) or go with the Midwest Monster, a BBQ sandwich piled high.  For those looking for more traditional BBQ fare, order the Pulled Pork or Brisket Sandwiches or just go with a half-rack of the killer pork ribs.

Ambiance in straight forward as the space is a converted business park location, but that doesn't mean it doesn't feel good.  Lots of BBQ posters, farm pictures and contest memorabilia let you know these guys take their food seriously.  Ample seating in the back room and the staff is friendly, knowledgeable and very approachable. Great value for the amount of food you get per order, but the best is buying bulk pounds either take-out or eat picnic style at your table.  Good mixture of POAF branded sauces which add another layer to the wonderful taste of fresh BBQ and quality meats..

Keep up the great work guys and gals!I've had lunch there twice this week.  The food was wonderful.  The best BBQ in Phoenix.  Matt, the catering manager was extremely helpful.  I couldn't recommend it more.When it comes to burgers I consider myself a professional critic. With comparison to Ho-Dad's in San Diego, Smashburger has won the competition! Their food is delicious and the customer service that goes along with it is nothing less in comparison. The cashier who took my order was very helpful in helping me decide what I wanted (by the way, the Sin City Burger is the way to go). Then she even brought it out to my table! To my surprise, after my meal she even cleaned my table! What customer service! Ally is definitely the person you want taking care of you, and let me tell you, I took care of her as well with a gracious tip! Remember to tip your waiter!I've read some of the other reviews on here for this place, and I'm wondering if there's a possiblity that they were either at a different place all together or simply on crack! I Love Yogurt is a fun place for couples, families, friends, and even those rolling solo. The interior is like a blast from the past. I feel like a kid everytime I walk in! The yogurt is so good, and there are always new flavors to try. I've actually done some birthday shopping there. They have cute 80's toys and memorablia. Besides the awesome atmosphere, totally rockin' merchandise, and delicious yogurt, I love the staff. My favorite guy is one of the owners! He always has a smile on his face and a joke to tell! I always go in after work around 10pm and I stay til closing. Basically, the bottom line is that you have got to go to I Love Yogurt every chance you get! And don't forget to check out the bathroom... even if you don't have to go!!The breakfast is just stunning! The place is a little hidden which gives it a v.i.p.  feeling. The eggs Benedict and biscuits and gravy are absolutely to die for!This place is small, only a few tables and it's in a dive bar where people are allowed to smoke.  I've only been during the week for work lunches so no beers with my pizza:(the poutine was really rich and filling.  The largest size pizza on the menu is baked in a restaurant baking sheet - if you've worked in a restaurant you understand. It's a HUGE - way more than 4 people could eat. Guineas pie and chicken wing dip were awesome!We were planning on hitting the Beijing Noodle Cafe tonight, but sadly they are closed, so that will have to wait for another day. A quick check of Yelp showed us this place, well always being up for a new restaurant and just down the road it was a good substitute.

When it comes to Thai food I base everything against Lotus Of Siam, a fantastic restaurant, except that unless you have reservations you will be lucky to get a seat.


Anyways, the food.

Very very good, as anyone who has read my reviews knows, simple food done right will always win, it just amazes me how many places manage to mess up simple foods.

For the record.

Chicken Satay, the second best I have had, only beaten by those made by a Thai lady that used to work for me.

Chicken Pad Thai, a dish that should be great, but it seems to be murdered by a lot of places we eat at, tonight's was perfect.

We also had the Mongolian beef, now, for those used to the typical Chinese restaurant way of cooking it, you would probably wonder what had be brought out to your table, I certainly did, but I have to say, it was fantastic, the beef was succulent, the taste far out shown the presentation.

Lastly we had the Crispy pork with broccoli, to be honest, my wife snuck this in while I went to the restroom and I was not expecting much when it came to the table. However, while not may favorite dish of the night (that would be the Pad Thai) it was certainly a nice dish.

The service was outstanding, something I would expect from a way higher price range than this, both servers were on their A game tonight.

So would I recommend Stick E Rice ? Hell yes, we were no sooner out of the parking lot than I was on the phone setting up dinner with friends for later this week.

I should also add, other users have commented on the music, during the dinner my wife and I were guessing at the original artists being covered, I never in my life thought I would here Pet Shop Boys "Suburbia" being covered, in a jazz way...But it sounded great.I love ther v6 on meun -!!This is our go-to for delicious Pho. Totally affordable & quality is amazing. Not to mention, whether it be to-go or dine, the staff is always very efficient. Only downside is this location isn't open as late as some of it's competitors around the area.WOW  My family and I ate here in August . I had a classic Cheese burger it was done to perfection!!!!  the fries were awesome also. My mom had the Cob Burger salad which was HUGE she wound up taking the rest up to the room.
My dad had a burger also and a Pina Coloda shake which was to die for!!. 
The theme was fun ! I loved the celing Lamp Shades!!!
Looking forward to eating here next year!!!!!I would recommend this company to any of my friends or family. Bruce Lombardi from Ace Relocation Services was the gentleman who sold us our move with Atlas Van Lines.  I had quotes from 3 different relocation services and I chose to go with you because of Bruce. Bruce did an excellent job in thoroughly conveying the integrity of his company and painted a complete picture of how our move would work.  When you take the extra time to make people feel comfortable and understand why their possessions are going to be safe with your company, that's where you win customer's business over the competitors.  Bruce always got back to me the same day when I had to leave messages and he was willing to help in any way he was able. When we needed more boxes, Bruce actually took the time to pick up boxes in his own vehicle and deliver them out to our house in Chandler, AZ personally, TWICE.  More over, Dwight (The Truck Driver) was a reliable pleasure to deal with and the packers were helpful and respectful. Dwight picked up our things on a Thursday in AZ and delivered to our new house in Houston, TX on the following Monday (always on time).  All in all I would have to say everyone did a great job. Thank you for making this part of our move pain free.  

D NArran Aromatics were born from attractively humble circumstances. Choosing to start the family business from their home on the beautiful Isle of Arran, they have made their own alluring scents and salts for years using the natural resources available to them on the island.

The talented family have evidently brewed up magic potions, as their business has expanded out into their very prestigious shops in the upmarket areas of Glasgow, and here on George Street.

Selling many ranges, from face scrubs and creams to candles, this place is perfect if your skin is in need of pampering, or if you're wanting to pamper a special someone with a lovely present. They do a range of gift sets for £20 which include everything you need for a night in immersed in a warm bath.

Their candles are all very naturally scented and contained in glass holders. Some of the aromas range from refreshing, gentle lavender to zesty citrus and a spicy, comforting ginger.

The staff are very friendly and know their range. They look like they are very well taken care of, which is the overall impression I get from this homegrown business - they want to take care of you! It's a tad more expensive than high street stores, but who wants a chemical filled body lotion when you can splash out on something invigorating from Arran Aromatics? Absolutely lovely and a breath of fresh air.Ahhhhhmeric's! I LOVE the bean & cheese burrito both America's & Terry's way!!! Also, the el pastor taco is a sure win! Not sure what else pastor is? Oh man, slow cooked marinated pork & they put slivered pineapple on top! Great chips & salsa! I usually get the mild salsa but I'm sure the spicy is delicious too! The food is always great! Fan for life! I find that it's a great place to pick up to go, but a nice enough casual dine in spot too! If you haven't tried it, you must! Plus, it's local! Yay!Thank you Yelpers for this great little find. I was out there to run the PF Changs RnR and was over by the hoity-toity mall but none of the nearby restaurants were appealing. Opened up Yelp and came across this little nearby gem. Directions were super easy to get to. From the outside this place looks completely questionable. I thought at first that there must have been a mistake but once you open the doors and step in...AHHHmazing!

We were greeted right away by a friendly lady who actually didn't "work" there but was there to help out. She continually stopped by to see how we were doing and compared notes on our items. The table next to us were friends with our waiter, which was slightly annoying as they were young college kids that kept interrupting while we were talking with him, but this is definitely a family owned business.

The decor is rich and luxurious without being overpowering and the same applies to the food from the calamari to the pasta with mushrooms and my daughters ravioli. The crostini was divine and the cannoli (which was a fresh batch) left me speechless. The college boys next to us got the calzones....Oh.Em.Gee....HUGE and looked so good. 

Go to Gaspers, you won't go wrong. The service was not "slow" but it's the Italian way...enjoy your time dining, enjoy the company, enjoy the experience, and drink it all in as you sip on a glass of wine. We were there for maybe a bit longer but it was worth it, it's not Olive Garden, and thank goodness it's not. Thank you Gasper's for leaving a lasting impression of Phoenix. Would love to see a location in San Diego....just saying ;)I'm giving a revised 5 stars to Firefly, not based upon the merits of a second visit (we haven't been back), but because of the stellar customer service provided by the manager in a recent series of emails and phone calls.

I was delighted and surprised that the manager (Dave) read and responded to my less than positive review.  We had the most amazing conversation wherein we shared our thoughts and views about customer service, expectations of customers and how he trains his staff to deliver the best experience possible.

It was very clear to me that he is committed to not only the restaurant and his employees, but to providing an outstanding experience to every guest.

He extended a very warm invitation to visit again, which we plan to do.  Although Vegas is not only our schedule for 'weekend flings', we'll definitely be back to enjoy a meal and I'm confident I'll be able to post a much more positive and happy YELP!

Marcy.The food was amazing. My sister took me out for dinner and at first we did not know where to go. She suggested Firefly and I had no clue what it was so I decided to give it a try. When we arrived it was full of people. The wait wasn't long but I was sure this place will be worth it.  The service and people were great. They got everything delivered in no time. The chicken salad was definitely something I would get again. I would recommend this restaurant to kids and families.BEST HAPPY HOUR in the Valley no questions asked.  Their food is fresh and unique (buffalo chicken bites and fried pickles) and their drinks are tasty (hello white sangria) and reasonable.  Their brunch is delicious.  I see people give it mixed reviews, but I have no idea why.  All you can eat, made to order.  Their cheesecake is the best I've ever had.  The menu literally has something for everyone.  Their upstairs game room/ large group area is fun and very comfortable.  Our company had our Christmas party there and it was a huge success.  And last Thanksgiving we picked up a family meal from there and it was phenomenal.  And honestly not much more than I would of spent slaving away.   As for the staff.  I have been dozens of times and no matter where I sit (bar, main room or upstairs) they have always been attentive and personal.  And finally, the owner/manager Jeff gives you faith that there are still people that own businesses that take pride in what they do.I saw them being reviewed by one of the morning news channels when they first opened.  The sample dishes they showed looked amazing!  I took my daughter with me to give it a shot and we were so very pleasantly surprised.  Excellent food, great service.  Yum!  We have since turned many people on to this place and they are all hooked as well.  I make it here pretty regularly!  The house special chicken is fantastic...all white meat!  Mongolian Beef....yummy!  Winny (one of the sweet waitresses) made me something special once...beef...tons of crisp veggies...a little spicy, it was sooooo good!Just switched from overpriced Verizon to T-Mobile and so far it's been awesone. 

The staff at this location are super helpful and nice. 

Kevin is amazing and helped us with what could have been a total nightmare situation with a new phone that was defective. He helped us get a replacement instantly without any hassle. What a relief. 

I will be recommending this store to everyone. If you are looking for a new phone or service, give these guys a try.

T-Mobile coverage in Vegas has so far been excellent and the speeds are better than Verizon.It was fairly easy to get our license here- we did this the night before, after a pre-wedding party that we hosted at our home. It was late (convenient closing time is midnight) but there were a few others doing the same thing. The line wasn't too long- maybe seven other couples. We were probably in and out in roughly 40 minutes. Parking was very easy. I don't remember if if it was free. There are several people handing flyers outside for those who haven't yet planned the wedding details.We had service this morning on our 5-6 yo Maytag washer. We looked around for reviews on Kudzu and Yelp before calling anyone. Wright's appliance had exceptional reviews and we were not disappointed. All we're looking for is somebody who can do the job right without gouging. Unfortunately, our machine is beyond repair with bad bearings, but I appreciate hearing that rather than spending the price of a new washer on fixing the old. That is good business ethics and we will definitely call Wright's again when we need something repaired.great thai fusion cuisine. very inventive and flavorful. great atmosphere and friendly service. definitely worth trying.This place is a hidden gem. I have seen this place while driving by so many times and the sign was just intriguing right off the bat - Thai * Tapas * Wine.... 3 of my favorite things!! Well how stupid am I for waiting so long to try it? This place was SOOOOO good. It was unique, very small dining room, cozy feel... We tried everything that was recommended to us for our first time and we were not disappointed. We did the chicken skewers with the peanut sauce, salmon avocado curry (which I wasn't too keen on from the description, but once I actually tried it I was so thankful I listened), we did the world famous spinach salad.... Not a salad at all, but the sauce was to die for. I checked in on Yelp to receive a free sangria... DELICIOUS and beautiful presentation! This place is a MUST GO TO! Recommending you make a reservation because we showed up at 5:30 and we were the only ones in the dining room - but 30 minutes to an hour later there wasn't a table available!! LOVE this place.While I was visiting Madison this past weekend, my lady and I found ourselves inside a sexy restaurant called Francesca's Al Lago.  The lights were low, but not so low you get lost on the way to the bar.  We started off at the bar eating sensual appetizers and drinking exceptional martinis.  They even gave me extra maraschino cherries so I could arouse my girl by showing her how I can tie the stems in knots with my tongue.  WINK!  We then migrated to a table where we sampled various pastas and fed each other bites of each other's meals.  The Faggotara pasta was so good I popped a bonedaddy under the table.  I must admit I got a little loaded thanks to the sexy bartenders, but it only fueled a garlic-filled love fest later that night.  I highly recommend this restaurant.  Chain restaurants are pretty lame, but the Madison offspring of the Chicago branches was both tantalizing and enchanting.  I'm used to classy NYC dining establishments, but this joint had me all hot and bothered!If I lived near this place, I'd be a diabetic. I'd probably eat dessert and maybe I'd have room for a healthy meal I'd be a happy, smiling,yelping  and sweet toothed dude!  But my doc, the everlasting kill joy, told me "Everything in moderation."  Exept here the stuff is so good, I'd eat this stuff in moderation times 2..

Everytime I visit relatives in Vegas, this is a must stop. This is the first time I've been here since they moved to this new building right across from the Cannery Casino right off the 1-15 on Craig Road.  The old location, while convenient for North Vegas customers near the Aliante Casino, supposedly had an unpredicable oven.  And that is as bad as a barbecue without fire or canoeing in shallow water.  So these new digs have reliable electricity for their ovens.  It's also bigger in the front area, so  they can offer a few places to sit down and eat a delicious lunch, such as their pizza, soda, and sandwhich combo for $6.00.  I love their Cuban Foccacio Pork Sandwhich. With a slice of ham and baked pork, some pickle and Swiss Cheese, it is grilled with butter so there is some sweet and sour, crunchy and soft, meaty, and nicely aromatic.  

But I came here for dessert.  As usual,a I had the bright green lime cream tart, slice of flan, a very fresh fruit tart, and vanilla cake with frosting.  Yet, even better than the dessert might be the Cuban bread.  People drive from miles around to have this lightly sweet, soft dough and crisp french bread.  If you heat the loaf before slicing it, the subtle flavors come through and the crust gets crisper. The loaves are big, and only  two bucks plus change for a loaf.

The staff is friendly, and service is good.  You might have to wait for a sandwhich, so be patient. They supposedly make awesome cakes, too.Love how they use local ingredients.

Was a little disappointed in the House Pickles. Was somewhat mild in flavors more so in the kimchee. The Pork buns were mouth watering. Soft bun, crisp/juicy meat and condiments made it come together. The mac and cheese my look small but it is filling. The Bibimbap was excellent with the crisp rice, spicy gochujang and you can't go wrong with a sunny side egg on top.There are 3 large fenced in areas for small me and dium and large dogs! My dog loves being able to explore while I sit in the shade under the canopy!We take our dog Dakota there every weekend and sometimes during the week. The best time to go is early morning when other dogs are there to play! You will see the same people and dogs routinely which is also a plus. Very clean too! Highly recommend for those who live close by!Last night's Friday Night Lights show was way more than we expected. GREAT fun with local talent on stage. Made us feel like we were watching Last Comic Standing. As always... HH you always bring home!! The place was packed and great entertainment!! Flip Schultz..hilarious!!! Until next time!A gem of a restaurant with great service and delicious food well presented. Very reasonable prices too. Definitely one to go back to, especially with the great St Vincent pub round the corner too!I was returning some excess stuff to home depot when I saw a sign that said 'Chicken Strips' -- i thought to myself, chicken strips, all the place does, it better be good. And good for me i felt like chicken so I dropped in to order me some chicken. 

As the name says - baked, fried, grilled. Its simple and simply delicious. I ordered two combos, a baked chicken with baked mac and a grilled chicken with french fries. 

I talked to a cat named Jin and he explained the rundown and history of the joint and talked until the food arrived. The staff is friendly, the place is clean and the food is tasty. 

Each combo comes with a drink and bread, the bread is very tasty and their selection of sauces is very good. I went for the BFG sauce and the wasabi cream sauce while the other combo had bbq and honey mustard.

Everything was tasty, it was cheap, and run by friendly folks. Something is quirky about their logo but it got me to go in.If you haven't already visited BFG chicken strips, you really have no idea what you're missing.

The fried chicken strips with the baked mac & cheese are absolutely awesome. I highly recommend the wasabi cream sauce as well as the sweet chili sauce.

This place is a great example of having a great product with great service.  Over the past 5 days I've been here 3 times and both the food and the service are consistently awesome. I'm sure Jin knows how this combination of great food and great service contributes to his business.  Although Jin first told me to close my eyes and the chicken strips would taste like passionfruit, marshmallows and masago, I was pleasantly surprised how good it all was.  The fried chicken strips are crispy and juicy and cooked to order and the baked mac & cheese is really creamy and delicious.  

BFG Chicken Strips may be a little hard to find as there is no street signage but it definitely worth looking for!  It's just south of the Home Depot on Rainbow between Alta and Charleston.  Drop in and say "Hi!".Why has it taking me SO long too get me some BFG? Thankfully I cam say finally got me some. Sure so many reviews not sure much more could add but think every great establishment can always use another great review! It all starts with the customer service and the personnel touch both co owners show from the minute you walk into BFG. It was my first visit so looking at the menu little confusing but he did awesome job of explaining everything too me. Very clear, friendly, and understanding manner. Each step you get choice way chicken cooked, different sauces (thinking just get one; my surprise get two choices!!!), and the sides. Not just one option but few options on the sauces and sides. If get the combo comes with garlic bread. I needed too add honesty earlier because I was looking too try as much things being my first time. He told me comes with the garlic bread since going too order one on the side. Little things or sense of personnel touch gets lost in restaurants. They have stamp card too. Woot! Woot! More reason too keep coming back for more.

The chicken strips LOVE the breading anything with panko winnah. It such cleaner breading for any protein, just lighter and crisper breading outside. The meat is perfectly cooked, moist, and juicy on the inside. The sauces Wow so many too choose from need too got back try more. I had the honey mustard and the BFG. I fan of both. The sides looking at other customers going fries but it looked too good pass up. I was not disappointed. You would think fast food type of chain thinking mac and cheese. Not sure. The mac and cheese was da bomb. It was rich with the cheddar flavor, creamy, the pasta cooked al dente, and the cheese melted top it off was just perfect topping. All this for under ten dollar if that not steal of deal not sure what else there is in life. 

I went for lunch talk about packed. I had too wait too get place too sit down. It soooo worth the wait. They have couple tables on the outside too. I really like the artwork on the side once you walk in. It has personality of its own cartoonist style but on point too the theme of the restaurant. If never been too BFG or enjoy fried chicken strip must stop in Vegas.I feel blessed to have found this facility many years ago.  They have become my preferred provider because Dr. Brooks, his PA Justin Ehmke, and the entire staff consistently exhibit the highest level of compassion and care for me. After each visit I am completely satisfied and confident that I received an accurate diagnosis and only necessary and appropriate treatments.  I passionately recommend them to my family, friends, neighbors, and coworkers. They are much more than an Urgent Care facility. They become true partners in improving your health and well being.This is by far the BEST Chipotle location ever. I go here often. The staff are always friendly. They talk and carry conversations with me every time. This location is quick and clean. I could not ask for a better location!!!I was a little weary of this place after trying Max Brenner's in NY, which I thought was tad overrated. But dining at the Vegas location did NOT disappoint!

The entrees are a bit pricey (be prepared to spend at least $14 on a sandwich) but they are large and generous with the helpings, plus the food display is pretty and the ambiance only adds to the feeling of a rich and luxurious dining experience.

I shared a Bacon Avocado Lettuce Tomato sandwich with a friend and it was completely savory with enormous hunks of avocado and bacon. Plus the seasoned criss-cut fries and dip were equally deeelectable.

Our waitress was the sweetest woman ever; she was incredibly friendly and attentive to our huge party of fourteen, graciously taking care of the most customary services like water and napkins. She even encouraged us to share dishes that we wanted to order (who does that these days?!). When we decided not to order a dessert, she told us to go down to the chocolate shop and get free samples. Someone give her the Employee of the Month plaque, please. 

Don't wait for your trip to NY if you can try Max Brenner in Vegas! Better service and better food to be had here!I have eaten her many times over the years and it never disappoints. Vegas or New York locations are awesome, of course New York wins because well it's New York. 

As far as food the Chubby Turkey club is my go to. Deserts in order 1) Hazel nut crepe 2) Melting Chocolate Heart 3) Banana split waffle.  

Also anything served in a hug mug is a must. My go to is the dark chocolate mocha latte.Came to eat here with my kids the other day, I am very critical of my Thai food since I have been to Thailand and have alot of Thai friends who cook authentic meals for me. Heard really good things about this place from coworkers so I figured I would try it out. I drove pretty far to check out this restaurant since I live on the opposite side of town but it was well worth it. It was a Saturday and I was greeted right away which is always a plus, we sat by the fish tank, it kept the kids occupied for awhile. I ordered the papaya salad, tom yum soup, pad see ewe , and bbq pork. The papaya salad was good but a little too sweet for my taste. Tom yum soup was delicious as well as the bbq pork. My kids liked the pad see ewe but to me it was just ok. I would actually only rate the food 3 1/2 stars but the reason it got 5 was the service was great. Our waiter was very nice and attentive, and he was able to comply to all my special requests (since my kids are picky). it usually is hard to find really good service in Asian restaurants because they usually hire people with no personalities and don't speak that much, and I was happy to have a waiter that could not only conversate and make me laugh but more importantly make my kids happy. It always makes life easier when they know how to handle kids and keep them happy so it makes it easier to enjoy my meal. Definitely will come back and bring my friends, hopefully my expectations will proceed me.I have referred Jill to most of my family and friends. She is awesome at what she does and has done her research!! No matter what issue I'm having, whether it be asthma or anxiety, ect, Jill has got a remedy for it!! Her massages are top notch and I can never get enough!! So usually I'll schedule a 90 min. session. I just recently purchased hour long massages for practically the whole family. I'm sure they'll also be very pleased! Personally, I've been seeing Jill for a few years now and I wouldn't switch up therapists for anyone else :) 
I would have checked in at her location yesterday, but for her safety I decided to bookmark this page, and write my review later...I love this little place, i hope the family who owns and operates it will prosper for a long timeAmazing carne asada fries! These are definitely the best carne asada fries I have ever had. There is a large selection of different tacos to pick from here and the service is super fast. My boyfriend and I found this little treasure when we were visiting Vegas with his family and everyone enjoyed it. 

I remember that it was scorching hot that day so I got a popsicle from the little mini freezer and it was so perfect! Definitely come visit this place on your next Vegas trip!Friendly service! Nice layout and presentation. We had a lil of this and that all of it was devine! 
Chocolate chip cookie-humungo! Soft with slightly crispy edges. 
Brownie crinkle-also big it was sweet,chocolatey and 
moist.
Sugar free dark chocolate raisin and almond drops-surprisingly tasty!
M&M/chocolate covered pretzel-yummy
Peanut butter cup-delicious.
Over all everything we had was amazing.Pulled pork sandwich is my favorite. It comes on a perfectly toasted soft bun with pickles and a side of your choice. It's so good I (little ole' me) devoured the whole thing and I guarantee it has 2 serving of pork on it. There's no messy sauce, just moist perfectly seasoned pork. 

Definitely a sports based restaurant with a big roomy bar. They improved the outdoor seating from the old place and it now has a great wrap around bar on the patio. Lots of TV's and great service, what more could you want for any game day?


In addition they have Happy Hour EVERYDAY from 5-7.  1/2 off appetizers and drink specials!Hands down the best gym in Las Vegas.  I started going here as a student, then as a staff member, now as an alumni (thanks to Scarlet and Gray credits).  The gym is beautiful, clean, state of the art and (best of all) never crowded. Some of my favorite areas are the cardio room with elliptical trainers and treadmills, the 2nd floor weight training circuit machines and the pool (which also has a really nice sauna).  

Everyone from students to faculty avail themselves of the facilities, so you don't feel too out of place if you're older, like me.  Oddly, for being on a college campus, it doesn't seem to have a meat-market kind of feel at all.

Parking can be a problem on campus - but I usually pay $1.00 at the fee box for an hour at the parking garage behind the gym.  I've never had a problem finding a space there after 5 pm. Plus you can watch some gorgeous sunsets that silhouette the Strip from the roof.I read this review below the other day about the dozen donuts being ordered through the drive-thru so I figured I would give it a try since I wanted to bring donuts to my office the other day. I waited in line since the store was super busy (inside and out!) and when I got to the speaker I told them I wanted to get one dozen donuts please. They asked if I wanted the express dozen and I said "no I want to pick them out and I know what i want". They said no problem and asked what I wanted!!! 

HMMMM this goes against everything that the last guy said but I figured I too would play along. I gave them my selection and pulled up to the window. I waited about 10 seconds and they handed me my dozen and the order was super successful! 

I told the girl that i "heard" they only offered the express dozen through the drive-thru. She responded that they used to but now they offer any selection of dozen donuts. I asked her why they did that in the first place and they said that Dunkin Donuts corporate is so concerned about the "Speed of Service" in the drive-thru that they wanted us to only offer the "express dozen" since it can be pre-packaged right out of the oven and wouldn't slow down the drive-thru line. She than said they had been fighting with DD corporate about this for a few weeks and finally won  the battle. 

So moral of the story is....DO NOT GIVE UP HOPE MY FRIEND! Fry's donuts or Safeway donuts are old and stale...nothing can compare to a fresh glazed or boston cream from DUNKIN!Quick serviceWait time is minimal, they're open earlier than my fav. coffee shop on the weekends and drinks are good. Even the drive through wait time is minimal, I've never waited more than a couple minutes in a 6 car line.As others have stated, Artie is a bona fide professional.  I was facing a calamity and he showed up late on a Friday without hesitation.  I loved the fact that he put on the booties and took great care in ensuring that he limited any mess during the removal of my reading chair (aka toilet.)  In the end, he didn't have the equipment necessary to complete the job, but he didn't charge me.  I have no doubt that if he had the equipment, he would have been able to help me.  Still, I will not hesitate to call him again when needed and neither should you.

**Tip 1** 

He's got some great plumbing stories, so just ask.

**Tip 2**

Check out his website.  His great joy is custom work, so if you are in the market for a bathroom remodel, he may be your guy.I very much enjoy the property. It's an awesome area. Very close to the freeway, close to downtown, old town and Arcadia. There's a Target, Costco, Frys and Ross nearby. 

I moved in here in Jan of this year and really like it. The grounds are kept very nicely. My area is nice and clean and so is the entire property and there's a very nice dog park that is kept clean! 

I love it here bc everyone is nice and the office is very helpful. Whenever I put in for a maintenance problem, it's fixed quickly!! Parking is great. The pool looks nice, I just haven't been.  It's a very nice area and I enjoy it here. I'll be here for a lot longer.Visiting a friend and came across this place after she INSISTED I come down here. I was reluctant at first, since I'm not really into anything beautified and fancy. I was also really worried that it would be insanely expensive. I was also worried I wouldn't like it and the trip would be a total waste of time.

Well, all of my worries were for not. I enjoyed the experience, probably too thoroughly. My friend assures me she doesn't go here all the time, but I know if I lived here, I would. 

The owner is great because she is really friendly and outgoing. She is very good at keeping her store well-run. She also has a wonderful eye for fashion. AND, despite my worst fears, there were actually items in the store that I could - you guessed it - afford!!!!  

Will I go back? That depends on if I ever visit PHX, Arizona again, but if so, I'll be the one dragging my friend to this place. Can't resist the urge to shop till I drop at this boutique....I picked up more clothes than I had room for and actually had to buy a second suitcase to bring them back!Thai Chili is a hidden gem in Gilbert. I have been to Thailand a few times and love the food honestly this is the most authentic I have found in the US and haven't had a bad meal here. 
Some of my favorites are the crispy chicken with plum sauce and the sticky rice.
Lets talk about the handmade coconut ice cream. Holy moley it is amazing. You cant not have a scoop made in house. When mango is in season the stickey rice with ice cream and mango, cant go wrong. Just try this place. You will just as in love as the rest f us.A++ service at Fendi. Respectable and friendly salesperson. Will definitely come backThis is my home church when I attend college in phoenix. I absolutely love it, the atmosphere and community really make you feel at home. Pastor Brian always has great messages. Check it out!fast and courteous service...called and Eli helped with a quick estimate...truly a professionalGreat blend variety if food. Cold beer. Great atmosphere and crowd. Great for an after work beer and dinner or just a bite to eat. Really a neighborhood and our family fav.I LOVE Blue Sky parking.  Once you are parked there is a shuttle right at your car ready to help load your bags which is far superior to having to drag your bags across the parking lot to get to a bus stop like at the airport.  They have a punch card so every 8th day is free which is a nice perk for someone who travels often.  If you book online and prepay it is a little cheaper.  I would strongly recommend Blue Sky to anyone having to park at the airport.When we lived closer we would frequent this bar all of the time.  Came in for my boyfriends birthday. They remember him of course.  Service was exceptional. Birthday shots all around.  Had a great time!Pork shoulder was amazing.  My wife loved the chicken and eggplant.  Serivice was great.  The squash blossoms were amazing and very unique.  This is my favorite of the three Batali and Bastianich places at this particular casino.Hands down the best customer service we have ever experienced. Every single person was knowledgable and if they didn't have the answer they found it immediately. Michael, Andrew,  and Cesar were awesome. Plus the food was amazing.Hello everyone, This is James aka DJ Rebel X of Paradise Nightclub.. I am writing to comment on Mike C.

I am really sorry you feel that way about my music, but i do play Gaga and madonna's music, but i must also play hip-hop and rap. Thats the job of a DJ to play to the crowd. I do what I can, thats why we take requests. If you felt like listening to Gaga or Madonna, come up and request it cause people that request music might not like either

I take my job very seriously and thank you for your opinion, but to write about the fact about the music I play is kinda messed up.

Paradise Nightclub music is high-energy dance, hip hop and dubstep..There is literally nothing more appealing than a warehouse full of trampolines, meaning Jump Street is probably one of the coolest places on the west side of the Valley. 

$10 gets you in for two hours on Tuesday/Thursdays, and you'll get your cardio workout for sure. They have a large area just for jumping, as well as, two smaller "arenas" for dodge ball. You haven't played real dodge ball until you've done Hollywood stunts on a trampoline to avoid getting hit. 

They have several "extra" attractions that cost a little more than the regular trampolines. It's all worth it if you go on the days that have cheaper pricing. There are also designated kids areas for smaller children to play without the possibility of getting hurt by a rambunctious high schooler. 

I love this place, and I'm not exactly a kid anymore either. In fact, when my better half and I visit this place we might just be the oldest people jumping. Jump Street offers serious fun to all age groups; check out their website for videos and special pricing.My two year old loves coming to Jumpstreet and his older cousins have a blast too.  I find it a good value for the amount of fun the kids have.Amazing service, steak, and price, need I say more?Great coffee, delicious and creative food.  Friendly staff and well decorated, provides a nice atmosphere.I try to visit here once every Friday in order to get my mid-afternoon/evening coffee fix.

I love how nice it is to have a Starbucks inside of Target, let alone have very nice and hard working individuals who are helpful!Great coffee.  Yummy food. Friendly staff.  Super quick.

What more could you ask for?Great Mexican food at a very reasonable price. Nice lady at the counter had all our food ready in less than 10 mins. Highly recommend!I've been here twice and have no complaints! In fact, I plan to go here again for my birthday! I think the idea for this cafe is great because it's a mix of Filipino, Hawaiian and American breakfasts. All they need is chicken and waffles and it's the perfect brunch place!

The first time, I ordered the chicken adobo fried rice and it was awesome. For those who don't know what chicken adobo is, it's a very popular Filipino dish. It's basically chicken cooked with soy sauce and vinegar. My friend ordered the red velvet pancakes and those were amazing! They taste as good as they look!

The second time I went, I had the spam scramble, which was pretty good. Nothing too special though. My friend ordered the Loco Moco, and we both had the white chocolate macadamia nut pancakes! Again, the pancakes were great!

The place does get crowded because it's not that big so expect a long wait especially on the weekends.These self-serve yogurt shops are a dime a dozen these days, and most offer a very comparable product. The thing that sets a business like this apart is the service. I have been to this shop maybe four times and have never been treated with anything other than kindness. The same man (owner) is always there and he is friendly and helpful. He recently gave me multiple stamps on my loyalty card for absolutely no reason, which was unnecessary, but showed how much he cares about his customers. The yogurt has always been good and unlike most of these yogurt shops, the chocolate is actually tasty. It is a small shop, but this only adds to the charm.I grew up on the east coast and have been eating steamed blue crabs every summer since I can remember.  The clue crabs here are flown straight from Maryland to their steamers.  The quality is the same as anything I have had on the east coast.  I have had steamed crabs, crab cakes, and the crab soup here and everything was top notch.  I would recommend dining there on Tuesdays as other reviewers have mentioned for $2 crabs and $2 beers.  This restaurant is a no frills seafood place with fresh food and friendly service.  For the seafood lover or anyone from Maryland nostalgic for the real thing, Crab Corner is the place to go.  If you prefer to have your crab feast at home, they are more than happy to sell you live crabs as well.My husband and I came here on his lunch break, and was greeted right away, the Manager walked up and I asked what I was thinking about  getting and I told him that I ALWAYS get the smokehouse sub but wanted to try something different! He suggested a sub and I told him I'll just stick to the same sub so he offered to split his sub w me just so I can try it.... Wow!!! Now that's how u keep a customer coming back!!  Not to mention everyone is super nice always happy and if u enjoy trying different hot sauces they have over 25 different sauces!!!!Best aloo gobi in town!I wasn't sure what to expect since Seasons 52 has only been open a month or two and was thinking the decor would be more urban loft. But we were very pleasantly surprised. The decor is gorgeous - wood and stone and the tables were placed far enough apart so that you weren't competing with your neighbor's conversation. The service was also excellent.

I had the wood roasted pork loin w/cremini mushrooms and it was cooked perfectly and delicious - the best pork loin I've ever had! My friend had the cedar plank salmon and she also said it was the best salmon she's ever had - and she orders salmon almost religiously whenever she goes out to eat. The mini desserts were amazing - so much taste and flavor in such a little package! I had the pecan pie and my friend had the carrot cake - both excellent.

Seasons 52 also has a very nice wine list with plenty of single glass choices - something that is hard to find in some restaurants. I had the St. Hallett's Gamekeeper's Reserve '08 and it was excellent!

I plan on going back in the very near future with additional friends in order to celebrate Christmas.

I am thrilled with Seasons 52!I'm surprised at some of the negative reviews I saw. I have always had exceptional service here. I like that you can be fairly casual or dressed up and still be very comfortable here. I also like the decor and smell of rich wood as you enter. I appreciate that the menu is healthy but you don't feel like you're missing out on anything. They offer some fantastic wine selections as well. Sorry to see some others didn't enjoy it. Hopefully they'll try it out again with a better experience.Had out of town guests and was planing a pizza; however, at the last minute, thought of Seasons 52 and glad we did!

It was 6ish; however, we were seated quickly and greeted by Alexandra, our server, promptly! She was wonderful!  great smile and helpful attitude throughout the dining event!

Our guests were rookies, so Alexandra explained the Seasons 52 program and carefully assisted a wine choice.

Dinner was amazing, served fast and it was hard top believe that each entree was only 475 calories... Great presentation, flavorful and "healthy"!

Drinks, appetizer, dinner and dessert were perfect!

THX!Always enjoy my meal at Seasons 52!  There are always innovative, unique dishes to choose from, and they never disappoint.  I especially love the flatbreads, the salmon dishes, the mushroom appetizer, and the scallops!  The menu is always changing with the season and in this case, change is never a bad thing. The wine selection is great but I tend to order cocktails here. I'm never disappointed!  On my last visit I had the grapefruit martini.. One of my favorite martinis ever! Great place for delicious food and drinks with a intimate, classy atmosphere without feeling stuffy or being ridiculously overpricedThe entire experience was nothing but TEN stars.  The menu was spot on for Arizona summers ... cool and lite. The food was excellent. The quinoa salad was superb. I can't wait to go back again and again trying something new off the menu each time.As a long standing resident of Arizona and a student going to college I have been to most every bar that is popular and on the up and up. Diverti is a great bar and has been open now for about 4 months and I am surprised at the service and the prices. We all know, especially college students, that no one wants to go out and just blow money on over priced alcohol. The drinks are very affordable and may even be the cheapest on mill ave. I have spent many nights there and have gotten away with spending just around 30 dollars and that's including food. The menu is very good and everything is on the normal to lower price ranges. The location is prime and there is an excellent area to park just behind the bar so you don't have to worry about all the traffic and bustle on mill. If you haven't been there in a while there has been two pool tables put in, and a couple dart boards along with some other stuff. There is also a smokers patio in the back with a nice view of the street. Diverti is both relaxing and fun depending on how you want your night to go. I recommend this bar before any other on Mill Ave, because of the good people, great atmosphere, and really good prices.Seven of us ladies went shopping at Patty's closet and ended up next door having all kinds of treatments done!  What a fantastic gem of a place!  We walked out with tans, waxed eybrows, Brazilian waxes, cupcakes, great conversation, candles, makeup, and most importantly feeling beautiful!!!  All the young women working there are simply magnificent...they know what they're doing and do it well!  Can't wait 'til our next trip out to Vegas where we now know where to be pampered!!!Amazing pizza.Biaggio's is easily my favorite pizza place in town. Biaggio, himself, is a big perk - he's too funny. Being that it's down the street from my gym (LVAC), the drive home is excruciatingly tempting. Alas, a sporadic treat every so often is a must. Anyways:

1. Pizza is flavorful, with a great crispy crust and a splendid balance of cheese and grease. Very east coast style. 
2. The giant meatball is amazeballs. Yes, ONE meatball is what I ordered. According to Biaggio, they use a secret recipe with different meats and spices. Well, let me tell you... it's glorious. 
3. Chicken wings are the best I've had in town. Somehow, they're juicy but not oily. They came out on a platter lined with paper, and the paper had no grease on it. 

The first time I went there, they said they delivered anywhere in town, but I'm not sure they do that anymore - I'd never expect them to. As nice as the idea is, it's too much to ask of anyone.

So yeah, a huge lunch. Well worth the added caloric intake! Again, Biaggio is a funny man and he's got really great grub. Prices are comparable to other pizza joints.Spoke with the owner and he offered to make it right.  The shirt washed clean so its all good.  As I said before, great place to get a shave.The ice cream, shakes and root beer float were all delicious. However the best part of the experience was the service!!! He was helpful, kind and extremely tolerant of the loud and crazy group of kids I brought in! He really could have been annoyed but instead he made the time so fun!!! Thank you so much!One of the best seafood buffet places I have been. They have good selection and of course very tasty food! 

Its an excellent place to go with friends and family! Thank you very much for great service!Wow I absolutely love this place. I have been here twice now, once a bit over a year ago and again last week for restaurant week. The food is amazing.

The item that I remember from my first visit that got me to come back was the bacon dipped chocolate s'mores. They are amazing i love the savory sweet combo of the bacon and the homemade marshmallows are fantastic. The peanut butter is also great and doesn't have that super creamy over processed taste that stuff like Skippy has.

To reverse course the meal started with the sausage and grits appetizer which was fantastic. Little bits of sun dried tomato mixed in made this a fantastic dish. The sausage had just the right amount of heat to pair perfectly with grits. The bread that we got was fantastic as well. The honey wheat was my favorite but the jalapeno cheese was really good too.

I also got the zucchini cakes which were phenomenal. I love fried zucchini and fresh and these were the best of both worlds. The flavors that were packed in while still keeping the taste of the zucchini was great. The aoili that it came with was really good as well. Pretty sure it was a cilantro lime but had some other flavors too, I think lemongrass was one I picked up.

The main course was the pork loin with baked beans and coleslaw. Our waiter, who was fantastic, strongly recommend this and I couldn't have been happier taking his suggestion. This was like the fanciest BBQ you could possibly have. It took classic BBQ flavors and paired it with a perfectly cooked chop. I am not a huge coleslaw fan but I ate every bite on this plate. Was a great blend of upscale cuisine and backyard BBQ. 

Overall it was a fantastic meal with great service and very good food. Can't wait to come back and try some more. Very happy to have been here and to have Beckett's table be my 100th yelp review.Beckett's Table is one of the very best restaruants in the city of Phoenix; need I say any more!I love this place. There time is prefect for parents that have a 9 to 5 job. Fast service as well, rather be here then umc urgent care & e.r. & doctor miller u are awesome thank you for taking good care of my daughters elbow!Not sure what some peeps are complaining about as far as customer service...I've never had anything but friendly,  top notch, and well informed people taking care of me. John Senior, and John Jr. are both quality people, and more importantly, know their way around a beer list. This is by far one of my top 3 favorite places to grab a beer. First it's always a great, dynamic selection...and two, the people (at  least John & John) know what they're serving you. They might not be vapid, 19 year old hostesses promoted to bartender by some horny over-aged manager, regardless of the fact that they don't know an ipa from a stout...but they're good people who know their product. You make the choice.We are addicted to the French baguette sandwiches -- the Parisian is so good!  They also have a location on Rainbow just north of Sahara, east side of the street called Camille.  If you love Manon, go to the Rainbow location if you're coming from Henderson and save some drive time.  The same great food!YUM!!!!  This is by FAR one of our families FAVORITE Chipotle stores.  The food here is always awesome and super fresh.  Now, I know everyone knows the food is spectacular and fresh, but what they may not realize is how great and friendly the staff is, especially Casey who helped us out this last time we were in.   Also, I have to admit that I hate waiting in line (since who can resist this place) so we always order online, drive to the store and walk straight to the counter and never have to wait.  Nothing better than an inexpensive, high quality meal with no clean up!  Thanks!Dined with a group recently in the urban barn. What a cool spot! First they had appetizers under there Carob tree that had this amazing setup of star studded lights. Then we moved into the barn for our three course dinner. I had the sweet potato soup with pancetta. Nice balance of flavors I was impressed. For my entree I tried the NY strip. Talk about a mouth watering piece of meat... It was delicious! I already made a reservation for next week to try the full menu. This place has great ambience and if they can handle a party of 50 that smoothly... I'm sure there Alacart service will be amazing.I'm from Cali here on vacay, heard about this place from some friends who live out here. Jon greeted us the second we walked thru the door and the staff was very quick, professional, and happy! The food was hands-down one of the best I've had in a long time and the place was cute and clean. The BBQ chicken, taro leaves, cantelope juice, and halo halo were my favs!!! One of the employees even stopped by our table to ask how our food was and if we needed anything. I will def b stopping by here every time I'm in town!!! Def a must GO!Sara has healing energetic hands. She massages from an intuitive healing place. You are surely going to be in complete bliss after her work.

You must try it to believe it!It's really cheap and fun.  I wish the zip line was longer, but very much worth it.  The actual wait in line can be misleading.  You wait in line to buy a ticket on the ground level, but once you take the elevator up to the platform there is another longer line to go on the zip line.  Just a heads up if you are in a rush.  

Keep your eyes closed so you won't be detained as a witness to the shady drug deals going on below.  Remember this is Freemont Street.  

Definitely a good time and will be back soon.I have been there many times. At first I wasn't a big fan as I used to regularly go to Cherry back in the day. I wasn't huge on the rock music at first. I like going to places that play rap/hip hop. Recently, the club has changed a lot where they are playing all hip hop, which is great.  Most places in Scottsdale or anywhere else don't play the music I like. Its a good environment to be in. While I certainly respect the opinions of others, I happen to like this place a lot as it is different from a lot of other places out there. Check it out and see for yourself.I love Jimmy John's. I love Jimmy John's so much I used to drive clear out to Baseline & Rural from my home in Downtown Phoenix just to get a tasty sandwich fix.

Guess what! I don't have to drive far at all now!

The newest Jimmy John's is open just eight blocks from my office in the Camelback corridor.  I've been waiting anxiously for this shop to open, and when I noticed today that it's up and running, I knew what I was having for lunch.

I took with me a co-worker who is a self-proclaimed sandwich lover.  We went around 11:30am ready to enjoy a tasty sub,  Upon entering, we were greeted enthusiastically by the ten or so people standing around and behind the counter.  It was a bit surprising, but not in a bad way.  You could tell the staff was trained to be friendly and welcoming to all who entered - each patron who came in after us was greeted the same way.

I knew what I wanted and ordered right away and my co-worker made her selection, as well.  As expected, I hadn't even finished filling my drink before my #16 Club Lulu (no mayo, add cheese) was ready.  We sat down with our sandwiches, ate, and talked about all of the different sandwiches they have available.

Jimmy John's never fails to meet my expectations.  The sandwiches are tasty and filling, the service is friendly, and fast, and it's a meal definitely worth every penny!One of the best places for lunch and dinner at the UW Plaza.

It has the feel of a nicer sit-down place and serves great food, but its never expensive and the food is just great. What's more, the owner is always very calm, smiling, and polite. I always feel welcome coming back.

They also have hookas for late night hangouts.

Recommendations:
- Meetpoint: (get the small for ~$7) The sauce is delicious
- Spiess sandwich - awesome for ~$7, I think the bread is home-made! So good.
- Good turkish coffee and baklava

Heads up:
- The service is sometimes slow for students in a rush
- The shows they have on their TVs dont always match an eating mood (one time they had Dirty Jobs playing)Great breakfast place.  Cozy, and fresh food!  Went there last week and it was great!This was my first time going to a hookah bar and it was really fun. Its a chill place and all the people are really nice. The flavors of tobacco they had were also amazing:)I didn't know about this place until a few weeks ago.

If the smell of fresh baked bread from Karl's Bakery next door doesn't do it for you,  maybe the sight of glorious cakes and pastries at the Baker's Daughter will. Take a look at the pictures that people have posted here on Yelp- it is a true representation of how amazing this place is. To top it off, the customer service here is great and I can all sorts of questions about baking techniques and the staff is happy to explain. At least I think they are.

I really love local businesses- especially family owned ones- and this place is no exception. Anytime I have family or friends visiting in town, I will be taking them here for a special treat. Or because it's Wednesday. Or whatever.There has never been a Five Guys I was not please with. Every location gives me the same great service, not to mention the excellent food. Any Five Guys I visit is always kept clean, doesnt smell like the average fast food joint and once again the customer service is awesome.. I cant express enough how much I love coming here. Its not a normal visit for me but I know when I do go in ill leave happy.My date and I chose to try this place out based solely on the name. (We did do a quick Yelp search to find out what the general atmosphere was - you never know with a name like The Spotted Donkey!) 

I immediately liked the place - the ambiance and warmth was inviting. It was definitely an older crowd, but that comes with the territory of North Scottsdale/McCormick Ranch. Because it's off the beaten path of trendier Scottsdale restaurants, there wasn't a wait - a breath of fresh air for me in Scottsdale dining. 

The jalapeno poppers were just the right amount of you-can-just-handle-it spice. (You can't feel guilty eating something doused in buttermilk when it literally makes you sweat.) My date ordered the beef tacos and I got the salad - the ingredients were brought out and mixed in front of me, how fun? The meal was satisfying, fresh and the portions were ample but not Applebee's sized. 

I'd love to bring my parents to The Spotted Donkey and would recommend it to anyone simply looking for a good meal in an upscale/casual environment.When you hear the word 99 cents Only what do you think?  Yeah another dollar store has come along.  This is what I certainly thought when this one moved into my area.  My first reaction was why would I bother going in there I have plenty of other dollar stores around me.  In other words if you seen one dollar store you have seen them all.  Boy was I wrong, after the store open I decided to just go check it out once.  I was stunned by what I found in it.  Yes, it has the typical dollar store items such as shampoo, and kids stuff.  But there was also a produce department a frozen food department, a can good department the likes of which no other dollar store could equal.  Then there was an over the counter drugs and personal needs area that once again put most other dollar stores to shame.  In other words, this was a dollar store that also had a drug store and a grocery store within it as well.  I can't say enough about 99 cents only, except if you have one in your area and you haven't gone into it because you think its just another dollar store, think again.  Visit it and you will be as pleasantly surprised as I was.  It has now become my favorite store, and I have saved so much on my grocery bill per month thanks to 99 cents only.Visited Carvers Steaks and Chops on Monday night for the first time.  YUMMIE!!!  Service was excellent, thank you Bernice and the Steak melts in your mouth!  The Calamari is delicious, seriously this was a treat.  You Eat with your Eyes and when the food arrived it is a visual delight.  Brilliant color, aroma and such flavor.  John, Leigha and myself give this a WOOHOO!  Thank you Todd Cunningham you ROCK!Highly recommended.  We had a failed AC unit.  Communication with their office as well as onsite service (thanks Mario) were prompt and professional.  Pricing was reasonable, no hard sales pitches, and equipment was of high quality (they sell primarily the Goodman brand - with an excellent warranty).  Would definitely use Authority HVAC again.I went in to get a flat tire fixed on my brother in-laws SUV.  I'm not sure where the tires were bought, when I went to pay for the repair they said, "No Charge!"  I was flabbergasted.....When my brother in-law got in town I told him about it and he went right back to the shop and bought 4 new tires from them and is very satisfied too.I was afraid I wouldn't like it.... just 5 choices for sandwiches. UGGH 

Holy Hell... 

First off the strip mall is decent. Nothing too bad nothing too great. The Bakery is clean in the places it should be. The seats could use some shampooing. 

The bread and pastries looked amazing. Check out all the wonderful choices. 

The sandwiches, while only a few, are perfectly crafted to maximize flavors and ingredients. 

I had the Italian, loaded with imported meats and cheese and fresh toppings served on a scratch made, fresh baked, french baguette. PERFECT 

@ 7.25 it seemed high until I received it. It is enough for two and the quality more then made up for the price. 

While the owners are quirky they are friendly. 

We will go back.This place is awesome. Every time I go in there the staff is pleasant the food is good and there is always a good game on. It would be cool if they had a full bar but hey can't complain. It nice because the kids can run around and it truly is like a pizza parlor. Get some video games and it takes me back to the old days. 

Salad bar is always good, pizza is amazing. 

The only advice would to maybe not charge for extra ranch and make the salad bar unlimited. Just a few suggestions. 

Keep up the great jobI emailed Honest Air through their website, and got a call back from Brandon, the owner, within a couple of hours.  He described the process, answered my questions, and gave me a price.  Since I have a smaller home with only a few vents, he told me I would most likely be charged his minimum rate.  We set up an appointment, but a few days before the appointment, my work scheduled changed and I had to re-schedule.  Brandon was very understanding and quickly re-scheduled me for the next week.  On the day of the appointment, Brandon was on-time and professional.  He counted the vents before he started and let me know what the price was going to be.  I have 6 ducts and the intake register.  Brandon was in and out of the house in a little over an hour.  The vents were clean, and he gave me an idea of their condition when he was done.  Overall, Brandon was super-responsive, didn't try to up-charge or sell me any thing, and I would highly recommend him.The market rocks. I go here almost every weekend for fresh produce to cook during the week. They are adding more every week. Love the specialty cooking salts. The hummus is great and the pita chips even better. My only knock is whoever runs the facebook page sends WWAAAAYYYYY too many posts. I'm borderline ready to hide them on FB.I had dinner there tonight.  I had the ribs which were absolutely awesome.  It comes dry and the sauce is a ginger base sauce on the side.  The ribs were falling off the bone and very moist.  The fried rice was awesome.  The waitress recommended a petite wine which was perfect.  But I have to comment on the service.  Five stars for service. They are really friendly and seem to enjoy being their and helping all of their guests.  Tonight they had a guy singing and playing a guitar.  Very good and suited the restaurant very well.Had dinner on Friday.  It was happy hour which meant that it was $2 off the appetizers.  We had the chicken lettuce wraps. They came with peanut sauce and sweet sauce on the side.  Very tasty and crunchy with cashew and noodles. Main dishes were Beef with Broccoli in Oyster Sauce.  The server asks you how spicy you want it and I said very spicy (to her this meant Thai Spicy)  The second dish was Chicken in Sweet and Sour sauce.  The Beef dish was spectacular in flavor and I ate all the broccoli (which I usually do not eat at all) because it was al dente (broccoli was not soggy or overcooked).  I really, really enjoyed it.  My companion liked the sweet and sour sauce but felt the chicken was overcooked.  I checked it out and agreed.  But the sauce was very good.  Our server Netty? came by often to check on how we were doing and how we liked our food.  She made sure our water glasses were kept full.  The water had cucumber slices in it which made it taste super refreshing.  We had a $10 coupon from the card deck that is sold in participating restaurants so we saved a few bucks.
The bottom line is that we finally found a Thai restaurant that we like and is open 7 days a week.  OOPS, forgot to tell you that there is a nice guy playing the guitar and trying to sing classic melodies.  It was a nice touch. Can't blame a guy for trying.First time to this theater last night and must say was impressed.   The seats are comfortable and place is clean and cool inside.  I will be going back for sure in future.I just had a construction/remodel clean up done by Arizona CleanPros (note, I had some trouble finding the Yelp account, there are a few folks using similar names, make sure you have the right one).

Team #3, Cecilia, visited my house.  I called the office and talked to Nancy (?) to schedule, and she was very straightforward, and suggested based on my square footage (I said 1700 sqft since there was some space I wouldn't have them clean) that a team of 3 would likely be on site for 3 to 4 hours.  Having used some miscellaneous housekeepers in the past (not a company) I thought that seemed too high of an estimate.  

Turns out Nancy was spot on, and it was definitely worth it.  Cecilia arrived at 8:30 with a team of 3 (granted about 30 minutes after scheduled, but at least Nancy called at about 8:15 to let me know they were on their way). She asked for an introduction to the house, which I admittedly did a pretty bad job at (my wife would have done a better job).  Nonetheless, they were amazingly thorough.  Without introduction, they ferreted out pretty much everything, figuring out where all the trashcans were, the linens, etc. etc.  

They spent a full 4 hours at my place, but the cleaning was incredibly thorough - there is lots of stuff in this house that has never been touched by a maid, and there was enough staining in the toilets and such that my meager attempts in the past (with a pumice stone) had me thinking they were destined for replacement.  Turning the water on and off in a 1953 house with a little galvanized piping still in the walls does that.  Everything this crew touched was sparkling - including the toilets, and including under the rim.  

More impressive, I had quite a bit of "junk" in the house - we're still moving back in from a storage trailer following the remodel, and there are boxes stacked up and piles of clothes being unpacked.  I had asked them to clean around this stuff and not worry about it, but it turns out they didn't want to leave the corners untouched.  They neatly moved and restacked all of this stuff, and there was no spot on the floor, nor on any countertop that was uncleaned.  Of course they hit all the windows and shutters and vacuumed the AC ducts, and all that good stuff.  Meanwhile, they also happily picked up a couple of other things I asked them to do - clean out the refrigerator and fold some clothes - and I'm not sure the inside of my refrigerator has ever been this sparkly.  Meanwhile, I didn't monitor these ladies or give them any input while they were cleaning - I was on conference calls the entire time.  Given the scope of work, the independent maids I've used couldn't have touched this cleaning in 12 man hours.  I'm impressed.  I'm not sure what the other teams are like, but team #3 is a keeper for me.this place is the best of the best of modern, macabre, alternative, dark, creepy, sexy, and beautifully put together in a wonderful little cove on 5th street, right off of Roosevelt. Perfect location. Friendly and passionate artists. Priceless art of all kinds. BUY BUY BUY!the food was amazing! staff great, good beer flights, very cheap for such high quality food. this is a tap haus done right! the BLT with salmon and avocado was awesome, but my wife's sherried oyster and mushroom soup stole the show and i don't like oysters.When in Vegas, there are a bunch of options for foot spa/reflexology.  Eric's Foot Spa offers the $20/hr foot spa but also offers $35 full body massage.  I went with the full body massage and I was very pleased with the results.  I called and spoke with Eric himself and he took me in 30 minutes later. 60 minutes later, I felt refreshed and relaxed.  The establishment is clean and relaxing and although much of the massage is done in a reclined seated position, the back massage portion (10-15 mins) is done in the prone position in which the chair reclines horizontally and you lay on your stomach. All in all, my friend who recommended this place to me was right. Great service for a great value! I highly recommend Eric!Hands down, best comic book store in town. It doesn't get any better than this.

The owners are awesome. They have always been incredibly welcoming from the first time we walked in the door. They make the time to chat about anything and everything--Doctor Who, X Men, Avengers, Star Wars, Star Trek... they are knowledgeable and they love to socialize. 

They have put comics into my hands that I never thought I would have liked, and they were right. And it was so sweet. 

The store is exactly what I want a place to be--comic shop meets coffee store meets gathering place meets gaming place meets Doctor Who Marathon movie theatre. It's got a cozy feeling without being too crowded. The couches are wicked comfortable; you can slouch down into one with a comic book in your hands, and the owners encourage such behavior. They also have a TV that often has tv episodes or movies playing, and a room in back for console gaming. And a great, industrial-batman themed bathroom. 

Their mini coffee shop sells chai, coffee, italian sodas, and other cold drinks. Also snacks. And they have wifi. You could literally (and I have been tempted) spend the entire day there, with tons of different activities planned. A lot like when you were a kid and had friends who went to daycare during the summer, and they got to go on a field trip every day. The weekends are kind of like that--adult fandom daycare. Sign me up.

They have Doctor Who Tuesday nights, where they show two episodes (new and classic or documentary of DW). They often have something (or multiple somethings) going on during the weekends. Today it was Yo-Yo demonstrations, then Pokemon, then gaming (I forget). 

They'll be at PHX Comic-con. They should be everywhere, all the time. 

Visit them and say hi, and ask about the new Star Trek movie, DW theories about Clara, or what they think about JJ Abrams doing Star Trek. Or the new Iron Man III. All of them will get you a long, spirited conversation. And I love it.This is our only grocery store. The prices are really good and for produce, much cheaper than other stores and such better quality! The meat section is also excellent and offers great cuts of lamb, chicken, pork, beef, turkey every day. I looked everywhere for ground chicken before finding it at Sprouts. The butchers will make any cuts you need. I even bring them whole chickens out of the case and ask them to quarter them or cube a leg of lamb, no problem. The fish is good and their weekly specials allow for some killer deals on things like Sockeye and Chinook salmon. I love the bulk section, too and get all our grains there. All the staff is wonderful and we are such regulars there that everyone knows us and always gives us a smile. 

Sandwiches at the deli are an amazing deal and do not scrimp on the ingredients so you can easily split a sandwich into two meals or split it with someone. They also will order things for you (Isreali cous-cous for me though I have seen them carrying it now regularly). Overall, this is the only grocery I frequent now and we've been coming here since they opened.So my laptop took a dive off my lap and onto the floor and as my luck usually is, the LCD shattered. I was in a panic because I use this particular laptop for work and my boss was going to likely come unglued at my unplanned vacation time. So, I called Desert. You will not be making a mistake if you do the same thing.

I first spoke with the ultra polite, Tony. He was as helpful as he could be, but needed me to talk to the fabulous get-it-done, Carl. So, I did. And, boy was I lucky to have found these guys.

I also needed another screen fixed (apparently I have a problem with this stuff), but it was just the glass and not the LCD. 

Spoke with Carl and he promised I'd have the broken LCD fixed by Wednesday (this was on a Sunday). I told him the second would just be a backup so no worries on getting that back at the same time. He told me that because I had two computers he'd give me a discount. Sweet!

Dropped them off in great hands and got a call from Carl on Tuesday saying that it would be Thursday instead of Wednesday. Naturally I melted down. Carl was on it saying he'd fix everything and he did! I had BOTH laptops back on Thursday good as new!

I love this place and am planning on taking all of my computers here!Fixed my iPad2 good as new worth every penny and they did it in the 3 hoursBy far the best barber shop I have found yet!! I live in peoria and travel to the other side of town, outta my way, to have them chop my mop.. highly advised the twins barber shop(s)This was an absolutely beautiful venue for the event I went to, one of my favorites: Wedding and reception. This place is pro grade and was very impressive. 
Not sure on how much the planning, catering, flowers, and photography are put on by the place, but it was superb and I loved it.My husband and I finally got to experience Cafe Bleu' today and it was so super fantastic that I cannot say enough.  We had 2 ice teas, Caesar salad, French onion soup, roasted chicken salad, hamburger and fries, and pumpkin creme brûlée for dessert. ( the creme brûlée was the best I have ever had. )    It was truly a fabulous lunch.   You get 3 courses for $10.00 per person!  The atmosphere is classy and quiet, plus you get to watch the chefs/students prepare your meals for you.  

The location is a little hard to find and the hours are very limited, but it is SO worth the effort.I love Moxie Girl!  As a single young professional, these ladies provide two of the best treats that a girl can get - TIME and a RESTFUL, RELAXING home.  With a busy and unpredictable work and travel schedule, I'm excited to have Moxie Girl come in once a month to do a more thorough cleaning than I'll ever be able to do.  

At the price of a couple days of Starbucks and a mani/pedi, this service fits right into my budget and the staff is friendly.  I love that they are able and willing to go the extra mile to think of the details and that they offer organizing, cleaning, and pet sitting help.  It's a one stop shop for all my household needs.The boyfriend & I decided to grab a bite here after checking out the local shops off of Roosevelt Row. We split a Jamburitto and I must say that it was *awesome*. The rice had great flavoring and the chicken was tender- but most of all the side of hot sauce was DAMN tasty, can't say I've had anything like it! 
And they sell xtra long neck (ie. mexican style) Coca Cola sodas :o 
Hellsyea I'm coming back!Best service, best deals, hands down my new favorite place. I've sold guns & ammo to them when times were hard & bought guns from them when times were good. I will be back!Best sushi I've ever had and the service was great too! Salmon sashimi is awesome. Been here many times. Was just here today but don't let me check in because I'm too far now.Great breakfast. Quality ingredients and good service. The Irishman is awesome.The Bikini Bar is freakin great! The bartenders were super friendly and drink prices are reasonable-$5 for Red Bull/vodkas! I love places where I can throw on a hoodie and some chucks and just kick it with my friends and not have to dress to impress. Super chill spot with all kinds of music playing and just a good vibe. I dig it. Plus they are going to be a new spot for local bands and Monday Night Football!!!! I will definitely be back again and again.Quality tiles for less. They have a large Selection and great prices. If you are purchasing a large amount of tiles, they will work on prices with you. The staff is Very friendly and helpful and are highly knowledgeable in what they are selling unlike other stores in the Madison area.This place is very impressive. High class, trendy, and really comfortable. It is double the price as regular theatres...but those are regular theatres. 
If you want, you can partake in additional services like ordering food or drinks while watching your movie or you can simply just go to enjoy the movie. 
I dont think all movies deserve the level of attention and class that is offered at this theatre but on special occassions or for special movies, definitely go. 
If you reserve online and become a memeber you get free benefits too. do it!Best service & casual dining in the Cosmo by far!!!!I am local and I still frequent here.  The only thing better than the burgers is the outstanding staff and the excellent beer selection. (I prefer Brother Thelonious) 

It is not too pricey either, especially since it is in the cosmopoliton.  I only have one suggestion to everyone:  TIP YOUR SERVER !Been here a couple times and it's a must if you're hankering for a burger. 

- Rising Sun: Kobe beef with a tempura avocado, genius. I ask for the teriyaki glaze on the side because it's too sweet for me and I also add a fried egg ($1). It's freaking awesome - just get it already. 
- Gold Standard: the aged goat cheddar cheese was too overpowering for me. It's good just not as good as Rising Sun.
- Korean Bullgogi: the kimchi was good. A little on the sweet side. 

Bottom line - just get The Rising Sun. I prefer the steak fries out of the shoestring fries, onion rings and steak fries but they're all really good. 

Shakes: don't make the mistake I did and get them to-go. You do not get as much as you would dining in and everyone knows the best part of a shake is that extra in the silver mixing cup. 
- Cereal: my favorite so far and I like the captain crunch. 
- Cow Float: pop rocks sounded cool. That's it - just a float. 
- Drunken Monkey: like eating a candy bar  if that's what you want. 

Overall, good burgers but at a price. If you were lucky and snagged a groupon, nice because after talking with the manager, it doesn't seem like they plan on doing it again.When it comes to burgers, this place is tops.  I have been going here for two years, and always have the best experiences.  Their appitizers are great too, love the fried pickles and the buffalo chicken dip.  The desserts are also outstanding.  I really like the spiked shakes too, but be careful, they do pack a punch sometimes.  Although the music is a little loud at night sometimes, it's a really fun, hip place to enjoy a beer and burger in Vegas.Came here for lunch after a morning in Cosmo's pool. I was wearing a two piece bathing suit and one of those beach shirts. Was told when my party was being seated that I couldn't be in there because I'm not wearing pants. WTF, it's Vegas...people walk around every where with a thong even. We looked at the workers and all the waitresses had to wear booty shorts and knee high socks. One of the waitress, a black chic, her shorts were so high that literally half her ass was showing. It was kind of disturbing. But I guess they were trying to keep it classy? Lol. So what did I do? I sat down and just put my purse on my thighs. No one noticed, problem solved.

Ordered a chicken caesar salad and meh, nothing great about it. The other person ordered the kobe beef burger and I had a few bites of that, it was DELICIOUS. One of the best kobe beef burgers I've had. The fries were pretty good too, asked to have it crispy though.

For 4 people, ordered two chicken caesar salads and 2 burgers, bill came out to be about $80. Best part, meal was comp'd. #WINComme Ca deserves more praise than it has received. Love the ambiance, presentation, and **everything** we ate was delicious! The outdoor patio view is stunning! Bone Marrow Appetizer...DO IT! One of my newly found favorite restaurants!! :)Absolutely outstanding! My friend and I were out doing a progressive dinner. We started at merchant. We didn't have reservations and it was a Saturday night. The staff was wonderful and found us a table. They also sat me without my friend, which many restaurants around the square will refuse to do. 

Mike was our server and he was beyond wonderful! Really knowledgeable. We were looking to try new things and he was great. He recommended the meat platter which was exceptional! We also had the warm olives. He also picked out drinks for us. I wish I could remember the names as they were excellent just like the rest of the meal. 

I was so impressed. The food, the drinks and the service were exceptional! We will return!!!I was eager to try this place after seeing Korean food in the menu. My husband had a sushi and I ordered a Korean dish called japche. They were both delicious! I am Korean and I can say that my dish tasted authentic- just how my mom made it!! The prices are great for how much food you get and the service was warm and welcoming. My only regret is that it is not closer to my house!!one of the best burgers in Vegas i've had!  Burgers are good, fries are good, shakes are good.  Open late too!2 words: WISCONSIN BUTTERY. I freaking love this place. The burgers are cheap and amazing. The shakes are awesome too. I normally get cookie dough, they have both kids size and regular. I always get a kids size shake because the regular size is huge. Everytime I come in, I never even look at the menu. The buttery is by far, hands down, the best burger ever. It's buttery! How can you go wrong with that?!?!Amazing service!! My frisco burger was super delicious.. Prices are also very reasonable!

Highly recommended! Its a mustThe best place in Vegas to get pretty!  Excellent customer service and fabulous make up. Ask for Valen she is the best. She is fast knowledgable and highly skilled. She has done my make up numerous times and I always leave looking amazing. She has helped me find the best products and colors for my skin type and how to highlight my best features.  I never go to Vegas without making time to stop by MAC Nordstrom. Its my favorite place to stock up on the latest MAC products and get professional advice from their artists.I like this hotel and the buffet is no exception.  The food is just as good as every other great vegas buffet that I have been too.  They cook the food fresh and try not to keep it out as long and they also have done something that I haven't really seen at other buffets, the individual servings.  This keeps for the food looking aesthetically pleasing rather than having someone else wanting to mix the whole tray before they can grab their little corner.  This can also help all the food stay warm without drying out as well.

Almost everything that I ate was delicious (and I tried everything).  I think the only items that I didn't like were the over achieving dishes with multiple flavors that were too much for my underdeveloped taste (Sure, sometimes I eat the finer things, but I still enjoy the occasional fast food type food).It was a great dinning experience hands down. My only question now is if they would live up to my expectations a second time around. I personaly wouldn't bring kids to this Buffet but I did see a few while i was there. Difinately for a more mature taste bud.best buffet in vegas, hands down.

dinner is better than lunch -- more selection.

enjoy!One of the most spectacular Buffets you can ever experience, even by Las Vegas standards.

I honestly don't think there was a dish that I didn't like, and I certainly tried to try them all.  Some items were standard-fare that were delicious without any particular twist to them, like the Korean BBQ short-ribs, but that doesn't earn you the coveted 5th star, it really was the unique items that did it for me.  Items like the Wicked mac-&-cheese and Wicked fried chicken have a unique, delicious twist to them. Here's a tip: if you see something that is served on its own little special container, try it!

And of course, the desserts, oh my god the DESSERTS!!! A magical medley of tiny-portioned gourmet cakes, souffles, pastries, fudges, cookies, and if that isn't enough they've got like 12 different flavors of gelato.I have been to this buffet twice, once for their Sunday champagne brunch (inexpensive bottomless mimosas??  Yes!) and once for dinner.  

First of all, I am in LOVE with The Cosmo; I went to the grand opening and it has one of my favorite bars (Vesper), not to mention it is gorgeous!  The Wicked Spoon is my current favorite buffet as well-- the food is AMAZING.  It is really hard not to over eat here because it all tastes so good and the layout is nice so that there really are no super crowded areas (at least there weren't any jam-ups while I was there).  Wine is reasonable for the Strip ($20/bottle for the house cab) and I loved all the little mini serving dishes.  

The service was standard for a Strip buffet (not the speediest) but our waitress was friendly and it IS a buffet....

If you're on the strip and debating whether or not to try out this place, DO IT!  You and your belly will be happy you did!Wicked Spoon can stand up to the best buffets in Vegas.  A long-time fan of the Bellagio and Wynn buffets, I was worried Wicked Spoon was all flash and no substance.  I couldn't have been more wrong.

Small plates are all the rave at Wicked Spoon.  Creative showmanship, like tiny fry baskets with chicken wings, make for a fun presentation and ensure you aren't over-eating.  Plan on making several trips so you can truly get a taste for every item. The atmosphere is fun and fresh, the exact opposite of your typical feeding frenzy buffet.  

I had the brunch buffet, with fresh squeezed OJ, exceptional french toast, and bottomless bloody mary drinks.  I made my way through mouth watering short ribs and homemade sausages, and enjoyed an impressive spread.  Usually I skip the dessert items (or end up being disappointed by the phoned-in offerings), but Wicked Spoon really delivers here.  Their gelato was smooth, creamy, and worth the wait in the small line (The line is what drew me - people waiting in line for ice cream at a buffet seemed out of the ordinary).

For brunch, there's no better place to spend your money in Vegas.  I'd still look for Bacchanal or Bellagio for dinner, but Wicked Spoon gets my 5 stars for Sunday Mornings in style!This is the best buffet u can find in Vegas! The decor phenomenal. The food is great and there's so much variety that you would not ever see in another buffet. This is a unique buffet that is worth the $42! I've been to several buffets in Vegas including the Wynn but wicked spoon was the best in my personal opinion.  Dessert section is wonderful. Great gelato choices.Has to be one of the best buffets I've ever been to. Fast service and high quality food. The dessert buffet is the best part!I love this buffet. I love the small plates of food. I have never been a person to go to buffet and load my plate with heaping spoonfuls of food just to take 1 bite of this and nibble of that. Waste really bothers me so when these nice buffets started this portion control I became a big fan of buffets. Lots of choices everyone leaves happy!We had breakfast at the wicked spoon included with our expedia booking. You can have breakfast from 8am to 3pm which is great especially if you enjoyed Vegas` nightlife the night before. The breakfast buffet was awesome! You can have everything here: French toast, chicken Wings, salat, icecream....Favorite lounge area in Vegas!  You are able to sit in the middle of a masterpiece.  The drink menu is unique.  I recommend the Verbena drink.  It's comes with a flower called a "buzz button."  I had never heard of it but it was worth the $12!  The staff is friendly and very willing to serve the guests.  I visited this place 3 out of my 4 days in Vegas.  

It's just simply breathtaking...I love shiny things and I want this in my room. Great vibe, comfortable setting amongst throngs of shining crystals. The live music is endearingly impressive and it attracts a finer yet hip crowd minus the annoying patrons of typical Vegas hot spots.Amazing place to come and have a low-ish key night; plenty of room on a Sunday night to grab seats. I highly recommend trying the specialty cocktails - they're a little pricey but are extremely well made and contain a surprising amount of liquor. The bartenders are very friendly and knowledgeable tooBest "Old Fashioned" ever. Great place to hang out all night. If you like the bar scene this is the place to come for sure. The bartenders are "Mixologists"!!I Can't rave about this place enough. I love coming here and hanging out and drinking great drinks that are made to perfection. If you come early you can get a lounge to sit at if you have a big party and start the night off. Place gets packed pretty fast. Occasionally they have live entertainment and the bands are always awesome. If you come to the Cosmopolitan you have to come to this bar for sure. Hope you enjoy!! Thanks for reading.I haven't had Hong Kong style pot pot since I lived in Manila, so I was so excited to hear about Tien Wong Hot Pot. It was delicious. It's also fun to eat as a family putting different foods into the broth. It's a great experience for a meal to share and talk. Very cute and chic ambiance. Professional and attentive service. I will go back again and again.I know the goal at Vegas was to have girls to buy us drinks... But dudes getting us drinks is a whole other level.  LMFAO!

This place was so crackin'  the guest list line had 300+ people waiting since 7pm!!?!?!?!?!!  So we bounced the go to XS for a quick minute to come back. 

We had so much fun the pictures we took I don't even remember taking... Hahaha!

Shouts out to the staff for letting us in for FREE and cutting the line at 1am!!Showed up during Memorial Day weekend and, Saturday, it was super packed! Didn't have the best experience on saturday because it was so crowded! But, came back on Monday and had the BEST time at party rock Monday with LMFAO! Free stuff (glasses, lights, inflated zebras/guitars, foam fingers, etc) was handed out to the girls and the bottle service tables! So crackin.. 

Definitely recommend mondays!! All locals say the same thing, mondays are the day to be at marquee & it was free!Stopped in at Marquee each time I've been in Vegas now. Located on the 2nd floor of the glitzy Cosmopolitan, through the center of the crystal chandelier, this club is just beautiful and classy!

There is always a long line for Marquee (even on a Monday night!), so lucky for us there were early-purchase tickets online ($10 for girls, $20 for guys) that helped us skip the line. Look around and work your magic to get into Marquee.

Three dance floors! Main Room playing electric/house, Library upstairs playing old school hip-hip/R&B, and the "Boom Box" across the way from the bar. Marquee is nice and roomy, bouncers make sure to never let any floor get too crowded... so that you and everyone else can actually enjoy themselves and dance! If things do get too hot, there's also a great patio outside with plenty of seating, an additional bar, more bathrooms, and a great view of the strip. Drinks are about $13-$14, average for Vegas... but the bartenders are super nice and attentive! Bathroom is clean and stocked with tons of goodies! Security, management, and escorts are very nice and respectful. Unlike a few other older clubs, Marquee definitely knows whats up!This is the number one spot in Vegas. I had the best time here. The library is where we were seated. We had our own bouncer for our table. Worth every benjamin!This is still one of the hottest club in LV.

We partied here during Super Bowl weekend. There were about 20 heads and we all pitched in to get a table, as the night goes on, we ranked up the bills on Champagne.   I really didn't know champagne was that expensive :))  I was already too drunk to mix my drinks at that time.

The DJ was pretty darn good, the dance floor was packed in like sardines,  the dancers were in football jerseys, quite entertaining,  and our servers kept our drinks cold and always filled. 

Great club, great music!! But way over our budget!!It's been my experience in Las Vegas that transplanted restaurants tend to be very overpriced and in a food-court setting. Even if the food is up to par with the original restaurants, it's quite easy for your dinner to be affected by the yelling at the craps table 5 feet away. Nonetheless, there are some gems in Vegas and I believe this is one of them. The service and food were fantastic. Because the restaurant receives fresh fish daily, your options will diminish the later you book a reservation. The anchioves, octopus, and lavarki all stand out. It's nice to have fish that's not bathed in marinade or overcooked. What you get here is simple, yet perfectly balanced fish.This is an amazing place for lunch! I have gone here three times and love it every single time. It is also one of the best priced gourmet lunches on-the-strip I have ever had. 

It is priced at 20.13. And there are a few items that can be upgraded. I usually choose their fish dishes... because they are so fresh and taste wonderful. I have also had their octopus (and it is well worth the upgrade charge). My dish was not heavy at all. Their portions are so well-sized. And to finish off lunch... get the greek yogurt! And have an espresso! It is one of the best in town.My favorite store on the planet! The staff at this location are very friendly & super helpful. It's hard to leave the store empty handed. Usually there is a sale rack so that lessens the blow because the clothes here don't come cheap.

I can't wait to come for a class on Sunday morning!Forget about other sub shops - Jersey Mike's is the BEST! They cut the meat and cheese fresh when you order your sub - everything is fresh and delicious every single time I go to Jersey Mike's! I read other reviews about it being expensive - here's the deal - you get what you pay for. Jersey Mike's has quality food and excellent service - well worth paying a little extra for! Tip: Get your sub and then let it sit in the fridge for a few hours - the flavors melt together and become even more amazing :)Get the Philly.Get the Philly. Get the Philly. Don't mess with the other mediocre subs. The cheesesteak is ridiculous and somehow the best in the valley.Best pizza I have ever had in life.I WANT PIZZAAA!!!!

I think I was craving pizza after using up all my energy at XS. My friends managed to find this AWESOME hidden gem at the cosmo. There are no signs for this pizza place but I was so drunk. I don't remember how we got there but I remember when I went inside I knew exactly what I wanted to order. MUSHROOM PIZZA! I think my bf told me I wanted to order a whole pizza. But I was so hungry..... I guess I forgot to add the word slice after pizza. So we ended up ordering two slices. for $10. Pricey! But GOOOOOD in my tummy...... 

It was soo good.. I came back for more on my last night in vegas... before going to Serendipity and clubbing for the night. I will definitely come back here each time I'm in Vegas now.. Best NY style pizzaaaa I've had. Well, maybe I'm hyping it up a little too much. But it was pretty bomb! :) I think I also kept calling it Pizzeria 'cause I didn't know the name of it and I was drunk. Oops hehe. Secret pizza, I love you. ^_^I love love love the secret pizza stop at Cosmopolitan. Nestled in a hallway at the Cosmoploitan reminds me of finding those little secret joints in New York.....so is this where they got their idea from.....cuz if so it's working....people lined up...the smell of the best darned pizza I've ever had, and the nicest staff a girl could ask for. I really did not think I would like it as I really have not found a good pizza joint in Las Vegas (well to my likeing anyway, and when it comes to food I'm a tough cookie). So off I go into this pizza culinary dream joint only to find that they have veggies...lots and lots of veggies (yup I'm a vegetarian). This is one reason I thought I may not like it.... The staff assured me that I can get almost any veggie known to man if I would wait a minute while they ran to room service to get the ones most people don't eat on a pizza. What a concept! Yes guys you can order pizza to your room after a long night at Marquee...just call room service and they will hook u up....Between the quaintness of the hidden pizza joint and being able to order it from room service I see a winner....now can we get a chain of these across the us PLZZZZZ??????I love pizza, I eat it about twice a week at least. Pizza when drunk is even better, and I was was wasted when I had this and it was probably one of the best drunk meals I've ever had!!!

I think I got a slice of the sausage/pepperoni and a slice of the supreme, both were phenomenal.  Amount of toppings is generous and the pizza slice was huge and greasy (good greasy).  

The wait can be a while after getting out of Marquee (30 min), but it's well worth the wait!!!!  It's on the 3rd floor of the Cosmo Casino  I don't even know you whoever you are reading this review, but I hope that you will get the chance to enjoy this miraculous pizza.  I can't wait to go back and get it again!!Great pizza after Fat Tuesday & Haze. I ordered the combination - very tasty & crust was perfect. I should've eaten there again before I left Vegas! Will definitely get a whole one next time...I will always remember Secret Pizza as the place where a prostitute stole my pizza. Well to be fair, it wasn't intentional. She was standing in line with her "John" right behind us and thought the slice they pushed out was hers instead of mine. She tried to offer to give it back to me, which was nice but I had to politely decline since I have no idea where her hand or mouth touching the pizza had recently been.

Judging by the crazy long line, Secret Pizza is probably the worst kept secret in Vegas. The establishment is located on the third floor and has an obscure entrance right in between 2 restaurants. It's not hard to spot because you just have to spot the crowd.

The pizzas are good but don't take my word for it. I was pretty inebriated and extremely starved when I consumed my slice. I just remembered really enjoying my new slice of veggie pizza that was not touched by any ladies of the night. The guy at the counter even gave me one free slice extra of pepperoni since I had to wait longer for mine.

If you want a whole pie, you can actually call it in and walk right up to the counter to pick it up. That should be handy if you're in a large group and are able to call in as you leave the club to head here.My boyfriend said "this is the best pizza he's ever had in his entire life" and I agree. It really is a secret... A waiter from a previous restaurant told us about it when we mentioned we were staying at the Cosmo. I had a vegetarian salad and it was extremely fresh. The guy at the register was super friendly and super cute which only made my experience here better:) you have to ask a security guard where it is exactly....I honestly felt cool knowing about this secret:):)Saturdays and Tuesdays are $1 Margarita days.
(Oh and the food is really good too.)I love olive oil. I would drink it if I wasn't worried about people judging me. And when I come here, I can drink it without strange stares! Outrageous Olive Oils and Vinegars I am convinced was created just for me and my love of all things olive oil. I have been in here twice now and I know that I will be back many times more. I found out about this place from groupon and also purchased a deal on living social. I have ended up with three bottles; basil oil, wild mushroom and sage oil, as well as the 18 year old balsamic.

The set up of this place is great. You walk in, and you are greeted by many hundreds of bottles of oils and vinegars and you can taste test to your hearts content. You pick up a little stack of cups and you can mix and match and taste till you find the olive oil and vinegar that was made for you. I could spend hours in here finding endless combinations of oil and vinegars, but then I would be broke because I would end up buying tons of bottles. If you don't have any idea what you are doing when you walk in here, the ladies who work here are more than willing to help you and suggest combinations as well as ideas of how to use all oils and vinegars. 

Olive oil is heart healthy, and what better place to make your heart happy than this!Great shanghai soup bun. It is the best in town. Just be careful of the hot yummy juices inside the bun. The hot and sour soup is by far the best in town.Fabulous chocolate and DIVINE gelato. I had the red raspberry (Dairy-free) gelato, which tasted so much like raspberries it was insane, with the deliciously dark and chocolatey black forest gelato. The two combined were just divine and creamy and delicious.

Their chocolate was equally delicious and the samples were lovely. Very dark, not bitter or dry, but deep and barely sweet and perfect. Huge variety to select from and good prices for a chocolate shop.The service here is friendly, and they have samples sometimes.  I have started buying loafs of their pastry bread to eat for breakfast. Everything I've bought here has been really fresh and delicious. They have also been well stocked when I've been in, and the store is really nice looking, as well as clean. I'm not sure about the price because I've never really bought bread from a bakery before. For the pastry loafs they are around 4 dollars. The singular pastry breads have been 1.25 I think.I love this dental office.  The staff is efficient, the technology and dental techniques are state of the art, and all of the procedures are explained prior to beginning treatment.  I have had a root canal, crowns, gum grafts, cleanings, and fillings replaced, all with precision and proper pain management. I believe my oral hygiene is the best it's ever been...and I'm pretty particular about my teeth.Truffled tater tots here are amazing.  And I'm not just saying that because I was drunk and it was some various hour of the early morning.  The tater tots came out piping hot and with a good truffle flavor. I just wish there had been more of them!Vegas baby Vegas! Been coming to vegas for years. I still love all the lights and the glow of Vegas night life. They are constantly changing things and its only getting better as the years pass ...Ive heard about it by a couple close friends and decided to check it out with a date. Beautiful patio on the canal/waterfront. American/southwest food influences. I had the short rib tacos and they were great.  Savory with a spicy black bean salsa mix.  We sat at the bar for the sunday brunch and, too our delight, endless mimossas and bloody marys for a mere $24 which includes any thing off the menu!   Bartenders John and Jason were attentive (my mimosa never went empty while I was drinking), energetic and funny.  Definately a regular sunday stomping grounds for the future!I drove by 2 breakfast joints on Scottsdale Rd on Sat. am and the wait was 25mins.  Then it dawned on me that The Herb Box was in Old Town.  YEAH!  We walked right in, we were seated.  What a great place, cozy and great patio and the food was great, as always!Alright, finally got to see what the carpet looked like after the grand opening which was so packed we could not even see the floor.  Very nice place for a date night and a cool bar to watch the big game and even the patio looked sharp.  Very upscale is a little of what we need over here in the west side and I refuse to knock it for the crazy grand opening.  We left after 10 minutes and ran up to Arrowhead Grill for dinner that night, but you cant fault a place for being to popular.  They can't help that they are so good!  

Anyway, we double dated with friends in the area and we started with the shrimp appetizer on top of rice, I am not a big fan of shrimp but it was pretty good, we also all ordered 1 tortilla with butter (which had a sweet flavor to it so it made it special).  I ordered the green chili chicken enchiladas......can I say heavenly?  Hell yes I can, this stuff was great!  The perfect amount of cilantro, sour cream, a tiny bit of spice, and just a great dish.  It was in a 10" low rim bowl with a side of white rice.  My wife and her girlfriend both ordered the 7 layer salad which I guess was good because they both cleaned their bowls as well.  My friend ordered the Argentinian steak....which I presume came from Argentina.  My buddy let me steal a bite and I will be coming back for that since it was darn good,  it had a fajita flavoring to it served with mashed potatoes.  The menu overall isn't to large....it had a few salads, sandwiches, appetizers, only a few entries like the steak and enchiladas and a couple of fish as well.  Then the bottom had a few options for their street tacos and then some desserts.  I am so pleased with this place and cant wait to return.  Once again a home run for Chef Charles!  Oh I forgot to mention our server was great, he had a sense of humor and did a great job and never left us dry.Rating for "Spa Journey Only" - In short, Cory, journey concierge, was amazing and this treatment is spectacular!!  I told Cory we should rename this treatment and call it the Post-Jet Treatment.   Fresh off a plane, I was in the treatment room within 45 minutes of getting to the hotel. :-)

Some quick notes:
- I typically get cold during body scrubs and wraps.  Nope, not here.  The room was warm, the ground was warm, and the stone was warm.   My body temperature consistently stayed warm throughout.
- Everything for the treatment is in one room: Steam Room, Room Temperature Jetted Tub, Ice Cold Water, Ice Cold Towels. And buckets and buckets of warm water :-)
- I think the water being thrown on my body was the best part of the treatment next to the way Cory was able to knead out the kinks in my back with a gentle hand.
- I don't have a gender preference for my therapists.  However, I did think twice before allowing a make therapist to apply a treatment to my body.  Well, again, Cory was the ultimate professional.   I can't have asked him to be more appropriate.  :-)

I consider myself to be an expert spa goer; so I always have material to compare to.   That being said, this was one of the best treatments I've ever had by one of the best therapists I've ever had.

Way to wind down from a few weeks of travel - I'll be back to see Cory in the future!I have always wanted to get permanent makeup, but could never decide on who to go to. After asking around and getting a lot of input from my friends I found Karla Kwist! I am SO happy that I did! I had my eyebrows and eyeliner done a week ago and I am so excited about the way I look and feel! Karla is such a wonder! She is so educated in the permanent makeup field. I knew right away I was in capable hands. Thank you, Karla, for the new me!I had a nagging side/back injury that persisted for months before Dr. Quan was recommended to me. Having never been to a chiropractor I wasn't sure what to think. I was amazed! Within a few visits I was feeling better, without medication, and now can't imagine what I would've done without her help. Dr. Quan really takes the time to get to know you and your injury, and then work with you to overcome it. The office is clean, the staff is friendly, and I actually look forward to my visit to the doctor. I highly recommend her.I've eaten here twice in the last two days because the food and service are amazing.These guys did a FANTASTIC job, and were sooo nice and accommodating.  They came to my place, during the weekend, which was very convenient.  They have excellent customer service, the warrantied tint looks GREAT, and the price was great!!!It might be premature after only one visit to give this place five stars but if it's not it's awful darn close to five stars as I couldn't find one darn thing wrong with our dinner or service we had here. The room is a bit on the dark side but it's crisp linen and shiny silverware. The menu goes from very casual with bar food to sandwiches to maybe about a half dozen dinners.

Upton entering we were greeted warmly and whisked to a table. Our server was very professional, explained the specials and was friendly. The cocktails we tried were good and also packed punch.

We started with a special appetizer of an all house made plate of Tasso that came with  mustard and pickles. Everything was excellent even the pickled okra and pickled watermelon rind.

My plate of Pacific Rock-fish with curry millet and stewed okra and tomatoes was delicious as well. The fish was fresh, seasoned and prepared well. The curry millet was a curry for curry lovers meaning full strength flavor and was an interesting healthy alternative grain to use. Bird seed just never tasted that good before. I sort of feared stewed okra because I have had it before and didn't enjoy it's texture but in this dish it was enjoyable and anybody would like it because it had a fresh crispness to it and picked up the delicious sweet flavor of the small tomatoes.

I was too busy with my plate to try my husband's Amaro Meatloaf but he said it was very good and also enjoyed the potatoes. he said, "they taste just like your potatoes" I take that as a compliment.

The waiter described a very refined adult style nut butter and boozy fruit sandwich as dessert that I wanted to try but unfortunately I was too busy with my plate to have room for it. 

Very very good  don't know if everything on menu is as good as what we tried but what we tried was excellent.Bacon-wrapped scallops with grits! Wow are they delicious as is the chopped salad. The scallop was tender and perfectly seared and the grits were heavenly and creamy.  Honestly I've never had a bad meal here, only downside is that it's a bit noisy. Highly recommend!Me and hubby decided to have a drink, sitting outside overlooking the pool. Ended up ordering a salad, filet and a lamb pasta dish. All were excellent and we enjoyed this place which we almost walked right by. It's a must do and we can't wait to go back.I love this church! Growing up Catholic I was believing that there was this checklist I needed to have in order to earn my way into Heaven. Redemption opened my eyes and my heart! Christ as my Savior and His grace is my road. The worship team is amazing and so lively! I feel Him during every worship. Pastor Tim is so inspiring, honest and endearing! The children's ministry leaves me in awe. My daughters love attending and learning about God's love. The staff really connects with the kids and helps them thrive in Him. If you haven't found a church to call home, you should make a visit to Redemption and your search will stop here!Great pricing and she does an amazing job!  Best place to go in Las Vegas.Place is great! Customer service is fantastic and my gf absolutely loves this place! She is always satisfied!Randi and her team are the best! She is kind, patient, and always made me feel like a top priorty. I highly recommend Next Door!Great shopping, with various restaurants for any palette.  Easy access from hotel and casino.  Family fun entertainment with a Greek Gods side show in the middle of shopping area.I think this is a great option for those of us who would otherwise not make it to the chiropractor as often as we should. It is affordable, fast and very convenient!The 22 course chef pairing was simply delicious. The entire staff executed Jose's interpretation of each meal to the utmost perfection in terms of texture, taste, visual appeasement, and for this dining experience. I thoroughly enjoyed the apple "brazo de gitano" and the maine lobster with citrus & jasmine. The dessert were equally tasty with my favorite the orange pith puree la serena. Recommend booking early.LOVE THIS PLACE!  Great food, great drinks, great ambiance and locally owned. I'll be back!Great lite fare.  Sandwiches, soups, and salads.  My personal favorite is the OMG (a sandwich with prosciutto,  marscapon, and figs.  We've tried several of the sandwich and been very happy with all of them.  

They have a full espresso bar and it the drinks are very good.  I used to own a coffee house, so I'm picky about my espresso.

Service has always been friendly to us and our two dogs who usually accompany us.  We have a Doberman that has excellent restaurant manners and a whippet puppy who has well puppy manners.  

If you come for dinner ask to be seated.  Yes even on the patio and despite the fact you didn't see the sign.  If you don't prepare to be scolded.  Keep perspective and smile.  They are just doing their best to keep everyone happy.  

I really enjoy this place and drop in whenever I'm in the area, which always seems to be with my dogs.I was so fortunate to have met Becky before I needed an attorney.  She has been so great with her advice during a very hard time in my life.  I would always recomend and trust her with my family, friends and strangers.Nice and newer Courtyard. Nowhere to eat in walking distance, but there's a mall nearby with tons of places. Probably the nicest of the Courtyards in the Phoenix area. I have stayed in quite a few of them too! They have a person singing and playing guitar near the bar area on certain nights which is a nice touch.Quaint European bakery with an old world feel.  We ordered a variety of pastries, lemon roll, almond twist, cherry strudel, chocolate croissant, cheese Danish, rum ball and chocolate coin - all were fresh and so good I'm sure they were baked with love.  Disappointed there was no seating to enjoy our coffee and goodies although it seemed there was adequate space to accommodate some small tables and a few chairs.  Also, the stiff coffee will put hair on your chest.  I give the German Bakery 5-stars in spite of the coffee and lack of seating because our pastries were perfect.Well my (now) ex-boyfriend is from Boston, so we came to Bambino's a lot. I just love pizza in general but Bambino's is oh-so-good and their hot wings are awesome. The staff are all very friendly and fun and actually get to know you instead of treating you like just another customer. Someday, Tony will remember my name but in the meantime, I will continue to come here (while my ex is at work). hehehe just kidding!WOW...another GREAT meal at Girmaldi's
We tend to end up here at least once a month when the craving for pizza is upon us.  Marla (manager) ALWAYS goes above and WAY beyond to make sure our visit will keep us coming back.  This trip was no different than every other one...!  The pizza is GREAT and they always get it 'right'.  
So the next time the pizza crave hits you....head to The Quarter to Grimaldi's and tell them Van sent you...See Marla and give her a GREAT BIG hug from me!
Prop's to Lucas for joining the management team headed by Brad!!!What's not to love, super easy carwash. Nice staff and very seldom have anything not work perfectly. You drive through a tunnel yourself then you dry if you'd like after, "free sucky vacuums" too! The spot free does a great job and the materials used on their washing curtains is super gentle on paint. Good for car enthusiasts like me that don't have a place to wash their car at home due to pesky HOA rules.I was in this area and went here for lunch today based on the Yelp reviews. I had a molete and lengua, fish, and pastor tacos. Washed it all down with a Mexican coke, made an awesome lunch! Everything was so good I ordered a shrimp burrito to go and shared it with a friend after I left. I'll be back to try more things next time I'm in the area!Excellent place to have pastries coffee or tea.

Lovely stuff taking well care of their customers.

Bakery: excellent

Coffee: Best cappuccino in Edinburgh so far (perfect strength with perfect foam of milk)Homemade Fudge.  Lots of flavors plus soup and sandwiches.  Wonderful food and friendly service.  All proceeds go to support compassionate ministries of the Mosaic Church in Florence.  Located in the Historic Silver King Hotel.I love love love chicken wings, I basically order them whenever I go out if I can. If I was stuck on a deserted island and a genie  said "You may have one food infinitely until you are rescued." ...I would reply "chicken wings"

...So rolling with my two favorite ladies going to the SW to see a friend last Saturday the 2nd, and searched yelp for CHICKEN WINGS BURGERS in SW Nevada. Chicken Bonz came up as number 1 most reviewed for the SW.

So after we hit my friends, we went over to Chickn Bonz on Durango and Warm Springs. It's kinda hidden from the street as your going east to west on warm springs, so look for it behind a jack in the box I think it was.

Anyway, pulled up about 8pm on a Saturday night, got out of vehicle and.... fell in love instantly....with the sign i read.

ALL YOU CAN EAT CHICKEN WINGS - $12.95

Really!!? REALLY?!?! YIPPEE KI YEAAAAAAAA MOFO!

*ahem*

Anyway, proceeded inside, nice sports barish atmosphere with neon signs, and cool memorabilia on the wall, not a big sports fan so didn't really pay attention. Few video games, and nicely decorated. Ordered our food from the smokin' hot counter girl, that was mutli-tasking like a mofo. Good size crowd taking up most of the tables, got our pitcher, and chilled for about 10 minutes till we got our food. The girls ordered a juicy looking burger that they shared, totally enjoying the texas toast used as a bun instead of the normal McD's bun. Nice. For the AYCE you get 10 to start, and have to order in increments of 5 after that. 

Ordered the Garlic Salsa somethin somethin at the counter of the about 10-12 different flavors they had. I can't remember because the counter girl was hot and I was distracted. 

Anyway, I was expecting tiny little wings like you get at Hooters (I go for the wings) and l and behold, good size pieces of  wings filling up the little tray basket. slathered in my choice sauce. The cool counter person working by herself came up and apologized for it taking a little longer than expected, but she was single handedly handling the entire front by herself with about 15-20 customers on the floor, and about 8 in line AND asnwering the phone, and rocking getting everybody's order in. I worked retail/food the last 11 years and give her kudos, she even managed to compliment my homegirl's tattoo in the middle of all of it!

The wings filled me up surprisingly quick, convinced we were going to sit there for at least two hours  (my homegirls know I love wings) I ended up ordering just one more set of wings and I was content, fat and happy after just 15 wings. I was not surprised with the good size delicious wings, and threw in the  towel at 15. My friends were surprised I was done too. I only tasted the Garlic Chili and Teriyaki, but will go back to try the other ones. 

Had a definitely enjoyable experience, wish the place was a little bigger, as far as choice of seating, but perfectly good time eating some wings.

I live in the north, but will drive down to the SW just for the service, atmosphere and great experience I had with my friends at this location, even though there's another one I guess 10 minutes away from where I live. (I asked the counter girl)

Good Job Chicken Bonz! and Good job Smokin hottie Counter Girl!  I shall return-
4 Stars for food and atmospher+ 1 Star Bonus for our server and overall hotness-making it 5 stars. 

*Poof*I've heard a lot about the Slidin' Thru Truck and have been wanting to try it for a while now, so it was awesome to find out that they have an actual restaurant that you can go to.  It is in an offbeat area (a business park) and is located right next to a bar/gaming lounge (there are no signs on the outside...just have to walk into the lounge to get in).

I definitely agree that the food is top notch.  The menu is only made up of sliders and fries, but the quality of the food is awesome.  You are able to mix and match up to three sliders.  I had the barby, yaya, and pep pep sliders.  All three sliders were great and each one had distinctive flavors.  The barby is a bbq style slider, the yaya is a greek style slider, and the pep pep is a cheese and bacon slider with special sauce.  They don't seem that big at first, but I was pretty stuffed after eating three of them.

They also have sweet potato fries that are covered in cinnamon sugar, which was surprisingly pretty good.

The place itself has a fun and friendly atmosphere and our server was very nice and helpful.  Oh, and they have an NBA Jam arcade machine that has free play on it...very cool.

I would definitely come back again to try the other sliders and their specialty fries.This place is amazing. Hand made tortillas and amazing food! Love it. Finally a legit Mexican food place.Wow I took a friend here for his birthday it was amazing service and great food!! The warm peanut butter mouse with chocolate gelato was amazing!! A party in your mouth!We saw a movie here tonight, very comfortable seats, very clean. The movie had an enjoyable,  unpredictable story, great acting, and honest emotions. So much better than regular, commercial movies. Everyone who loves movies should go to downtown Phoenix, just about a block south of Roosevelt. We don't want to lose this important place! We deserve to have it right here. I've lived here my whole life and I was so glad to have this place open up.
 The people who own and work for the theater are very nice and welcoming. Come and check it out!I have had consistently excellent visits here and highly recommend Due Forni.  Everything I've sampled have been fresh, hot (or cold depending on item), and delicious.  From skewered dates to gnocchi to the pizza (prosciutto e rucola; Due Forni namesake pizza), I can't select a favourite item.  I've only had the Neapolitan crust and will try the Roman crust next time.  (The former is baked for 90 seconds at 900 degrees, resulting in a light, chewy crust.  Roman crusts are baked at 500 degrees for 3 minutes, resulting in a thin, firm crust.)

Service is fantastic.  Don't be surprised if the servers remember you!Wonderful stadium! Situated in a beautiful area of Arizona. The surrounding land is gorgeous! SRF offers more than just games, they have entertaining events & fun baseball camps for kids! Very friendly & efficient staff.I used Pristine to do a move out deep cleaning on one of our rentals.  The stove and bathrooms look like new and the house is 14 years old!   They did an outstanding job and plan on using them in the future for not only our rentals, but also for a resale home we have purchased to live in.  Always had a new house, not accustomed to moving in after someone else.  With Pristine, I won't have to worry!

Janis RSammie loves her new cut! Thank you Alexi!Truly an exceptional experience. From the Kung Pao Calimari which was perfectly spiced to the Strip au Poivre everything was perfect can't wait to go back again when I'm in ScottsdaleThey have a great selection and prices seem to be average for Vegas. Always friendly and willing to help. Over all it's a great place friendly atmosphere and a good selection of beer and wine.My absolute favorite Thai restaurant. The food is incredible, sauces are to die for. Decor is modern and upscale, but prices are incredibly good. My favorite dish is Rama noodles- just can't get enoughThese guys are on my list of top Pizzerias as number one in Las Vegas for a reason.  The pizza is amazing and ingredients are supper fresh making for a tasty and satisfying dish.  The décor is almost a high end and vintage Italian restaurant feel.  

The staff is top notch and always on top of your order, your drinks and able to give recommendations.  The last time I was here I took my out of towners here for lunch telling them this is my favorite spot.  My buddy told me I was building it up so well in their minds they were going to be so disappointed with the experience if they didn't live up to what I was saying.  I never thought of it like that and was nervous as we sat down. 

We ordered a salad and split it amongst three people; a large pizza and when it was sat before us my friends both smiled ear to ear and said WOW! That is an incredible pizza; I said wait till you taste it and they both instantly melted into their seats with satisfaction. 

The outdoor seating is comfortable;  the bar staff is very nice and they make small talk very well if you let them but will respect your space if you are watching the tv or playing on your mobile device.  I know the price scares a lot of people away but trust me you will not regret your dining experience here.Second time I've eaten here and it's still one of the top pizza places in my book. I could eat the large house salad all by myself! It's the perfect blend of salad, house dressing, and mushrooms/onions/etc. Any pizza with the white cheese (the name escapes me) is amazing. The most recent one I had was the pepperoni and sausage pizza. The large can easily feed 4 people with 2 huge slices. Super friendly staff and I can't wait to keep trying more types of pizza!Great food service!Great place. I went there on the opening weekend and they had a waiting list. It did seem a little disorganized, people going this way, people going that way, I can't count that against them though. I am sure it will probably become a well oiled machine in the coming month or so. The one and only complaint I have is the wait for a pizza! There is a warning on the menu saying that there is a 40-60 minute wait for the pizza because it's hand made...really, an hour!? I love pizza and Uncle Bears, which is a 15 foot walk has equally as good of pizza when you consider that it's ready in 10 minutes. That said everyone was very nice.Now that I have been frequenting Park Avenue for a few months I feel that I can write my review. I found them when I moved to the neighborhood and was looking for a place to get a weekly blow out. I went to a blow out salon (actually tried a few) in Chicago and having moved to AZ in November I had yet to find anything similar in Phoenix. I started with a google search and when I saw that the salon was down the street from my new place, I was more than excited. My other option was Dri Bar (I was excited to see them open since I had been in LA  but I don't live in Scottsdale so I figured I would try Park Avenue first) 

First off, I was surprised to see the negative reviews because my experience has pretty much been positive since the beginning. I think its important to note that anytime someone new does your hair, there is a learning curve. I have v. rarely gotten an exceptional result from someone doing my hair the for the first time (pretty much everytime I get my hair styled for a wedding, I am disapointed) This certainly doesn't excuse wet hair but I think it its worth mentioning that you can't have insane expectations either. If you work with someone over time, results almost always get way better, at least, in my experience. 

Also, I have never gone on the weekend and always book my apt. with Lauren on Tuesday afternoons. So I can't review the weekend crowd or any of the other stylists. Lauren is wonderful! She takes time to understand how you would like your hair styled and is always providing styling tips. I actually wish they  would cut and color  hair there too because if they did, I would want Lauren to do it. Second,  I am SHOCKED to read about other yelpers experiences with the front desk. Jessica is usually there when I come in and I have never experienced anything but a very warm and friendly greeting. Which I agree with the other reviews, is a MUST at a salon. I actually can't even imagine her ignoring anyone (she is THAT nice) so I am concluding  that someone else works the front desk on the weekends???

Reasons for 5 stars: Lauren always does a great job, the results last almost the whole week, and even with my long hair I can get in and out on my lunch hour, The decor is adorable, I tried a mini facial and LOVED it (I think it was Cheryl who did my facial) IF I actually ever need to get done up for something I would totally trust Lauren to do my makeup for me, I have (and will continue to) rec. to others, and they just added a monthly membership option which is a ridic. deal for a blow out addict like me. 

My only issue is that I think scheduling could be a little easier if it was available online. A few times I have called to schedule (or reschedule) and the phone goes to VM. I am VM phoebic for some reason so I hate this. I also wish they were open on Mondays but I guess they want some time off so I won't hold it against them. Overall, I love this place. If they added a $35 no-chip manicure option I wouldn't go anywhere else for my beauty maintenence!They have a good variety of flavors and toppings.  They always seem to be well stocked at this location.ANDYNEVSKY

Most fun I've had in a car?  The instructors are very positive, know how to put you at your ease and get you further, quicker than you would normally.  

This really made my trip.

GPS had trouble finding address, got lost and almost gave up. The address below works better with google maps. 

7065 Speedway Blvd, Las Vegas, NV 89115

ANDYNEVSKYAfter vacating renters from our home and discovering the nightmare of a mess they left in our home, we called Jay to come and clean some mattresses in our home after our tenants moved out. We thought they were ruined until Jay came and left them spotless! They were like brand new again! We learned about all the services he provided and were so pleased with his work we knew we would call him again if we needed anything. 

To date he has helped us with various things including grout cleaning for our 5,000 square foot home (that grout was so heavily soiled it was almost black...needless to say it is now white again), upholstery cleaning, carpet cleaning of an almost unsalvageable custom rug. His jobs are complete from beginning to end. This luxury property is now back to tip top shape and ready for rent thanks to all his hard work! 

He has also washed and detailed our high end vehicles--Maserati--car show presentable and Lexus' as well as our water crafts.
 
Is there anything this guy can't do?! He is reasonably and competitively priced, incredibly hard working, OCD meticulous, friendly, personable, reliable and trustworthy (we live in California and have been able to call him to care for things even when we have had to be away from our LV property), generous with his time and knowledge, and one of the best things about him is that he is available day or night! He has been invaluable to us. We would highly recommend him for literally *anything* you need done!!Hooray for Yelp, otherwise I might never have found this place even though it's in my neighborhood.  And to be honest, even if I had literally found it, I might not have tried it.  But I'm so glad I did!

My husband and I went for dinner on a Wednesday night, and although not crowded, the restaurant was pretty busy, which I'm happy about. I want this place to stick around.

I've never had Cambodian food before, but as others have reported, it's a lot like Thai and Vietnamese food with French influences, which is not surprising.  I had the crepes.  They were filled with shrimp, ground pork and bean sprouts, and they came with mint, lettuce, cucumber slices, and cilantro.  I used my hands to make little crepe/lettuce rolls and then dipped them into the fish sauce.  I'm not certain that's how I was supposed to eat them, but it worked for me, and they were delicious!  My husband had the lak lok (I think that's what it was called--marinated beef pieces on a bed of greens with a side of rice), and he really like it too, although I think mine was better. . . .  We also each had a monster spring roll to start.  We really could have shared one, but I'm kind of glad we didn't.  Finally, we each had the iced jasmine tea.  It was very refreshing, with a floral undertone.

I'm already planning my next meal here.  There were so many things on the menu that looked yummy.

Two final comments:  Yes, service was slow, but not horribly so.  And the food was so good and fresh that all was forgiven once it arrived.  And this is not a "sketchy neighborhood"!  It's central Phoenix, not Scottsdale, and frankly that's exactly why I live here.There are moments in our lives that are so special, we want to remember them forever... birthdays, weddings, pregnancy, anniversaries, reunions, or just a perfect simple family day.  My latest precious moment have all come from my 1st pregnancy.  It's been so amazing to watch my body change for my lil baby and I wanted to capture it on film.  Sure, I have a million photos of the last 8 months but, I wanted some that were beautiful and taken by a professional photographer. haha  Don't tell my friends... their photos are great, just mostly amateur and typical. 

Well, through friend of a friend connections, I met Audra Little.  She's a Phoenix/Glendale based photographer who specializes in capturing special moments with newborns, babies, children and their families and most importantly... baby bellies!!!  haha She does many special events such as engagements, weddings, senior portraits, etc.  She's also taken pictures for a couple of my friends so I always see her work hanging on their walls when I visit them. :)

We met last weekend for a photo session and she was so nice to work with... photography is her passion!  She had great ideas and props for the photos (blankets, letter blocks, etc) but also ask me to bring some personal stuff, like a pair of little shoes that I plan to have my baby wear.  I also took special baby blankets that family made and a lil teddy bear that one of my best friends gave me for him.  So cute!

Over a few hours, we shot both inside and outside photographs... the day was so beautiful.  We tried some new things and shot traditional pics, too.  It was a lot of fun.  I'd definitely recommend Audra for your photography needs and I plan to go back to her when my baby gets here!

Side Note: Now that I've had a photo shoot (first since senior pictures), I also think it'd be awesome to have a photographer with you for random, nothing days... just to capture unique moments. :)

See ya there!Awesome!  Great service, great food, great margaritas....perfect!!!  Chile Platter was so good, carnitas and adobo ribs were all awesome!  Will definitely be back...soon.God forbid even something as simple as a bra size be standardized negating the necessity to be measured every time you go somewhere new.  But no.  It's always going to be a surprise.  Will you be a 32AA or a 36 D today?  And I cannot count the number of times (actually I can, it's 2) I have been told I measure a 32.  Maybe if your bra is made in the US, but anywhere else...that 32 really means 34 ,36, pick a freakin' number.  It's arbitrary.

Now that the rant is over, I can say I really did have a good experience at Soma.  The lady who helped me was fantastic, only I cannot remember her name because I am not so fantastic.  But once I proved to her I am not a 32, we were in business.  I received 100% of her attention.  So what if the store was empty.  Being the only customer in a restaurant doesn't always equal good service, does it?  She helped me find the right bra for a particular dress with minimal pain and suffering, at least on my end.  And to no surprise, I walked out with yet another size I have never purchased.

Also, a special thanks to my husband.  When trying on said dress, he offered this expert advice which led me to Soma in the first place..."I like the dress, but you need a different bra, a push-up would be good."  Thanks.If you would like to know the difference between "American" Chinese food and authentic, here is the place to go for the real deal! Absolutely delicious,This was my first time here so I have nothing else to compare it too if it was an average night or not. For those of us who ran the Las Vegas Rock n Roll marathon and half marathons this year this was the sight of one of our "pre-parties" on Saturday night. Runners got free entry and free vodka wells from 10-12:30, but it wasn't exclusively a runners-only night.
There was a huge line which we waited in for about an hour, but once inside we were able to get at least two drinks within the time remaining.  The dance floor is small and the club is a long narrow room. VIP lines the walls and there is a bar on either end. For those of us regular people who don't VIP we danced all night. The DJ was great and he mixed a little bit of everything: old school hip hop, top 40, techno, and kept it moving so he wasn't stuck on one song for too long. 
They shot out confetti over the crowd a few times, and tossed out these light up wands for those of us on the dance floor. 
The bathroom didn't have a line when I went in, and since there was an attendant it was kept clean. 
Dress code is a must at a Vegas club though. There was a young guy in line behind us who showed up in swim shorts, sneakers, and his runners t-shirt. Bouncer told him to go home and "dress up". So bring your swag people.This is one of the best boba place I been to. The boba's texture is just perfect. The juice they use it fresh and flavorful.I used the Snyder Group to help us find a place to rent until we could afford something to buy when we first moved into the Las Vegas area. The experience went great and we're now using them again to find a place to buy. These real estate agents really know what they're doing and are great help every step of the way. They saw potential problems we wouldn't have found on our own and were always available to talk when we needed to. I could not recommend them more!Dad had a stroke and you're feeling blue? Heartbroken over the loss of a lover?  Then Rice Paper is the place to go.  My friend and I were having a bad day and wanted good food and drink.  We're both from out of town and found Rice Paper on Yelp.  The specialty drinks were amazing especially the Vietnamese Spiced Punch.  The calamari and spring rolls were scrumptious and they have reverse happy hour at 10PM.  The great food and service definitely put smiles on our sad faces.  I live on the ocean and the fish was exceptionally fresh, especially since it was Phoenix in the middle of the summer.  The only down side was that they could turn up the heat on the spicy dishes and drinks.This is a fantastic Irish pub. The decor is absolutely spot-on (I grew up in Dublin's fair city so I know what I'm talking about here!) and the atmosphere is amazingly genuine. The bartenders are very friendly and skilled and can pull a first-class pint of Guinness. The food is tasty, well-prepared and a good value for the price point. The Irish breakfast in particular is a brilliant way to start the day after a heavy night out! The bronze statue of St Patrick is a funny and cool touch also. Anytime I'm in the vicinity, Ri Ra is a must-visit. If you are looking for a little piece of Ireland in the heart of Las Vegas, then it doesn't get any better than this. Highly recommended!Rí Rá has great food and great service. As a local, I don't spend a lot of time on the Strip, but when I do, I try to get to Rí Rá. The potato pancakes are so good. Yum! I just went back again today. Potato pancakes and the Irish mac & cheese! Oooh so good! I just want to go there and listen to all the servers speak with their lovely Irish accents. :)I don't just give it 5 stars I give it 10 stars whoever comes try the hamburger with curry sauce it was awesomeCalled same day on a Sunday and they were able to bathe my Chihuahua. She came back smelling great with trimmed nails in under an hour and a half. Staff was very friendly.We took advantage of restaurant week at this place. This is a nice clean restaurant which most true European restaurants are. We had great service by Walter who sat us. To the ones who say they were rude...I say this...This is not Olive Garden or the tacky restaurants when they write their name in crayon on your table. If you never been to the real Italy or New York, you might think it is rudeness but it is not. The food here was Awesome. I had the spaghetti with meatballs (yes, I know meatballs is an American thing but it is hard to find good ones). The red sauce was excellent! The calamari was great. Tiramisu which is either made right or wrong was spot on! The pork chop was supper tasty. I totally recommend this place and I will be back.GREAT PLACE, LOVED IT  We received a 15% off coupon in the mail so we thought we'd give it a try, just figured it was burgers.  This place is GREEN and has little posters hanging all over letting you know what different ways they are doing their part to make a difference.  The beef is all natural, hormone free & for a $1.00 up-charge your burger can be made with ORGANIC GRASS FED beef, which is what my husband ordered in the western style...I ordered the chicken club burger...the way it comes sounded more flavorful than it actually was, but it did seem really lean...next time I will chose one of their other burger types, like the western & I'll just sub with the chicken patty as I don't eat beef.  We split an order of fries & they were fabulous, reminded me of how Wendy's fries used to be...and there is a poster on the wall telling you the type of oil (which I can't remember now) that they are fried in has antioxidants & vitamins in it.  After we ate, I wanted a shake I had seen on the menu...Hazelnut Milk Chocolate, I added malt and chose the coconut whipped cream...OMG BEST SHAKE EVER...forgot to mention that the shakes are made with gelato...even my husband said it might be the best shake he's ever had.  It's the kind of place where you order & pay at the counter & they bring your food out to your table.  A person who seemed to be a manager came over to our table a couple of times to see how we were enjoying our food & offered up some other tidbits on their GREEN products & was super friendly.  Can't wait to go back & give the chicken burger another try.When you walk up, eyebrows raised, you're not really sure what's going on here or what to expect.  The beer garden is interesting, but once you make your way into the tent, wooden plank floors, the smell of an old wooded cantina.....you feel like you are in an old jankity tent.  But it's soooo cool!  Sit in the front, you might get picked on to do a lap dance or something else you would be embarrassed doing all in exchange for free Absinthe booze..... or if you want to see your life flash before you....up close and personal is an understatement!  There is a rollerskating couple who I swear, I'm going to keep them in my prayers everyday that they don't die during their routine.  Go see it quick before something happens to them, it's CRAZY!
Don't be offended by the racist, sexist, rude, or raunchy remarks by the 'host'.

One word.....fun!

I can't wait to go again.The funniest, most entertaining show I've seen in a really long time. I'm not going to go into details because enough people already have. I will easily make it a point to see it again. Well, unless there is another mammoth woman sitting in front of me and my lady recording the entire freakin' show on her crappy cell phone. Oh yeah, that's my only gripe, you are packed in like tuna in those nasty canned tuna in water things.Can't wait to see it again!!! With a new cast!!!  My absolute FAVORITE Vegas show so far... VERY raunchy and hilarious, not for the easily offended.  The acrobatics are just awesome, and what these people can do with such a small place, it amazes me.  I've seen it twice!The best show I have ever seen...If you go to see a show in Vegas this has to be it...So much fun, and well worth the money!!!Love, Love, LOVE this show. Intimate setting, excellent decor, costumes, music. The ambiance was spot on. If I were a gazillionaire and someone put together a dream performance for me this would have been spot on! Various acts, F bombs, totally off color but the performers being so close adds a WOW factor that I haven't found with my other Vegas shows. 
There is nothing PC in this show so if that is a problem skip it. 
I picked up my discount ticket day of show when the box office opened at noon. My hotel concierge told me it was sold out but I walked over anyway. Very glad I did. Got an excellent single seat and graciously accepted the discount cards they were handing out in front of tent.OMG! OMG! LOVE this show. Laughed so hard our cheeks hurt. Would see it again.Goyemon, hands down the best AYCE sushi ever!

Prepare yourself... the waits long, but its worth it!

They have daily specials on the chalk board. It gets cramped when you're waiting but otherwise, being a sushi snob this is the only place I like to go to when I want AYCE.

Their side dishes aside from their sushi are pretty yummy. 

If you're into that kinda weird food stuff, NATTO CUT ROLL!! But my favorite specials have to be salmon belly and conch without the sauce... MMM thinking about it makes me want sushi now!The most gentle wax I've ever had. Brittany is fantastic. Loved the ambiance. Had a Brazilian (not my first time) and it didn't hurt at all.3rd time here for lunch and every time I am blown away.  

They put a spin on Mexican food that just flat out works.  This is not what I would think of as a lunch place, but wow.  The food is flat out great!  I mean award winning good.  The service is outstanding.  I only had water last time and I think there was only one that my cup was half full.  By the way, the water there taste good, I have not Idea how, but it does.

The are very accommodating to special requests and to large groups.  I have yet to use the beer taps they have on their table, but that seem like an obvious win.

I would put this in my top 10 places to eat lunch, and that is saying a lot.Hey everyone. I was just here for a bachelor party the weekend. Honestly, this is a great place to party and dance. Love the crowd. everyone is laid back and just loves to dance, have fun and party. 

Wanted to say thank you to all the staff here for making the night for us and I
 - the wrestler, the shooter girls - you do an amazing job. the people who made the mexican day of the dead night beyond epic. 

This place is the hotspot in scotsdale. If you love to dance, go here. Get off the couch and go here. If you need a place to move around. Grab some real estate on the patio, a table, the booth seats along the wall, the speaker box, grab something and just dance.Friendly staff! Tasty food! I could drink gallons of the red sauce!I love Spinato's!  We usually get Nicole's NEW Favorite, it's pretty basic, but my husband is pretty picky, so....ya. Still, it is consistently delicious and well made. They also have a spinach salad that tastes amazing, and is a pretty good size portion. When we go with a group of 4, we get 1 salad and 1 large pizza and everyone leaves satisfied. 
Their homemade sauce (which you can buy on it's own) is pretty fantastic. I think that's what makes their pizza taste better than most others. 
Another pro- Diet Dr. Pepper. Not many places offer that option, so I have a special place in my heart for those that do. 
The only downside I can find with Spinato's, is that they need a location closer to Gilbert!Very awesome coffee house and dwelling place. Great scones and granola....the music and vibe here is fantastic....the counter girls extremely attractive and friendly.....the owner cool and makes the place comfortable to hang.  Great find.I love this place! Nice atmosphere, great people, fantastic food, and won't break the bank!Best Chinese Food I've had in Arizona to date.  Actually reminded me of a place I eat at in San Francisco.  

Thanks to yelp I happened upon this place.  I'd been by and around this place for quite a while but because of it being in a strip mall down from the American Legion Post I just never thought to try it.  It did always smell good however.

Ok so after reading the reviews I took my wife there since we both love trying new restaurants and food.  The service was very good, quick and informative.  I tried to order the LARGE Hot and Sour soup and she said the small was enough.  Was it ever.  More than enough for two and delicious.  It wasn't as spicy as I'd normally like but the freshness and flavor were spot on.  A little pepper and chili oil and I was in heaven.

We ordered the eggplant with minced pork and garlic sauce, house fried noodles which have shrimp, pork, chicken and beef and pork dumplings.  This along with the soup was like 33-34 which is very reasonable and we enjoyed absolutely everything.  Fresh Fresh Fresh.

We ordered take out and drove out of our way to pick up and it was just as good.  FYI since the noodles are homemade they can get sticky if you don't eat them right away.To have a great Gondola ride at Lake Las Vegas, you need 3 things. 

 1 -  for the Gondolier to sing - otherwise there's no point. Just go on a regular boat ride.

 2- have a Great Gondolier who isn't just a wonderful singer but an amazing personality. We had a guy named Gerry. This was a special surprise for my best friend and she LOVED it, and him. So did I but it was more important to me that she like him, as it was my gift to her.

3- the right time of day.

We booked at sunset. If you get there in time, you get to see the sunset over the water on the way out - gorgeous against the mountains - and the twinkling village and sky in the way back.

Hardly a ghost town , I disagree with the reviewer who said that. The parking lot was full, we passed a couple & a family on the short walk to the boat. Quiet? Absolutely. But even though we purposely came to Vegas during the off season, it wasn't deserted, unless you're comparing it to the Strip.

You can order a meal, not just the chocolates and champagne - costs extra but is it ever worth it! I had a perfectly cooked Alaskan Salmon, after starting with a baby spinach salad. The chocolate cake was so rich I had to take it home. 

The gondolier points out different things to you,then sings. They'll take requests or sing opera!

Our guy, Gerry has one of the most amazing voices I've ever heard. And he was such a sweetheart - bent over backwards to make the night special for my friend and I.  

Coming from someone who used to live in Vegas, if you like being on the water, want to get away from the touristy atmosphere, and want to do something special for a date or a friend or your Mom, you HAVE  to do this. Ask for the nights that Gerry is available - change youR plans around if you have to, to get him. Never met the man before tonight but I'll never forget him. Great, great night.These guys used plumbing pipe (schedule 40 they said) to run the sprinkler system feeds underground. I had originally contacted Arizona Landscape Group, but they had neither insurance, nor a proper license to do the job. Lic. req. with jobs over $999 in full cost. NOT ONLY THAT, PRO WAS $200 LESS FOR A BETTER SYSTEM & DID IT IN HALF THE TIME! The other guys had proposed the crummy blue strip Toro underground mains which, now, after 13 years were springing like a leak a day. I had 6 leaks in the old system. The other outfit said 2 days, Pro did this in one day and you'd never know they were here. They showed up right at 7AM just as they said they would, and they did everything we asked for.  Those 2 things are what I did in my years as a business phone inst. & svc co., you could not ask for better! Altho the timer box was goofed up a bit, I reset it and we are very, very pleased with what Pro did. Thank you.First, I'm starting to realize that I only review places that I really really love. Topping that list, Teriyaki Madness. That whole "highly addictive food" statement is dangerously true. 
I'm ashamed to say that I get the exact same thing every time I come, which is usually more than once a week. My husband at least switches it up. But I am totally completely satisfied with the same thing every single visit. 
Of course I'm talking about the spicy chicken bowl. Which is spicy perfection in a rice filled bowl. The chicken is always expertly cooked and grilled beautifully, extra sauce is served on the side (I always use 2 containers full), and the staff is always sweet and helpful. I go with no veggies and white rice, but you can healthy it up by adding veggies and requesting brown rice. I've never gotten a bad bowl, in fact what impresses me the most is the fact that the food is consistently fantastic. 
Just be warned... It really is addictive. If this is addiction, I don't ever want to go to rehab!Oh. My. 

I've been wanting to try this place for a while, but couldn't sell the spousal unit on African fusion food.  Finally I sold it as a new sandwich place (I felt bad at first) and we were both glad we came here! 

We called ahead and reserved a booth (easier to corral the wee one than at a table) and it was waiting for us when we got there.  It is nicely decorated and cozy; you can almost forget it's in a strip mall.

We had the samosa appetizer (the hubs was skeptical, but it was delicious!), W5C Mixed Grill (which was a sampler of pork, beef, salmon, and shrimp with some awesome veggies and rice), and the Taste of Nairobi (like a whole chicken... maybe half in super yummy curry and chapati--a tortilla-like bread).  You can pick how intense you want the spice level (we opted for medium, which was yummy  but we might go for a little spicier next time).  The portions are large, we ended up taking a lot of food home.

Also, the menu accomodates picky eaters with more traditional American dishes and there is a kid's menu.  There is something for everyone here!

Our waitress was so friendly and made some really great recommendations.  

And don't forget, they offer a free glass of wine with a Yelp check-in!It's a gas station. Fairly clean, the prices are average, the service is always pretty good and friendly. I'm a creature of habit, so I doubt I'll be going anywhere else for a while.This place is the real deal! Great food, great sauces, friendly service!!!So excited they finally have a good Viet restaurant in town. I ordered the Pho Thai so did the boyfriend, we also shared the crispy egg rolls which were amazing. My son had the chicken fried rice. All was amazing. I would say however they give you rather small pre-squeezed helpings of Hoisen and Sirracha. I like to add a ton of both to my soup and made due with what I was given. Other wise it was very clean, the staff was great, the soup and egg rolls were amazing and I would highly recommend the chicken fried rice for the little ones. My kiddo devoured it.
Give them your business so they stick around. Fun atmosphere, nice bar, great food, great location, clean bathrooms and cold stone next door if youre craving a sweet treat after.One of the best in town. My family and I love this place! Awesome environment, we love to sit outside on the patio. My 3 year old LOVES the pho and so do I. The shrimp spring rolls are also amazing. Everyone is so friendly and makes it a even more enjoyable time.Don Pancho grills their carne asada over charcoal. Need I say anything else? Yes I do.

Everything is prepared to order. It comes out hot and delicious. 

The restaurant may seem older, BUT it is kept very, very clean and tidy. The owners are very kind and enjoy talking to their customers. 

They offer you complimentary chips topped with frijoles and white queso fresco. The frijoles are silky smooth and savory. The chipotle salsa is unbelievably good. Deliciousness all around!

Items my family and I ordered:
- Chimichanga w/ Red Chilli Beef - spicy, hot deliciousness. Not too spicy, but Br prepared to fill your drink cup frequently. An overall great item. 

- 3 Carne asada taco plate - these are smaller street-style tacos. The carne asada is well-seasoned, smokey, and tender. It comes with a wedge of grilled onions which adds a great depth of flavorful. - Carnitas quesadilla - crispy tortilla, not too cheesy, and the carnitas are crispy and flavorful. 

- Birria - I'd come here solely for the birria, which is only served on certain days. The broth has great depth of flavor from the many spices, and when you add the lime and onions, gets even better. The meat is fall off the bone tender. 

- Carne asada burrito plate - The burrito only contains rice, asada, and some onions. That is all that it needs anyways. As stated before, the asada is awesome! The rice has great flavor, and the frijoles is well seasoned and creamy in texture. 

- Tripa taco - Worth trying. Crispy, clean taste with no bitterness. Great option to the asada. 

- Cabeza taco - Very good. Tender and moist. It tastes like stewed ox tail.

- Lengua taco - another great option if you want to try it. Very, very delicious. 

You won't go wrong with anything on the menu. Be adventurous, try anything and everything. 

I am definitely going to be a repeat customer, and will be recommending my friends to come here.If the kid's area
is any indication
of what the rest of this library
is like,
then I cannot help
but give this place 5 stars.

The clean, open, and comfortable
reading space of the children's
library was so accommodating
to kiddies and parents
alike that I found myself
lounging with my little one.

Moreover, the story book room
is simply awesome
and helps to encourage reading
as well as a love of books
at a very formative age.

A library that encourages reading?
Imagine that.Pam is such an amazing nail tech. She is such a joy to be around. And my nails always look amazing. If your looking for a great nail tech, look no further. If you want nail art, she does that amazingly! PAM,YOU ROCK!!!!When you've had the same dentist for the past 22 years, going to a new one is scary. After a really bad encounter with another local dentist, I found the stellar reviews here on Yelp and made an appointment at Floss Dental. They could take me within the week and asked only to send over my x-rays. Even calling to make the appointment was pleasant - Dayna's the best. 

I went in about a half hour early to do my paperwork and they took me promptly. They numbed me with rinse (no needles! hurray!) for a cleaning procedure that I had previously undergone sans numbness (it was much more pleasant this time). I spent more time with Dr. Tounian in the room than I had ever spent with a dentist - it was awesome to have close attention. And, he's good at maintaining the patient small-talk - mostly yes or no answers. Much better than asking me my life story, then going wrist-deep in my molars.  Also, whoever's idea it was at that office to turn on Netflix for the patient is genius. 

I highly recommend scheduling your appointment for first thing in the morning - I think I was the only patient there and I was in and out very quickly! Plus, you can avoid the Coffee Bean parking takeover at that hour (the office's neighbor to the south, which is a blessing and a curse). 

One appointment in and I'm a fan. I've even recommended them to coworkers and friends. Believe the hype - these guys are the best!Just a review of the vintage retail (not the salon):
Even though the selection isn't huge, I always find a number of things I like and have to choose what to actually purchase.  I got a coat here that's turned into my winter go-to, and some ties that I really like, too :)I WOULD GIVE 6 STARS IF I COULD 

Jerry, the owner operator of eurotechs really knows his stuff when it comes to mini/jaguar. dealer giving you the run around? go see jerry, he's very honest  VERY reasonably priced, and he wont try to sell you on anything you don't need. Pop in sometime, even for just a chat about Minis or jags and you will see what i meanSuch a gem! I'm a big whiskey drinker, so have been on numerous occasions for adult beverages. Last weekend, a girlfriend and I were looking for a good happy hour besides Blue Martini. I called and found out their happy hour goes until 7:30 pm, yay! So we stopped by and ordered some small plates and adult beverages. I had never had the food prior and was impressed! Will definately be back soon. I will say their couch/love-seat chair seating is very uncomfortable, especially while dining. Good idea, but I would suggest taking those out and putting more small tables in.I had been going to a couple different small fitness clubs in the past few years, one doing personal training with weights and the other doing the medicine ball routine. Both clubs went out of business and I was wondering what I was going to do. My daughter had started Pure Barre in Beverly Hills and loved it.  She called me and told me I should start because she thought that it was what I was looking for. She couldn't have been more right!  I have been going since April 2012 and I absolutely love it!

Every time I walk in the door I'm greeted with a smile- I love the owners and all the teachers. It's not like every other workout, they make you comfortable with what you can and can't do.  They are excellent at describing each technique and correcting you if you don't have the right pose.  They pay special attention to you to make sure that you don't hurt yourself. 
In your first class you will be very confused as to what "tucking" is but by the third class you will know exactly what it is. The moves change up every so often to keep things fresh. The music is very motivating and you just lose yourself for a hour. 
I walk out of the class exhausted but feeling so good. 

You will see a difference in your body within 10 classes. It's a workout that you have to try! Trust me, you won't regret it.This place is great! I went in there today and got the chicken basil, which was probably the best I've had. Ever. The owners (husband and wife)  were very nice from the moment I walked in. I told them that I wanted my meal very spicy, and they didn't disappoint. This was a nice change of pace since most places I frequent usually don't deliver when it comes to heat. The chef - who is the wife - told me that when people ask for spicy, she gives them spicy. I love that attitude! The ingredients are very fresh, and the chicken was nicely trimmed of any connective tissue or fatty bits - which is another issue I've found all too common at other places. 

I will definitely be visiting this place often as there is so much I want to try on the menu! I miss Mad Pita, which used to be at this location, but im hoping that Pan Asian lasts a while! Please, everyone, go there and try this place out. If you like Chinese, Thai, Japanese, or even Vietnamese food (really want to try the pho), I don't think you'll be disappointed. The prices are great and it wasn't busy at all when I was there for lunch,but hopefully that changes!Ok so I went back a second time almost a year later and I have to say that it was MUCH better than my first visit. I don't know if they changed anything but it was fantastic! Food was great! Had the pineapple fried rice, gyoza, sweet and sour chicken and the special of pork ribs - presentation was perfect and the taste was fantastic. I would definitely go back.I don't even like mushrooms and they were deliciousI was craving sweets one evening, so I went on yelp & I read the reviews about the tres leches cupcake at this bakery, I wanted to try it out for myself. I called the bakery a little after 7pm to see what time they closed. The lady on the phone said that they closed at 7pm but was willing to wait for me. 

When I got there, it was a nice, cute, small bakery filled w/ the most delicious looking pastries I've ever laid my eyes on. I really don't know how I had the will power not to order 1 of everything on the display. Everything looked so tempting.

The lady at the counter let my family & I try some samples. She was very friendly, gave a good description about her items on display & informative. A+++ service here. 

I ended up getting the  mini tres leches cupcake, mini tiramisu, cream puff & red velvet cupcake. I enjoyed everything! Especially the mini tres leches cupcakes. I think it's neat that they have mini cupcakes mini tiramisu available for $.99 The prices here are great.This is the best loan center there is in vegas. They are they to help you if you need it! I just have fantastic things to say about this place not only are the employees very nice and helpful but, go above and beyond to help. I totally recommend this place if you need emergency money or are in a difficult time.Last night we had a cheerleader as well as a trainer.  Shannon cheered us on as we rode the bicycle at one of the stations. I personally think there may have been an air conditioning cool spot there, but hey, staying cool and cheering us on. Works for me.

As for my wieght loss, lets just say my mufin top was missing yesterday morning and today's capre's I couldn't wear last month.

Physix LLC is where it is at even if they work you till you sweat!Michelle drew up our trust and living will. I put it off for a long time becuase 1. my own mortality scares me and 2. the amount of thought required to cover all contingencies was more than I wanted to deal with. But Michelle met with my husband and I for an hour, gave us a one- or two-page sheet for "homework" to think about and had us come back two weeks later to finalize the paperwork and sign the docs. DONE! It was so easy and it's such a relief to have it done and over and know that if something happens to me that my three kids are taken care of. Michelle made it painless and easy.What a find.  Went there because of a online coupon but this place is a gem. Being seniors we of course went early, if you consider 5 oclock being early. So the service was prompt and so very friendly. We felt like we were friends that stopped by for dinner.  As for dinner it was delicious and portions were ample. We will definitely go back without a coupon it was that good. Do not pass up this gem of a restaurant if you like homemade Italian food.  I give it an A ++.Tasty balls...as in the meatballs that is....! Fast & super friendly staff! The Mac & Cheese is divine & goes perfectly with the Godfather sandwich.Now, let me say that I am VERY picky about who does my hair and what products they use. I moved to Vegas from Socal nearly 3 years ago. The same stylist did my hair in Newport Beach for 11 years. To say that it was stressful to change hairdressers would be an understatement. :)

When I first moved here, I was fortunate enough to be referred to a guy who was great and took very good care of my hair. Unfortunately, he basically left the business and I was stuck finding someone new once again.

After drifting from salon to salon and having some VERY bad experiences in the process, I landed at Pico Madama. What a difference! This is the only salon I've found in Vegas that even comes close to the overall quality of my Newport salon. The owner, Beli, is wonderful, as are all of her employees.

After trying a few stylists, I have chosen Letty as my permanent stylist. Letty is GREAT. You should ask for her. :) She honestly gave me the best hair cut I've had in years, and her attention to detail is among the best I've ever seen. I've had Letty cut, style, color, and keratin-smooth my hair. In all honesty, I can't say that anyone has ever done any of it better. 

I highly recommend Letty and Pico Madama...and I'm very grateful for having found them! Thanks, Letty, Beli, and staff!We have been using Swimming Pool Butler for our weekly pool maintenance for the past 2 months. This is the first time we have ever had a clean pool! I highly recommend them. They send a notification email after every service visit and use automatic billing, which is very convenient.Its been hard to find authentic Thai here in Scottsdale but I love Thai Basil - The tom yum soup and Pad thai are both delicious and appropriately spicy - Im averaging once a week since I discovered it!Amazing peeps at this place!! Willing to do anything to go over the top for up at 5:45 in the morning!! Thank you all again. visited on 2/24/2013.OMG new spot to get some delicious Venezuelan arepas!  I have never had one before so I really can't compare arepa to arepa, but these little guys are so delicious for about $5 a pop!  Cheap delicious eats!  So happy that Anne L. introduced me to this place.

Here is what we tried:
1. Reina peplada: the most popular.  Chicken, avocado, mayo, and cilantro.  Served cold.  What is not to love???
2. Pork butt: it is delicious with cheese added!  Soft pork, sorta like a pulled pork sandwich.
3. Woodfire beef: with tomato, lettuce, and onion.  Tender beef with all the veggies.
4. Garlic shrimp: fully loaded and can be served hot or cold. 
5. Fried yucca and pork rinds: this was surprisingly delicious!  I was scared about eating pork rinds but they went well with the yucca!  It's like interesting fries :)

Some other notes:
- bad area but nice restaurant.
- right across the street from Luv-It's Frozen Custard!
- the sauces are amazing
- the bread is toasted and yummy

Can't wait to come back and eat everything here.  Haha.I could of sworn I wrote a review for Viva Las Arepas a few years back, my apologies. I began coming and enjoying these delish arepas when this establishment was the humble little shack across the parking lot now replaced by an up and coming gourmet sandwich joint. My first time here the owners kid was out behind the shack and some drunk women was walking up and the down the street cursing and confronting customers so I called the cops and my mom went to go talk to the little girl and her mom so she wouldn't be scare. The chef was busy so as a thank you he gave us a few free orders of the cheese sticks. After that I became a regular. 

The pork arepa is filled with really tender pulled pork but I always order without the tomato slice. The shrimp arepa is really yummy too, sautéed shrimp in a mild spicy condiment sauce served hot. The bean an cheese arepa, can nothing go wrong with those!!! Finally but not least, the Reina Pepiada is my absolute favorite!!! It is made with shredded chicken, mayo, avocado, peas and cilantro. 

The arepas are served in rustic baskets which I hate because when people spill their arepa juice, how do they clean them? I eat mine over the paper they come in. The new locating is sooo nice and big too. Their menu is extensive, it contains other Venezuelan goodies like cachepas which are these sweet little pancakes. The parking lot is still limited but I never have a problem and I'd walk a few blocks to try these guys out, trust me!!!What can I say...  food from The Great Greek is made with love and that's the not so secret ingredient!!!

First off, this place takes care!!!  The food that they serve is definitely a reflection of the quality of produce and products used!  This is an important element that differentiates their food from surrounding competitors, and it's a difference you can really taste.  Moreover, the food here is extremely affordable and definitely worth the price mark, add ons and all!

I'm always open to new food but when trying a new Greek restaurant I always take it back to basics.  Hummus and tzatzki with pita bread are ALWAYS a must for me so I was delighted with the fact that I had found a place who knew what they were doing.  The texture and seasoning was on point and I love the accompanying pita bread!!  It was thin, soft, warm and didn't overpower any of the dipping sauces.  In other words, it was not overly thick and hard.  

Do try a little combo of the different appetizers such as the hummus, tzatzki, dolmades, pita bread!!  It's a wonderful selection of the most popular Greek comforts.  Those little dolmades were fresh, flavorful and stuffed just right.  Please... Do yourself a favor and get an order of the Great Greek feta fries. Damn!! This dish really won me over cause i'm a sucker for fries and this little twist was such a nice palate pleaser! Amazing!!  Can't stop thinking about them!  Gyros are tricky ordering for me because others i've tried either had too much of something, or too little.  The Great Greek's gyro was huge and each ingredient it was stuffed with did not outshine another; it was the perfect amount of everything.  Presentation is simple and to the point but also exhibits a hidden wow factor that I like.  

The restaurant itself is extremely inviting and exudes a very "my house is your house" type of feeling!  Being that it is a family affair, there are no inconsistencies when it comes to service!!!  This is what I love about gems like these... It doesn't have that "chain restaurant" feeling... and that brings me back to the not so secret ingredient: love, love, love!!!  You can tell that you matter as soon as you step in cause you're always greeted with a smile and a welcoming hello!

Anyway... Go ahead and give The Great Greek a try for yourself.  You'll see just what I'm talking about once you take your first bite.  I highly recommend! *love*I LOVE the gyros & greek fries here....it is a little pricey but you get a lot of food! AWESOME!I could probably eat here for the rest of my life! I've tried a lot of different things on the menu and they're all delicious.  My favorite is the greek salad wrap with chicken, it is perfectly tangy and delightful but the gyro is solid too.  My boyfriend always gets the falafel which he loves and sometimes if we're feeling wild we'll get dolmades and hummus.  I almost forgot about the feta fries!!!  Great Greek is really doing something right with those fries they're the best.  I believe its family owned and the woman behind the counter is always so sweet and welcoming.  It can get pretty busy though so we always order it over the phone and pick it up, otherwise there are about 8 tables or so inside- not bad but it can get packedI have been back more times than I can count, and the food is always top notch. 

Recently I have been on a Ramen fix, their Beef Ramen is some of the best I've ever had, they serve up a big bowl, the broth is rich, they aren't skimpy with the beef, and you can get tendon if you like. (I'm not a tendon fan but it was pretty decent.) And it's under $6!

They also have a steak special that is Under $10, the steak is good (cooked on a flat top so it's a little different) and the sides are fresh (the baby bok choi is amazing)!

Also they've been serving up a mango pudding, I don't know if it's on the menu officially yet, but it's really good, and I'm sure they'll serve up an order for you if you want.

I have to go back to try the Soy Sauce Chicken and the other new Chicken Special.

The staff is friendly and the price is cheap, it's hard to beat Big Wong.

you know I'll be backFirst time here and I love it.  Food was great as well as the service !! Everyone on their laptops, free wifi. I will def. come back .. I love the fact that there is an outside cafe too.. Dog friendly !! Luv that !!!This QT is one of my favorite locations! It is always very clean and the staff is upbeat!"hi welcome to QT" every time I enter, great friendly service. Cleanliness is key to this store too. Great QT.Well, I don't write a lot of reviews, but FINALLY! This place has the real deal. 

For further information on the Italian Beef (IB) sandwich from my hometown, go here: 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_beef 

To preface this, I went to High School at St. Ignatius in Chicago. For those unaware, you walked out the back parking lot onto Taylor Street, with the original AL's right there. I grew up on these Muttherf&&^&% sandwiches. In my mind, that makes me an expert. I could eat them 3 times a week back home and never get tired. Sorry if that sounds a bit arrogant, but...well, just trust me. 

That's right. No cheese, no mushrooms, none of the other BS other places try to pass off as a real IB. This little place has managed to capture it better than Luke's (which isn't bad) and the now defunct Al's up north. Sorry to see them go, but that joint was way overpriced, and tried to do too much. 

The IB was shaved paper thin, and the sweet peppers were good. I asked for it dipped and on getting back to the office, it was still a bit too dry for my taste. Next time I will ask for is soaked or double dipped, or whatever they call it there. The juice was dee-licious, reminiscent of Portillos and Al's from back home. I did not get the hot peppers (not my thing), so I cannot comment on that. 

I also had the fries, which were foodservice, but cooked nice and crispy. Note to them: If you read this, you need to throw a bit of salt on them RIGHT AFTER leaving the fryer. 

Excellent service! I got trapped behind a bunch of businessmen that ordered all kind of food, including grilled chicken Sammie's. They had my to go order ready in less than 5 min. Well done. 

All I need now is White Castle, and a REAL deep dish pizza that isn't bought at AJ's in the frozen section, and All the Chicago staples will be here in the valley. 

If YOU LOVE ITALIAN BEEF, CHECK THIS PLACE OUT. 

Beef sandwich: $5.00 Fries: $1.00.I called Bond heating & A/C on Friday regarding an airflow issue. I made an appt for this Monday at 10:00 and he showed up right on time. He checked my duct work and recommended dampers. He also wanted to check my refrigerant level and noticed the level was low. He added refrigerant and recommended I wait on the dampers. After doing all of this, he did not want to charge me. 

It can be hard to find honest repair work in this town. If you need heating or A/C work, I would highly recommend calling Chris at Bond heating & A/C.Can't beat this company for air conditioning service in Las Vegas.These guys are great! I had issues getting my car situated on the belt for the wash (bad day on my end) and the attendant was very helpful and kind about it. Also, the free vacuuming is a great bonus. I'll most definitely continue using this car wash.Undoubtedly the best sushi I have had in the Midwest. I went here as a party of five with reservation scheduled ahead. We were seated right away. Our server was prompt and attentive. Our drinks and apps came quickly, as did our rolls. I could not believe the flavor packed into these small (and sometimes large) bites. Absolutely astounding. I have never cared for sushi to this level, and this eatery made my month. From start to finish, service was flawless. Such a great atmosphere. I cannot wait to visit here weekly.I thought Curry Corner was fantastic. I ordered something like a vegetarian sampler platter, and it was so good, I ordered a second entree immediately after.

Unfortunately, I don't remember the names of what dishes I had. But it was stuff that I don't typically see on south Asian restaurant menus, so I get the impression it's fairly traditional / authentic stuff. Not just mainstream "Americanized Indian" food. (Not that there's anything wrong with that!)

I will say that my (meat-eating) companions were not as enthusiastic about their dishes, but that has more to do with the fact that they don't really like curries and south Asian food, and less to do with Curry Corner specifically.

Also, service was a little slow and not terribly friendly. Oh, and the faucet in the men's restroom was leaking so much it was basically just On. I mentioned it to the waitstaff, so hopefully it's fixed by the time I've posted this.First time going here after reading all the awesome yelp reviews. Definitely 5 star worthy after experiencing it myself!  Awesome color choices for gel, My gel manicure and pedicure are  so pretty! 
Thank you Tim! So easy to talk to and friendly! Can't wait to come back in a couple weeks.Wow...  Found this little gem on yelp. Fresh ingredients and a great price for a spectacular breakfast...This place is just spot-on in so many ways...

The decor is pleasant and unexpected with a personality all its own (and no country or breakfast theme -- man I hate "barnyard" decor).

The owners are sweethearts (Lou took my order today with an enthusiastic "Talk to me, Goose!" and tends to refer to everyone in terms of endearment).

The drink selection is impressive (premium sodas, beers, wines, coffee/espresso drinks, and at least 13 flavors of mimosas -- my favorites are passion fruit, guava, and blood orange).

The food is just awesome, no other way to describe it. I used to think I hated crepes, but this place has made a believer out of me. I can't vouch for the sweet ones since I'm not a sweets person, but the savory & breakfast crepes are effing genius. My favorites are the Sonora (carne asada steak, roasted tomato salsa, guacamole, jack cheese) and the Monterey (bacon, scrambled egg, tomato, red onion, serrano pepper, jack cheese). If you get a breakfast crepe, you can choose sliced bananas or cottage cheese as your side. If you get a savory/lunch crepe, you can choose soup (usually fideo) or a green salad with vinaigrette. Don't let that description fool you into thinking the salad is boring, though -- the dressing is homemade by Lou and has a base of cumin, lime, & garlic (my kind of dressing!!). OMGYUM.

I heard they're looking to open another location on the other side of town. As long as this one doesn't go anywhere, that's allllll right with me.Spectacular!  Not only was the food excellent but the service and people working their were outstanding.  You couldn't ask for a nicer staff that is attentive, without being annoying, and extremely helpful.  I had the Greek crepe which was absolutely delicious and my husband had a breakfast crepe with chorizo which was equally delicious.

We would definitely go back there again and highly recommend them to anyone.  We just wish they were open longer since it seems the only time we are over in that area is after 3pm.another great time!!!
Lacey gave me purple hair and it's amazing, fabulous, stunning and oh so gorgous! I LOVE it when the sunlight is on my dark brown/ purple hair!
THANK YOU AGAIN!!!!!I came here with my 3 daughters ages 11, 12, and 16.  The service was amazing!!  Staff was very friendly and we were all able to get our hair cut at the same.  We all loved our haircuts, done exactly as we asked.  All their products are organic, not some unknown chemical.   We've tried out many hair places, but we have finally found one we will stick to!  I highly recommend this Salon!!!I have a 2012 Accord so I'm hesitant to take my car any where else for car maintenance. I didn't buy my car there, but this location is closer to where I live. 

They have this deal which is 4 oil changes and 2 tire rotations for $120, which I think is a good deal. One oil change alone runs about $40 anyway, so this saves you money. Why wouldn't you get this? I don't feel like they are trying to rip me off or pressuring me when they offer suggestions for car maintenance like changing my cabin filter. I'm always in and out of here within an hour. Service includes a free car wash and a free drink from the snack area. They also have a little lounge with a tv while you wait. 

I'd recommend them:) the endShrimp, crawfish, potato fries, sweet potato fries, corn, sausages, EVERYTHING was heavenly. Such a pleasant surprise to find such delicious/fresh/juicy food off the Strip!

A+++ for the phenomenal staff.
Thank you for being so friendly and attentive!!

Hot 'N Juicy of Nevada (WIN!)

vs.

Boiling Crab of California (pfffffft.)Much nicer and cleaner than the original location down the street and more space between tables. The food is just as good. Who doesn't love seafood in plastic bags? A friend and I shared half a dozen oysters, a pound of crawfish, a pound of shrimp, a pound of Alaskan king crab legs, and a pound+ of dungeness crab. We had no problem devouring all that. If price wasn't an issue we would have ordered more. Despite this chain's appearance of looking like a dive it isn't exactly cheap. 

The king crab legs in the mild garlic butter sauce were the clear winners of the night. The dungeness crab was pretty tasty as well but required more work. I've never been much of a fan of crawfish. There's just too much work for so little meat. I'll stick to the other stuff next time.With Shrimp being my Favorite, this place is the best place for
It. I am in love with the lemon pepper (no spice) it's sooooo yummy!!!!! 

Down side of thing is... I hope you don't have anywhere important to go After you eat here because you clothes will smell so bad lol :)Love this place. We always have a great time. The bands are always good / great and the beer is fantastic. Gotta say, never had a bad experience. Customer service is outstanding. I always make an attempt to come here whenever I'm in town.Best sushi I have had in AZ, the presentation was spectacular and the food was awesome! We had the Phoenix roll, crazy salmon roll and the golden dragon roll and they were all amazing.I will be going back for sure.They should change the name of this place to just "BBQ House."  The Texas part is unfair to them as the BBQ in the state of Texas cannot stand up to this place.  I say this as I meander through Texas tasting any smoked flesh I can get my hands on.  

The brisket at the Texas BBQ House is the best I've ever had...hands down.  I've eaten enough in my time to fill an airplane hanger so I think I'm qualified on the subject.  If you fed this to a vegan, they'd leave the restaurant and go on a long spree of violence once they realized what they were missing in life.  It's that good.  Here's the thing though, average BBQ still tastes pretty good and most of your life you'll eat average BBQ.  Once in awhile you'll get a perfectly cooked brisket or pork shoulder or rack of ribs that blows your mind.  That's this place every single time.  I'm not kidding when I say I'd take a half-pound of their moist brisket over a surf and turf from any high end steakhouse if given the choice.  They only cook a given amount a day so make sure to get there early or call ahead to make sure they have what you want.  When a place sells out of food daily...that's a good sign.  They don't compromise their product by squeezing a few more briskets in the smoker.  They have a formula for delicious food and they stick to it.  

Some would say the location and shack-like appearence are a downside.  It's out of the way for sure but I find that to be a good thing.  If this place were near my home I'd weigh 400 lbs easily.  If you come here and don't like the food, you just don't like BBQ.  You might like BBQ sauce but you don't like BBQ.  And if you don't like BBQ, I weep for your misfortune.I became concerned that my mother was getting older, and I did not have a great photo.  When I contacted Emotions of Light, the photographer had such great ideas, I listened to her ideas than going with mine.  The end results were fabulous.  She even took several of me with my mother.  Mom cherishes those also.  I could not be happier.Nothing, but nothing, beats discovering a spectacular little place completely by accident -- which is how I found Chakra 4 for lunch today.  I was at the Biltmore area My Sister's Closet, just for fun, and decided to wander around the shopping center, saw this place, and thought "Hey, this looks quirky."  It's so much more than quirky, it's a perfect vegan tea house.  GREAT Wood Mushroom Pizza, tremendous tea list, and exceptional house made healthy chocolates.  I'm so going back often, the warm and healing atmosphere, super smart and friendly ladies on staff, and fantastic food take you totally out of Phoenix into a completely better world.  Don't miss this place -- it's VASTLY better than any of those mega restaurants at Biltmore Fashion Park, and it's just down Camelback Road;  perfect for an afternoon shopping pick me up when you're in that nieghborhood!I was looking for a new stylist that knows how to cut short hair. After reading the good reviews about Holly, I called and got in the same day... lucky as I was ready to cut it all off!  She is very friendly and knowledgable.  She cut my hair dry which is exactly what you should do if you have curly/wavy hair. She asked a lot of questions about preferences and actually listened to the answers. She did a lot of texturizing and shaped it up in no time.  Great job and a really nice and professional stylist.I love this place,  its a far drive for me but so worth it!  Prices are awesome!  Never again european wax center and body spa west!  I found a winner!  I love how they have a little play room for the kiddies.Not much to say about TBS, except that it's awesome!  Been here twice now...super nice and clean facility, very welcoming and friendly staff, excellent prices. Ask for Stacey, she's fantastic!Made me feel so comfortable for my first time! I am a large girl and felt a little nervous about what they would think about me. They were so sweet. Their $20 first time special is great!OMG best street tacos in Vegas ever.  They are just like the ones in LA, but better.  

Only got the tacos there but they were amazing.  
Adobado: Had right amount of spice and the creamy sauce complimented the meat.  
Carne Asada: Juicy steak comes with guac and pico
Lengua: Wow...so juicy and tender
Tripa: OMG...deep fried intestines...Greatness in my mouth..lol
Buche: (stomach) it was ok...i just had to try it.
Cabeza: (head)..wasnt bad..had to try it also
Sesos: (brain)...had to try this as well...it wasnt bad...but the texture was weird.

The place was busy when we got there, but the line went by quick. There are a few tables in the inside and a bunch on the outside.

Oh almost forgot free refills on drinks, so of course got Orange Bang!!!Very tasty food, their drink machine is unlike anything else you'll find in vegas too5/21: I've been here a few times; every time has been awesome! I haven't been to many Mexican restaurants, although I can't imagine better tacos out there. 

These tacos are so good, fresh, and cheap...max value for $2 each! You can definitely leave here full and satisfied for under $10. 

I've had the Spicy Pork and Steak Tacos. The fries are awesome as well. 

TIP: Make sure you ask for the freshly cut pineapple if you get Spicy Pork! 

The chefs are pretty friendly as well. I love that you can watch them cut the meat from the rack and prepare your order. 

I even overheard some guy at the Bellagio say "Tacos El Gordo." The word is out. Just about everyone will love this place! 

Whenever the weather is nice, sitting outside can be very relaxing while eating these delicious tacos. 

Amazing food! I want some right now!BEST TACO EVER! 

Adobada Pork!

Ask for extra salsa. 
Ask for the plate of veggies.

EVEN BETTER WHEN DRUNK!

Right next to the Wynn. They had live music at around 2am...!


So SooooooOOOOooo GOOOOD!

-Give it a try!Awesome tacos at a good price, but expect to wait.

I went at lunch time and had 3 tacos: al pastor, carne asada, and lengua.  All were good, but al pastor was the best, IMO.  There was a big line, but the well worth the wait.Strayed away from the convention center and big name palatial casinos to take a break from all the overpriced nonsense and corporate types.  I felt comfortable at Tacos El Gordo, the service was fast, and the steak and spicy pork tacos were excellent.  I'm glad I checked this place out and am going to make it a place I come to every time I'm in Vegas from now on.The food here is amazing. Order Al Pastor tacos, sopes, vampiro, etc. Can't go wrong with anything on the menu and the prices are cheap. Come after the club and the food taste even better.I just visited a new Cactus Valley Pool Supply store next to the Safeway at Happy Valley Road & 39th Ave.   The staff was friendly and the prices were great... I'll be back.Having visited the Chop Chop on Morrison Street on a couple of other occasions, his was my first visit to the Shore.

The two restaurants were very different, and this one was definitely fresher and more contemporary. It a very spacious place,and it has to be for the amount of food that gets brought to the floor! Service is efficient, attentive and the staff know their menus well.

Our group opted for the Unlimited Banquet for £18.50 per person, and promptly ate ourselves into a stupor, is it possible to fit in another vegetable dumpling? Oh yes...we didn't manage dessert though! 

For those of you familiar with the wonderful world of 'Harry Potter', a visit to Chop Chop reminds me of the scenes when the pupils of Hogwarts have their feasts, and the plates in front of them fill up by magic! At Chop Chop, the minute one of our plates were emptied, a replacement quickly followed...as if by magic!

Highlights were the vegetable and prawn dumplings (light, delicious and incredibly more-ish!), the aubergine with garlic (Mmmmm!) and little roasted cubes of potato done in a black bean sauce (spicy and extremely yummy!). My meat-eating companions fell in love with the sticky ribs, and the sticky sauce made a good dipping sauce for the prawn crackers.

The menu is fairly set, but the staff are happy to substitute certain dishes to accommodate vegetarians and other dietary requirements, thus keeping everyone in the group happy!

The menu is extensive and reasonably priced, and the drinks menu has lots of lovely Chinese lager to accompany your meal.

A great place to go with a large group or as a couple...just make sure you wear loose clothing to give your tummy some post-feasting space!Absolutely excellent meal at Tommy V's. The food and wine were excellent (I had the Chicken Marsala) as was the service.  Portions were good and the price was fair. I would go there again in a minute.We were a group of 7, and I had cioppino.
Service was great, and we loved the atmosphere. Very cozy and comfortable to spend a good time with your family and friends.
Cioppino was good. I liked the source though seafood was not great, but good. However, this is a restaurant in AZ, not Monterrey. Compared to other restaurants in AZ serving seafood, I would say this restaurant is doing their best.
Highly recommended for special events.It on a very fun street with lots of nightlife! Very fun scene! Everything was delicious! A nice twist on the classic italian that gives the food a fresh feel! Our waiter was great too! And the owner personally came to make sure we enjoyed our meal!My husband and I recently visited Arizona and had the opportunity to eat at PVBC. We both had the same reaction: BEST BURGER EVER!!! He had the Beach House Burger and I had the Burger Parmesana. I made the mistake of watching my caloric intake and missed out on the awesone toasted bun. The sides (french fries and tater tots) were equally as good. We told the owner (super nice guy)  that if he opens up in New York he could count on us to be regulars. If i were you I would definately check it out and make sure you dont make the same mistake that I did, HAVE THE BUN!!!!Love the staff here! Great people, they always help us out for our cat and dog! Plus the cute little silky terrier behind the counter is always my favorite part of the visits. We only buy from this store.I don't think I've ever had a better meal in all of Arizona. If there were 10 stars, ShinBay would get them all. MMM.

We did the tasting menu. The starter was a halibut sashimi in a ponzu like sauce. Typically, you wouldn't think of halibut as being the go to sashimi, but it was prepared perfectly and can't think of a better sashimi dish. The next course was a bento box with different small apps. Each one was better than the last. We especially enjoyed the oyster and uni. The third dish was a mushroom soup. It was phenomenal! The fourth dish was a "cook your own" wagyu. At first we were hesitant to do this, but once we realized how amazing this meat was we couldn't get enough. The final dish (and surprisingly the best) was a plate of nigiri. Every piece was perfectly done and SO fresh. This was the best nigiri we have found anywhere in AZ. For desert we had a custard with fruit that was the perfect ending to the tasting. 

Overall, the prices are very high, but extremely worth it. Alcohol prices are reasonable. This is a truly perfect spot for any special occasion!I've now used Kevin twice for home inspections and would highly recommend him.  He is thorough, and takes time to discuss the results and answer questions immediately.  Both of my experiences have been long distance so his knowledge of the area and its nuances were extremely helpful.  Kevin is very professional and a pleasure to work with.I actually live in Southern California, but I bought my wedding dress here. I had called several stores within 50 miles of my home only to find that most did not have any of the dresses I was looking for. So while we were in Vegas for a weekend, we took a look at 3 different bridal salons in the area. 

One Maggie Sottero dress in particular was high on my list of potentials. Bowties had a sample to try on and a few others I liked, Michelle helped me get in and out of the dresses, and one of them I decided was the one for me. Only an hour prior, we had seen the same dress at Bridal Elegant, but were told that the dress wouldn't ship until late May, and probably wouldn't arrive until too late for our June wedding.

Turns out, Bowties was able to find the dress already in stock and only had to order it.  It came in about 2 weeks! I now have my dress already. 

And even though it's a few hundred miles away, I'll probably bring my dress back to Bowties for any alterations I need closer to the wedding.  And Evanna explained that they have dressmakers doing alterations rather than someone who just takes in sides, etc.

I'm all for supporting local businesses, but some of the places I called closer to home (such as The Dresser in Fullerton, CA) are downright rude. Michelle at Bowties was a sweetheart, and I'm really happy with my experience there.Simply put amazing. Lunch is a great, they have a select lunch menu. Have yet to have a bad item. Pizza, which I think is hard to mess up, is amazing. I recommend the cheese/pesto for an appetizer, great great great!

They have a great Sunday Bloody Mary for $5. It's made with jalapeno infused vodka. Go easy on them =)My wife loved them!  Delivered in less than an hour!I didn't know that Pronto existed until I was thumbing through the Valupak of coupons and found theirs. It was close to my place, and I've gotten tired of Mixteca and Carumbas. I think some bbq place used to be there.
I tried the carne asada burro with a side of sour cream and a fish taco. The burro looked a little on the small side when compared to other places, but the flavor made up for that BY FAR. The meat was tender and marinated well, the pico was tasty with a little spice, and the tortilla was perfect and didn't break like they usually do.
The fish taco was big and very satisfying, and after eating it I had to save the burro for a later meal. 
The decor was inviting and what you'd expect at a nicer Mexican food place. The staff was very nice, and there was even a worker who would quality check the food before bringing it out to the customers. 
They even have... and this a huge plus for me... a salsa bar! I know, I know, almost everywhere has these now. But it makes the experience personalized and by the time you've gotten all yr salsa and pico, the food is done! Even better than playing Plants vs Zombies while you wait! 
This place is new, awesome food with super affordable prices. If they keep it up, they will make that corner their permanent home, and no one will even remember that bbq place... whatever it's name was.I guess I could be addicted to worse things, but I don't know if it gets better than Popped. Went back for some more Dilly Pickle (pure craving satisfaction) today and some Buffalo Hot/Ranch. Also picked up some Pinkadelic for a friend's kids. Go support this cool local business and "get Popped"! :)We used Big J Plumbing on an emergency plumbing repair this evening.  Jay was on-time, did a great job and did not try to gouge us at all.

Big J Plumbing will be the first and only plumber I will call when I need plumbing work done in the future.

Fast, efficient, HONEST and friendly service!I think my review here is definitely due an update. Yes, it's still at  the same top-of-the-class 5 star rating. But since my first review I've been back many, many, many times and sampled many of what the Monkey Leith has to offer. Namely:

- Dr Paul pub quiz on a Monday night, 7pm. Awesome. He's a legend, brilliant banter, staff are up for it, but the neighbours upstairs hate it.

- Good pub grub. Not gastropub food, pub grub. The veggie chilli (either as is, or on nachos) is amazing! Chickpeas and beans and nom. Most recently, the filled potato skins with chicken & salsa, and houmous & feta, were really tasty.

- Friendly bar staff. Friendly customers. Generally a friendly place (where everyone knows your name. Yeah, that.)

- I'm not a big ale / beer drinker, but I know they have a lot here. Ask others who know better, but they def have a good range and lots of local stuff too.

- Movies. The Monkey pubs are known for their movie connections (not sure where that started) but they show movies all the time (admittedly with music over the top) and I think on a Sunday still properly screen a movie.

So yeah, I really, really like the Monkey Leith. It's quite different to its older brother up on Drummond Street (the original Brass Monkey). That one is more populated my students and regulars and is a vortex where you can get lost for hours drinking, with great craic. It's small and cosy and a squash at the bar.

Whereas this Monkey Leith is much bigger, huge in fact, with a massive bar but plenty room around it. The toilets don't smell, and aren't shared (referring back to the original Monkey, where they do and they are) the furnishings are new and it's really quite swish. There's loads of room, loads of comfy sofas, loads of tables. Just loads of space generally, so even if it's packed you'll still have room to yourself.

I just wish it were closer, as it's on Leith Walk so out of the way for me, but well worth the bus ride.Started going to this place with a groupon and will still continue going! Friendly staff and they always do a fabulous job!! I would recommend this place to anyone!the customizable soda station gets 4 stars alone! But then I had my burger. Delish! The bun was toasted but also super soft which doesn't normally work but it was perfect! 
I'm not normally a big fan of fries, could take them or leave them, but Five Guy's fries are sooooooo very good!!!! 
I'd never heard of this place until the other day when I was in Phoenix with my boyfriend. He suggested it and so I said "what the heck". So glad I made that decision. Then I go on the website and find out they have locations in the Seattle area! This could be very good or very bad depending on how you look at it. 
One suggestion, if your appetite isn't very large, go with the Little Burger. My boyfriend has been here before and warned me ahead of time. It was very good size on its own so I'm glad I didnt go with the regular one. They also give you tons of toppings options at no extra charge. All in all, can't say anything bad about this place. They even have peanuts you can munch on until your order is up.Great service, nice atmosphere, decent food, great dessert!

I went on a Saturday afternoon right before the dinner rush. Our server was phenomenal. He said it was his last day so unfortunately I can't direct patrons to his section, but even the managers were great. We were asked how our service and our food was twice while we were there and we has nothing but praise during our lunch. 
The California Chicken Sandwich was alright, but too greasy for my own liking. The wedge fries were good though and the sangria was tasty. I shared the red velvet pizookie with my friend and it was phenomenal. It was perfect for 2 to share and I highly recommend it!
I've been to BJ's plenty of times but this was the first time at this location and so far  it's definitely my favorite.great selection of beer and food. Love NITWIT and if your feeling froggy for dessert the pizookie is bombVisited from out of town for a conference, staying near the Capitol, but had events down near Union South and Memorial Union.  And wanted to explore campus and town a bit and run some more errands, so I needed to carry some supplies for the conference, as well as beer and cheese curds.  Rented bikes for 2 days and rode at least a dozen times.  Bikes were great!  Small inconvenience when one location (Charter) had zero open docking stations, but Union South nearby was sufficient.Trip to Santan isn't complete without a stop at Frost.  The staff is always all smiles. With the variety of flavor sand seasonal items it's never boring.  We feel so much better stopping here than for ice cream somewhere else. If you've never tried gelato you need to here.Delish! Healthy, refreshing, and unique. Gluten free granola is offered too :)Move over In-N-Out!  Five Guys gets 5 stars from me!  

Numerous toppings to select from and a great "classic cheesybugery flavor" that sticks to your ribs.  You have  to pay a little more for cheese and/or bacon, but all of their burgers, hotdogs, and sandwiches come with the option to add up to 15 different toppings at no additional charge.  Mmmm...I love the grilled onions & mushrooms option.  You know you've done some eating when you leave FGBF.  

Have you ever had 2+ people in your party order the same thing (ie. cheeseburgers) with completely different toppings and then have them all tossed in the bag with no markings??  At FGBF they label each burger with a # that coordinates to the order in which your party placed their order.  I know it's a little thing, but it sooo delights me to not have to play musical burgers, trying to guess which one belongs to who.

Have no fear if you decide to make a pit stop while hanging with your cool vegan friends; they offer Vegan Sandwiches, which I've heard are quite tasty.  

I'm no newbie to Cajun Fries, as I'm originally from North Carolina, where I grew up eating Bojangle's Cajun Fries.  With that said, I did find FGBF a little overseasoned.  Next time I'm planning to ask if they can do lightly seasoned Cajun Fries, otherwise their regular fries are outstanding.  

The wait isn't long, but they offer peanuts to snack on (if you're not allergic) as you complete the final stage of your "Get Some Beef in May Bellay" mission.  

My favorite part is an often overlooked place to excel in the customer experience, the soda dispenser.  As I approached this fancy pants machine, I'm noticing all of these buttons!!  I press the Diet Coke button and then receive another (no less than) 6 options for flavored Diet Coke, ranging from cherry, cherry vanilla, vanilla, orange, lime, and one more.  They even offered all of these choices in the Caffeine Free Diet Coke variety as well.

They don't have a Drive-Thru window, but they offer online ordering.Can't explain how happy I am with their service. They only took 45 mins to restore my foggy headlights. I highly recommend this shop!!!!Not a single complaint about this place! 

We decided to bar hop a bit before heading to see Mason Jennings last night, and when we arrived at the Crescent Ballroom we were actually kinda pissed we didn't just hang out there before the show.  Here's what I liked about the place:

~friendly staff
~nice outdoor patio
~reasonably priced drinks
~an audio feed into the restaurant/bar area... this was especially nice because we didn't have to miss anything to get drinks or go to the bathroom.
~plenty of seating and standing room to watch the show
~a second smaller stage outside the main stage (had a guy playing as the Mason Jennings show let out).

We didn't try any of the food but we're gonna try to get back here for another show as soon as we can!I've seen some great bands at the Cresent ballroom. The fact that the food is top notch just adds to why we love this venue.Everytime we come here they are always super nice . We haven't tried a pizza that we didn't like . My personal favorite is the BBQ chicken :-)I moved to Scottsdale about 6 months ago and I needed a good quality Nail Salon. I walked in without an appointment my first time and they assured me it would be a wait but offered me water and were very friendly. I have been to probably 12 out of the 17 techs they have there and I have NOT ONE complaint or concerns. Their pedicures are the best I've ever had and not to mention my gel/acrylic nails are to die for. They've given me so many amazing sets that I get compliments on them daily and I travel all over the U.S for work. I would highly recommend ProNails for an amazing experience. Julie and her team will take great care of you!My daughter and I come here whenever we are craving Chamango. The store is clean and the ladies behind the counter are always friendly.I thought Susan gave an outstanding massage.  I've had several and this was the best one so far.  It was extremely thorough and I felt totally relaxed when I left.   She's very friendly and professional.  The office was peaceful and pleasant.  I highly recommend that you pay Susan a visit to get the knots out!I have gone to EVD since I moved to Arizona 6 years ago. The entire staff is professional, friendly and it seems they do not have a high turnover rate because most of the girls that were there when I started going are still employed there. To me, that speaks volumes about a doctor's office. While I have seen many of the medical providers here, I am a patient of Dr. Chen's. She is an amazing doctor and is sure to explain everything thoroughly to me. I appreciate feeling like I am a valued patient as this is something that slips through the cracks with many medical providers. As long as I am living in the Valley, I will be a patient at East Valley Dermatology.Have already recommended this hotel to many friends. All my friends who visit here are very satisfied. Awesome! reasonable price and great service.Guuurl! If you want to get your grub on this is the place to be! My friend Lary and I stopped in here for a late dinner on Saturday night. Seems like we came at the right time! It was more of an adult crowd as all the families were leaving and taking their kiddies with them. The look of the restaurant is pretty impressive. Very nicely decorated. Sort of a "by the pier" sort of feel with the brick and wood poles. Love it. 

The service was incredible. We were greeted and seated right away. After one person took our order another server came over to make sure we had everything we needed. Very friendly! Everyone was so attentive. Even as we were paying and leaving the people at the front (who appeared to be the owners) were very nice and asked us what we liked most about the place and offered different menu suggestions for next time. We are totally coming back for that! I like it when people actually give a shet about the customers and try and find better ways to service them! 

The. Food. Was. Incredible! I am a delicate flower! Do you want me to eat with mah HANDS??? Do you know who I am? I don't get my nails done to use them as tools! We ordered two pounds of shrimp lemon peppered and sweet potato fries. The shrimp came in a big plastic bag with the soupy sauce and a small corn cob. My friend had to teach me how to take apart these little monster shrimp to get to the goodness! ha! After the first one, I was a freakin pro! Two pounds was more than enough for the both of us! The shrimp was huge and delicious in the garlicky lemon pepper sauce. Not too spicy either as sometimes "hotness" can take away from the actual taste for me. 

All I can say is WOW! I was very impressed and WILL be returning with my claws to dig out some more seafood!After eating at heart attack grill, I came here to check out the transformers, it was a pretty awesome store, I wish the dude from pawn stars was there, overall classic toy shop may the force be with youIf you like Seafood you have to add Tempest to your list.  I had an exceptional experience trying Tempest for the first time.  The Oysters were absolutely delicious.  They offer a variety of Oysters From both the East and West Coast.  They also have a selection of clams, mussels, and crab.  Make sure to get one of the towers of hand picked oysters, clams, mussels, and crab by the chef.  You will not be disappointed.  I had the tuna for my main course and it was truly exceptional.  I will definitely be back.just moving into Soho and stumbled upon The Lady Silvia. ABSOLUTELY loved it! Incredibly nice people, welcomed us to the neighborhood. Loved the atmosphere! If you live in Vegas and know of the Griffin, it's kinda like Griffin meets a library with a Cheers neighborly feel. I just got the keys to my place today and I'm already in love with this as my new hang out spot. Best part, bring your dog to the bar!I went to the salon for a updo for my graduation and Ashley Gramer was my stylist and she was Awesome!  Very friends and professional I am for sure going black to see her again for any of my hair needs. The salon was clean, we'll put to get together, the front desk girl was nice and friendly I would recommend this salon to any one very happyGreat service. Bar staff is very knowledgable about the menu and drinks. Awesome happy hour. I consider this place a diamond in the desert where locals can go and get some great food from across the pond as well as great drink specials.I love my lash extensions by Layla! She's such a perfectionist, that they always come out looking glam but natural. I've gone to many other lash extension artists before, but and they have never even compared to the work that Layla does. 

She always personalizes the sizes she uses to match the shape of my eyes which brings out the contour of my natural lash line. I love this because it makes them look natural and lush and CLASSY instead of like a glued on strip or stripper lashes that I see on a lot of girls in Scottsdale.  

When she does my lashes, they never come out clumpy or itch, and they always last the longest. As they do start to fall out, they stay pretty natural looking because I won't have random clumps missing. 

Also, the quality of lash and glue she uses is great. My eyes are sensitive and I wear contact lenses but her products never irritate my eyes. 

I also LOVE the cooling gels pads she puts under my eyes to separate my bottom lashes from the top ones. It not only feels amazing but makes my eyes look less tired after. It feels rejuvenating and relaxing! At most places they just use tape (yuck) which I hate because of the adhesive irritation I get from it. 

I've recommended WINK to everyone who inquires about my lashes, and all of my friends who have gone to her have been satisfied.I made  reservation here for 11:30. Parking was tough though.

I had the Salmon lovers roll and the Spam Musubi. the Salmon lovers roll was pretty awesome and the Spam Musubi was really good. The location and the prices is what really got me to come here. My friend had Udon and he said it was good but it didn't have as many toppings as other places. However, this might be good for people getting over a hangover! Can't wait to try some of the other dishes!Drunk or sober, their food is amazing. The atmosphere is casual, and of course, Hawaiian. We went on a Friday night when they had live music. Awesome! They have an extensive menu for both sushi lovers & sushi rookies. Locals, did you know you get half off sushi rolls?! Sweet! We got a bottle of wine for our table for under $8. Talk about cheap. I highly reccomend the Salmon Lovers roll, the Island Special, & the Makaha Roll. This was a great experience. Great service. Great soul food. Fun Hawaiian music.I don't know what I was eating before Grimaldi's, but it wasn't pizza. Hands-down, the best pizza of my life. In the Mid-West, we have a wide variety of pizza, from thin crust to thick, and even some deep-dish. But nothing compares to Grimaldi's brick-oven, thin crust, with fresh mozzarella and house-made sauce. 

The husband and I were looking for some place to eat near the Fashion Show Mall, but we didn't want to eat in the food courts. Grimaldi's popped up on the Yelp app. The location is near the "back" of the mall (in relation to the Strip), but it's definitely worth the trek.

We ordered a ceasar salad (great salad, but not the best I've had) and a small pizza with pepperoni and red peppers. The peppers are amazing! We split a cannoli for dessert and it was one of the better cannolis I've ever had. 

There is a fair selection of beers on tap and in bottles. Being from the Mid-West, there were plenty of West-Coast beer options that I'd never tried before. 

Everything about Grimaldi's is awesome. Good salads, AMAZING pizza with quality ingredients, good beer selection, great desserts, classy but casual atmosphere, AND reasonable prices.Hot dogs on crazy flavor steroids! Oki dogs got nothing on this place.12oz of hot, yummy goodness with a kick of caffeine. 

I said to the barista "I just want a good cup of coffee." She smiled and said, "That's what we do." Then she asked what type of coffee I liked (medium roast, not too strong) and let me smell the corresponding jars of coffee beans. I selected the highly aromatic Costa Rica beans and about 2 minutes later I had a freshly brewed classic cup of coffee. Perfect. No cream or sugar required. Did i mention it was only $2.11?

I would definitely recommend this place to friends. The atmosphere is laid back and inviting. The staff is awesome. So helpful and personable. Lots of high top tables and a comfy couch and chairs in the corner. A good place to relax and wind down or get your day started. Win.This coffee has so much flavor. I think Starbucks has competition after drinking an Iced Vanilla Latte. I recommend this place to anyone looking to try something different and delicious! They have a nice spacious lounge area with a good relaxing vibe. Definitely coming back with friends next time!OkGot their standard specialty burger and wow it was so good. Had a nice moist and meaty patty and fresh toppings.

The fries were the type I like kind of like Mickey D's but thicker. 

I finished off with fried Marshmallows, yum!

Price was right too! Used a coupon!Great experienceSo grotesquely overwhelming, multitudinous, bombastic, and monolithic that it's like a volley of regret straight to the aortas of your now barely pulsating heart. That beating organ is now like a deflated tire after roaring across a police issued spike strip. 

How does Hash House a Go Go exist? Even if you're drunker than a 19th century prospector, it's still easy to feel bad about stuffing your face with the food that's served in this restaurant. Forget reading Dante's Inferno; this place is like living the third circle of Hell. Everything is perpetually slathered in gelatinous gravy, propped up by creaking pillars of bacon, or slathered with butter and pancake syrup.

But...

It's so good. 

If your girlfriend is laboriously attempting to make eye contact with you, even as you ram fried chicken the size of a Buick down your throat, your brain will still refuse to emit shame. You will make her sign a disclaimer, before you enter the restaurant, that says, "As your girlfriend, I will still love you even after your body absorbs seven biscuits in thirty nanoseconds."

And you know what? That obligatory story about how quantity overwhelms quality is an old wives tale when it comes to the hallowed ground of Hash House a Go Go - everything here deserves to be stuck to your incisors. 

So go on and make it rain, Hash House a Go Go. In this case tears of defeat and of joy.We always eat here when staying at the plaza. We've never waited in line, the food in in large portions and delicious!

I usually get the chicken, mozzarella , and corn hash which comes with some eggs
And a large yummy biscuits. The scrambles are eggcellent too. The juices are fresh squeezed we love the orange and tangerine and the coffee is fantastic. I've had the s'more mocha( you've never seen anything like this) and the ice tractor coffee.

Wait Til you see the pancakes! They're folding over the plate!

I've seen burgers, sage chicken and waffles all piled high at the tables around me. You really can't
Go wrong! Try one Dish today and
A new one on your next visit!awesome food...huge portions....worth the waitThe best carpet cleaning service I have ever used, by far.  The guys were very professional and knowledgeable, worked efficiently and my carpet looks and feels clean and fluffy again  --  and I thought my carpet migh be beyond help.Great donuts all the time every time! Cake and raised always on point, although I like cake best. Service is top notch too.Just an overall fantastic experience. Super friendly staff and amazing team. I look forward to heading to Waxperts each month for a day of pampering and "cleaning up." Run, don't walk.Great Studio with a great staff!! Very friendly and productive atmosphere!!
Music and Dance lessons are offered, go in and check them out!!Listen,  I cant put into words of wisdom what I experienced here, all I can say is GO!  Stop reading all the reviews and just experience the place for yourself. The 5 stars is from a guy who just loves to eat great food.... I've traveled all over and have eaten at fancy restaurants without having 1/2 the experience I had at Barrymore's. The strip is loaded with big name chefs turn restaurateurs and some have succeeded and some have failed. The key to surviving in sin city is not your celebrity name, who you know and blah, blah, blah...



Taste, Quality, depth, creativity, comfort and off the hook-great service-BAM!


The Barrymore has it all-



I'm done..........exit, stage left!

JUST GO!Food is great, and staff is really friendly. I had the bacon cheeseburger with fries and a drink. The price was reasonable, and on top of that, I also received an additional 10% off for being a business owner. I am definitely going back to try the cheesesteak which looked amazing!i love the atmosphere and the style there. Very comfortable and relaxing. Great style on cuts. I highly recommend Justus if you are looking for an edgy, stylish cut.Embers has always been a favorite stop of mine, not only for the great selection of wines, dishes and desserts, but now that they have added a new, young and extremely talented and innovative chef, the restaurant has kicked it up a few notches!  From fantastic and unique appetizers to mouth watering fish, chicken and beef entrees to the delectible desserts, Embers has it all!  The ambiance and the wait staff complete the excellent experiences I have each and every time I visit. 

 Anyone looking for a "strip" restaurant experience without the prices, or dealing with the strip itself, this is the spot to be at!  You will be delighted with the atmosphere, the service, and the value for the price that you receive at Embers.I love this Place. Jenny is the best. it's even better when she dresses like Hatsune Miku!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! a Vegas must now.amazing experience.  went here for my dad's birthday dinner and it was an overall 5 star experience.  I would give it 10 stars if they had the option. Our waitress Felicia was awesome. she was on top of our drinks and food and was very friendly and we went on a day that they wore super hero outfits and she was wonder woman which was appropriate given that it was busy and she still took very good care of us as a server. The food was also amazing I got the 16 oz rib eye and the steak was so good it seemed to melt in my mouth with every bite and at the end Felicia grabbed a saddle and had my 54 year old father sit on it and did the Texas roadhouse yeeeee haaaaaawwww song and dance. just an amazing experience and I will be back in the future. being there is a black angus and another steakhouse right next door to each other there is no comparison even the price was good. best steakhouse hands down. A must visit if you are ready to have fast friendly service and amazing food.This place is great!  We recently moved to the Mesa area from Chicago.  We've been here several times and I've tried something new each time and everything has been fantastic!  And to top it off the service is always friendly and fast.Nice friendly staff, I definitely recommend if you need some custom orthotics, or the right fit shoe!A nice place in old-town, Went here with a friend, I tried the Jer-making-me chicken sandwich, it was really good.  we used a daily deal.  The overall experience made a good impression.  The environment is a very laid back feel, which is a nice change of pace for the area, no need to dress up, check it out, enjoy a beer, and see for yourself.Professional and courteous service from start to finish! Aaron did an awesome job getting the knots out of my shoulders!Before finding Brent, I NEVER walked out of the salon liking the way they styled it.  I always had to grow into the style and color.  With Brent, I am amazed by how much I love it.  I have received more compliments on my hair than I ever have before.  The cut is soooo beautiful that I cannot say enough wonderful things about it.

As for the salon itself, it's so down to earth, but classy.  Their customer service is unparalled and each of them are as beautiful inside as they are out.  On a side note, the female stylists are lovely, but the male stylists - OH MY GOODNESS!  They are fun to look at, but aren't outrageous egomaniacs.  

I recommend this salon highly!I needed to get my tile and carpet cleaned and heard about Carpet Star here on Yelp.  With the high rating, I thought I would give them a try.  Boy I'm glad I did!  Steve was very nice on the phone and came to my house on time when he said he would.  He did an amazing job on the tile grout!  It looks 100 times better than ever before.  I really can't believe how clean it got, since the color was black and now it's bright white.  Looks like a new floor, amazing!  Then I had Steve clean a few rooms off our kitchen and dining room.  It smells very nice and I can tell he spent some time going over a few spots that needed some extra attention.  I can't tell you how happy I am for using Carpet Star and I would highly recommend them for any tile and carpet cleaning.  I'm one happy customer!  Thanks Steve!A new place for vegan with so many options! I will be back!Awesome place!! EXCELLENT food/apps(try the bleu cheese figs)! Ask for Dizzy Dre, he's AWSOME and listens to your likes and customizes drinks for you!! Very patient with women!! ;)I enjoyed their nightly sashimi special, with Echigo rice beer, and great service. I will return. Thank you house of modern sushi.I thought I was going to have to go have horseshoes made for my hooves until I met Vicky!  I have been going to see her for over a year and she performs magic on my feet!  By far the best pedicure I have ever had.  She has a great selection of colors to choose from.  Bonus, does a great job waxing my eyebrows too... Can't wait for my first facial with her!It was delicious exactlly what i wanted. some light healthy tasty food.  I will be going back again.  As someone who lives downtown  we need more places  like thisThey gave a quote and came the next day.  Very quick job with assembling a baby crib, chest, and drawer set including moving the items up to the room, assembling it, and moving the items to the desired location, and taking the trash back down to the garage.

Things to note:  They don't dispose of your garbage, they move in two-man teams usually, and they're very quick (finished assembly in about two hours).   They also came with short notice which was appreciated.  Only take check/cash as of this review date.

Price was very reasonable and definitely would use again.My husband brought me here.  Here after he had been a couple times and he knew exactly what we were going to have...the 20" cheese steak with sweet peppers, hot peppers and mushrooms.  We of course split it.  It was awesome.  One of the best cheese steaks I have ever had.  It doesn't seem to be that busy in the evening, which is when we went.  That was nice, we didn't have to stand in line and got our food right away.  This place is nice change from the usual.Super service and great food. I tried the half and half with a chicken/avocado skillet and protein pancakes. DELICIOUS. 
Will be back next week.This China City has been open for 3 1/2 months now, so I dropped in for lunch yesterday joined by Mike C. to see if it's still excellent, as it was at the beginning.

This time there were 137 food choices out, plus sauces, dressings, & gravies, & everything was still tip-top.  The dining area itself is smaller than average for a "Super Buffet", but the big food selection is right up there in the top group.

Today we found the staff to be very friendly & everything about the food & the atmosphere & the pricing just right for this type of place.

Some standouts for me today were the delicious Sushi, the excellent Mongolian style BBQ with Kong Pao Sauce, & the great Maple Walnut REAL ice cream, one of four!     :-))

Weekday Lunch Buffet $7.99/$7.19 Sr.I just completed this hike and made a video, see for yourself if you want to accept the challenge.

http://youtu.be/lHASly540w0Ok, it's a Chipotle Mexican Grill. It's exactly like all the others, and the menu is the same.

That being said, it is inside a mall, and has a reasonably large and clean seating area outside the restaurant in the concourse. The food was good, and the staff was efficient and served promptly and hot. It is possible to get some variability in the freshness of the food and cleanliness of the location of course, and on both points this location was great.

The only reason I'm adding my review here, since I don't think every single Chipotle needs a review, is that it was one of my best meals in Vegas. The last time I was in Vegas it seemed a little easier to find something vegan. Especially in some of the $100+ per person restaurants, I'd expect the chef to be a bit more accommodating.

Anyway, two thumbs up (and five stars!) for finding a Chipotle convenient to my hotel, the Palazzo.I purchased my in ground spa a little over a year ago.  I have needed Tim and the Spas by Design crew come out a couple times for little random things, nothing major.  Each time I called and spoke directly with Tim and he had someone out to my house the next day.  The spa is amazing and the entire Spas by Design team from sales to service has been nothing less than exceptional.  I would recommend purchasing a spa from Spas by Design to anyone in the market, just ask for Bob.Unbelievably great mix of food and atmosphere. Easily 5 stars. The GM and our server Chancy were very friendly and made our experience here memorable. The chef has recipes that will excite anyone's taste buds. Highly recommend the boneless baby back ribs, brussel sprouts, cucumbers and yogurt, blackened ahi and the cheesecake. Simply put, a great dining experience, a must try.Started a few weeks ago and I absolutely love it. The owners are both friendly, caring, and personal. The staff and other members are nice as well. This is the most comfortable and welcoming environment I've experienced at a gym. In addition, you will not find a gym with more advanced equipment. I'm grateful I found a place that I enjoy so much. It has me excited to go to the gym.Professional 
Friendly
On time AND affordable!
We will definitely call again if we need their irrigation repair services!!So much fun. Exercise while you drink. Bike thru downtown Scottsdale and your like an instant celebrity! People waving at you and taking photos. So much fun!  They have a deal right now, sign up for it! What a great experience!Well, I disagree with the previous reviewer.  We love Tao Kitchen.  We've only sat down and eaten there once, but order take out a lot now.  The time we ate there, the service was fine, the won ton's were fine, I didn't care for the soup, but i don't really like soup anyway.  The orange chicken is the absolute best and we had the orange beef this week and it was very good too - not overbreaded, just darn good!  Their egg rolls are great and their crab puffs are mighty tasty as well.  Their lunch specials are a fantastic deal.  You get the same amount as you do at dinner, for a lot cheaper and lunch specials run until 4.  We sometimes go before 4 and just pick up dinner early to save a few bucks.  i welcome this gem to the neighborhood and hope they do well - we'll be crushed if they don't!I've always wanted to try this place but I always just drive by it on the way home. Finally, I decided to try it and I have probably made the best decision doing so. The staff here are nice and when I came through the door I was greeted and seated. I ordered takeout orange chicken with rice. The food was made to order and delicious.  Food tastes authentic and comes in great portions. Definitely will be coming back soon.Thanks to all the awesome reviews I had to check this place out myself. Five star treatment all the way! The staff is super customer focused. I had a gel manicure and their options were by far the best that I have seen. Glitter and color galore!! This place is clean, as they bring out your own nail equipment nicely sealed in those packets they use at the dentists office. Not only that but prices are reasonable. I really felt valued as a customer - would definetly go back!!!Just moved nearby and gave them a try. The customer next to me finished her pedicure a few minutes after mine started. I watched them meticulously clean the chair. My pedicure was great. I brought my 5 y-I daughter and she had a mani-pedi and was treated like a princess. All-in-all it was a great experience and I will return.Dr. Koagedal is professional, compassionate and accommodating.  I have been suffering insomnia for years and he has helped me improve my sleep.  I recommend him highly!
Sleepless in San FranciscoSimply amazing! Had the Egg Plant Parmesan & it's the best I've had in a while!Had the nautilus sub, was HUGE and delicious. And a veggie burger, that was SO yummy and chucked full veggies. Great potato salad & the fries are fresh cut!! GO! Such an original.My experience at New York Flavor has always been a GREAT ONE! I have enjoyed many different types of food. From sandwiches, lasagna, hotdogs, hamburgers, and my favorite meal BACON!!!!
Please listen to me go to NYF if you are craving deli with a bit more varietyIn a strip mall, just before you come into Sun Prairie from the south, there's a Pizza place on the right. Go there! Take out if you must but go there.

S.U. and I had heard good things and, mid week, made the trek. No crowds on a Wednesday, Great friendly service and a menu full of specials. Now, I'm ordinarily a double anchovies on a simple pie guy but, we went for the smoked gouda, bacon, caramelized onions and tomato special. Out of this world. On top of that several good beers on tap and a decent wine list! The reasonably priced Spanish Garnacha (Grenache, north of the border), was excellent. For some unknown reason, we were offered a 20% discount on the wine (we accepted) and that made the bottle even more reasonable!!

I should also mention the salad, tossed in a bowl before serving and beautifully presented.

5 stars! As good as it gets!All eyelash places aren't equal and this place is a 10 in my book!

I have been obsessed with wanting eye lashes noticing them on many of my clients for a while now. They make everyone so pretty! 

So I tried one place and they put on clusters which lasted less than a week that were so painful from too much glue. 

I found @ Lash and they save the day! They removed the few sprigs left which I called shooters, LOL! and put on individual ones with surgical glue in 2 phases. I had the first application and 2 days later a fill of shorter ones to make them look natural.  I cannot believe how my prettier I look and feel. They are holding up really well too! The gal that does them is such an upbeat spirit too! I cannot wait to go back.
 I think their prices are great.  They offer a package of 4 fills ($25 each) for $100 which is excellent!

Their salon is super cozy and cute too. Black and white in animal prints with red accents. 

While I was laying there 3 different clients dropped in just to say hi because they were in the neighborhood. What great Karma I thought. 

Warning... do not open your eyes to see anything during the process like I did! The fumes of the glue will get you!One of my favorite restaurants in Vegas and its close by! The staff is really nice and excited to see my family and I every time we walk in.

The teriyaki salmon is my favorite from the lunch menu. I crave it and its greatly priced. Also the shrimp tempura, must get. 

I love taking friends from out of town to hibachi, they feel like we are really going all out at a fancy Vegas restaurant. I'm like a kid watching them cook in front of me. 

My mom tells me i need to stop telling people about her favorite restaurant. Lol :)Went there for their Hibachi and enjoyed the show & food. Returned there today for their regular menu and we were not disappointed. Good food and service with avg prices. 

If your looking looking for a nice Japanese restaurant or a good Hibachi show this is the place to go. This is going to be a regular spot for us.i would give 10 stars.. love this place. I have been here over 20 times. I consistently receive an awesome massage. The place is clean and comfortable..They always give a warm welcome to anyone who stops in!!!!My husband and I tried Sin City Club Crawl for the first time.  It was our second time in Vegas and the night was an absolute blast!  The hostesses were friendly and cheery all night.  The bus was huge, clean and nice and cool.

Would definitely do it again!We called them to replace a garage door spring that had broken.  I had no idea who to contact for this job, so I searched here on yelp and found them.  Jeff showed up exactly on time and fixed the problem.  He was very nice, very hard working, and provided us with a warranty.  We would definitely contact him again for any other garage door issues that we may have in the future.  We are so glad we read the reviews here and used their services.I have been to several other places like this but Fogo is the best.

my wife took me there for lunch and we started with the fresh and tasty salad bar. I'm a carnivore but the salad was just too good not to try. I wanted more but I decided to save my hunger for the real star....meat.
As soon as i flipped over the card from red to green the food started flowing. The first bite let me know just how great the rest of the meal was going to be. All the beef was so flavorful. The lamb selection was great too. The chicken leg was moist and tasty. 

Service was great. They kept the mashed potatoes coming, the cheese bread was yummy, the fried bananas were perfect.

Finished the meal with the creme brulee/flan. Even though we were too full eat more, there was enough room for dessert.

They do a great job here and the meats were all deliciousI had no clue what to expect when eating at a Brazilian steakhouse. It was delicious!!! The waiters were VERY attentive! Not use to that... Wasn't a bad thing. They never let your drinks go low, anytime you turned your card over for more meat, 5 or so people came right away! Their bread and fried bananas were to die for!!! Worth the $50 for dinner.  Definitely going back!Not sure if you want to eat here or that other place?  Eat here.  Not only do I think the quality is better but the sauces are like crack.  Only more addictive.  The whole shabang or the garlic is the way to go imo. And make sure you get some potatoes to soak up the sauce!  This was supposed to be just a "tip" but I wanted to give 5 stars.  Oh yes and our waitress was on it too. Great food great service What more can you ask for? GoAwesome homemade pasta, we had 4 different types and they were all incredible! Our server, Shaun, was very personable and immensely knowledgeable about the menu. Will definitely go again! Oh and the salty carmel dessert was amazing!Went here on Saturday night for a date night with my boyfriend. Both of us had never been here before and we were craving some Italian food.  I had seen on the menu they make their pasta in house and the reviews looked good so we decided to try it. I am so happy we did! I had the bolognese pasta and he had the spaghetti and meatballs they were both excellent dishes. For desert we had some salted carmel thing I cant remember the name but it was delicious!!! We will definitely be returning. The service was great too!!!Great service, decor, and FOOD,

I've only eaten here once, but highly recommend the bolognese pasta, strozzapreti, chicken parm & zucca chips!

The pastas are fresh and the flavors & portions are great!Had lunch and it was great!!Very friendly & my bichons were happy and looked great!Bruschetta was amazing. Ambiance was perfect for a valntines day date. Service was great.You can get a 3-ounce taster of any of the beers on tap for $1 or $2 each. I went with a group of friends, and we tried ALL THE BEERS. It is a night that will live on in the annals of history. I highly recommend it as an adventure, a group bonding activity, and an opportunity to discover new beers you like.

The food is mighty tasty. I've had sweet potato fries at a lot of places, and these are hands-down the best. They're a little on the salty side, but that's how I like them. If only they offered them with Delux's aioli, then we'd be in business. We also got a meat & cheese plate and the grilled chicken flatbread pizza. They were both quite tasty and disappeared quickly.

Our server was great. We were a big group, and it would be easy to mess up with all of those tasters. But he got everything right and checked in with us regularly. It also didn't hurt that he was a cutey patootey.

The only con was that we were seated in an alcove with two booths, and it got really loud with all the sound bouncing around. I wish they'd put up a curtain between the booths and something on the walls to dampen the sound. For now, I'll just ask for a different table.My wife and I ate here last night, and it was terrific. Ordered the Arizona burger, pink, it was delicious. And the sweet potato fries were perfect.  My wife ordered the Brisket sandwich, and let me tell you, it convinced me to come back for the all you can eat BBQ they have on Sundays. The beer selection is top notch with around 12 from local sources. Inside is huge, and they have nice outside seating as well. You can tell by how crowded it was that its a favorite with a lot of people.Vanguard is one of the finest financial companies that my husband and I have ever dealt with.  We were with several large institutions over the past 45 years and were introduced to Vanguard through family in North Carolina.  Helpful, professional, friendly, and knowledgeable, Vanguard has gone above and beyond in assisting us with our financial planning and with our sisters estate when she passed away in February 2014.  It was a comfort to know Vanguard followed up and made some very useful suggestions during this difficult time.  Please note the 5 Star rating and my compliments to a company who makes you feel more like family than a customer/client.  Thanks Vanguard, we appreciate all your efforts over the past 4 years on our behalf.  You are - "Woohoo!  About as good as it gets!   Rita R.Excellent!  Great food, service atmosphere. Went there with the family and we tried all sorts of dishes. Everything was great!  We will definitely go back!You will NOT be disappointed. Gio is FANTASTIC, did I say FANTASTIC Chef. If you have the opportunity, you have GOT to experience Gio work.It's been a little bit since I made the trip up I-15 to Craig Road and headed West to visit Chef Gio and OSP. I wondered, what all had changed? Would it be as good as I remembered? I worried for nothing. I stepped in the door to a Hello and a smile, and it was on. Today I kept it simple. A combo slice, a drink, and some garlic knots which a customer told me were the best things ever. Turns out that customer was right, the hand made sauce and the complex flavors of these garlic knots were over the top good. And my slice? Absolutely perfect. 

I've had a very, very rough day and OSP's comfort food and Chef Gio's positive attitude and service with a genuine smile was just what I needed. This is not just pizza, this is comfort food for me at it's absolute best. 

Chef Gio, I have no choice but to move you to my Mythical 6th Star list. While Yelp only lets us technically give 5 Stars, I love your food so much 5 Stars just isn't enough. 

Oh and I don't want to forget: He now has real silverware for those who eat in, and he now accepts credit cards. Cash is always welcome though. 

Seriously, the Garlic Knots put my favorites from Benny Blancos in Denver to total shame, and I craved those dang things.Very friendly guys. They have things for those who take it seriously and also a lot of funny things. Must visit if you like zumbies.My hubby and I just had dinner here. We both enjoyed our meals and egg roll appetizer. The coconut ice cream with sticky rice and sprinkled with nuts was the highlight of our meal, as it was our first time experiencing. Now it's a favorite and we look forward to another great meal!My husband and I have been going to this place for a while.  Tony is always the best therapist for my husband.  I've had some of the excellent ones (Peter, David) but they are no longer there, so I have to go with a different therapist every time....

Anyway, this place gives great massage for a decent price.  Clean environment and friendly staff.  Btw, if you are a regular, they sell a batch of 10 sessions for $250, great deal!Bought a laptop for school. Alex was very informative, no B.S approach which i appreciate. I told him what i needed a laptop for and how much I was willing to spend , and he pointed me in the right direction. Definitely my new place for computer related issues.Great meal, there are only a few tables withe Fremont view, so make reservations early. Fremont light show starts at 7, so pace your dinner. Amy is a true Broad, loved her history of the joint. Scott was very attentive. Rib eye was delicious. Halibut was over the top ! Relax and enjoy the atmosphereExcellent two hour massage with Shylia.I love this place! It seems I go there weekly now. My new love(s) are the Las Vegas Rolls. To echo Candice's comments, the restaurant is clean and modern. The scrolling menus on tv monitors along the wall are great for sushi rookies like myself. The staff/owners are wonderful and ever-so patient. 

Nestled between Subway and Burger King, Sea Star is a hidden gem that should be found and frequented...often.Very clean and professional. Tina did an hour deep tissue and I left feeling amazing! I will definitely be visiting Tina again!awesome customer service every time and great food.. love eating here!Wow. With all of the anticipation surrounding the opening of this place, along with the history of such phenomenal pizza at the NY location, I had to try it. And it is better than I was prepared for. Believe the hype. 
Highest quality toppings that I've ever had on a pizza, crust that thin and crisp, cooked to perfection each time I have had the pleasure of dining here. Someday I will get a chance to try the thick pie but I will have to first overcome my love affair with the NY style. You may have to wait for a table and you may have to be patient for the food to arrive at the table but the wait is always worthwhile for such a quality product. You can't rush greatness.Friendly & accommodating and have always done a great job with our dog.I order their thai mango salad and enchilada soup every time I go and it's amazing every time I eat it. the ingredients are fresh and crisp and the soup is flavorful and creamy. it's the perfect lunch! and I love that they give you a chocolate covered strawberry with your meal as a dessert. my fave!!I just found Lucky Break a couple of months ago. Have been there 6 times now. The food is excellent and electric atmosphere.Breakfast Club redeemed my Phoenix experience.  

The food was excellent but the service... oh, the service!  If the option presents itself, sit at the counter.  The two gentlemen who work behind the curved the counter are the epitome of efficiency.  Clearly they take pride in what they do and have honed their skills to the point that they (uncannily) are able to anticipate just about everything.  Thinking about a cup of coffee to go?  It appears on the counter with your check.  Contemplating a no carb breakfast, all options-- including possible substitutions-- are presented.  During my brief time in the restaurant, it was clear that everyone who worked at BC genuinely cared about their clientele.  A woman named Betty walked in and an iced tea was waiting along with an english muffin prepared specially for her.  Was it called in ahead of time?  Not according to Betty: "they somehow know."  Just about everyone who entered the front door was greeted by name.  

If you've ever wanted to experience what 'flow' in a restaurant looks like, the counter at Breakfast Club is your place.  Sit back and let the staff take care of the rest.Better go see this Guy before he hits even a bigger Show Room.   Probably the most talented young Entertainer to hit Las Vegas in years.  We have seen most of Big Shows in Vegas and Moreno Tops all of them in shear talent.  We love the old style Las Vegas Entertainment were you can sit a Table with friends and have a few drinks.

Party on and do it now before it cost you $150 bucks!What an amazing show, truly one of the best in Vegas. If I could give 10 stars, I absolutely would... all of the rave reviews are right on target!

Frankie, his brothers, the band, the fun, and the entertainment make for the perfect night in Vegas. I have been lucky enough to see the show many times and love going back for more. If you don't know any of the songs, you'll leaving singing one of them and hop on iTunes so you can play your favorites day in and day out. 

Great show, wonderful and talented performers (and people)... this is a can't miss!OMG!!! Was up front, woohoo at Frank's filming last nite of his new Video.  He is just amazing!!! His band has soo much talent as well!!!  The girls play Violins and are in lil red dresses, sexy and talented wow! The dancing with the stars star, comes out as a Diva, soo sexy her dance routine!!!  Frank, has come a long way from the first time I saw him and his band on Fremount street!!!!  He is the next Elvis, he is soo handsome and he plays the Piano like Liberace wished he could, AWESOME! He played the harmonica, and the guitar oh and the drums with the drummer!! His Brother is Tony, plays bass and is handsome and amazing too!  The guitarist, drummer and horn section, wow,  were great too It was a treat for sure, great original music too!
I give it two thumbs up and 5 stars a must see show in Vegas!!!!  The song Diva, I think will be a huge hit!!!Here's the deal. For a while, I've been searching for authentic BBQ here in the city. Chains restaurants like Dave's and Lucille's are great but missing more of that southern down home feel. Enter Rollin Smoke, located in the shadow of the Las Vegas Strip, this small eatery is does everything right.

We got here around the lunch rush, and had to wait in a small line to order. The host/cashier was Dusty I believe, friendly guy, and he was quick and attentive. Because the staff is well prepared, the food was out within 10 minutes, very quick for a BBQ establishment, and it shows great preparation.

I ordered the Pit Special, and for 20 bucks you get a pick of 4 meats, 3 sides and a drink. That's enough food for 2 meals or to share. I ordered a piece of the catfish on the side, which was very good as well. Catfish is hard to perfect because you have to cook it through but not over cook it. I'm willing to attest that the catfish is about as legit as it gets.

The meat itself was fantastic, the ribs were tender but not greasy. It was nice and smoky with a good texture. Someone on here said the ribs weren't "fall off the bone", which  is correct. That's not to say it's tough, because it's not. Being smoked they way they are, they aren't greasy, they pull off the bone with very little effort. That's better than greasy, mushy "fall off the bone" people talk about when they use that phrase.


The sides were fantastic. The loaded mash was pretty good, not as good as some of the garlic mash I've had, BUT, excellent in it's own right. The mac and cheese was great. I'm kind of a mac and cheese snob, and nothing is as good as my moms homemade, but this was better than most BBQ/Southern restaurants. My one and only complaint was that the food could have been a bit warmer. That's it. 

For not much money you can eat like a king. Fast friendly staff, and great food makes this hidden gem a winner in my eyes.Rollin smoke catered a 150+ resident pool party for Sky Las Vegas Condos. Amazing, everyone loved the food. Chef Tim, his crew were on point and everything was served hot, fresh and absolutely delicious! I had so many people tell me "this is their new favorite bbq" We will be using them again!!I cannot wait to go back! The food was awesome! I had the brisket and chicken which had great Smokey flavor and wasn't smothered in sauce.  The prices are reasonable and there are a lot menu items to choose from.  My roommate got the burger and enjoyed it.I`ve had just about everything on the menu and have loved it all. This week I`m strung out on the pork chops. We had Jim and Joanne cater our company christmas party and it was so awesome i decided to do the same for my family christmas get together. It may have been the first year there weren`t any left overs. I highly recommend this place. Great people, great food!I eat here a lot. It's a good value for the price. Then sandwhiches are better then subway and way cheaper! Love them.I know you can't expect the world from a fast food sandwich shop but Jimmy John's is seriously awesome. The subs are leagues beyond Subway and they really are "freaky fast". I really think they make a delicious sandwich here.Dr.Wong is great and Rhonda has all the answers I love this place. It's right off 215 on rainbow. Fast appointments and short waits. I think the staff is lovey also. A lot of frames to choose from.Went to Public House a few weeks ago with my girlfriend!  Being a Scotch drinker.....I was very impressed with not only the selection, but my waitresses knowledge of single malts.  My girlfriend started with a smoked beer that was amazing.  We started off with some octopus, bacon wrapped dates and oysters that were all amazing.  We then split the Steak Frites, cooked perfectly and the sea bass...also amazing.  Overall great experience from decor, to service to food!Wow, where do I begin? My husband fancies himself a beer aficionado, so he was in heaven as soon as we walked in and were seated with the beer menu/ipad. I had scoped out the menu ahead of time, so I already knew what I wanted to order for lunch - the poutine and the bone marrow. Both were out of this world. I had never had bone marrow before, just seen it on a lot of travel/cooking shows. Wow, now I know what the fuss is about. Super excited to try poutine too, and it was also delicious. My husband ordered a steak and said it was delicious and cooked right to order. It was a pricey lunch, but I am so happy we went here!LOVE this joint!  Our new favorite Mexican place, thanks to Yelpers!

Been there twice now in as many weeks, even took the kids.  I still can't get you out of my mind, Casa Ramos.

First of all, this MUST be a family joint because the service is incredible and you can tell they really care about pleasing you as a customer.   The chips are fresh and hot and they have a few different kick ass salsas.  Their 'house' salsa has the perfect amount of kick and chunk, they also offered us a milder sals for the wimpletons at the table, then they brought me the jalapeño habanero salsa.  All three were fresh and tasty as hell.  I bet you can't have just one bowl of chips.

I get the carne asada burrito with green extra spicy enchilada sauce.  The meat is super tender, perfectly grilled skirt steak.  It practically melts in your mouth and you can tell its a good quality cut of meat.  My wife gets the chicken and steak fajitas, which were aslo amazing.

To top it off, we had fried ice cream.  Definitely a hand made house recipe and also seemed fresher than any fried ice cream we'd ever had.

God I love this place.  So much so, I had to dust off my yelp account to let everyone know.  Go, now, don't hesitate.  Oh and great house margaritas!Absolutely the best Mexican food in town! This was our first visit, and it  definitely wont be our last! Great food, wonderful service, and authentic atmosphere!Amazing!!!! The ceviche was awesome the Huitalocoche quesadillas were to die for, but the stuffed poblano pepper with shrimp and crab was exquisite!!!! Well worth your time and money if you are in the area. Definitely one of my regular places from now on!!!!The taco menu is amazing & so unique. This is not typical AZ Mexican food (it's more gourmet). It reminded me of another restaurant at The Quarter. I only had the tacos so I can't speak for the rest of the menu. They had tons to choose from. One had blue cheese on it. There was one with a fried egg.  Margarita was good. We went during happy hour. Got 10 tacos & 2 drinks for $33. Yum!My husband and I love this fun place with terrific food. Have always been a fan of Wally's, and Chris, the owner, has proved he has all of his fathers talent and more. Try the bbq baby back ribs. YumI have had the tacos, tortas, constra, fish tacos, and all their salsas. EVERYTHING IS TREMENDOUS. The owner is one of the nicest guys and all the employees remember my smiling face.rachel is awesome!!!!Came here with my fiance on a Groupon and ended up coming back almost every day after for a few weeks. their breakfast plate although the basics is absolutely perfect!! fresh homemade toast, homemade fresh hash browns and tons and tons of desserts to try and take home. All the employees over a week became what felt like family. If you go there and do not like it, there's seriously something wrong with you and you need Jesus. I'm just sayin ;-)My fiance has been raving about these tacos, so this past weekend they were at the Scottsdale pavilions and so I had to go try them! at first I thought it was strange that it had a Japanese flair on their truck and had Japanese drinks as well. My fiance ordered three different tacos (for him self) and since I'm a fan of chicken I got the chicken. they were AMAZING!!!!! my chicken ones were so awesome I wish I would have gotten more, I had a try of the others which were pork and beef and they were equally amazing. Even tho it is different they are awesome!!! next time we know where they are we are sooooo going back, Id highly recommend finding them and getting yummy good awesome food!!I've been going to Stacy for 3 years now and she is AMAZING!!! I've had my hair every color of the rainbow and she always knows exactly what I want and how to achieve it without ever damaging my hair! Recently I've been getting extensions done by her and I've just gotten my second set in and I couldn't be happier! Her color matching was ridiculous and the overall results have been life changing. I am moving out of state soon but will be driving back the 5 hrs each way to AZ to see Stacy every couple of months because I refuse to believe anyone can do hair as well as Stacy!! She is a beautiful person inside and out, and her passion for what she does is reflected in every one of her amazing creations!!!This is my fav Mex restaurant outside of Mexico. Maria and Mark are wonderful hosts who always remember my friend and me. Mark's margaritas are the best. Maria is truly a gourmet cook. IMHO, her mole sauce is the best ever (Mexico included). Chicken mole enchiladas are my HG. Don't know how she gets the chicken so tender. 

This is not a chain restaurant. No one is rushing you or pushing you to rack up your tab. It's tucked away on the SW corner next to the closed down AJs, so a little out of the way. But if you're looking for an authentic experience, give them a try.Had a terrific morning at machine guns vegas.  It started with FREE transportation from our hotel, yes FREE.  After a pleasant ride we arrived at the range.  We were greeted by a very attractive staff of girls who set up our shoot.  Then on to the range with our very own range master.  We shot the ruger hand gun, Mp5, H&K Mr556, M203 grenade launcher and the Saw.  NO disappointment here.  It was AWESOME.  I highly recommend this place.  Our actual package was the seal team VI package with added ammo and an added gun.  We were not shocked one bit by the price since we are around fire arms at home.  It is well worth the money!  If you don't know guns you may be in a little bit of sticker shock, trust me it is NOT over priced one bit.  Same prices as back home in michigan with the added benefit of hot girls and knowledgable staff.  YOU HAVE TO GO!!!!I've been here several times. Went again for breakfast this morning. The red velvet pancakes are delicious! My friend ordered biscuits and gravy, which were seriously the best I've had. The strawberry pancakes are good as well. Good food and good service, no complaintsBest Red Velvet pancakes. Something about it is just so so good. I've had my fair share of red velvet pancakes, and this place by far makes the best.  I've had a lot of things on their menu and they were all super duper good. A must place to eat for breakfast or brunch.Awesome breakfast.  We arrived around 8 am on last Saturday..no wait.  Good timing...there was a steady stream of customers while we ate.  Our server was super sweet and attentive.  I had the bacon and eggs, with an upgrade to the Lemon Ricotta pancakes.  The BF had the Piglet Skillet.  Boy, do you get your money's worth!!!  The breakfast potatoes were crispy, perfectly seasoned and delicious.  The Lemon Ricotta pancakes were perfect compliment - not too heavy, leaning towards a delicious crepe.  We both had food to take home but it didn't last - we ate the leftovers before lunch (we were organizing the garage and needed the carbs!)  We will definitely be back!My favorite breakfast place in las VegasBest upscale hip hop nightclub in vegas! If you are in vegas want a good
Dj and a good time you have to come here! Ask for me at the door ill get you right inThey always have something cool and the prices did go down and you never know what you're going to take home there..the bed bug guySo I use to go to Shila for my brows about 6yrs ago when she worked for another employer whom should remain nameless. Once she left the company I had a hard time finding someone to get my brows how I wanted. I moved to the Bay Area and found 2 ladies who came pretty damn close to what I liked but nothing on how Shila would do them. once I moved back I found out she opened up her own place so I just HAD to make a visit and now she is the ONLY person  I will allow to touch my brows. She def is my Eye Brow Threader for as long as I am in this town!Today started off like any other day, I wondered what I was going to consume to get proper morning nutrition. As with the last 5 days I've been in phx, I decided on a smoothies. God forbid my host doesn't have a vitamix, so I have to drive to random locations to get my fix. As per usual, I got my smoothie from whole foods and was satiated, as well as perplexed as to why I just bought a ten dollar smoothie and why I also got $180 worth of random items including bee pollen and nut cheese? Anyways, I walked to my car and noticed the sign for pizzeria bianco. I loaded my whole two bags into the trunk and went and found out its the same place as the original location that I heard people bang on about the whole time I was at ASU. I got the margherita, recommended by the friendly and accommodating Dave. After my first slice I was pleased that the pizza was not only tasty but didn't leave me feeling sick as would a slice from somewhere like hungry Howies or dominos. Hurray pizzeria bianco, you continue to please.Brunch was amazing. My girlfriends and I hit Wy-Knot on Sunday. All of our dishes were unbelievably good. My one friend for the stuffed French toast. It was divine! My other friend ordered the eggs Benedict special and it was incredible. I wasn't in the mood for breakfast food so I ordered the wilted kale salad. Wow. Tons of veggies full of deliciousness. This was my first time there and I will definitely be back. Love this place!This place is awesome!  Everything is made from scratch and the taste is out of this world!  Very wallet friendly & completely fresh food!  Highly recommend!  I've eaten there 3 times and love it!BTM is the best hockey supply store (or chain of stores) in the Valley. I prefer to come here (the Scottsdale location) for all of my hockey needs because they have everything under the sun when it comes to hockey! 

I love their selection of new and used pro stock sticks. This is probably the best part of the store, in my opinion. The fact that they have both new and used pro stocks (not just sticks, other equipment too) gives people the option to buy top-of-the-line products at modified prices. Granted, the sticks don't come with a warranty, but I rarely break them anyhow so it is very worth it. They also have pretty good sales every once in a while. But, their prices are already extremely reasonable and competitive so I can't complain, and no one else should! Their sharpenings are quite reasonable too, at $4 (or somewhere close to that) for FBV on skates purchased from BTM. 

An all around great store with great prices!Awesome sushi. Their hot rolls with the yum yum sauce are pretty yum yum. Also you have to try their salmon necks I forget what they called them.Daniel is awesome.  I was so stressed that they would not have time to fix my phone because they were closing in 30 minutes after driving over 2 hours the said they would be able to.  Daniel was pleasant and I didn't feel rushed at all!!!I ran into Scott, the owner and salsa maker, upon entering Whole Foods in search of cranberry juice.  He was sampling fresh salsas he just made.  He sells them in Whole Foods, all local farmers markets, and a small store downtown.  He was sampling 5: pico, mild red, guacamolito (medium green), taco shop green (hot), and death salsa (red hot).  I tried the spicy ones.  The death wasn't spicy to me - but then again I am a native Texan - but my nose ran and my mouth salivated at the greens.  I do love a good green sauce and not often do I find one I like.  The guacamolito has a bright limey flavor (lime zest added!) and the taco shop green is just fresh and green with serranos and jalepenos plus cilantro.  I am a big fan and bought both greens.  Then I had to buy tortilla chips so I could eat it right away :)  I highly recommend picking up some True Foods salsa!Tom's Thumb has become our favorite for breakfast, lunch, & dinner! Great coffee bar, quality food, and superior service! Exceeds expectations! Friendly staff...this is one restaurant that is an asset to the community. BTW, we patronize the full-service automotive services, too:)My girlfriend told me we should try this place because of the Yelp reviews - I was thinking she was nuts no way am I ever going to eat at a car wash. This place is unbelievable - great! We got there after 5 so it was sit down dinner only and they had the best service, great food, interesting decor and clean. Definitely well deserved 5 stars - must see to believe.One of the best food trucks in Vegas and it don't serve food -- just coffee drinks and smoothies.  

Wouldn't know much about the smoothies, but I have a serious caffeine addiction and Grouchy John's Coffee does a great job with espresso drinks and coffee.  First, the black coffee is great.  Grouchy John's uses coffee beans that are medium roast (not French roast or burnt like Starbucks beans).  After they grind the bean down, they brew up a strong tasting and flavorful cup of joe.  Thumbs up.

The espresso drinks are great too.  The honey latte is my favorite, offering a sweet steamed milk drink with a sweetness falling between a mocha and a latte.  The honey provides a nice sweetness, but not so much that the taste of the espresso is drowned away.  Love it.  The mocha should be celebrated as well--for those nights when you want a hot chocolate, but also need a pick up--it's delicious.

Finally, the truck offers great customer service.  The guys running the truck always seem to be in good spirits and crank out the drinks quickly.Love it here! The atmosphere is pleasant, they have almond milk (a big plus over Starbucks), wi-fi and board games, and the coffee is tasty. They also have a happy hour, which is pretty cool.Friendly atmosphere, down-to-earth vibes, and great coffee.  This is my regular go-to shop for caffeine and comfort :)This is seriously some of the best coffee around.  Stopped by for a quick cup of coffee with a friend.  The staff was so nice and the coffee was so good, we now meet here weekly for coffee and to catch up.Love this local authentic Cantonese seafood restaurant. Great food great serviceI'm dissatisfied with my current gym (I won't name names...) and decided to check out Mountainside.  This facility blows my current gym out of the water!  It's pristine, spacious and has plenty of room to grow. 

Every part of this gym was impressive.  The equipment is pristine and cutting-edge, and there are many items that traditional gyms don't have: TRX, heavy ropes, punching bags, a boxing timer, resistance tubes, kettle bells, platforms....the list goes on. 

The yoga studio is another highlight. It's fully equipped with ballet barres; listen to therapeutic-sounding cascade of water during one of the many yoga, pilates or barre classes.  

The locker rooms are actually a beautiful pre- and post-workout retreat.  Did I mention towel service?!!  Friendly, knowledgeable and courteous staff are a bonus.  And an awesome smoothie bar and apparel section. 

Drawbacks:  no basketball court or pool. My current gym has both but I don't use either, so their absence isn't a big deal to me. Also missing are sanitation stations. It would be helpful to have disinfectant handy to wipe down the equipment after use. 

I can see myself here. I hope they maintain the clean, pristine atmosphere!I had an itch to pick up a new , or at least new to me, firearm.  So I went to Wold West Guns , they generally have what I'm looking for and while I was at it I was going to have my P220 serviced. 

Well as usual I was greeted with a smile and great service, I explained what I wanted for the my SIG P220 and ended up getting a cerakote job and full service for it.  

I picked up my SIG P220 a few days ago and it looks amazing and shoots as good as the day I bought it . Everything is done better then I expected and would never get cerakote done anywhere else.


I recomed WIld West Guns for any custom work.  

I also picked up a new firearm that day

MikeThis place is the best! Quality is always consistent and everyone is friendly and dedicated. Peter, the manager, is awesome. He is incredibly attentive and super skilled. This is the first time that I get acrylic and it doesn't look fake, rather completely natural. I break nails easily and every time I get them fixed by him they always look as they are my natural nails, none can tell the difference.

The salon is always clean and fresh and they have superb massage chairs. 

So worth it!!!!!We arrived after 6pm, during dinner rush hour to a small, fast-moving line. While the menu seemed limited to about half a dozen burger choices and handful of other meat/non-meat options, the product finished with surprising flair.  I had the BBQ bacon cheeseburger (minus cheese in my case) and rosemary-garlic sweet potato fries.  

Let me say, THIS burger had that char-grilled black crunchiness you think of when biting into a perfect backyard burger in the mid-summer, with all the flavors of top-grade, savoury flavoured Angus beef.  Juices and oils dripped like rain off this sandwich.  For a fast-food joint, I never expected a simple order of sweet potato fries to have so much punch, either!  Ketchup was hardly needed, though I may have recommended a nice aoli dip to go with them.  

Staff were mostly young teens, though surprisingly cheerful.  The cashier girl even made it a point to come to our table to ask how we liked the meal and if this was our first visit in.  As we leaved, every available associate either thanked us for coming in or wished a good evening.  

If you have the zeal of a deprived, starving carnivore, make this a definite destination.  It's a rich, meaty hamburger that doesn't disappoint!This was a great place to visit.  I spent nearly 3 hours going through the various exhibits.  The interactive stuff was update technologically and unique.

The spin was more from a law enforcement angle rather than glorifying the mob.  

Nice tie in to role the mob played in the early days of Las Vegas.

Clean, well lit, and lots to see.

Highly recommended!I go to a lot of museums, and this one was one of the best. Not only is technology incorporated throughout, there are many interactive components to the exhibits. Even the location is significant to the museum. Organized crime has always intrigued me and the Mob museum does a great job of educating and pointing out some details you might otherwise miss.

If you're driving to the museum, park in the Main Street Station lot and walk a block to the museum. It's $3 but you get it back by showing your receipt at the cage in MSS or the California.

Oh, there is a locals discount too!Best massage ever. Don't think I'll ever go back to regular massages. This place had nice ambiance, clean bathroom. I've paid much more for massages that were not as good as the $50 massage I got here. Awesome.My pup and I love this PetSmart location. We have done some extensive training with Ashleigh, and she is hands down THE BEST!!! Honestly, she is the main reason we keep coming back. Take a minute and introduce yourself, you'll be anxious to start taking classes with her too. We also go to the Banfield pet hospital inside that location. I would have to give them 4/5 stars though. They have been behind schedule almost every time I go, but that is typical of a doctors office I suppose. I have also had to take my pup in to follow up on routine procedures. Other than that, they are very nice and seem to take good care of my little guy. I have used the grooming services once or twice, and I wasn't blown over the top impressed, but I think I need to give them another shot. Definitely see Ashleigh if you're at all interested in training, there are tons of different classes to choose from, obedience to tricks.Got the Spicy Shoyu Ramen which had robust flavor and perfectly hit the spot. 

I have to say in a comparison, Ramen Sora is probably #1 on my list of Japanese noodle houses right now. 

Will definitely be back!I ordered the vengeful ramen.. Oops it should have come with a warning "do not get on a vehicle that has a bad bathroom for the next 18 hours". It's a double burner... Burned on the way in and burning on the way out..  That being said it was the best inferno spicy ramen I've had.    If your getting on a plane eat the spicy ramen or at least insist on a aisle seat close to the front.  Oh the 2.99 curry char siu and mango mochi were awesomeMarriott's first Residence Inn in the UK is modern, almost to the point of being futuristic, comfortable, conveniently located on the south side of Edinburgh and a stone's throw from the centre of the old town. Each room includes a kitchenette so that guests can self cater although the hotel will shop for you as part of the service and serve complimentary breakfast. A maid even services your room each day and does the washing up! Rooms have all the mod cons you would expect with additions such as an i-playing device. There is an oven, microwave and cooker but no air conditioning or dishwasher as in the States. Heartily recommended nevertheless.This place is really more a 4-4 1/2 star place, but since I really want it to succeed & the owner (I'm guessing that's who me and my parents were chatting with) seemed super nice I'll just follow along w/the other five star reviews.

I grew up about a half mile (if that) from the strip mall this place is located & think besides the Quick Stop, Jesus Chapel, and Asian restaurant on the corner most places have come & gone.  Even though I'd like for these guys to find a possible better location where more people will find it, it sounds like they put a lot of time & effort into renovating this space & it's kind of nice for this neighborhood to have a cafe like this since there really isn't any other place like it in the area.  

It's not the largest restaurant, and the decor is fairly simple.  It's clean & despite it's small size there's quite a bit of seating.  

The food here is solid & like others have said it's CHEAP!  With the exception of a couple items everything on the menu is under $6 & is very tasty.  They're only open of breakfast & lunch, and you can get breakfast all day, which I like.

I'm not really sure what exactly you would consider this place.  Even though I didn't try any, they have more than a few coffee & espresso based drinks, but because they have so many sandwiches & wraps (as well as a couple salads) I really wouldn't consider this a coffee shop.  

As far as the food, its' yummy! I had the breakfast sandwich on a cibatta roll & everything about it was perfect from the egg, to the bacon, to the pesto sauce which added a pleasantly surprising taste.  My mom had the exact same sandwich, except on a bagel instead.  My dad had a grilled cheese.  It came w/avacado, tomato, & pesto as well (now that I'm writing this review I realize where the "pesto" in the name of the restaurant comes from...they add it to most of there sandwiches).  This sandwich was good as well.  

When I'm back in Scottsdale I'd stop by here again, especially for breakfast.Ok...you guys convinced me.  These are the best al pastor tacos I've had!  The flavor is above and beyond others I have tried.  The portions are especially generous, given the $2 entry.  Pic is just mouthwatering! :

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/taqueria-el-pastorcito-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#hE9164desFUpJ6yD0u3HXg

My friend ordered some quesadillas, and they took up the entire plate with generous portions, for a $5 bill!

Chorizo tacos are also very good!  A lot more fat and juiciness going on, just like it should be!  I've tried these at a few other places, and the chorizo seems dry in comparison.

I also like how the sides/toppings are DIY, so you can play around with their different salsas and toppings.  I liked the two green salsas, as they were a bit spicier than the red.

Comparing to the big names here in Vegas, I enjoyed this little taco truck much more!  Good thing it is not closer to me...I'd be eating here every other day!I was scared to go to a kiosk of all places to get my eyebrows and lip done. But when she handed me the mirror afterwards. My eyebrows were amazing!!!! I was so happy with her work. And it didn't even hurt! I regret the fact I didn't ask for her name. But whenever you you want amazing eyebrows and you're in the area. Give it a try!Postino never disappoints. I'm thrilled with their new downtown Gilbert location but more over their delicious bruschettas and excellent service. I went here for the opening party on St. Patrick's Day and had a fabulous time. The wine selection is, as always, superb.I'm a huge fan of this joint.  The wine and the food is really good.  I've recently become more adventurous with my food and this has really come in handy when trying their bruschetta.  I've tried almost all of them and they are all pretty good.  I haven't been for their awesome happy hour on Monday's and Tuesday's but it sounds amazing!Awesome bruschetta !!!  Sometimes service isn't the best.I have been coming to tip toe for years I originally began coming because it's right by my house but I kept coming thanks to the quality of services! Tommy is the best I always leave happy and with impeccable nails. He is so sweet he always remembers me and what I like and he also remembers everyone else that walks In the door. Great price & great quality!Great food, great service and pleasant atmosphere. I'll be back again and again.This place has the biggest pizza I have ever seen! You have got to try the 28" big boy :-) with friendly staff and fast delivery for a reasonable price I would definitely recommend this Big Boys Pizza to anyoneBest Pizza around. I would eat here everyday if I wasn't so fat. The staff is super nice except for the EMO girl.Reasonable all you can eat price and they have good service
Fish is fresh enough to enjoy
Worth to tryThis review is for the doggie day camp. I have taken my dog here a few different times for doggie day camp and I am pleased. Check in process is always easy and the employees are always friendly. I like that you can view the dogs in day camp through the big window and watch how your dog interacts with the other dogs. I like that they offer a treat time for an additional fee so that the dogs get a snack while they are there. I love picking my dog up and getting the "pawgress report" to see how he did for the day. Employees also point out which dogs my dog interacted with and played with during the day. My pup is always exhausted when I pick him up and usually falls asleep on the car ride home which is perfect and allows for a relaxing evening at home.This park is a unknown Jewell. On a hot day the kids can play on a rubberized playground with water jets keeping them busy running back and forth and staying cool. There are also two different playground sets for different age of children. 14 children ages 2 to 5 and another for ages 6 to 15. There's plenty of covered picnic tables for shade and clean restrooms op and you will see youth baseball and soccer teams practicing on the more than ample green grass areasMy favorite park.  Always clean, super cute and big.  Authentically carved trees (D+A=Love kinda thing.)  And the ducks are always fun to feed!Fresh and delicious! Calistro opened up right by my house and I am so happy about it! The veggie terrine dish is amazing, and the sweet potato mash is to die for. I've also had the steak, which was phenominal. They have high quality tea, of which I love the cranberry hibiscus flavor. Their drink menu also features hand crafted cocktails and an impressive wine list amongst other non-alcoholic drink options. 

The decor is clean and polished, with friendly staff and management. The space itself is very large, and so even if it is a busy night at Calistro, you never feel stuffy. Patio seating is available, and since the patio is enclosed they are able to control for climate. Im so pleased to have Calistro in my neighborhood, I hope they stick around for a while!Great complex for soccerI paid 1000$ for 3 days for a suite, got there and was able to tip 100$ and upgrade to the penthouse suite.

It's really nice and new. I would be down to come back here for my stay in vegas.This place is awesome!! Love the fresas con crema with a scoop of their homemade ice cream on top!! My kids love it. Highly recommend it.Awesome place. Every Sunday from 10AM to 2 PM. Food Fun shopping. Great people. Awesome ItemsI recently found out about this place when I was at the Farmers Market. I tried the Southern Fried Chicken with a side of rice and gravy...I love gravy and this was fantastic! I could drink a cup of that gravy it's so delicious! I came back the next week and tried the catfish poboy, and that was great also! I will come back again soon and try something else!I just wanted to said that, I am somone that like to scrap, been at so many locations and never, ever had this "great " experience I had from this company they're very people oriented, professional, this guys have the greates customers service I've ever seen on scrap business.  Not only that, the people at they're cashier window are really friendly as well!!! There has not been a time that I leave that place with a big smile on my face ..... I strongly recommend this scrap yard and I well always come back!!!Service was very friendly and fast. The food, though, was excellent. The omelette is served "pancake" style but one of the better omelettes I have had. I doubt I will ever eat breakfast in one of the casinos again. As hard as it is to screw up breakfast, most casino restaurants find a way. Since my guys and I are in Vegas twice a year for trade shows, we decided this is our new breakfast spot.I cannot overstate how amazing Chutneys is! The food is delicious and the service is excellent. I frequent this restaurant and cannot get enough of their food. The quality is outstanding, the presentation is attractive, and the buffet items contain staple Indian dishes like butter chicken, tikki masala, and a variety of curries. In addition to the staples, they rotate other dishes providing an excellent opportunity to experience new food. 

I frequent Chutneys with a friend who spent two years living in multiple regions within India. He has validated the authenticity of the food based on his experience.This store is not like your average overpriced grocer. This place is Great. Why you ask? GO TO THE BULK SECTION--there is everything you could think of needing (probably stuff you didnt know you needed) at a price you could never find at any chain store. They have a machine to make your own peanut butter.....no not lard or oils just peanuts and salt. A tub of that which is more than the side of a jar of natural peanut butter at the other stores is around $2.30, close to $5 at your local store.

Spices--Amazing selection of spices and im not talking about a few im talking every spice out there. I can get a POUND of cayenne pepper for $5 or a pound of garlic powder for less......try getting that in your store for that price.

Quality stuff at a lesser cost.....the store is employee owned.

Why are you still reading this???? get your caboose to Winco!Came to Chandler to Visit friends. I was recommended by friends to get my haircut by Eisela. After spending about an hour with her and getting my hair cut and adding color I couldn't be more happy. Everyone should take a moment and have her cut your hair. You will never go to anyone else again.This place was a great.  My husband gets credit for picking this place.  He planned a day at the museum and lunch here and it was a very nice experience all the way around.  First we headed over to the restaurant and picked a nice shady spot out on the patio.  It was beautiful outside, the weather was amazing and the view of the sculptures, and greener was very pleasing.  The service was excellent.  They were very quick and helpful suggesting some of the best things on the menu.  My husband had the rueben and the sweet potato salad which was out of this world amazing.  I told our server and he gave me a really nice picture/recipe card for it.  It was a few months ago and I dont remember what I had other than I remember it was so good no complaints from me but what won the whole meal was that insane sweet potato salad.  Whats nice about having lunch here first is that you can tour the museum and burn off those calories.   Also the light rail drops off right in front of the museum.  Another little tip is if you are an MCC student you get into the museum for free.The tacos at this place are little bundles of goodness that are damn near perfection. To begin the carne asada has great flavor with a slightly charred and crispy exterior, but still manages to maintain some tenderness on the inside. The cabbage, guacamole, and salsa are a necessary addition to this masterpiece of a taco. And just when you think you have it all... bam! Grilled onions complete one of the best tacos in Phoenix. On top of it all, these bad boys are only $1 a piece. 

Now on to the less glamorous side of Taqueria Los Yaquis, or the underbelly if you will. The establishment is inconspicuously housed just west of 7th Ave on Camelback Rd under a tent with some plastic tables and sporadic misters outside of Charlies gay bar. Here you will find some flaming fairies and hordes of legit Mexicans flocking in from all angles. Once you reach your destination you can watch the cooks working tirelessly in a food truck (one of the cleanest I've seen) to prepare you meat-filled pockets of love. God bless them. 

There are two ordering lines: one is literally a hole-in-the-wall inside Charlie's and the other a general line outside which accommodates all. This dual line and alternating order-taking results in ridiculously long waits of up to 20-30 minutes. I prefer to go on Sunday afternoons when it gets real, and a lil' less... uh... gay.Okay, this is my first review on Yelp. I'm an airline employee and have moved coast to coast. I always redo my flooring on all of my homes. This is the first time a company had showed up on time and worked non stop  9-10 hours each day. The attention to detail is amazing and they were courteous at all times. The sales manager Quoc Luu is a pleasure to work with and is a true gentleman. The floors, staircase and base boards looks so beautiful. I will tell everyone that is looking for flooring to look up Vegas Flooring Outlet. Oh yeah,  the pricing of install was $1.50 a sq ft. everybody else charged $2.00. I saved so much money and I could not have better results!!!!  Thanks, JohnnyWOW......

All I have to say is this is probably the best steakhouse I've been to so far. I am a huge ribeye & porterhouse fan but everyone said Gordon Ramsey is known for the beef wellington so I decided to give it a shot even though I'm not a huge fan of mushrooms or mustard on my steak.

The wait staff was very attentive and friendly. They came out with a variety of breads that was pretty decent and different from the standard hot rolls or pretzel breads they serve to you now. My wife ordered his signature chicken and we shared a side of Mac & cheese. 

When the wellington came out it was cooked perfectly med-rare and the first bite was FANTASTIC. With all the flavor you wouldn't have known you were eating a filet. My wife who isn't a fan of steak or red meat loved it as well. The Mac and cheese was pretty good and her chicken dish was very moist, flavorful and juicy. 

For dessert they are known for their sticky toffee pudding, which happens to be her favorite as well and she thought this was the best thing ever. I wasn't a huge fan of it and think the Monkey Bread served at Craftsteak is hands down the best dessert in a steakhouse. 

Prior to coming here SW was #1 on my list in vegas but this is definitely better and we will be back next week.My husband and I flew out to Vegas to try Gordon Ramsey's steakhouse in the Paris hotel. We are big fans of the show and were expecting a very high quality experience and he did not disappoint. We had the most amazing night. First let me correct one of the reviews who said they couldnt go online and make a reservation. I emailed the resteraunt to request reservations shortly after they opened and received a response and confirmation immediately. When we approached the restaurant , which is decorated like the Chunnel in London,  the hostess was very pleasant and attentive. We were seated at a table with Freddy as our waiter. I must say that he is a food poet!! Every adjective he used to describe the food made it sound like a work of art. He was wonderful and extremely attentive as was the other staff members that  assisted with our table. We both had the kolbe filet which melted in our mouths and was the best steak I have ever eaten, far better than delmonicos or Ruth Chris. Make sure to save room for the sticky toffee pudding which was better than I had in London last summer. I read some other reviews commenting on the price and all I can say is that fine quality costs and it was worth the price. It's top quality food from a world famous chef, if your on a tight budget go to Denny's or McDonald's, and leave the fine dining to people who truly appreciate a fabulous meal. I can't wait until my next las vegas trip to eat at Gordon Ramsey's steak .

December 12, 2012
This was my husband and my second visit to Gordon Ramsay Steakhouse in Paris hotel. We had Freddy as our main waiter. He was equally as fabulous on this visit. Every time he describes a dish our mouths began to water from anticipation. He is the Shakespeare of food description. Assisting Freddy was Adrian, he was very helpful and anticipated our every need. He was extremely pleasant and enhanced our dining experience. I had the Kobe filet mignon and my husband has the Kobe skirt steak. Both were of the highest quality and cooked to perfection. We also had the Mac & cheese, sautéed mushrooms and baked potato. Everything was wonderful. It's hard to describe pure perfection, but once you eat at Gordon Ramsay steak you will understand what I'm talking about. To top off our outstanding meal we had the sticky toffee pudding and cappuccino. My husband and I were in London last summer and the sticky toffee pudding here was better than in London. It was heaven on my plate. Prior to eating here our favorite meal was at a wonderful bistro in Paris, but this is now my new favorite restaurant. I also want to thank Michael, the general manager. He was wonderful. He came to our table multiple times to make sure we were happy and that the service and food were the highest quality. This is a fabulous restaurant for anyone who appreciates fine quality food and has a refined palate. I've read some of the other reviews commenting on cost. I personally believe the food is appropriately priced for the quality of food and anyone who believes its too much obviously doesn't know food quality.I really enjoy this place, the food is good, and the service is friendly.My wife & I planned a trip to Vegas. One of our must-do's was dinner at Gordon Ramsey Steak. We are big fans of Hells's Kitchen and wanted to see if his standards matched up to what's portrayed on the show. First let me say the restaurant design was cool. The "meat tray" presentation unique. And of course the food was delicious. But what impressed me above all of this was the wait staff. I generally am not impressed by wait staff at restaurants. They often times act like they are doing YOU the favor. At Gordon Ramsey Steak our waiter was Matthew. He was simply fantastic! Best waiter I have EVER had at any restaurant! He takes great pride in what he does & it shows. I would highly recommend Gordon Ramsey Steak and if you go ask for Matthew. He will take great care of you.This restaurant was my favorite culinary experience while in Vegas. I went 4 times while there (in just one week!). 

I took a bar seat since I did not have a reservation and got seated immediately. 
The  bar staff was very friendly and did everything they could to make my dinner experience great. I have to say that the beef Wellington is my favorite dish. Appetizer, entree and desert? Beef Wellington with Innis&Gunn (or red wine).Came here with a party of 6 recently and we were all amazed by the caliber of the service & the quality of the food - despite our already very high expectations.

The blue crab soup, beef wellington, complimentary bread, and toffee dessert were definitely the highlights. The salmon and bourbon creamed corn were also great but not too memorable in comparison to the first 4 mentioned. 

Our server was fantastic and my water was always filled. Add in a glass of red wine and a bottle of passion fruit tea and bf and I were so stuffed for the rest of the night. Overall, we had a fantastic experience and Gordon Ramsay Steak definitely lived up to our expectations. Will be back in the future to try their other steaks!I adore Khyber Halal, it's my new favorite. It's a new experience in a cuisine you may think you already know well. While not Indian, many of the dishes are novel takes on Indian & Middle Eastern dishes you may already know, like curries, kabobs, biryanis & naan. All of the dishes are marked by a fresh & vibrant taste. It really seems like homemade food, not churned out by the pot load. And the owners are very friendly and make for a nice atmosphere.I can't say enough good things about this place.  I've been here a bunch of times with my kids, girlfriends and I've even hosted a corporate event here.  This place is awesome.  It's so much fun to make all these great gifts.  We've done soap, candles, fused glass and cake decorating.  Next time we're trying the pottery painting.  The staff are SUPER helpful, the ambiance is totally fun and the variety of activities can't be beat.  The owner, Michelle, is incredibly nice and accommodating and her event coordinator, Cassandra, is also really lovely to deal with.  This is a great afternoon with your friends, family or work buddies.  It's also an awesome idea for gift giving since you MAKE everything there!  I LOVE this place.This shop owner and master technician both care about cars and their clients.  I am VERY picky about my M3 convertible and dont let many people touch it.  They installed a custom euro style lip for me and repainted my bumper.  My car is a rare color and is a bit older now 03 M3 convertible.  This made matching the color take a few days longer than I wanted but they also knew I wanted this to be done perfect and this car is my baby.   They put the extra time into matching the color since the 5 pre sprays were not to their liking.  They also smoked my blinkers and did some extra fabrication to the lip.  They did charge me extra for this but after seeing it I am sure they put hours into this job and I feel it is worth it.  They are both nice guys and will explain things and not try to rip you off.   

I have a E36 M3 that also has full body kit that needs work that I will also take there when I get the money saved up.This ranks high on one of the most amazing and unusual culinary adventures that I've ever had.

A friend tipped me off that this chicken place was opening this week.  I so wanted to go, but I had another gig, and figured that I'd miss out.  As it so happened, said gig ended just early enough for me to go right before closing, so the missus and I hightailed it to ensure that we got there before closing.

Oh yes, there was a line.

And so we waited.  And waited.  However, the staff came out and started giving away free cornbread.  I'm... just not a big cornbread fan, but I figured "Why not", and bit into it.

o_O

It was amazing.  Super sweet, like cake.  I ate two pieces while the line trudged on.

As we got closer to the door, another staff member came out and started handing out copies of Flav's autobiography.  And now I had something to read while waiting.  People said that Flavor Flav himself was in the kitchen cooking, and sure enough, he was.  No clock because of health reasons, but he was hands deep in prepping chicken.  The place is small, and not flashy.  Public Enemy was playing over the speakers, and a few pictures of Flav hanging with other famous folk, but the size and decor were subdued.

In between food prep breaks, he came out and talked to people, posing for photos, and signing autographs before rushing back to the food.

I placed my order, and waited.  And waited. 

And waited.

Turns out, they simply weren't prepared for the mass onslaught of people at the end, and had to rush like crazy to get everyone's order covered.  The staff looked exhausted having been there all day, but they were nothing but friendly, even tempered, and soldiered on, saying that they are here to be the best.  Flav even came out in between food prep breaks to let people know how genuinely appreciative he was that so many people came out to support him, and just bless everyone.  He's going to make this right.  And that included getting down to the last order perfect.  "If anyone were to get a raw piece of chicken", he said, "you can come up and punch me in the face."

It was nearing midnight by the time the final 10 orders were being serviced.  He was dead set on making everything perfect, and thanked us over and over for our patience.  I have never seen someone work so hard in my life.  Forgot the rapping and reality show work.  The man is a juggernaut in the kitchen.  His staff are class and all were working like crazy to get food done, and keep people happy.

When I finally got my order, it was past midnight, so I wished him happy birthday.  As I got handed my bag, I called out to him to say thank you for working so hard for us.  I felt it was the least I could do.

With that, he stopped, came over to me, and shook my hand profusely, thanking me for coming out, being patient, and bless me for being so supportive.  I've come across of a lot of celebrities, famous people, and well knowns in my time.  Flavor Flav is honestly one of the nicest, most genuine people I've ever met.

Past midnight, I finally dragged home, more excited than tired by the wackiness of the adventure, and how fun the whole experience was.  And then I sunk my teeth into the first bite of the chicken.

....

o_O

My God.... 

It is, hands down, the best fried chicken that I've had in Las Vegas, if not possibly ever.  It is absolutely, utterly remarkable.  I don't know what Flav puts in that fried chicken skin, but Colonel Sanders deserves a demotion in rank and can kiss Flav's backside, for Sanders or Popeye are no longer the masters.  I devoured chicken like a Mogwai from Gremlins, and even cold the next day, I gnawed on the remaining pieces with glee.  The mac and cheese is excellent.  I even liked the french fries quite a bit.

So if there was ever a "bucket list" item that you never knew you had or even wanted, I can now cross off that Flavor Flav personally hand prepped and cooked me one of the best fried chicken meals that I have ever had in my life.

You'll need this experience on your bucket list.  You don't know how much you really do.

I will heartily go back to this diamond of a chicken place in a microsecond.  I am stunned.First time in downtown Las Vegas, and I just loved it!!!!! Friendlier and more genuine people! From now on, that's where I will stay each time I go to fabulous Las Vegas! The D was outstanding (a little confusing though because its former name (Fitzgeralds) is still pretty much everywhere!). Fast check-in/check-out. Extremely friendly staff. Free breakfast during my 2-night stay. Clean and spacious room at top price ($29!). HELL, YEAH... I WILL BE BACK!!!!!!!!I used Glass Now to replace my windshield and they did an amazing job!  Super fast service and the techs were on time and very professional.  I would highly recommend them - thanks Alex and team for a job well done!This was my wifes office throughout her pregnancy. We absolutely loved Dr. Suhn (spell check) he is amazing. The entire office made us feel at home besides one of the ladies who do scheduling, she was usually pretty rude and rushed us off, but one bad seed cannot ruin the foundation they have established. Dr. Howard however, was usually behind schedule but a friend of my wifes referred us to him and says he was the best shes ever had (she has 4 kids, 2 delivered by Howard). Most of the time the doctors are out of the office because unlike most other practices they are with the women throughout their pregnancy and make it a point to be there and deliver the baby, not pawn you off on another ob that you've never encountered. We will be returning back to Palm Valley when we conceive another child.Best soy lattes in the valley.  I don't know how they make them so silky smooth, but they are l-o-v-e-l-y.  Service is always very friendly, and of course the building is awesome.  Parking is a bit of a pain when they're busy, but no big thing.  Glad to see they have almond milk too, I'll try that next time.This place is an absolute gem!  The vibe is warm and inviting by both the instructors and students.  I am always greeted by name and feel like they really are happy to see me.  The variety of classes and teaching styles is helpful in maintaining a balanced practice.  It is so great to have a place to go where the yoga is AFFORDABLE!  You should definitely check it out.Fantastic Salvadorian Fair!  I'm so happy to see this in my neighborhood! My husband is from El Salvador and craves foods from his homeland.

When we tried this place out, we had several bean and cheese pupusas, horchata (salvadorian of course) corn tamales and black beans. The corn tamales where a little dry, but still very good. The pupusas were the best!I love this place! So much better than the the big chain donut shop across the street! Plus they have boba!!Mmmmm! I called for delivery on just a Green Tea Boba(Awesome how there's no price limit for what you want to order). It cost 6.04$ in total with the delivery fee, but was worth! SO YUMMY and I think I'll try their food next time. This'll be my go-to place for boba now since it's close by my work/house. The guy on the phone and delivery was super nice. Even though I was askin lots of questions, he responded great. 

-sidenote: delivery fee is 2$ below 3 miles. If you live farther than 3 miles it's a 1$ more for every extra mile. (What I've been told)

I might call often for delivery on boba to my work. :) 

Hope the food tastes just as Great as your bobas.OMG this guy is absolutely amazing I called him to make sure that he could fix my phone and I drove down and he was done within 10 minutes. My phone screen is crystal clear everything works just the same I would recommend this guy and this company to anyone hands-down.I had a wonderful time last Saturday here at The Great American BBQ & Beer Festival.  Arrived around 2pm and didn't have any problems finding a parking space.  The city really had it planned out as far as traffic and parking.  Major plus is that they didn't charge to park in the parking structures that were right next to the event.  Walking in was a breeze and the staff were super friendly.  Right away I could tell I wasn't the only fan of BBQ.  Tons of people lined up for all the awesomeness.  Lots of BBQ venders lined throughout the event, so no matter where you were you could smell or stop in for some good eats.  Beer was flowing and I liked that the the selection was a local Chandler brewery of SanTan Brewing Co.  
Along with endless selection of venders selling food, they gave a bonus of some awesome punk bands that I remember seeing in the 90's.  Loved the nostalgia of seeing all these great performers on stage.  My only complaint was the level of sound for the music.  It needed to be a lot louder then it was.  I was near the stage and still needed it louder for an outdoor event.  I also enjoyed that they let in's and out's of the festival, it made it easy to slip on by local businesses to stop in and sit down to get out of the sun for awhile.  All and all I had a super great time, and would definitely come back next year!I have a habit of dropping my phone at least once a month that will completely shatter my screen and these guys are the best in replacing it!!  Very inexpensive and they are fast.  I drop it off, grab lunch, and it's ready before I know it.  They are extremely friendly and just a great company all around!  Highly recommended!!fun place to go for happy hour. Sevice is great. The Saki is good and thet have several specials all at excellent prices. located in Tivoli  which is a gorgeous shopping center the have a early and late happy hourThis place has super good food.  It's hot pot, but it's also soup.  So, you don't have to cook your own food, rather you get to enjoy delicious food.

The servers are very nice, but don't let them pressure you into odering too much food.  We ordered a chicken and a beef hot pot, and that was enough food for 4.

The chicken....lets just say you should definitely order the beef (the beef is way better).  Also, the coconut water was too...real.  I would suggest ordering any of the other drinks because they were sooo good.

Also, make sure to get spicy on the side so you can add it.  The broth is very good on its own!Shine now has a brick-and-mortar location right off of central on Vernon (North of McKellips, South of Thomas). The service is great! I always get a Iced Soy Chai! Yum! 

The location is absolutely adorable, tiny!I love WinCo.  The store is enormous, spotlessly clean, the prices are extremely low, the selection is amazing.  Their produce, meat, dairy and bakery sections are wonderful, and the final (huge) plus is that the staff is genuinely friendly and extremely outgoing.

Another interesting thing about WinCo is their huge bulk food section and food storage area.  Perfect for those of us that like to have a few things in deep storage...just in case of a zombie invasion.

The only thing I don't like about WinCo is that there isn't one nearer to the center of Phoenix.  I have to drive clear up to Bell Road and 7th Avenue to get to it and that is pretty far.  But let me assure you, it IS totally worth the drive!!



Now, I see that some folks are saying in their reviews that WinCo doesn't accept debit cards: THIS IS FALSE.  I just used my debit card here this last weekend...

CLARIFICATION FOR THOSE THAT ARE UNSURE ABOUT THE PAYMENT POLICY: They do NOT accept credit cards.  They *DO* accept debit cards.  

Easy tip to tell the difference between the two different kinds of cards:  
-If you sign for your purchase it is CREDIT.
-If you enter a pin number it is DEBIT.




The more you know...LOVE THESE LADIES!!!! 
Tried a few others in town but once I found Divine, I haven't gone anywhere else! They are so friendly, quick and awesome at what they do! :)Very professional and helpful.  Felt very comfortable with the system explanation and the options available to us.  I would recommend this company to all of my friends!Service, food, cleanliness, efficiency and cost is all A+! I will never eat Chinese anywhere else! The staff is so friendly and the atmosphere is fun and cozy. Very relaxed! A great little place tucked away in a strip mall! Sesame chicken, won ton soup and crab won-tons are a MUST!This is little strip mall is dangerous to the waistline... there is Bistro pizza and a great cupcake place right next door. 
 The owners are super nice and down to earth and generous. The cupcakes and gooey bars are awesome. She also makes breads and cake pops, They ran out of pumpkin when we were last there. ( Someday!!!! :)
 Nice homemade taste. Nothing tastes like it came from a box, it tastes as if someone had been working very hard to please your taste buds. The efforts pay off, never been disappointed. 
Cute little place with a family friendly touch, some artsy fun gift items and aprons for sale too.
 Worth the trip, worthy of the treat.Sad day.  Went there for our favorite Vegan Farmers Market pizza but they were gone. Wasn't the end of the world but an end to having good family style pizza with fresh organic ingredients.  Too bad :(Tiny little place and not the fanciest. most would prob be quick to judge but don't let the place scare you because they have really good food!!!!!! Very fresh! The salsa is amazing too!!!! And the place is a small family owned business! I'm all about supporting that!!!!Been here 3+ more times...

Yup... still amazing!I've been to lots of restaurants in the 20 years I've lived in Las Vegas and I have to tell you, WILDBURGER is the BEST! GREAT service from one of the bubbleist workers that I've EVER met that ALWAYS guaranties my vist is the Best it can be. Her name is ASHLEY and from my experience for service, GREAT Attitude always, attention to detail from the condition of the seating area to even coming by MANY times during our meal to make sure all is GREAT! They have this bun that is OUT of this world, cooked right everytime and again...service is the BEST!  Watchout Wildburger, someone will come in and steal your girl Ashley if you don't watch out...Keep her, promote her and keep serving the BEST Burgers in town! You OWN my business!!!!Tapas are dreamy. Service was perfection and the prices weren't bad I my opinion.  The spinach salad,  dates with bacon and blue cheese,  lamb chops, artichoke toaster and muscles were off the charts. We ordered more tapas that were all delicious but I mentioned my absolute faves. Nothing was less than delicious.  

One and only issue was parking. Parking is horrible there. I could not see fit to take off a star because of the parking because the service and food made it ok.Great Time. Took my parents here and they had a blast. They do the standard show here for this type of place but it's done well. Food was good the roll I had was great. If you are looking for a good interactive dining experience this is a great place to go.The boys and I wanted to meet up in Phoenix and do some partying. After a quick internet search we saw all the great reviews and decided to give AZ Elite a try. It worked out perfect for us. No DD rock,paper, scissors game to be played. Like others noted the vehicles were clean and our driver, Chris was  very personable. Everyone had a blast and made it home safe. Oh and the best part is the price. Try this service and you will not regret it.Crudo, Crudo how do I love thee? Let me count the ways:

Butterfish with lardo and lemon
Albacore with truffles, apples and black garlic
Squid Ink Risotto
Pork Belly enough said
Short Rib with root veggies

Each dish was amazing, an orgasm for the tongue. I didn't want it to end. I could have stayed and ate for hours. Charming building, awesome set up... And the cocktails, ohhhh the cocktails. The modest monk and daring dutchman were crafted to perfection. 

Cullen Campbell has done it again and having Micah Olson behind the bar was a brilliant combination. This place is a "must try" and reservations are recommended. Last time I was there I forgot to make them and the wait was over an hour (and worth every minute).I just had my first treatment for botox at LaserAway. Everything was great! The staff was very accommodating and professional. The store was very clean and well decorated. I would recommend coming here for injectables and laser hair removal! The only down fall was that it is located in the Scottsdale Quarter, which is busy with holiday shoppers this time of year.It was a last minute decision to get a tattoo while we were in Vegas.  We researched nearby shops on Yelp and this place had the best reviews.

We were greeted by someone (forgot his name) but he was super nice and said that Russ would be doing our tattoos.  I already had an image with me, Russ worked with me to change the font a bit and created my beautiful little tattoo.  He was so pleasant to work with, great personality and loves to talk.  He has a very light hand, in all my years of getting tattoos, this was the first tattoo I had that did not bleed or hurt immensely afterward.  I can't say enough good things about the shop and Russ.  The place is super clean, the music is perfect when you are getting inked.  The place just has a lot of good vibes flowing through.

I will be back in September with friends to get our sports tattoos.  Russ is going to be super busy that day when we get done rolling through there.  :)  Thank you for the most awesome tattoo.  

*I laughed when I read Rowena's review.  Russ shared the Friday the 13th story with us and told us he didn't leave until almost 3am.  LOL  Now I know who he was talking about!  lmaoAll I kept on saying when I came here was "What a Place!!!" because of the quality of food. My girlfriend and I came here on the second, third and fourth day while in Vegas sometimes twice a day (breakfast and lunch) and I wish we found out about this place on our first day because we would have been here. 

We tried the crepes, sandwiches, desert, pastries and cold drinks and I know I say I enjoy a lot of places I go to but this place deserves more than five stars. 

What makes a great sandwich is fresh bread with all of the proper fixings and this place definitely knows how to mix and match ingredients in your sandwich to get your pallet wanting more. 

Their deserts are fresh with quality chocolate 

Crepes are not soggy and small but moist and full of whatever type of meat of sweets you order it with. 

The only downfall about this place is the price. On an average for a party of two the bill can easily come out to $30-$40 bucks and that's with out waiter service. But heck I would spend that type of money for the food they make.This beautiful little place in the corner of Bellagio Casino and Hotel is simply AMAZING!

Guinness World record for the largest chocolate fountain.  Yes chocolate fountain of 3 different cascading real chocolate from ceiling to the ground.

The gelato was YUMMY!  One cup has two scoops of your favorite flavors.  I got mango sorbet and strawberry.  Usually I stay away from gelatos because they're usually too sweet for my taste, but the gelatos here were not too sweet.

This place makes crepes too and they look beautiful.

All in all this place is a great place to take a break from the machines and have yourself a little treat.  And maybe you can find a good spot to watch the Bellagio water show from the insideBest gelato I tried but very pricey!  Still worth it.Sat on a table with a view of the swimming pool at the Bellagio.  Had a restful time here with a coffee and 2 flavors of the gelatto while waiting for the world famous musical fountain display to begin in the evening.  The chocolate fountain at this patisserie is great fun to look at.We eat at Inca Grill once or twice a month.  We generally go for a half or full chicken with salad and lots of sauces.   Seems to be the best Peruvian restaurant in town... We love it! :)3rd Visit within a week.  We have been so impressed with the food and staff that we took a friend.  We tried something different and once again were very happy that we did. No Question we will be back, and soon if I have anything to do with it.Indulged myself in some German dining this past weekend. It was a great atmosphere and the food tasted awesome. The pretzels were  unreal! Everyone was extremely kind, especially the hostess (dark hair). The wait was a little longer than I had hoped, but she made an effort to ensure we were doing well, and she kept us up to speed with why it was taking a little longer. Great service and I strongly recommend it.

Nick H.Love the place.old oregenos location. Get the hot pretzel with assortment of mustards. Lots of good german beers on draft. funny mini bus outside. place will be packed come spring training.Great food, awesome and friendly staff! New favorite place in Old Town! Try their "Pig Mac" Burger! Very tasty!!I never thought that I would be waxing euphoric about a retail store--especially one that basically helps you organize and sells containers.  But I now am.  The unique thing about this store is that you will likely find something that you never saw before or ever previously realized that you needed.  For instance, after two trips, among other products I now have a stepped plastic platform that displays readily identifiable cans of food inside a kitchen pantry, pull-out metal shelves in the cabinets below bathroom sinks, expandable shoe racks, a multi-sectioned holder of various balls and other essential sports equipment, and even a clear acrylic holder for an orange KISS souvenir golf ball from KISS by Monster Mini-Golf.  Beware, for a visit here can be dangerous to your household budget and wallet.  And, prices are not low for these unusual items.  Yet, in the end, the better accessibility, organization, and appearance of one's stored items and collectibles will likely be well worth the monetary outlay.    

One metal shelf pulled out somewhat roughly after it was tried in earnest at home.  The imperfect shelf was cheerfully taken back and exchanged without incident.  So, this is a store that will also stand behind its products.  At the site of a former Borders bookstore near an entrance to Town Square, the large space has been totally refurbished and filled with great stuff.  It is bright, cheery, itself well organized, and pleasant to graze.Really enjoyed this restaurant that was referred to me by Mr. Jimmy J.  Love this place and so glad it's close to home.  Had the Pasta Valducci and it was very tasty!  Can't wait to go back!This place is a really good inexspensive dinner. On Monday and Tuesday they have a great deal for dinner, only $5.99 for a great meatball and Spaghetti meal. It even comes with a hardy warm bread.
We have come to this location about 4 or 5 times now. Each time the staff is always friendly and helpful.
 The food has been really good each time. Even their drinks are good and not too high. I have watched a bit or two or some good football games here as well.
Every time we go we try a differant anti pasta, again with this, each time really good.
Easy parking, and nice place to come for a meal.Hubby and I had dinner recently and really enjoyed the 3 Meat Platter. Ordered Red-Neck Tacos as a "starter" and they were delish. Corn cakes with tender pork and jalapeño coleslaw on top. I ordered pulled pork, chicken and wonderful ribs with some of their Hot & Yaki sauce on the side. The food was cooked to perfection and so was the service we received from Kelli. Very friendly and efficient. The restaurant was clean too. Thumbs up!You MUST go here!!!  We just moved to Chandler a few weeks ago and tried this place.  The BEST mexican food I have had in a long time.  The staff there is also very nice and helpful in explaining the selections.  We got our order to go and the woman who took our order (I think she was the night supervisor there) recommended how to put the order together and answered all of my questions patiently and was very informative (she knew their menu extremely well).  The food was AWESOME and correctly packaged and labeled.  Our kid's even loved the tacos (ground beef and potatoes with cheese only--not something I thought they would like, but they did!) and the cheese quesadilla we got for them (and they are very picky).  I got the cheese enchilada with red sauce and shredded beef tacos, both were very good.  My husband even loved his steak (carne asada) burrito (tip:  he got it deep fried and loved it).  It doesn't have an overhead sign on the building yet, but it is near to where Rosati's pizza is...look for the sign in the window (if I remember correctly).I have worked with Craig over the years and found him to be exceptionally intelligent and very knowledgeable. I would not hesitate to recommend him.Love these cupcakes!! We visit this place often!! If you are a chocolate love - Dark Vader is amazing!!!Wow. Excellent service, friendly, easy to talk to, and make you feel extremely welcome at their place! Food is wonderful, be sure to get the sweet poTOToes!! Don't expect to get in and out in a reasonable time though, this place is about relaxing and enjoying your time. This is my kind of therapy!Only bad think I can mention about this place is the single bathroom. One for Men/Women and one for Women so if you have to go on a busy Friday night, you'll need to get in line. But not a big deal. 
Service was quick and friendly. Burgers are great. Big and juicy with your choice of different buns. The fires are good and plentiful. My wife like the sweet potato tots. 
Get there early on the weekend as there is usually a line but it moves quick. Been here 8+  times and never disappointed. I like the McNarley burger. Be prepared, the Rehab burger is two patties, hugh and messy. Ask for extra napkins.I've been to a number of gyms across the valley including LA Fitness, Gold's Gym, and LifeTime Fitness and this gym is by far the best! Everything you need without the hassle of a long term contract! Very affordable at around $25 a month. Friendly staff and personal training available as well. Definitely check it out if you're looking for a new gym!This is the perfect starter snack or late night stop after you've been partying all night. I'm not even sure if Rocking Taco even closes?!

The chips and freshly made guacamole with the spicy salsa is definitely the best snack meal around. They make these killer Blue Lemonade Margaritas that are to die for. 

We definitely made a few stops here for drinks and more guac!I just moved downtown and I've been looking for a neighborhood barber shop. I feel like I've found a great one. 

They gave me an incredibly low priced cut, but it was still one of the better cuts I've had in a long time. They were really friendly dudes who were very attentive and quick while still making you feel welcome. Good conversation, too - which adds to that neighborhood feel. 

Really nice to see a locally owned shop give such awesome service at an even better price. I'll be going back next time I need a cut and I hope they stay open to serve the community for a long time.I'm a travel nurse who's only in Phoenix for a short time and this place is near my apartment, which is the only reason I decided to walk in there. I was craving Mexican for lunch, but when I walked in I almost walked right back out because the atmosphere is not a good first impression. The place looks outdated and worn out, stained ceiling tiles, stuffy, and was almost empty.  My young son was with me and he wanted to stay, so we tried it.  BEST burrito ever.  The food was very fresh and tasty. 
Don't be put off by the looks of this place, they are for real.  I wish they had the money to remodel so more people would be attracted to them, the food is amazing. Maybe we can get Robert Irvine and Restaurant Impossible in there? LOLThis is a must see. They do random shows, you can get really close to the dolphins and it is huge so you never feel cramped.Excellent service from beginning to end. Our server was well versed in the plates and the chef was very knowledgeable about gluten allergies and made sure I was able to enjoy every bite. The meal was exquisite from the rabbit rillette, dates stuffed with chorizo, elk ribs and my boyfriend's papardelle.Hands down, my favorite restaurant in Vegas. Everything is vegetarian, so no matter how real the "meat" tastes, I trust that is soy of some sort. 

My girlfriend and I have tried the orange beef, sesame chicken, fish with black bean sauce, oyster mushrooms, spinach salad, and Mongolian beef. I have never been disappointed with a dish. 

Service is always great. They never pressure you into deciding, or make you feel rushed to leave. The chef, Kenny, always comes out to check on the tables and make sure you enjoy everything. 

If this place were ever to be on the brink of closing, I will lose all faith in humanity.What a diamond in the rough!  One of my good friends took me here for lunch and it was fantastic.  As a 15 year vegetarian I couldn't believe this place had gone unnoticed by me for so long.  Their entire menu is made up of creative vegan items and traditional Asian dishes.  I love hot and sour soup and is one thing I've missed since converting.  I ordered that and I was not disappointed.  The crispy eggplant and lotus root were also delicious.  Great place to eat whether your're vegan or not.  You could probably even trick some of your meat eating friends if your covert enough.I live here in Providence, and was actually online to see if anyone knew when the new Cafe was opening, as my husband is a brekfast person , and was SHOCKED to see some of the people writing awful reviews about Jims Pizza. I am not a YELPER like many of you are, as I have a busy schedule, being that my husband and I own ourselves 3 local business' in town, but I was so saddened to see what people were writing about this great place, I had to give my two cents.

To start, my family, especially my teenager and her friends have ordered Jims Pizza many times, and it is fantastic!  Always tastes fresh, crust is amazing, and it gets to our door of hungry teenagers fast.  Maybe the people complaining about Jims Pizza, are just use to eating junk food and the "fast food craze" and just got used to eating the cheap tasting pizza from places like Dominos and Pizza Hut, and their taste buds just cant realize what good pizza tastes like anymore, as Jims Pizza is great.  I always got great, friendly service as well.   I met the owner once, about 6 months ago, had a conversation with him, and he is a very nice man who works hard for his business.

Secondly, most of you probably never owned a business and while your review may just be a random sentence on the internet to you, but to a business owner its the ability to provide for his family and his loved ones. To us business owners, we put  our heart and sole into our business', its our dream.  Please don't give me the excuse "the public has the right to know about   the service" or "maybe if we publicly give our input, they will change their recipe"  While many of you may not know this, your asking a man to risk his business, cost him money so that MAYBE it will appeal to your taste buds.  As I said my husband and I own 3 local business', well, there use to be a 4th one, it  was a very popular local place in town, that many of you would be familiar with, but for reasons I am listing, I am choosing not to list it, nor give my "real name" as well, as after reading and knowing how some of you, including members of Providence decided to write awful things about Jims Pizza, I don't need you writing any of our business bad reviews, just to be spiteful. Anyways, it wasn't till we owned that fourth one, that we realized how many bad, spiteful, and jealous people there are in Las Vegas.  I thought the world was a better place than this.  We helped out people by the day, gave them our sweat and blood, and got crap from those same people we helped, it got so bad that when a building disaster occurred, we took it as a blessing to get out of it, and closed it, which hurt us deeply, but was time to focus on our other business, and move on. We couldn't be more happier, as I don't have to deal with the general public at that level as I did then, and while we miss some of our wonderful regulars that we created awesome memories with, there was just too many awful ones and many freeloaders.  Just please remember that there are many aspects to a business that many of you who work a 9-5 job don't understand, and won't. While it may seem easy to ask a business to change to your liking, even just a simple request, are not that easy and expensive to any business owner. Also for you that complained about the $2.50 delivery charge, YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT JIMS PIZZA OVERHEAD IS, AND IF THAT HELPS HIM KEEP HIS DOORS OPEN, THEN HE NEEDS TO DO THAT.  YOU YELPERS SEEM TO ASK ALOT FROM THESE PEOPLE.  ON TOP OF EVERYTHING ELSE, I GUARENTEE THAT SOME OF THESE POSTS ARE WRITTEN FROM JIMS PIZZA COMPETITORS FRIENDS, FAMILY MEMBERS,REGULARS, AS IVE PERSONALLY HAD THAT HAPPEN TO ME.  COMPETITORS CAN BE CRUEL, SO FOR YOU THAT HAVEN'T TRIED JIMS PIZZA, PLEASE IGNORE THESE POSTS AS HALF OF THEM ARE PROBABLY WRITTEN FROM HIS COMPETITORS. AND TO YOU PEOPLE THAT ARE WRITING FALSE REVIEWS, ITS ONE THING TO SUPPORT YOUR FAVORITE PLACES, ITS ANOTHER THING TO BULLY HIS COMPETITOR AS YOUR DOING HERE. 

NEXT  FOR YOU THAT LIVE IN PROVIDENCE WRITING THESE REVIEWS I AM SHOCKED.  ALL OF US SHOULD BE GIVING THE LOCAL BUSINESS' IN PROVIDENCE OUR LOCAL SUPPORT AND GET BEHIND THEM! THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE WHO DON'T LIKE LAS VEGAS BECAUSE WE HAVE NO CULTURE OR SENSE OF COMMUNITY, AND THEY ARE RIGHT!  WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE? IF YOU DIDN'T LIKE THEIR PIZZA, MAYBE WRITE OR EMAIL THEM A LETTER, THERE IS NO REASON TO PUBLICALY HUMILATE A BUSINESS, AND IF THAT DOESN'T WORK, MOVE ON AND EAT SOMEWHERE ELSE.  AFTER ALL, BEING A YELPER, IS NOT GOING TO GET YOU ANYWHERE, AS I NOTICED, THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF YOU, SO IF YOUR WANTING TO BE A FOOD CRITIC, GET A WEBSITE TO STAND OUT, OR A BLOG, AS YOUR NOT GOING TO STAND OUT HERE.  BEHIND THIS BUSINESS IS A PERSON, A FAMILY, SO PLEASE KEEP THAT IN MIND WHEN YOU POST.  REGARDLESS, MY FAMILY WILL CONTINUE TO EAT THEIR DELICOUS PIZZA, AND STAND BEHIND A LOCAL BUSINESS THAT IS HERE IN PROVIDENCE.  THANK YOU JIMS PIZZA FOR YOUR GOOD FOOD AND KIND SERVICE.  KEEP UP THE GOOD WORKThis guy Robert knows how to conduct customer service. I found him through YELP.COM here, gave Robert a phone call and he was back to me with in a day. Told him my situation. He said he could drop by that evening, but we schedule for the weekend (Saturday) instead. 

He called to let me know his ETA that day. He was on-time. He didn't jerk me around, gave me his exact price and stuck to it. Told me his process for cleaning my carpet. Gave me a bottle for any spots/spills in the future and was done within 1 hour. Living room carpet was cleaned and honestly made me think about holding off tiling the living room for awhile. Robert, you're the man... thanks and I'd refer you to anyone.1 man did the work of 3 with the results of a 10 man crew. This guy takes pride in his work and it shows. My neighbor already wants to use him and he just left my house. Outstanding job. Works his butt off for every one of the 5 stars he getsIsabella loves her 9:30 Wed morning Storybook dance class. She talks about how great her teacher Miss Louisa is and I have to say I love her as well. She has really taught the children a great deal and I have seen such improvement in skill level since she came back from maturity leave. She has great control over the class and the children really pay attention when she is in the class room. I will be back at the end of summer!Holy mother of salad goodness...I have finally found a replacement for the sadly now-closed Market Bistro. The sandwiches are interesting and have amazingly soft bread. The salads are fresh and generously portioned with dressings that are tasteful. The desserts are also yummy. This place is my new favorite and go-to at least once per week. And for $8 that gives you a FULL sandwich and salad (which you can easily split) - paradise bakery must be freaking out!These are the happiest, friendliest employees on earth. I had never been to Five Guys- I was a confirmed in and out guy. No more. This is the best burger, killer spicy fries, and best team I have ever experienced. How day do dat?
The best.Nom. Nom. Nom. Awesome every time.  Great staff.  Friendly owner.  Love this place.  Went for the first time on a Groupon, now a frequent diner.Friendly and wonderful. I had not found anywhere I wanted to return to until now. Tierney easy scheduling is great for busy moms like me. She's professional and understanding and definitely skilled in her trade. If you're nervous or a first timer she is the one to see and continue with. You won't be disappointed. Clean salon.Great Service.... I usually go to the location closest to my house but today I went out of my way to this location & the 2 girls that were working were absolutely Great & Super freindly... This location is now my go to!!!Cant wait to come back! The baby loved it here! plenty of toys! Safe play area! Seats for the parents who dont turn kid and play along, i think it even has wifi. One the coolest baby sleepers Ive ever seeeen! like something from Portal. Go and you'll see it!I get my hair done there and I love it. I have curly hair and have had more bad haircuts than I can count. I know every time I go I will leave happy and beautiful. The salon itself is gorgeous, and the staff and stylists are professional and friendly. I drive a long way every month to go to Haute Fringe, and it is totally worth the time and gas it takes. I wouldn't dream of going anywhere else!This place is great. My favourite burger place in town. The selection of what you can get is very large and some of the selections can get a little strange but well worth a try if your adventurous. The tower of rings is great especially with the beach house sauce. My wife tells me the milk shakes are great also though I haven't personally tried them.  I try to get here at least once a month to fill my craving. Glad they opened a shop in Waterloo.I had such agreat experience here. The massage technician was professional and courteous. I was so relaxed I think I dozed off for few minutes. When everything was said and done, I felt so much better and rejuvenated. I definitely recommend this place.The service is great, the guys are attentive and quick. More importantly the sandwiches are great. Excellent bread (I had pretzel bread), veggies are fresh, a nice selection of dressings, and the meats and cheeses are plentiful. The price is on par with Subway but you get a far superior sandwich. Get them toasted or cold, and they have all the options and upgrades you could ask for. I know the cops in the area like to lunch here, I'll be sending my firefighters as well. We know good food!Went for a birthday dinner on a Thursday night. Staff was very welcoming and nice. Kids loved the teppanyaki dinner and the food was fabulous. 8yrs. old son said it was the best restaurant.
Fried rice was fluffy and not overly spiced. The meat was very tender and the seafood was perfectly cooked. Never had to wait for service, the waitress was very attentive and understanding with the kids.
Can't wait to go back, will be bringing the grandparents as well."I was seen here in the past and they were quick and kind and very helpful. so, when my son became ill, I drove out of my way to take him here. This visit was just as good, they were quick, thorough, and very efficient. All of them."This place is fantastic! The service is great and the food is outstanding! The cheese puffers they bring in the beginning are delectable and a perfect introduction to the food. I had the tuna and it was cooked perfectly, the grapes provided the perfect balance of acidity.  My friend had one of the steaks and I tried a little, it was amazing, totally melt in your mouth delicious.  For sides we had the corn, mashed potatoes, and brussel sprouts.  This was my first time having brussel sprouts and I have no idea why people don't like them...they were absolutely divine, and I want to try them everywhere now.  The corn was perfect and a little spicy.  The mashed potatoes were really creamy and delicious.  For dessert we had the donuts and chocolate which was a perfect ending to our meal, little bite size pieces of heaven dipped in chocolate.

The drinks were also very good, I had the cocktail on draft which was a rum based drink...it came to the table on fire, which is awesome.  I recommend getting this when it's darker to get the full effect.  It wasn't dark when I got it, so the flame was hard to see.

Mostly, I can't wait to go back and try more dishes!Bought an SR9 this week from Shooters Vault. I was trying to buy a different pistol but they could not find the box, which I'd like to have. I'm glad that happened though because I am really happy with my purchase. They were all really helpful and knowledgable.Omg I just left with tons of popcorn. Never in my life have I seen that many flavors to choose from.  70 selections!!! Naturally I bought some for me, my son oh and my best friend who turned me on to this place. I don't know whether to hug her or slap her..lol. Seriously if your looking for some fantastic popcorn this is the place.Nutella frozen yogurt. That is pretty much all I have to say about Twirl. I love frozen yogurt, but I'm first to admit that most frozen yogurt tastes about the same. However, this is not the case for Twirl's. The Nutella is creamy, it's chocolatey and it's completely delicious with every spoonful! They have a wide variety of flavors that are both fruity and creamy. In addition, they have several toppings to top off a delicious cup of fro yo! They have everything from caramel and chocolate sauce, to mochi and fruity pebbles. Twirl is the ultimate shop for a tasty sweet treat to get you through the day!Absolutely awesome experience!! We picked a package of 4 guns and had a blast. John was an excellent instructor and made sure we were comfortable. Not just for guys either, I'm a chick!This place is something of a hidden gem with a lot going for it and definitely worth a try if you are staying nearby and in the mood for pizza.  

I think the pizza here is very good.  Authenticity is something I'll leave t the experts to debate.   

They do not serve slices here, but they do make an individual pizza for about $9.00 that's big enough for two if neither is super hungry.  

Regardless of the size, you can select from a lengthy list of toppings - some traditional ones and some fussier ones if you're wanting to get your gourmet on.  

In addition to pizza, they also have starter and entree salads.  I had a starter spinach salad for about $8.00 that was quite good if perhaps a little heavy on the dressing.  Believe me, the starter salads are very generously portioned, and two could easily split one, especially if you are getting pizza, too.  

The service was excellent.  

It's also a comfortable restaurant with a stylish decor and a chill vibe.  

My buddy and I walked over from the Wynn, and we both thought it was worth the stroll to get there.

Bottom line:  a nice place to eat with good food, excellent service, and very reasonable prices.for a chain, this place is legit.  I ate 3 out of 4 nights I was in Vegas.  Pizza is consistent and very good.  the sauce and crust is on point.Very cool feel at The Players Club.  Love the food there -- especially recommend the sliders, which are absolutely terrific.  I went with a group of girls and we shared different cocktails off the menu. Creative, tasty and not too pricy!  We loved this place and will be back soon!  (Maybe tonight!!!)By far the best subs my husband and I have had! They don't skimp out on the meat either! I am very impressed!I really wasn't looking forward to going here, but our guest in town insisted, because someone she knows, told her she had to go and check it out.  So ya'll know how it is when guest come to town, you have to do the whole tourist thing! 
So we got there, they were spit-shining this place!  OMG, if they weren't serving anyone, they were shining it up!  I don't think you understand!  They were on the floor, on there hands and knees! 
So I thought it was just going to be like and Icee!  Nope, it was like an ice, but it was creamy in the mouth like ice cream.  

I tasted several flavors, cotton candy, and watermelon was my favorite.

My husband got the custard!  That wasn't Italian Ice, it was a custard, but it was kinda weird, it wasn't cold like ice cream, it was a lot warmer than I liked.   My husband loved it, but he's a custard lover.

We also met Rita.....He's a man, very nice guy, he also gave us a couple of buy on get one free coupons.  We will return.I'm a dog girl from Chicago and I must say- This place is awesome!! I haven't been to the bar location but hands down- best service and atmosphere for a dog joint.  The hotdogs alone are sooo good!   I love love the spicy Korean Dogs.  YUM!!!! and GO!!!!!Homemade cookies and Thrifty ice cream... Need I say more? Go try it.I don't get the whole Thrifty's Ice Cream excitement (I think Thrifty's is a little before my time). But I can recognize delicious things and Sweet Addiction has got them!

At Sweet Addiction, my favorites seem to be the most colorful ones in the case. Like a child, I gravitate toward rainbow colored ice creams? The kid in me thinks they'll taste better I guess. Whatever the reasoning is behind my sub-conscious wanting pink and blue, candy-colored ice cream, I'm in love with the Circus Animal Cookie and Birthday Cake. They have other "normal" flavors as well but those are my go-tos. Cookie-wise I'll order whatever floats my boat. I've sampled the chocolate chip and white chocolate macadamia which are both winners. They're soft in the center with a little crisp on the edges--just how I like it! They've got a fridge of beverages with a few different kinds of root beer for.... you guessed it--root beer floats! Tip from the ladies of Sweet Addiction: Don't get too creative with your ice cream choice. Stick with a classic like vanilla because a mint chocolate chip root beer float just sounds nasty.

I rarely eat ice cream. Long story short, I worked at Coldstone and ate too much Birthday Cake Remix. But if I'm taking someone on an ice cream run, Sweet Addiction has that chic, modern, and daresay slightly upscale decor that makes it the cool--but cheap--place to entertain yourself and other people. 5 stars!My sales associate that helped me did an awesome job. I told her what I wanted and immediately she pulled my options, and I did find something immediately. The store is beautiful and has a lot of nice things. My items were wrapped in a cute blue box.I originally wrote the review below on the DRK Facebook page in early February 2013 soon after eating here for the first time. 

Fast forward 14 months and I'm more impressed and happier than ever. The "always changing, always delicious" daily selections that Leslie and team produce never fail to please.  

Fabulous flavors, incredibly fast and friendly service -- and entirely vegan.  My week isn't complete without my two regular visits to DRK.  That said -- even if you're not vegan or vegetarian -- I challenge you to give them a try. You will not be disappointed (and your body will be very happy with you)!  

Original review:
Thrilled to have found a place like yours so close to ASU.  Vegan food that's delicious and local -- with fast and super friendly service.  Not to mention the relaxed outdoor patio seating.  Perfect for my break between classes. I'll be back!I am addicted to this place! since its in the corner of the food court I wasn't Quite sure about this place but took my chances and ordered a viva veggie sandwich and MMM MMM MMM LEME TELL YOU words do not do justice to the glory my mouth experienced. Its fairly cheap and I have yet to order anything I did not thoroughly enjoy ..also their cookies are heavenly!I heard about this place while checking out the generic 702 show that showcases all the attractions of Vegas on the hotel TV. I was immediately drawn in by the description of the founder/mixologist's rendition of alcohol infused ice cream. At $18 a pop (approx. 3 scoops) I can assure, the experience alone justifies the splurge. I had the Snow Bunny which included Raspberry Stoli, sugar free Red Bull, and sugar free raspberry syrup, topped with Pop Rocks (absolute perfection!) The combination made for an explosive taste of tart and sweet. Just watching the mixologist apply his goggles and get to work through the haze of sugary sweet smoke rising from the mixer was a joy (did I mention liquid Nitrogen is involved in this process). 

This shop is small and nestled behind the pool area in the Cosmopolitan. The trip (we had to have a security guard escort us because it was so remote) and the expense were well worth it. This is one of the many unique culinary treasures that Vegas offers. So liquor up with a bonus sugar rush on the candy pink deck that overlooks the strip and enjoy!!This place is bomb. com.
Very customer service oriented (I love great customer service) The subs are awesome I had the Italian sub and boy was that bad boy loaded with meats.

lol I only had meat, cheese, mayo and black pepper on mine.(cuz I am weird like that) The gentleman who helped me looked a little suprised and how simple I was. So I added bacon. 
Further more I would highly recommend this place.

It is family owned, if I am not wrong.
Very clean location. 
Prices are very pocket friendly.

Enjoy.I love coming here to get my car washed.  It is cheap to do, there are many bays to vacuum, wash and dry your car and they have 2 drive-thru car wash bays that even take debit cards which is handy.Pretty darn good coffee, and I also got their chicken salad sandwich in a croissant, soooo good!!!  I don't know what they do to it but it's amazing. 

It's also all very fairly priced, it's almost as if it's a cute little boutique except for sandwiches, little cookies and adorable teacup sets for sale.  

I would definitely recommend, bombdotcom. Great service too.We've never had a bad meal here. The chicken.pita is one of the best in the valley! My hubby loves the gyro pita and Greek fries; my favorite side is the Greek salad. Although the pitas are great I crave the chicken shwarma meal with pita chips and rice....not sure what goes into making that rice but I could eat it every day! If you haven't been here yet, you're missing out!Largest indoor archery range in AZ. Top product - Hoyt and Mathews with helpful and friendly staff. Separate area for adult and junior archers.As a wine-spoiled NYer, during visits to Madison I had lamented the lack of a really good wine shop until I visited Square Wine. The shop features a good selection of well-priced artisanal and natural wines from small producers that are not available locally elsewhere, including wines from less well known areas like Jura. Andrea Hillsey personally selects the wines and knows her stuff, offering regularly scheduled tastings. This is a great place to find wines that pair well with all types of  food, and to expand your wine horizons.My rating is relative to all the other pizza places that have delivered to me, since I've lived in Vegas. New Yorkers would probably rate it 3 or 4 stars. 
Far and away the best delivery pizza (in my neighborhood). The best thing to get is the 22" pizza, because the crust turns out to be the thinnest with that one. 
The wings are pretty good as well, and reasonably priced relative to other places that deliver wings.
Sometimes they forget my blue cheese dressing for my wings, but other than that, I really have no complaints with this place.
Oh, and I tried the calzone once, and it was also above average.Look no further than Michelle... I have been to many, and she is BY FAR the best and extremely reasonably priced... I have been going to her for over two years now... Knowledgeable, professional and hysterical!   You won't be disappointed....We went here because it was within walking distance of our hotel. We were seated and then greeted by Julio, who gave us the background  of Ben and Jacks, and info on how they age the meats. He advised us the sides were huge, served family style. We started out with the Ben and Jacks house salad, which was fantastic! I will try to duplicate it, with Canadian bacon, shrimp pieces, tomatoes, onions, blue cheese crumbles. All 3 of us loved it! My sister ordered the seafood primavera, so much seafood and a bit of pasta. She said the Alfredo sauce was perfect, light and flavorful. My husband had the ribeye, cooked to perfection. I had the filet mignon, very ample portion which I did not finish. The side of mashed potatoes could have fed 4 people. We wished we had left room for dessert, they are all made in house. I highly recommend Ben and jacks!We recently moved to the area and my worst fear was scorpions. Unfortunately we have them! We continued to use the bug service the previous owners used and had horrible results. So we switched to APS. David is wonderful and is actually concerned about my scorpion problem, unlike the previous service. He is honest, thorough, and informative. Since we started APS we haven't seen a scorpion in months!  I know I can call him at any time and he will do whatever is needed to help! Great guy.. Great business. Highly recommend!Love my nationality. Absolutely love this place and Mijana. Very fun for an Assyrian and Chaldean get together!Shannon is the best!! So knowlegeable and professional!
She provides so many services and does exactly what your skin needs everytime. She offers amazing prices and provides tremendous value for such expert results! From peels to dermaplaning to laser and much more shes one stop for all my needs. My skin looks and feels amazing!!Sooo good! The pizza here is AMAZING. Plus their lunch special is a GREAT deal. Two huge slices of pizza with a soda for $5.95??? YES PLEASE! Their garlic nots are delicious and the perfect amount of garlic for this garlic lover! And the owner is So nice! Will definitely be back here every chance I get!I had a great experience with Dr Mullen.  I went in for a shoulder issue, and wasn't even finished with my initial paperwork before I was being called out of the waiting room for x-rays. Very thorough in his explanation of what was going on, got right to the source of the problem and gave me my treatment options.Great fast casual.  I like the food. Friendly service here. Which is huge for me. Will be a regular stop for a gyro or a salad.Davanti was a long time in coming, but worth the wait.  As our waiter said, it's the polar opposite of the Quilted Bear which it replaced.  The food is Italian, but the concept is more Spanish or Chinese, with emphasis on a group of customers ordering a number of plates to share, rather than each ordering his/her own.  The totally renovated interior is warm, rich, and inviting.  Every member of the staff was friendly, outgoing, and upbeat.

Our group of four started with a liver pate topped with cherries -- scrumptious.  Then we had a bruschetta, as good as it gets.  The following brussel sprout salad was the weak link -- a little too heavy with cheese to be a salad.  This weakness was immediately redressed with a fantastic mushroom risotto.  Then a delicious ragu served on white corn polenta left us struggling to find room for a raisin bread pudding desert.  We left vowing to come back soon, since the menu contained many more interesting possibilities.  

Our meal for four was $140 including tip and a $35 bottle of wine, quite reasonable for the fare.One of my favorite hang outs with the family! Love the Pides and the salads! Our favorite is the Green Eggs and Ham! Yes, it's called that and it is soooo good! The food tastes very fresh and it is definitely one of the best healthy restaurants to eat!Upon walking in, I was pleased to see there were plenty of tables at this little cafe... So One would not have to worry about finding a place to sit. The guy who greeted us at the counter was happy to explain the menu. Sandwiches, salads, entrees, and even breakfast! This place is great. All fresh ingredients & a great stop for an on the go bite to eat.I was extremely pleased with both the service and the food. I had a white truffle mac and cheese as an appetizer that I can't say enough of.  The flavor were terrific.  I could have eaten a whole meal of it but was glad I didn't.  The scallop dish was perfect, too. Three large sea scallops seared perfectly on a bed of speatzle and spinach. I also tried the creme brulee for dessert which was also fantastic. ...and to think this restaurant is walking distance from my home.  I will be back.Very happy. Good light lunch and nice people that take care of you.Plato's Closet is great! My teenage daughter loves shopping here.  They have all the latest trends/name brands at less than half of the mall prices. The staff is also very friendly!I took my sister here to try something new and we were pleasantly surprised. The food was excellent and they offered a wide variety of speciality pizzas. I will have to go back to give them a try because I'm sure they are all equally delicious. 
The staff was excellent and provided the best customer service. We were kindly welcomed and seated right away. Our server was friendly and knowledgable, he made excellent suggestions. Matt was fantastic. I think he's one of the managers here. He walked over to check on us like most managers do, but this was different. He was professional and genuine it just really made us feel welcomed and appreciated for our business. It's not often you get that quality of an experience. 
I would definitely recommend Humble Pie to my friends and family.Awesome, definitely coming back.honest owner and mechanics, better try this shop to beleive ! i'm a filipino, we make sure that our mechanics are professional, honest and reliable.This man is a great doctor! He helped me repeatedly and thoroughly even though he does not use my dental insurance. 
He goes beyond  traditional professionalism!  He is friendly, punctual, compassionate, and actually cares for his patients- not the money they bring in to his practice.
His office staff and assistants are also friendly and professional. I can not think of  a negative thing to say or write about any of them. 
Wherever I move in this state, if I need his help again, I will surely travel to him!We went here for breakfast on a Wednesday morning. We were planning on eating there but we didn't anticipate the 30 minute wait so we decided to get our order to go.  The food came out quickly and was still hot when we got home. The shrimp and grits were to die for.  I wish I could have gone back for lunch and dinner. The staff was all very friendly and the owner held the door and wished us a great day on the way out. I can't wait to go back and eat in!Listen, 5 stars is a lot--I understand--but this place is awesome and it is in a great location at the Hard Rock!

AMBIENCE:  5 stars.  Great vibe, cool decor with lots of wood and metal and an awesome chilled seafood station, hip bar, and awesome patio with views of the pool.

SERVICE:  5 stars.  Similar to other places that require you to have a certain amount of flair a la' OFFICE SPACE, I think the servers and other workers here are required to have a certain amount of tattoos and piercings!  The service is excellent, the staff knows their menu inside and out.  The bartenders deserve special mention as their craft cocktail menu is really unique and really good!

FOOD:  5 stars.  Upscale bar/pub food!  The soft pretzels are homemade and served with a delicious cheese fondue. The fish and chips is AWESOME!  The chilled shrimp, oysters, etc, are great.  I have eaten here probably 5 times over the last two years and I have never been disappointed!

ALCOHOL:  5 stars.  Very creative and diverse bar menu.

OVERALL:  5 stars!  This place is a lot of fun, with great service and really good food!On a recomendation for a restaurant in a neighborhood I didnt know very well, Angels Trumpet Ale House it was.

Super easy to find and just steps from the nights final destination FILMBAR.
Prior to arrival it was Yelped and Googled and this beer centric gastro pub seemed to be the perfect spot to catch up with an old friend prior to a movie.

My beer recomendation was fine as I took my sugestion of the server that offered 3 THREE fruit beers, because I wanted someting lighter. The peach ale was tasty and I cant wait to get back and try some of the other 9000 beer selections, belly up to the bar, and wash those down with the Poutine or as known there as The Mess.

I have heard about this dish that is a late night staple in Canada. heck all  14,000 Canadians cant be wrong. The chefs must hang out in MY kitchen because they used the perfect amount of fragrant black pepper ( my favorite seasoning) near perfect gravy and plenty of deliciouce fried cheese curds on top of expertly cooked fresh skin on fries. This dish was a perfect 9... or 10 or somewere in between that.

I plan to get around that menu but we both ordered the same thing, a turkey sandwich by the numbers. Mine would have been stellar without any chipotle, but the rest of the fine ingredients overshadowed the one overplayed flavor. The turkey was fresh roasted, great avocado and the VERY BEST toasted bread I have had in years.
The side of chips were a great option.

The space is really cool, great chairs and heft tables, if not a tad noisy (screeming baby) prices good and this yelper says its a must try when in the Rossevelt Row.Very few places capture the essence of eating in the middle of Phoenix quite like this one. With 30 revolving micro brewed beers, a menu that is simply delish, you simply can not go wrong here. My wife and I started with the "Hot Mess Fries", it was served hot with gravy, wonderful. I got the "Animal" burger, blue cheese and onions along with a custom sauce, best burger I have had in a long time. My wife got the "Trucker" pizza, loaded with bacon. Combined with a couple of micro brewed beers, and we simply could not finish everything! Our server was extremely knowledgeable and friendly. Eating on the patio offered a wonderful view of Phoenix, and there was more than enough room. Don't delay in trying this place out, you won't regret it!We visited here in the afternoon before heading to a friend's wedding later that day.  It was exactly what we were looking for, and it gives me hope for the Phoenix area.  The downtown area is a huge contrast to the urban sprawl of the rest of the Phoenix metro area.  We didn't have any food on this visit, but it looked really good.  The beer list was impressive, a good variation in type of beer and brewery location.  I tried the Dragoon 3 Goons Belgian Tripel, The Petrus Aged Red sour ale, and the Founders Porter. They had good music and a lot of seating, including a great outdoor patio.AMAZING YUMMY FOOD !!!

I was there with 3 people and we made sure we did not eat a big breakfast prior to visiting this buffet.  We went late in the afternoon and we made sure to take our time to enjoy the variety of food.  The restaurant looked very beautiful and I was in shock at all the different stations with pretty little mini-plates filled with food.  This place was so huge that I couldn't find my table at first.   It lasted us 2.5 hours to try a little bit from each section. 

First, I did a complete walk through to see what each section offered and then I began to start selecting food from each section.  At first the service was a little bit slower than normal, but then again it was quite busy.  Drinks were not refilled often enough and plates did not get taken away as often as we would have liked.   Some of our plates had only three items because of the adorable mini-plates/bowls/dishes that the food comes in, hence the need to have the plates taken away.  (For example, one fried chicken leg came in a cute mini deep fryer looking container but it took up half the plate.)  I accidentally spilled a cup of ice and could not find anyone to help me clean it up for a little bit.  After awhile, I think more staff arrived and service started picking up.  

All the stations had something yummy, except the Mexican/Latin station.  I've definitely had better authentic food elsewhere.  My friends did like the taco station though.  Dessert station was yummy.  Asian station was delicious.  Fresh hot crab legs were amazing.  I asked for steaming hot king crabs legs and I was told to wait 5-7 minutes by the chef in charge of steaming them.  I decided to take a few steps back while I was waiting and after 5-7 minutes the fresh hot crab legs came out.  Tons of people saw and came.  They pushed by me to get in front of the line.  As I politely waited in the back, the chef told everyone to make space for me to come up first because I was the first one to ask and had been patiently waiting...he remembered.  =)  Great service especially since, the chef was very busy not only taking care of the steaming crabs, but bringing more crabs from the back, passing out cold crab legs, and passing out the other shellfish and seafood to the customers.    

I've been to most buffets in Vegas that are on the strip.  I think the price at bacchanal is crazy expensive in comparison to other buffets, but then again it is Vegas and all those famous chefs did get together to create certain dishes here.  The food is somewhat higher in quality and the variety is nice

Overall, excellent food and great service.  Will go again...just wish the price was a little lower.  Wicked Spoon was number 1 as far as being my favorite but now it's number 2 because Bacchanal is now my new number 1 buffet.I had the joy of trying the Bacchanal Buffet for their weekday breakfast. I was blown away at how beautiful the space is. I love white, clean, and airy spaces.

We went relatively early and it was a weekday so we had no wait before we were promptly seated next to the crepe section. Great location!

I really enjoyed the fresh juice section drinking at least 3 glasses of their freshly made carrot juice. My boyfriend loved the watermelon juice. The perfect remedy to a night of debauchery :)

I really enjoyed the congee and dim sum section. The lotus wrapped sticky rice was divine. 

The mini red velvet pancakes were delicious too. The rotating pancake grill was a sight to behold. The savory dishes were really yummy. Every menu item came in a small dish so it was easy to try everything without wasting food. The steak and eggs were cooked perfectly! 

Presentation for all the dishes was top notch. I would love to come back for dinner or weekend brunch sometime.

Don't forget to leave room for dessert.Let me start off by saying that I visited this place with the expectation that it was an overprice gimmick. Let me continue by saying our first attempt at Bacchanal met with a two hour wait that scared us off halfway down the strip. 

It was the next day, in our second attempt, that we made it inside Bacchanal (3:00pm is a great time to beat the line). As we entered, the cynical bastard inside me was looking for something to complain about . . . but I just couldn't.  I was surrounded by such a myriad of different kinds of food that I was overwhelmed.  I figured at this point that Bacchanal's key was quantity over quality. It was time to actually try some of these dishes and put that theory to the test.

While skipping about, gathering a virtual cornucopia of food, I was admittedly excited. I carried back a plate with various sushi rolls, noodles, shrimp, sliders, and even a cute metal basket full of tater tots (Yes, a bloody basket of tater tots . . . the kind that the buffets in heaven are said to have). Again, looking for something to complain about, I couldn't. Everything I brought back with me was fantastic. 

My charming companion's plate was equally impressive and she was thoroughly pleased. I never did get an articulate opinion out of her, however, as she did not manage to say much beyond "NOM" amid intermittent giggles of delight. We each tried everything the other brought back. 

I am not a big dessert person, however the psiren song coming from the dessert bar entranced me. Before us lay innumerable gourmet treats. Everything from fancy tarts, to cheese cake, to macaroons and chocolate covered strawberries. I think I managed to get back to my table with four or five treats as my companion continued to circle the bar like a ship trapped in the grip of Charybdis. She returned a few minutes later with a triumphant smile, carrying with her several sweet looking trophies.  As the culinary orgy continued,  the name of the buffet began to make perfect sense.

We went up for more after . . . 

I cannot begin to describe how pleased we were with the Bacchanal, and how happy I was to be wrong in my assumptions. I expected your typical buffet food, but found the quality to be on par with most fine dining establishments. I thought I would at least be able to complain about the price, but honestly? We easily ate more than forty-five dollars worth of food in sushi and desserts alone. 

I would describe this buffet as the perfect vacation restaurant. Obviously it's not something you'd want to do every day (unless of course you are rich), but dining at the Bacchanal is an experience that you will not soon forget. We are already planning on visiting next time we make it down to Vegas.Hands down best buffet in Vegas. Better than Wicked Spoon, and Wynn, and Bellagio.

Their seafood - wowow you have king crab legs, oysters on the half shell, plump and fresh shrimp cocktail, and more!

Their meats - you get your standard prime rib, and turkey, etc. but they have amazing marinated lamb chops! *drools

Oh yeah another item for-shizz worth mentioning: truffle potatoes. Is that the actual name? Who cares, truffle potatoes speak for itself. 

I can't even begin to describe their dessert bar. Its nothing short of HOLY FUCKING SHIT THAT IS GOOOOOOD. You have fresh crepes, fresh creams, fresh sauces, macaroons, cakes, cake pops, cookies, souffles (made to order!), GELATO, etc. etc...... 

I'd sacrifice a day at the day club to get fat here. Or would I...? #firstworldproblemsIf you have the money, spend it here.  Worth every penny.  In my opinion there is currently no better buffet in Las Vegas, and I've tried all the good ones (and some of the bad).

Looking at some of the other reviews, I guess it's possible that they have their off-days, but there was nothing off about it when I went last May.  Everything was perfect.I have to say this buffet is literally the best buffet in Vegas! You know it's going to be an epic feast when you have to wait in line for over an hour to eat! And of course the wait is well worth it! So I want to go ahead and talk about how amazing they're taco stand is! They make your taco on request! How cool is that ? And so since I'm a Pho fanatic you know I had to go to the pho station and it blew my mind how good it was Mmmm :) So my next entree was the crab legs, which I normally do not eat but it was honestly mouth watering and now I'm pretty much hooked on crab legs! Haha. And last but def. not the least i stopped by the dessert station, and wow! They have a crepe section where they make it right in front of you! I had a Nutella crepe with strawberries smothered all over it and with a hint of ice cream! Wow my taste buds were going insane! I honestly can not wait til I go back to Vegas so I can enjoy this experience all over again! The service was on point and very friendly. If you have not tried this place, your honestly missing out on the best buffet out there!Wow!  Best buffet in town so far that I have eaten at.   There is a line to get in and it helps to be a Total Rewards Platinum or Diamond member, so that the wait is minimal.   But all of the wait is worth it!   The price on a Sunday for lunch was $49.99.  The service was excellent, our server was Massimo and he was attentive and very courteous!  The food was exquisit! Higher quality of food with so many choices.   You can get full just trying so many things.  I saw people just taking there time and grazing to enjoy the food.I'll make this easy. This is the best buffet in Vegas, maybe the USA. It's pricey, but definitely worth it. We ate here on a Thursday night so we did have to wait about 45 min. The selection is overwhelming, from custom tacos, to Kobe sliders, to scalloped potatoes with truffle sauce...you really have to scout the buffet  once you are there, don't start taking food...be strategic. Most importantly, leave room for dessert. This buffet is utterly amazing....A must if you are in town!Pros: clean, homemade everything down to the sweet and sour mix, happy hour 4-7. Indoor and outdoor seating. Delicious food! Lots of flavor and variety. Excellent service. I just can't say enough!

Con: I live too close!!! I will be here everyday :D

Don't miss out !Have you ever been to a restaurant, and then dreamed about repeating a wonderful experience? No? I must be sleep deprived. Or hungry...

I probably would never had tried this restaurant if it hadn't been for my friend that lives in Gilbert. We met for a little shopping and lunch, and decided to try TQLA. 

The restaurant is nicely decorated, and the outside patio is super cute! 

We split the steak fajitas, and OMG! they were so good! 

The meat, I believe, is ribeye, and was very tender and flavorful. What makes it even better is that when the sizzling platter comes to your table, there is a little butter on top of the meat (YUM!). There was a little cup of something on the side that we thought was a flavored butter, and we just plopped it right on top, and it was really tasty (we think it may be an ancho butter, and it was really good). 

The personnel are very nice and attentive, as well. 

Anyway, I'm dreaming of those fajitas. Every night.I can best describe the chicken as "KFC done right." The batter is tasty but not too greasy. The employees have outstanding customer service and regularly ask how everything is. Furthermore the atmosphere is inviting and creates a since of positivity. For a fast-food joint, I really don't see a reason to "raise Cain." This fine place deserves your hunger.Mario's a good man who knows his stuff. We were very pleased with the service he provided and would highly recommend him to anyone who has appliance repair needs. Also, and I share this because it's something I'd like to know, yes- there is an initial $59 charge to come out and assess the situation, but if further service is required it's just included in the total cost, it's not an additional charge. So our repair cost $100 and he charged just $100, not $159. It's worth it, too! Great service and knowledge from a real guy. You don't find this often. Don't read anymore reviews. Call him now!Previously, I wrote a review about my nail technician(Elaine) under the name of the business called, "Dana's Nail & Spa".  Recently, Elaine opened her own nail shop inside of Epiphany Beauty Salon(Trop & Durango).  I'm so happy for her!!!  She is fully recovered from her recent surgery and I'm glad that she is back to work.  No more broken or lifting nails!  I'm highly recommending her to anyone wants to have their nails done.  She has 23 years of experience in NY, Dallas, & Vegas :)  She has been always taken care of my nails sincerely and I know why she has so many royal customers up to these days.Great place to get nails done In Las Vegas ! Profession , clean and they really take the time.I love this place.  It's A LOT more than just scrubs.Amazing! I've loved their local meat at the Farmers market and was so happy when they opened the cookhouse.  I live downtown, but if I'm anywhere near the west side, I make sure to pick something up.  I love the grilled cheese, mac and cheese, the rachel, the muffaletta.  I want to try everything.  I love the amazing options of sides you can get, I've had the veggies and hummus, cheese and sausage, and a wonderful citrus quinoa salad.  If you haven't picked up their bacon, ham, creme fraiche frozen pizza, you are missing out.  Also take the opportunity  to pick up some of their frozen meats or prepared items while you're there.Looking at the other reviews, either things have really turned around at this place or I got lucky! I was seen with 5 minutes of walking in and treated with the upmost respect and kindness by a very professional and knowledgable staff. My boyfriend also went in a few months ago and had a very similar experience. Hopefully I won't have to go again anytime soon, but it's nice to know this place is there if/when I need it!Such a quick and convenient way to get your late night munches! Love it!!!Simply incredible.  From the juggling lady to the gymnasts standing on top of each other's shoulders.  

What to people expect?  I don't get these below 4 star reviews, people have lost their minds.The burger was the best burger I ever had, and the best customer service. When you go to this location you will never leave hungry.I know, I know...it's a chain.  But it's in the hood and it's GOOD!!  We have been there a handful of times and mostly like everything we have ordered.  I love that you can choose 1/2 and 1/2; meaning 1/2 salad, cup soup, 1/2 spud, 1/2 sandwich and use ANY combination.  That means you can try 2 different salads, 2 different sandwiches, salad & sandwich, salad & spud, etc.  Here's what I've had so far:

Savannah Chopped Salad:  Mmmmm... gorgonzola cheez....The ingredients were fresh but I would recommend changing the dressing to ranch.  Not a fan of the sherry shallot.
The Smokey Pepper jack Turkey grilled Sandwich:  Melts in your mouth!  There is a little tang but lots of flavor.  You can taste the bacon in every bite.
Spicy Southwest Chicken Griller:  The Chipotle Ranch is a little sassy!  Love it! I'm usually not a fan of "warm" guacamole (it comes on this sandwich and the sandwich is grilled) but it tasted fine and added that necessary "moisture", for lack of a better term, to the sandwich.
Cobb Club:  MY FAV!!!  It states on their online menu that they add mayo but I'm pretty sure the one here uses Light Mayo, which I love!  The gorgonzola (mmmmmmm.....) makes this sandwich pop in your mouth.  It's a perfect combo of all these ingredients without being too much.
Mac & Cheez:  You can get this as a side.  I have a rule to try the mac & cheez wherever I go.  This one was creamy enough but had a weird, industrial, mass-produced taste to it.  Not nearly as bad as some I've had.  Would I order it again?  Maybe...
Bacon/Cheez Spud:  Holy crap these things are huge!  I didn't know potatoes could grow that large.  It took three meals to finish it, as a side dish of course, but so worth it.  
There are still more items I'd like to try.  They have special takeout parking so it's easy to get in and out.  Happy eating all!I am very pleased with the work (new brakes, new clutch, 60K service and a few oil changes) Scott at McIlvain Motors has done on my 911 (997) convertible. He truly is a great independent Porsche mechanic - definitely very knowledgeable about all things Porsche and provides a quality product that is very fairly priced. Compared to other independent shops I have tried in the area (and to the vastly more expensive dealer), he is both better and less expensive.
But Scott is so much more - he is also a super-nice guy that takes a real interest in his customers and their cars, always willing to provide great (often money-saving) advice on everything from water leaks, to future service needs, to weak points in a particular car and design and what needs to be done to minimize those weak points.
I highly recommend Scott for any Porsche related work, try him out and you definitely won't be disappointed!I love DLUX! This is the burger place that Madison has needed for such a long time. If you're bored with the same old greasy burgers served around the downtown bars, then head over there for an awesome burger. Their fries are to die for and the drinks are always great (they did take away the gin and cucumber juice cocktail though).

The vibe is great, the service is great, and the whole place is a great place to be on any day during the week.Thank you, thank you, thank you for bringing such a charming restaurant to Old Town! I am giving The House a solid five stars and it's because they have the perfect ambiance and delicious food to accompany it. The ambiance is what really sets this restaurant apart from any other restaurant in Old Town. 

When I go out out to eat, I like to experience the complete package: experience + delicious cuisine. Many times, restaurants focus so much on their culinary creations that they forget about working on the environment. This is not the case for The House. The House is 'housed' within the second oldest house in Scottsdale. During my visit, I learned about the delightful woman who grew up in the house and how she loved her rose bushes. She was a member of one of the first families in Scottsdale and during one of the wars, she would deliver fallen soldier notices and then lend a helping hand to the families while they went through their time of loss. The history alone of this house defines the charm.

Hidden in a quiet street that's often missed (luckily) by the bar/club scene, The House is like a place you wish you could call home. Twinkle lights light up the spacious patio and large and luscious trees surround the perimeter. The interior of the house is just as charming as the exterior. At night, the intimate indoor glows with romantic candlelight while the warmth from the wood fired oven heats up the environment. It's the perfect environment for a date night or if you're looking for a nice setting for out of town guests, etc. 

Now that I've gushed about the environment, I will move on to the food. The food here is nothing less than spectacular, but I am not surprised because this is Matt Carter's brain child and he also runs The Mission down the street. I came here with a group of 15 and they did an excellent job serving us a variety of delicious food. The menu allowed us to sample the following:

Wood Grilled Crab Legs with Aji Amarillo Lime Butter - this is buttery goodness at it's best. The crab is fresh, completely buttered and delicious. 

House Brisket & Biscuit - this is a nice option for a hearty appetizer. The brisket is tender and well seasoned. 

Peel and Eat Shrimp - spicy alert! This dish as a serious kick and if you can handle the spice, this is definitely worth ordering. 

Kale Sale with Miso Peppercorn Dressing - I'm not a huge fan of kale, but I will say that for kale, they did a good job flavoring it and making it eatable for even the non-kale eaters. 

Italian Farro Salad 
Duck Confit Meatballs - I had no idea I was eating duck! However, it's tasty and just the right size to pop in your mouth. 

Berkshire Pork Country Ribs - the meat falls off the bones out of tenderness and it's seasoned with a spice that has a kick. 

Chateau Briand, Marinated Jidori Chicken, Lobster Friend Rice , Broccoli Carbonarra -- all these dishes were good. None of them stood out in my mind, but they were still incredibly tasty. 

Caramel Apple Upside Down Cake & Crumb Cake & Sacher Torte - pure sugary bliss!! 

I've already written a lengthy review, but before I say goodbye, I will also mention their hand crafted cocktails. They are superb! The drinks are made with freshly squeezed fruit, etc. They are a must if you enjoy craft cocktails!CJ is great, we use him for all our computers, business and personal. 
Highly recommended.Handlebar is one of my new favorite bars on Mill, when I actually go to Mill. It is such a cute, modern bar with a bikey flair... I love the inside: the tables, the lighting, and the restrooms. I like to see how restrooms are designed which is kinda weird but some places have cool restrooms and handlebar does. Compared to some of the gross ones on Mill haha...UPDATE- I LOVED my experience with this company and my repairs so much that I now work for them! They have the great customer service, reliability and quality of work that I really appreciate and wanted to be a part of! I am very excited to have joined the icracked family!Cheeseheadz has some of the best cooks in town.  The food has always been great and the service is excellent.  Best tuna and cheesesteak sandwiches I have ever had!  The owner Craig has really done a nice job of ensuring high quality food at a reasonable price.This is one of my faves. I eat here once a week. I crave the Sweet Pork Burrito, I am not normally a pork fan, This is the ONLY time I eat Pork and it is so Good!  I moved somewhere that does not have a Cafe Rio and Boy did I miss it! So glad to be back!My first visit with Meghan was for a much needed haircut.  I had no idea what I wanted to do other than I wanted something different.  Meghan provided some great suggestions and helped me choose a style that would work for me and my lifestyle.  She is very easy going and we had comfortable conversation that never felt forced by either one of us.  She provided some great suggestions for styling tools that would help with my hair care and also gave me some great make-up tips!  I ended up purchasing the eye shadow palette she recommended to me and I'm in love!  I will definitely be back to see Meghan anytime my look needs a refresh!By far the best place to do yoga in town. All the best teachers are here.Amazing little place to eat. Great people who give great service. I've become a regular and they truly care and get to know their customers. I highly recommend it!Move over Lolo's, Phoenix finally has a good fried chicken restaurant. 
The owner and staff are very friendly.  Everything is homemade, excluding french fries. My order (for three people) consisted of a 12 piece fried chicken with 3 pieces of cornbread and a large serving of collard greens.  The amount of chicken was HUGE and there was plently to take home for left over.  
Bottom line, the fried chicken is fantastic.  
I have no need to go to Lolos anymore; besides the only reason I went there in the first place was for the waffles.OMG!!!!  I haven't had sweet potatoes like these EVER.  Best meal I've had in a long time.  Greens, chicken, cornbread, were so good but the sweet potatoes took the cake!  Phenomenal!  IF you enjoy soul food and you have yet to eat at Ezekiel's aka Zeke's then you need to go tomorrow!I have cravings for the food from this place; it never disappoints.  My first dish that I had tried there, and honestly the main reason I had visited, was the deep-fried salmon served with grilled rice and nuoc mam (legit fish sauce for dipping, drenching on the food for sure ... and maybe drinking?).  I was in love with it.  My partner usually requests the grilled rice to be extra crispy.  Since this is a preference, I would suggest to not request it unless you know the level of crispiness of their typical grilled rice.  This is such a simple dish but it just hits the spot right.  I am a bit  biased though, because I love me some Vietnamese food. 

Oh, I forgot to mention that before you even get your food, you are asked for some delicious nuoc mat, which I believe is sugar cane juice - and it's free! You can drink a whole cup, get a refill, and have another refill for the refill and it won't even be on your bill. 

They have a list of appetizers to choose from.  I have only tried the nem nuong (bbq pork sausage, some thin [rice?] noodles, pickled daikon and carrots, a sprig of lemongrass [i think it's lemongrass], sliced lettuce, a deep-fried, rolled up sheet of egg roll paper resembling a cigarette all loaded and wrapped with rice paper).  The orange, yellowish sauce that goes along with it is smashing and necessary.  If you go alone, you can order 2 of these for $3.99 - and you will live life!

They also have this deep-fried chicken and deep-fried sticky rice dish that is so decadent, especially with the fish sauce mixture they serve it with.  (We actually had showed them a picture of the dish from another restaurant in Westminster, CA, when they didn't serve it.  Nha Trang basically adapted the same concept for the dish.)  

If deep-fried is not your thing then you can also order from the soup dishes.  I haven't tried them yet.  

Back to deep-fried - specifically, the clay-pot dishes. The prawns caramelized in fish sauce dish was very good.  However, the cat-fish version of that dish, Ca Kho To, is simply amazing.  I am not really sure how they cook it, whether it is purely from the clay-pot, or if it's a mixture of deep-frying the fish then transferring to the clay-pot, but the texture of the fish is just slightly crispy and the caramelized fish sauce is just the right amount of sweetness.  I would say that this is a definite must try.  I am salivating now just thinking about their food.I just recently joined and recieved an introduction to Crossfit... truly life changing and a really fun way to challenge yourself, no matter what your starting level.I am the happy owner of a new pair of lucious lashes! They look amazing and I am officially hooked. Thanks Chelsea, I look forward to seeing you in 10 days for my fill. (She has an incredible offer for 3 fills per month.) That means, they will look perfect all month long.. Every time I bat my lashes, I will think of you.All the food was great!Great place! Nothing better than the homemade feeling of making your own pizza!I've been to Zookz 3 or 4 times and haven't had a sandwich I didn't like. I plan on working my way through the menu and Carole and the rest of the staff are outstanding.

Zooks is close to work so it is easy to pick up a quick breakfast or lunch sandwich and get back in our 30 minute time frame.    I don't eat my green veggies like I should (or at all) but I can survive on the Kale Salad.  It is to die for. 

I would recommend Zookz to anyone.  It is located on Central across from St. Francis RC Church.  

Try the Nutella, peanut butter banana sandwich as a dessert.   My friend and I share it as it is too sweet and filling to eat after a full sandwich.

Prices are great too.By far the best sandwich place I've been too.  I really love their dessert sandwich and have liked everything I've ordered.  The place is clean, the service is wonderful and the owners are friendly.  I've taken a few friends there and they were equally as pleased!!Zookz has been open for about 18 months now... and I am truly upset with myself for not trying it sooner.  On the flip side of that, at least now I have a new regular lunch spot!  The owner Carol was extremely outgoing, friendly, and cordial!  

These sandwiches could be described as fancy "hot pockets" on a phyllo-style dough... BUT I don't think that description actually does these sandwiches justice.  I'll just default to Zookz' description as "sandwiches with an edge"...  a very good edge!  And lunch and breakfast sandwiches are served all day long.  

The #25 is a glorious combination of ham, turkey, black beans, melted cheese, tomatoes, avocado, and some sort of sauce that I can't recall because I scarfed down the sandwich so quickly!

Sooooo good!  Yay!Good AYCE. No complaints nice variety of items on the menu.This 7-11 is the nicest one I've been to in Las Vegas. I was a fan of 7-11 coffee bars  but since moving here several years ago, I had yet to find a location with a coffee bar as nice as the old neighborhood. This location tops even my old favorites in Cali. Great coffee bar with many selections, cream dispenser and cappuccino machine. It was extremely clean and organized even during morning rush hour. The guy at the register was clean and professional looking as well :) you wont' find that at all locations, so I had to point that out. I'm afraid i'll be spending a lot more on coffee now.I was taken to Chada by a friend while visiting Vegas. I'd lived in Vegas for a couple of years and was well acquainted with the Thai offerings: Lotus of Siam, Archies, and Krung among them. The meal I had at Chada surpassed them all. 

I won't go into extensive detail. Suffice to say that the fresh oysters, crab curry, and ribeye with mint sauce. All were exceptional. I was hoping to get back again before my trip ended. I can't recommend this highly enough.Took my daughter here for breakfast this morning for the first time. The food was amazing!!! I love that their foods are natural and local. The service was great as well. Everyone was so nice and quick service as well (which was a major plus since I only had a hour on my lunch break). I will definitely be coming back here soon!!! May be my new fave breakfast place!!What a place! It was my first time at Aria and I simply loved it! We decided to eat at Javier's since the decor was so inviting. You have to see it to believe it. The food is super fresh and extremely tasty and the service is top notch. 

I wasn't feeling too hungry so I got the ceviche with octopus on recommendation from our server and it was probably the best I have ever eaten. The chips are fresh and the salsa is spicy!

The design detail of this place is outstanding. You have to go there to take a look even if you're not close by, it's well worth the cab ride. I hope to go back and have a full meal.I want to keep this short and sweet. We went last night. This was hands down the best Mexican food I have ever had, and everything was amazing. Everything was so delicious. It's super expensive yes, but a great place to go for a special occasion (it was our anniversary). I absolutely loved it. Service was superb as well and our waiter (he was awesome) had tried everything on the menu and was very knowledgeable about the dishes. So happy we went here! Will definitely be back at some point.Javier's in Las Vegas (Aria Hotel) is amazing!!! Ambiance is so perfect and romantic. Very dim lighting.  Had the taquitos, queso fondido and nachos. The beef taquitos were delicious and crisp. The nachos were huge!! Big plate! The queso fondido was delicious as well. Make sure u ask for no onions if u hate them lol but overall I give it a 5 star!This is a dark corner to enjoy.  My friend and I had a brief time to bridge one Strip destination and a ticketed show, so we ducked into Javier's for an appetizer and drink.  

Javier's allure is its atmosphere as much as its convenient location in the svelte Aria.  Everything in Vegas that is worth seeking out is "through the casino."  We passed raucous sports bars and slot machine cha-chinging walkups before choosing Javier's for its quieter mood.  It has metal studded ceilings, carved wood banquets, and heavy leather table tops and lounge seating  The piped in music was definitely an amusing background - looping on reggae during our hour's visit.  

We added to the cosmopolitan mix by ordering French martinis - not cheap at $17 each.  A value totally underestimated until we rose to our feet and discovered the liquid power that could have launched us to  the ionosphere.  But since we only hoped to get to the show "through the casino,"  the libations were perfect rocket boosters.

Food served at the adjoining table showed impressive presentation.  I can only tell you about the chips that were served warm next to attractive cups of red and green salsa.

Speaking of feet.  Yes, see paragraph 3.  My friend was suffering from all those trips Through the Casino.  The kindly waitress dipped into her own purse and presented three bandaids to sooth the blister that surfaced while one toe fought with the other to be first on the escalator, tram, revolving door, taxi, carpet, marble floor, etcetera etcetera...An interesting, very girl-to-girl, hospitable way to earn a well-deserved tip.I went to Heaven's Kaffee on there soft opening and their limited menu wasn't what I saw on line. They had a smaller version of what they show on their web site but the food was Heaven. So delicious. I had the beef tenderloin roll and my husband had the gyro sandwich(his all time favorite sandwich since I have known him for over 40 years) I told him not to order is because I know they wouldn't make it right. He wanted fries but I said "NO!" Not aloud "Greek salad-dressing, on the side" We were brought: Gyro, Greek salad. kraut cakes, mashed potatoes, purple cabbage(so delicious), beef roll, potato waffle with bacon maple syrup. mashed potatoes, mushroom gravy, and also fries. Paid a little over thirty dollars. Was a great deal. We will defiantly be back.Stopped in for lunch today and was happy to be able to find something that I could make work with my Paleo Diet. I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich which already comes with avocado & bacon (without the bun) and a side house salad.  It was delicious!When this opened across the street from my house, I was stoked. Finally a breakfast joint in my neighborhood! It was nice and clean, friendly and prompt service, and great food. The only thing I can say is that I was hoping for the best biscuits and gravy I've ever had, and they fell short a bit on the gravy. Even still, I've gone here a million times already, and will continue to...Great food, and reasonable price! Real Greek family run. Authentic!Woke up this morning to a non-working AC unit. Found Dukes on Yelp and made the call. Great response time, very professional and personable. No hard up-selling. Will definitely recommend. 

And I totally geeked when John hit the horn as he pulled away!Upward Projects does it again.   This place is in my top five favorite places to go in Central Phoenix.  

The atmosphere is great, many pieces including the benches outside came from Modern Manor which is a vintage store I frequent as well.  What is critical to the success of Federal Pizza is what Upward excels at which is delivering incredible food, by a solid staff of employees at a reasonable price.  What I love about Windsor, Postino and Federal Pizza is I can go there anytime I like, have a stellar meal and not look at a completely empty pocket book.  

The pizza is by far the best in the valley.  The secret to a good pizza starts with its ingredients.  The crust makes the pizza dishes that they serve, but then the sauce isnt too sweet, but isnt too savory... like Goldie Locks, it is just right.  The toppings are absolutely perfect and Federal Pizza leverages local suppliers like Shriners to provide sausage for their pizza.  Thus proves that a restaurant can obtain local superior ingredients, provide a stellar product and make a customer walk away having enjoyed a good meal in an atmosphere conducive to fun while mitigating buyers remorse.

Another quick note, try the wine coolers... they make them there.  I know how it sounds, but they are delicious and refreshing.I don't know what it is about Central, but the street has this stretch of road with the wildest hipster joints known to man.  This place is the new discovery.  I've driven by it a hundred times and I don't think I've ever even seen the sign.  Randomly out and about and decided to check it out.  It's tucked behind some sort of retail or office buildings or something.  It was packed on a week day, hip decor, lots of booths; kind of a cool booth strip with walkways on both sides.  We were greeted by like 3 girls and a 4th waited on us, I wasn't complaining as they were all fairly attractive.  We ordered a wild tempura appetizer and split a pizza, I can't remember what it was called but it had meat and mushrooms among other things.  Food was really good and we will be back!Short and sweet - my wife and I have visited Las Vegas at least once a year for the past 23 years - sometimes twice or more. But we had never, for some reason, been to the Stratosphere. So A couple of weeks ago during a Christmas visit we walked to the Strat from Caesar's and got hungry. Inside the casino we started looking for food and McCall's drew our attention. It was a late lunch and the food and service were great.

She had a lobster cake sandwich and I had a pork loin sandwich and we both had fries and drinks. Both meals were excellent and I find that it is generally a hit-or-miss thing when these cafes make their own "homemade" fries, but the chef here knew how to crisp them up nicely. We shared an appetizer of bacon-wrapped prawns & jalapenos which were way better than any prawn appetizers we have had anywhere else.

We hit the "server lotto", too. Our waitress was attentive and efficient and knowledgeable. Try it out - they have a great lunch and dinner menu.Came back and really enjoyed myself again. This time I brought my bride. We were the first ones through the door when they opened up. Now my wife isn't as adventurous as I am but she finally settled on the chicken bowl. I pulled a classic me and ordered the same thing I had last time. The tantan men ramen. I also ordered the karaage chicken. Mostly for Laurie as I know she loves chicken. Our order was up hot and fresh in a matter of 5-6 minutes. I can't completely describe the flavors of my ramen other than to say it was so rich and wonderful, that I could easily make a slob of myself and eat 2 full bowls! The karaage chicken was somehow even better than last time. It was piping hot but so flavorful and juicy. I still really wish this place wasn't so far from my house. I will be back, and I will once again be hungry for ramen!Taking all the advice and trying the Tantan Men

It was Friday and it was cold. Ramen is what was needed!  Most fellow Yelpers gave glowing reviews, and Tetsuro's yelp really got my attention for tantan men.

I ordered ahead, adding an egg and green onion.  It was ready when I got there to pick it up, and it was packaged with consideration and regard knowing a little time & travel pass before consuming.  The broth and the other ingredients (spicy pork, bok choy, ramen noodles, egg, and green onion) were in two separate containers.

Back at the office, I combined the broth with the ingredients, stirred gently, and enjoyed the savoriness of this dish.  The broth is a juxtaposition of slight creaminess and a hint of spiciness as the spicy pork slowly & chili oil slowly become fused.  Like a good wine, it actually became better as I tasted, mixed, and tasted again.  A generous serving of green onion and perfectly cooked ramen noodles topped off a remarkable broth.  Looking forward to trying their spicy miso broth next time!I went in to get my hubby something sweet for our anniversary! He loved them and the staff was super friendly and helpful. With three kiddos they even helped me to the car.From acclaimed Michelin star steakhouses to the trendiest gastropubs, from AYCE buffets to authentic Asian food, Vegas has a ton of restaurants. 

Unfortunately, almost all of these restaurants are not dog-friendly. I even heard that you can't walk dogs on the Strip because they wanted to keep the peddlers and their dogs off Las Vegas Boulevard. 

Therefore, trying to find a dog-friendly restaurant will require you to leave the Strip and head over to the more residential areas of Vegas. Perusing the Yelp app, that is how the wife and I stumbled upon Honey Salt, a glorious restaurant in the Summerlin part of northwest Las Vegas that feels like Palm Springs, CA... complete with wealthy white people and golf courses.

Like morons, we decided to do a late lunch with our four-legged son, Charlie, in the hot desert that encompasses Las Vegas. Blame our stupidity or the fact that we are so used to taking him around with us everywhere in Southern California that we did not realize how fucking hot it gets in Las Vegas. That is why when we arrived at Honey Salt, their spacious patio was empty. However, almost immediately, one of their workers, Mauro, came out and set up a patio umbrella for us to shade us from the hot desert sun. I'm sure he was thinking, stupid tourists! 

As we were waiting for the umbrella to be set up, our mindful server, Louis, brought out a bowl of water filled with ice cubes for Charlie! He even brought out two glasses and a pitcher of ice water for the dumb humans! First impressions go a long way and we were definitely impressed. 

We ended up ordering two of the "Family Favorites" off their lunch menu. The Mary's Free Range Chicken ($15) and the Ahi Tuna Salad ($17). 

The Mary's Free Range Chicken is served with red and white quinoa, beluga lentils, shaved fennel, radish, avocado chunks, and a citrus vinaigrette. While the chicken was very good, the grains definitely stole the show. This hearty conception was delicious and the citrus vinaigrette made it really refreshing. True to their name the citrus vinaigrette provided the "honey" and the grains provided the "salt".

The Ahi Tuna Salad was equally amazing. Yes, the wasabi pea and ginger crusted ahi tuna was great and the baby spinach with cream soy vinaigrette was delicious. However, the real star was the sea beans and julienned Asian pears salad mixed in what was a sesame kind of sauce. This single salad had both "honey" from the sweet Asian pears and "salt" from the sea beans. Freaking awesome.

All in all, the service and the fresh farm-to-table food was really impressive. It's definitely a hidden gem in the Las Vegas desert. Next time the family is in Vegas, we will wait for the sun to go down so that Mauro won't have to break a sweat for us.

* The complimentary Parmesan crisps served with honey butter were very addicting and they have an extensive beer selection.

* Honey Salt is located in the inconspicuous Rampart Commons shopping center with a Chico's, Gap, and Pottery Barn at the northwest corner of Rampart and Charleston. If exiting the Rampart exit off the Summerlin Parkway, the shopping center will be on the right.

* Honey Salt must be doing something right because they will be opening up another restaurant in the Summerlin area!I are here a few nights ago and I was really pleased with everything. The ambiance and lighting is really nice for dinner, and the concept is simple and unique. I had the mussels with chorizo and they were amazing. Will definitely be back to try some of their whiskey they have a really extensive selection.Oh my I spotted this bad boy at the Tempe Campus right in between of the Apache Parking Structure and the BAC Business Building!! 
After seeing this truck parked there around 5:00pm till about 7:00pm I decided to pay them a visit and see what they had to offer. Boy was I glad I did, since they offered much healthier meal options then the MU does! Makes me and my tummy very happy. 
They have delicious and quickly prepared bowls or sides! Top notch ingredients and flavors. For example, I went with their B.Y.O.B. (Build your own bowl) and selected the marinated stir-fry chicken, along with stir-fry veggies, white rice, spicy teriyaki sauce and a bit of their ninja dust, which was recommended for an added spicy kick. Oh my, it was OH SO GOOD and healthy too!! So I was glad I decided to try them out! 
The service was super sweet and friendly! Great experience!! High five to that and a well deserved A++ 
I will be paying them more visits I'm sure!! :)The owners put a lot of time and effort into making this such a spectacular nightclub. Every time I go here I have the best times. It's great for dates, parties and causal night outs. The drinks are amazing! The service is impeccable!! And the staff is friendly, engaging, and knowledgable. 

Definitely will be going back to this club every Vegas trip from now on!!!Great place to eat if you want something fast, cheap, and delicious on the Las Vegas Strip.  The fiancé liked it here so much we had DJ's twice in one day!  From the two visits, we got a chance to try their tacos, nachos, burrito, and churros.  ALL the meats were cooked to tender perfection and flavored wonderfully.  LOVE the churros--they're cooked to order so you get them piping hot!  Awesome value in Vegas (especially if you lost a few Benjamins gambling like I did)!This place is amazing.  Great live music, tons of ping pong tables and cornhole boards, and great drinks/service.  Add to that complimentary valet parking and it was a perfect night out.Very happy with the service and floral arrangement here. We literally called just a few hours ago, and the flowers are already ready for delivery.Amazing food. Went two nights in a row and was extremely pleased both times. This is definitely the best place to eat at the four seasons and maybe Arizona!!! Make sure you get the pretzel knots!OK - So, I miss lots of things about Phoenix, but Dutch Bros is at the top of the list. Didn't have one close to my house so it was always a treat to grab an iced coffee on a lazy Sunday or during a crazy day full of errands. Thinking about it actually makes me feel nostalgic... yikes - good job, Dutch Bros!Ree is a great coach. She has an easy going   personality that creates a relaxed teaching environment, along with a very instructional approach. I have learned a lot about my voice from Ree, and can hear and feel noticeable improvement...and have a lot more confidence in 
my voice. Very thankful to have found her!Came across this on my facebook feed and we thought we would try it today during our tour of the east side of Madison. So glad we did! The tuscan bean and kale soup was mouthwateringly yummy, the quiche was light and fluffy, and the grand finale of a slice of flourless chocolate cake was divine... we will be back!I was totally new to the ecig world, and the owners of Butt Out went to great lengths to make sure I had the right equipment and knew exactly how to use it. The environment of the shop is very inviting and they always encourage you to hang out. I haven't had any experience with other ecig stores, but it's not hard to see that these guys are doing it right and really care about the customers.This place rocks!

I've been a pack of day smoker for over 20 years, and a few weeks ago I was doing some research on e-cigarettes to help me quit, or at least find a safer alternative.

My friend Tom told me about this place, so I went. They were super helpful, set me up with a starter kit and e-juice (the fluid that goes into the vaporizer). They were knowledgeable and friendly and took the time to explain to me how to use the equipment they sold me. Out the door for the price of a carton of cigarettes.

I went back the following week for more e-juice (in a different flavor) and I'm happy to say that although I haven't completely quite smoking regular cigarettes (they call those "analogs", hilarious), I'm on my way.

I currently smoke only two in the morning, and when this pack is done, I'm done.  This isn't supposed to be a review of e-cigs, it's supposed to be about Butt Out.

Simply, they ROCK.Amazing staff. Jaina at the front desk is very friendly and makes you feel welcomed. Dr Gardner is the best at what he does. Very good prices. Recommend this place to all my friends.Stop coming up with reasons not to and just try it! It totally works and is as convenient and affordable as advertised!

I am a 6'7", 350lb, 40 year old man who had never been to a chiropractor and was as skeptical as they come. Dr. Lovaas is an amazing chiropractor who really knows his stuff and, most importantly, wants YOU to be happy and healthy!

For me, it boils down to this: I just got back from my 5th visit and I feel amazing!

All I can say to you reading this review is, try it! You have nothing to lose and everything to gain. DO IT!

TOTALLY LEGIT!!! THANKS DR. LOVAAS!!!We came this past Friday night for Krewella. Great venue!

I love the whole walls full of screens for light shows. And the dance floor was big, perfect for our group.

AND we got two free drink cards. Sure they were only for vodka, but that's my favorite anyway hah. 

I loved our night here. I will definitely be back.Better than the popular ramen places in L.A. -- Daikokuya and Shinsengumi.  The chashu they put in the broth is amazing and they give you lots of it.  Love this place!!I've been to Blue 32 three times now (twice at this location) and I've been impressed every time. Blue 32 is not your typical sports bar. It's clean, open, and really nice. They also have a large food menu and everything is made fresh. The service is also great and really accommodating. 

Their Philly Cheesesteak was delicious. I got mine with cheese whiz. Only thing is I wish that it didn't have chopped up peppers in it. I thought they would be whole peppers that I could just take out. Noted for next time. The sweet potato fries were also really good. Thee steak in their Steak Cesar is also amazing. Perfectly seasoned and cooked. It comes with a really large piece of garlic bread. I wish that there was shredded parm on it though.

Definitely check this place out if you're looking for good "bar food" or if you want to catch a game.By far, the most helpful and friendliest BR outlet I've visited EVER (and I've been to my share around the US).  We were greeted upon arrival and the store was fairly organized for a holiday weekend.  Had to do a return; a pair of pants that I bought for my sister last Jan.  Sabrina and Oscar were very accommodating and took care of the (out of policy) return in an efficient manner.  Keep up the great work!I had my first class EVER in a boot camp/cross fit type class and I LOVED IT! I thought it was incredible. The place is amazing, tons of obstacles and workout stations. The class I had was the Boot Camp Las Vegas class that comes to Camp Rhino every Thursday.  I went in hoping not to barf, and came out with my butt kicked but smiling from ear-to-ear ! It was awesome.Showed up at this location Sunday night right before closing. So happy to have found a place open till 9pm or else I would've ended up at the ER. Very quick tool me in as soon as I finished my paperwork. Waited 15 min to see a dr but didn't mind as I could hear how caring she was towards other patients   She kept making sure everyone was ok. Took care of me and my infected toe and they even helped me help a pharmacy open near by. Will definitely come back here if I get sick!As egotistic as this sounds I often get compliments on my smile. My secret? Brushing, flossing, retainers, and biannual checkups at Bright Smile! Alright I lied, I don't floss, but that's why we go to the dentist rightttttt?

I've been a patient at Bright Smile for something like 7 years. The staff is quick, I always get a reminder post card, a day before reminder call, and dentist swagbags. The procedure is always the same, I get walked in, get some x-rays, say hi to the dentist, get my teeth cleaned, polished, and swagbag! I've accumulated so many Oral-B toothbrushes, Crest toothpaste, floss and mouthwash that I don't know what to do with them. I have the luxury now of just taking my free stuff to a trip and just tossing it after. 

Their new location can be a little difficult to find when all the offices and buildings look exactly the same. Take a right turn at the round-a-bout on Post and go all the way down in the business complex. 

Their office is incredibly accommodating. I don't know how many times I've (naively) made appointments in the morning, but miss my appointments (oversleeping of course) and reschedule the same day!

By the way I hate the word swagbag.Took my two miniature schnauzers here and I have nothing but good thing to say! 

My dogs get a full shave (no schnauzer cut) but do get keep their beards and eyebrows. 

After a simple explanation, I felt in good hands. And when I came to pick them up, their trim was exactly what I wanted. 

The ladies here do a great job and I can't wait until my dogs next trim!I bought a balloon ride as a gift to my wife and we both loved it. Jon and his crew were very nice, knowledgeable and experienced. If we balloon again I would only use Apex and highly recommend them.Tried green tea snoh with black sesame glaze this time around. A few of my other friends also ordered the green tea snoh. General consensus was that the flavor was very mild, almost non-existent. It was good when you ate it with toppings, but without the toppings it was pretty much flavor-less. Probably won't try that flavor again!These are, by far, the BEST carne Asada tacos I have ever tasted... I stumbled upon this place by accident looking for hot dogs one night about a year ago. Luckily I found this place instead!! I think I am their most frequent customer as I only live about 2 minutes away! Definitely hope to get these guys some business by putting this up on here :) they deserve it!!Best Asada tacos I have had in vegas. Can't wait to go back to try the rest. Interesting setup, you order from the trailer out front, but you can eat inside of there brick and mortar that's in the same lotBeen going here for at least six months and always do a excellent job.  Very relaxing inside this place and staff always treats me wonderful.  Also I never have to make a appt.  they always take me right away.Great run! The hoodie you receive as part of the race packet is very high quality; I'll be wearing it a lot. I also bought another hoodie at the merchandise tent; it was similarly very well made and my wife bought a fun bling shirt. The race is a flat course, but it's nice because you get one side of a road which is divided by a median to run on, so there's lots of room for runners and no traffic whizzing by. The pre-race free yoga was a great way to stretch and kill time before the race started. We made sure to arrive very early as there are not a lot of roads into the Salt River Fields complex, although there is a ton of parking available.

The after-race party is fun, and the hot chocolate and chocolate fondue is wonderful! Lots of lines to pick up your treats from, so virtually no waiting. The only thing I wish was that the mug was higher quality. I can understand it being plastic (so people aren't dropping and breaking them in the parking lot), but a higher quality level would be appreciated. They also had plastic bag stations for your mug when finished so it didn't get chocolate all over you/your car on the way home.

A very well thought out race, and my wife and I will be back next year!(W)e finally paid a long overdue visit to La Belle Terre Bakery

YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2013-(23/100) "Cracknnele Addict"Does a great job of cleaning your car. Free vacuums that work really well! Also free carpet mat cleaner & a vending machine with cleaning cloths for purchaseMy wife and I adored his place. The service was great, the food was outstanding, the ambiance was cozy, and we will definitely return. We started with a sampling of bruschetta, then onto the elk shank, the white pizza, and finished with a salted caramel ice cream and chocolate basil torte for dessert. The portion sizes were perfect, the prices were very reasonable (especially for the quality of the food), and I've been to few other places where I felt more at home on my first visit. There were many regulars, lots of good conversation, and even a personal visit from the owner herself. If you're in the area, you should definitely stop by for a visit to this amazing local gastropub.Loved this restaurant!  The soup (lobster bisque) was amazing and I had the pulled BBQ pulled pork sandwich which was very tasty!  My son had the kids grilled cheese sandwich and the Wisconsin Cauliflower soup.  My meal came with bread and a chocolate dipped strawberry and my son's just had the strawberry.  Every sandwich, soup and salad can be customized with different toppings and mix-ins.  

They have incredible desserts there...brownies, cheesecake, tarts..etc.  I had one of the brownies and it was fresh and delicious.  And they have fun Italian soda mix-in flavors for your soda.  They are moderately priced and the food was great!  I'm looking forward to going back there again.I went here for the first time with friends the other day and must say I was surprised I haven't tried this place sooner!

Cafe prices for the food here. It's not a cheap place for a sandwich if you are comparing to a Subway, but the flavor and quality of food is as good as it gets in my opinion. I went to Panera TWICE (different locations) and food was served consistently. Cashiers know their menu and helped me choose my items. Paninis were crispy, warm, and loaded with chicken. YUMMY

I ordered Pick 2 which runs about $7.95 (I think). Choosing a "Signature" option will add $1 to the combo. French Onion soup and the Frontega Chicken, which is a signature option. Worth it. It's $1 cheaper than a lunch combo of sandwich and soup/salad at other places like Yard House anyway.

Feeling fancy for breakfast or brunch but dont' want to go to a sit down, menu type of restaurant? Go Panera instead :]I love this place! This place is conveniently located in the colonnade plaza next to the movie theater on pebble and eastern.

The staff are friendly and great, and really informative with their foods. I was so interested in learning their names and their contents in their food they were so nice enough to let me try samples of their different types of Bakalvas!

I normally get the Grape Leaves, Tibouli Salads, and their Spinach pies! they are to die for and yet CHEAP!

I also love their Spinach and Cheese Zatars along with their cucumber greek yogurt and their hummus!

Everything is made fresh daily, if you want you may even request to have those orders made fresh to order they are usually nice to enough to do that for me.

As far as their Bakalavas go they are amazing and really good! They have an amazing  selection, never thought there were so many different types.

If your in a rush go ahead and order it to go, otherwise enjoy their food while sitting outside.


Try NOW! ;)I have to say I was really nervous for my first bikini waxing, but Char (Charlene) so was nice and professional, she totally calmed my nerves and made the whole experience much more comfortable than I thought possible. I would definitely recommend her to anyone and I've already booked my next appointment!If u want to try traditional Japanese food, come here!  The food is very good, and people here is very friendly!Love this place!  Burgers are a bit smaller than most gourmet burgers but they are well worth it.  Had the truffle parm fries, roasted jalapeno peppers, farm burger, and britannia burger.  All of them were full of flavor and cooked perfectly.  It was a little hard to find because it's not listed on the Miracle Mile directory but the food, ambiance, and awesome dessert definitely got that 5th star back.Dinner on a Sunday nite. Waitress Ashley C was very attentive, courteous, and hospitable. Scene was lively. Sunday Night Football was on their HD flat panels, so we were able to watch and din.Mood: Sports bar type.  Table and chairs- also long bar area to sit at.
Seating: we sat at the bar on high top padded stool/chairs and could watch the food cooks and service teams in action.
Service: Very good, Food prep team top notch. All plates checked for smudges or crumbs and cleaned or replaced before serving.
Food: Very Good. Very -Very good.  I must admit, I complain of high priced Vegas places, but I am a BURGER FREAK.  The Hells Kitchen Burger and Farm burger were Fan-friggin-tastic! Even all of the condiments taste freshly made. This place makes me want to come back, like tomorrow.
My past Favorite Burger places: Holsteins @ Cosmo and Burger Bar @ the mall between Mandalay Bay & Luxor. Right now, I'm putting Burgr as #1.
Prices: 2 burgers, 1 hot dog (geez it is good),  2 iced teas, 1 coke, 1 parm, cheese fries, &  1 reg fries. = $95 bucks.  
Yes, I could buy a lot of ground beef for that $$, but hey-it's Vegas.  I don't like to cook so when I want to treat myself to a burger (I don't eat them often because of fat/calories) I only go for a truly delicious one...and Burgr does it up right.Til this day my husband and I will randomly bring up how amazing the chicken wings were. I still get random cravings for the fish sandwich. This place is a must go to when in Vegas. 

Oh and the jalapeño poppers---- ammaaaazing. They come in these tubes.

Trust me, it's not just the hype.It is very rare that I give out the perfect 5 stars on a review but in all honesty, Gordon Ramsay should be proud of this location, it's staff and the awesome food!  5 stars is definitely deserving!  I was blown away by our server who was one of the best servers I have ever had.  He was in it the while time and a perfect attitude that made me want to come back for more!  Back all that great service up with an unbelievable burger and fixings......and Mr. Ramsay has a winner here!  Big claps, high fives and just an overall wonderful experience!  I couldn't be happier!  I cannot wait to go back and try the chili dog now!  Yum!I loved it. The Burgr was delicious, people say expensive, but in PH there is Ketchup or something and the prices are almost the same for regular burgers. 

I love that the Burgr comes out exactly as identified on the menu, I cannot express how annoying it is to order something and then find that it has half a dozen other items added that are not listed. 

Our waiter was great and service was top notch. I will definitely eat here again.Saw this show last night and was blown away! The theater is small so don't worry if you don't have great seats.  We were in the fifth row and enjoyed every minute of it.  The performers are incredibly talented and they had the entire audience cracking up the entire show.  I am not even a huge rock fan (more of a 90's pop gal) and I was singing along and laughing most of the night.  Would highly recommend if you are in Vegas! Applause all around!This place is really good. They pay a lot of attention to the toes, more so than many places. I've been to the very popular places nearby, and I can't understand the appeal. I think the staff here do a better job. Great work, I'll continue to come back!I have a Volkswagen beetle and I went to AutoZone and got a battery and they told me that they could not put it in for me because it was too difficult. They recommended I go to AA auto care that they would put the battery in from me.  They not only put it in for me but didn't even charge me 1 cent. Thanks so much!Seriously one of the BEST breakfast places near me! They are always pretty busy so do expect a wait but it is well worth it! Plus you're able to get a morning cocktail while waiting :) haven't had a bad meal yet and the service was great! Super friendly staff all around! Definitely recommend this place to anyone and everyone!!Back Yard Taco is a beautiful place obviously created with much love.  There is a beautiful outdoor patio with misters.  I had a chicken taco and the crazy potato.  Both were equally delicious.  There is a salsa bar where you can load up with whatever pleases you.  The people are very friendly and helpful for someone who doesn't know one thing from another and the food was served quickly.  The owners should be proud of their back yard taco.Best asada on the planet. They use prime beef and the freshest ingredients. I eat here 3-4 times a week. I won't eat another taco in Mesa.This place is really awesome.  I went here for a work event with a group of people.  The wait staff was great and the food was very unique and everything was excellent.  The atmosphere is really great too.  They have some very cool rooms upstairs. The pork dumplings were some of the best I have had and we had a few crab dishes that were awesome too.I went here tonight and felt compelled to write this review. I went for drinks and dessert with my friends from out of town(I moved to Las Vegas area two weeks ago). We were seated in Russ's area. He is such a friendly and amazing server. He recommended stuff to us and even brought me a sample of their cream corn my friends were raving about(they came the night before as well). We had some cupcake shots that had frosting and sprinkles on them. We had champagne and then a huge dessert platter of all the things you could want, cheesecake, some kinda bread cake, choc cake, some kind of fluffy moose stuff.. ALL GOOD. The GM came over and spoke to us a few times to see how we were doing. She was very friendly and accommodating. My friend said she wanted to go to Ghost Bar that night with her family that was in from Illinois and the GM called her friend she knew at Palms to make sure the ladies got walked in. They had a fashion show on their catwalk which was entertaining. Then after they had the hottest girls dancing on stage. One was a belly dancer and one was on pointe shoes-and their booties hanging out in a classy way:) The guys next to us were eating some juicy steaks which looked amazing as well. Overall, I am definitely go back with some friends cause I know they will be impressed. This place is somewhat new and I could imagine it getting pretty packed sooner than later.This was the highlight of our trip to Las Vegas.  The pear and Saga blue cheese salad is probably the best salad I have had in years. (that is saying a lot since we live in San Diego and the salads available here are outstanding)  The beef shorts ribs cooked in a wine sauce were tender and absolutely delicious. It came with mashed potatoes and carrots. A very good value. The service was perfect and friendly.  Russ, our waiter, was outstanding.

A thoroughly enjoyable evening away from the noise of the casinos.I enjoy going here with my boyfriend for a cheap sushi dinner. Very well priced and good service. I love it how once you're seated and place drink orders, you're free to start eating off the conveyor. Although I do have a bad habit of getting too many rolls at once to the point of being full and not able to eat the ones I just got. They also have ramune sodas and sake that they send around too. They're fantastic.It's a smoothie, in a bowl, so more frozen, with nothing but GENUINELY healthy ingredients, but it doesn't taste "eww, healthy"  !!   Yes, it is somewhat more expensive than ice cream or a frozen yogurt, but it really is due to the quality of ingredients. NO fillers, no dairy, no sugar, no "fake" sweeteners... your body will truly thank you.   
And really, you have to get a BIIIGGG bowl with lots of extra stuff to get the price up over $10... It would be a serious M E A L ....DEE-licious and fresh.  Feel good food, awesome beverages (iced teas, fresh juice, coffee) and friendly service! Great location as wellThis used to be the Rhino Cafe and recently changed owners and the name to Sorella Caffe.  This was my first time in here and ordered a latte, which was very good.  The owner introduced herself, and said she hadn't seen me before and asked if I lived around here.  She was very personable and I was impressed that she recognized a new customer and was very outgoing.  I can certainly see that her new business will thrive.  I'll be back for sure.SO GOOD! I had the grilled cheese with mac n cheese on it. It was two of my favorite things in the whole world bottled up into one delicious sandwich! I am dying to hunt them down again and try another one. Their dessert sandwiches look incredible too. I will try the cheesecake one next time!Great food, awesome service (thank you Chase) and very reasonable pricing.  Next time I'm in the area I will definitely be stopping by again!This place is incredible. We always order ahead and food is ready or nearly ready when we arrive. Chicken fried rice is some of the best I have had. We always get a meal combo. 2 or 3 items at a reasonable price and can feed the two of us with enough for lunch the next day. Josie likes the won ton soup. Will have me stop if she is under the weather. It's magic. Staff is super friendly. And they remember you when you come back. If your in Henderson you can't go wrong.Great beer on tap and the food is delicious. It's nice to come to a locally owned restaurant with craft beers that change all of the time.Amazing and super fun! This place was packed but we only had to wait 15 minutes for a table at their busy time of night on a Saturday. The crowd was very hip and the atmosphere was fun. We sat there for at least two hours grazing on antipasto tray and pretzels with cheese dip. I found a new bear that I love and I can't wait to go back!I had my dress shoes rehealed here. They made my shoes look almost brand new. Cost was $16.95. Would take my other shoes here again.this place was clean, people were fun and my nails look great.  The design is really nice and the price is great!!Well this new restaurant seems to amaze us with its proffesionalism. I thought we were dining at a fine dining steakhouse. They have a very proffesional server and busser. And the food itself are magnificent.

We ordered the fish and chips and the bbq baby back ribs and it was wonderful. The fish and chips are crispy and wonderful while the ribs fell of the bone and pretty flavorful. For a pretty decent price, D grill should be one of your fav restaurant when you visit downtown vegas. Especially when its located inside the D casino where all the action is happening.Chinita Mexican Bar and Grill is a wonderful experience!! My daughter and I loved the food and the service.  We had Steak Fajitas, lots of steak and vegetables with the steak not over done and the taste..wow!!.  The service was great as well. You will enjoy every moment you spend there.Finally had a chance to eat here for lunch and YES! it is great. Had an Al Pastor burrito with the works for $6.00. The meat was so tender and tasty, the pico de gallo and beans were fresh and flavorful. Today was their 6 month mark so tonight I went back with the kids for $1 tacos. We had chorizo, carnitas, and asada. All were very good but our favorite was the chorizo. Corn on the cob with mayo, cheese and chile is the only way to it and for $2 each we had two. Out of all the Mexican places we've ate at around town this one has the best salsa bar. There were at least 7 to choose from and there were grilled peppers and onions both hot and cold. Limes and carrots are pretty much standard but cucumbers, whole and cut radishes were a bonus. Love this place and will be back for more soon.Yum! So many options and at reasonable prices you can try more than one type of taco. The burritos are huge so maybe one will be enough... if not, I won't judge :)

super clean, super friendly can't beat it :)Longhorn Steakhouse is awesome!  It seemed quite busy when we were there, but the food was phenomenal and the wait staff was great.

I had the white cheddar and bacon stuffed filet, which I prefer well done.  Not only was it done to perfection, but still tender, which many places cannot accomplish.  

Great steaks and highly recommended!Great job guys!!!I don't know how anyone gives this place less than 5 stars, the food is the best we have had at a restaurant in a long time, it's authentic, homemade, and yes it is a mom and pop shop...which makes this place even more inviting, the owner came around to speak to every table. Would absolutely come back here, and only here for Mexican food again.Friendly service and amazing food! Valle Luna just got bumped down to our #2 favorite Mexican spot due in part of Leñero. This place is more authentic, tastes better and for the same cost. If you're looking for great tasting food with a nice subtle atmosphere come here!! You won't be disappointed.Fusion better than your Ford hybrid.
I am not usually one to appreciate Japanese-related fusion food, but after a stellar meal at Uchi in Austin, I know I can be open-minded when it comes to creative cuisine and good quality ingredients.  Service was really amazing.  My server Ashlee was very attentive, gave me great food suggestions, and made it easy for me to be a solo diner.
The chefs in front of me were also great - I did not get any names but we had a cross-section of Asia with a Japanese female chef, a Thai male and a Filipino male.  I also met the executive chef, who is Filipino.
I received a hot towel to prepare for the meal, and ordered a pot of hot green tea.

The amuse bouche: king oyster mushroom "scallop" with yamaimo (mountain yam), raw okra slices, yuzu tobiko - a bit hard to pick up with chopsticks so I had to ask for a fork - the raw okra was awesome, and everyone knows I love a good yuzu...anything!

Special dish from the chef: fresh (large) cubes of watermelon topped with cilantro, in a lime-fish sauce-coconut cold broth.  When I first tasted this, it exploded with Thai flavors and was more delicious that I expected it to be.  It was a nice gesture to receive this dish gratis.

Appetizer: crispy brussel sprouts with lemon chili, mint and puffed rice.  I love brussel sprouts with crispy leaves (I make this at home with basalmic and olive oil) - these were different because they were halved, with some of the stem on, in a powerful citrus-y sauce that was deeeelicious.  I could probably make a meal off of this dish.  A MUST order.

Nigiri: I ordered 3 pieces next, the shime saba (Norweigan mackerel) with ginger, scallion and lemon zest; hamachi (yellowtail) with jalepeno miso and cilantro leaf; and the gyutan (beef tongue with pesto).  The hamachi was good but not too fatty...sauce was tasty.  The saba was a star - perfectly cured and the flavor highlighted by the lemon zest.  The beef tongue was SO tender, it was glazed and in the shape on a rectangle, wrapped with a seaweed wrapper around the nigiri, topped with basil and pine nut puree. It was really unique and I would get it again.

Sakana dore: fish of the day (tonight was choice between salmon and albacore and I chose salmon), apple slices, zucchini chips, bell pepper (yellow and red in long shreds), tosaka seaweed, micro greens, and yuzu honey.  The apples really tasted great with the yuzu honey, which was spiked with aji amarillo (yellow Peruvian chile pepper) and had quite a nice back heat to it.

Next for my pre-dessert, I ordered uni, with candied quinoa and tamari.  The tamari is not necessary here because the uni is really some of the freshest I have ever seen or tasted.  I also hate quinoa but the candied nature added an interesting crunch.  I did not like the candied quinoa on my nigiri at Uchi either, but this was still a delicious bite of food.  Normally I end at uni, but I decided to go for dessert since I was doing a lot of tasting.  First, I asked the chef in front of me if I could try the mentaiko aioli served with the toro.  He happily obliged.  It was really delicious.

For dessert, I ordered the avo hanimu.  The menu only says "avocado, lime, peanut, honey" and Ashlee gave me a brief description, but when I received it, it was HUGE and not at all what I expected.  It has these disks of lime curd? with a peanut-sugar crumble, lime "chips" that were like sugar glass, and then 2 textures of avocado - a frozen mousse and a sorbet.  The avocado was really tasty (I love a good avocado smoothie so bring it on as a dessert!) but the dish was a bit disjointed and I wish I had other people there to share it with me!

When I was preparing to leave, Clint B. and his wife arrived and I told them to order the brussel sprouts.  Great ambiance, wonderful service, creative eats, and a lot more to try!Yonaka is amazing! They take ordinary sushi and make it something special.

Everything we tried on the menu was great. We especially enjoyed the salmon prepared various ways and the sake selection.

If you are a visitor, take the time to head off the strip a bit to try this place and if you are a local, why haven't you been here yet!?The food was an absolute heavenly experience for my friend and I after finding this very unsuspecting restaurant. 

While eating the Sake Orenji, I had to sit back after a few bites and just close my eyes. It felt like instant meditation. 

The service was also incredible and incredibly friendly. 

We appreciated very much the woman (her name has slipped by, Jo? Possibly?) who came around to inquire on everyone's dining experience. We ended up talking to her forever (which was wonderful) and she told us a lot about the food, the goals of the chef and the staff, and just a lot about what you could tell was tons of heart and care put into every aspect of the operation. 

I truly hope the best for this place and tell everyone I can about eating here! 

I haven't had a dining experience like this in a long time that felt entirely complete and left my tummy and my spirit lifted. I love to see places like this where they really consider the art of food and turn it into an adventure. 

I could really brag about this place forever.One of the best dining experiences I've ever had. The service was incredible. They brought hot towels to clean our hands, the plate setting was beautiful, and our waiter was very knowledgable and cordial. I loved the mix of traditional Japanese cuisine with modern twists. We ordered the brussels sprouts, the Hamachi Kama and some delicious pork with an orange glaze. We must have gotten six different dishes and enjoyed them all. The flavors were incredible and very fresh, but more than anything the price was right. :)Best service I've revived in Las Vegas in a long time. And the food matches the servicei really loved my falafel pita. i was a little bit skeeeered at first to create my own, ya know, with the classic falafel pita creation being so divine. but i went for it. i added roasted beet hummus, fried eggplant, garlic aioli (put this on everything, please), tatziki and some other goodness. i went there for lunch and seriously though about going back for dinner to try another version. can't wait to go back. solid stuff.Bowls are amazing. Had the kafta bowl with the ginger lime and cilantro hummus with lentils and cucumbers.Taste bud paradise! It is really hard to name my favorites, I've been there 4 times since they opened and it's true love. I've never had Spanish rice like this - an inventive concoction that includes chorizo and pineapple chunks. You must also have the short rib tacos. You're welcome. The carne asada and al pastor are also wonderful. The guac is acado-riffic and the fresh, limey, just-the-right-amount-of-everything, ceviche is going to be the absolute perfect meal come summer. Go on Sangria Saturday for the perfect experience. The best part are the prices - completely reasonable. My husband and I had an app, an adult beverage and a whole lot of tacos and rice for about $30. There's not a lot of seating inside so get there early in the 100+ degree days. Enjoy!Sixteen years with Keith and still going strong. Always accomodating...right up to the last minute.  Consistent, excellent results in a relaxed setting. Brilliant work with color and keratin treatments. Can't imagine going anywhere else.Great food and atmosphere.  The manager I think his name is Jack went out of his way to make sure everything was fine.   We had sushi. The boat. A lot of food for a great price.Great food, clean interior, clean restrooms and helpful staff.  True Chicago food from a true Chicago company.  It is always busy here, but the staff helped my elderly Grandfather find a seat among the sea of hungry folks.  The Italian beefs and hot dogs are fantastic!Wow, I haven't given five stars out in a while, but this place totally deserves it, IMHO.  After popping up in the "New Businesses In Las Vegas" section and checking out the menu online and seeing they had acai bowls, I knew I had to check it out.  My first experience with these was at Swami's Cafe in San Diego and I've been hooked ever since.  Juice 'N' Go is located in the drive-thru hut at Rainbow and Oakey that used to be a Baskin-Robbins back in the day and then a hot dog place in its last incarnation.  I'm happy to report that the newest tenant is a welcome addition to this side of town. 
      I did a walk-up transaction, having left my car for an oil change down the street. I rung the doorbell and rather than help me through the customer window, Alex, the owner dressed like a chef, came out of the little hut and took my order.  Their standard acai bowl ingredients are organic acai puree, guarana, strawberries, non-fat frozen yogurt, coconut shavings, and granola.  In addition to that list of ingredients,  customers can then choose two more kinds of fruit; apple juice, coconut milk, or soy milk; and either agave nectar or honey.  My head was kind of spinning with the add-in choices so I just asked Alex what he suggested and he said to go with bananas, blueberries, coconut milk, and honey, so that's what I did.  I ordered the smaller 24 oz. size, paid my money, and Alex offered to deliver it to my car.  I told him I was on foot and he disappeared into the juice hut to make my bowl.  He reappeared to offer me the larger 32 oz. version for the 24 oz. price--who's gonna turn that down?  Not me.  Minutes later, he came out and presented me with today's breakfast and it was fabulous.  All of those fresh, organic ingredients blended together deliciously well.  
     There are lots of other things on the menu that I will definitely go back to try, especially with customizing orders.  Check out their menu ahead of time if you want to save time in the drive-thru and you can even call in your order.  This is a place that offers organic, healthy options (no HFCS) and is environmentally conscious, too--no paper menus available, they use earth-friendly cups, etc.  
     **Because I was taking pictures of my order, Alex told me that he gives deals if you check in on Facebook or use Instagram.  Since I was doing neither, I told him I was Yelping and he told me that he will upsize the same way for you if you tell him you heard about him from Terri the Yelper.  Give his place a try and see for yourself.  (I am not related to Alex, nor did I get anything but a great customer service experience and a fabulous acai bowl, or, cup, in this case.)I like this place. It's clean the staff is helpful and they have a lot of toppings to choose from.  This was my first Time here I have no complaints.Gonna keep it simple and tasty just like their menu. It's simple fresh and the place is clean and cute. Their street tacos are good but their hamburgers are best and tasty.  For what they offer and how it taste they deserve the 5 stars. Good job guys.The front yard of the home we rent was in MAJOR disrepair.  I tried 2 other landscapers who took my info but never bothered to call me back!  Jeremy came out same day, was super professional, gave me a great quote and was out a few days later to get the job done.  The few days were because it was new years day. :)

They did an AMAZING job and had some great recommendations for us.  I will not hesitate to refer them to anyone and will definitely be calling them again.I love this place! Professional and clean and their prices are competitive:) They always remember me by name when I walk in and always get me in fast. I definitely recommend them to everyone.5 guys was good as ever.  They gave us extra fries since the wait for the food was a little longer than normal - although, we weren't in a hurry so the wait wasn't bothering us.  Of course, they give you so many fries to start with that extra fries turned out to be way more than we could reasonably eat!  My husband, unable to let any fries go to waste - they are good, took one for the team and finished them up.

It seems they have also added to their menu since we were last there.  There is now a veggie sandwich and an option to order a small fries - which is good since a regular fry is too much for one person.

My kids still love the coke machine where you can select and mix your own flavors and the peanuts that you eat while you wait.  

Overall, we think 5 guys is a fun place and always enjoy a return trip.My bacon came from the pig in back, the rosemary in the breakfast potatoes came fresh from a garden in back right next to the chicken coop that layed the eggs that went into the waffle mix.....at least in my mind, because that's how fresh all of the ingredients tasted.We are breakfast at the airport location.  Great service and quality food.  We ordered The Five Spot and the Hog & Chick.  Bacon was excellent.  Just simple great quality food with a smile.My kids loved it! Do I have to say any more..  My wife went Singapore cashew and I went butter chicken. Food was quick. Staff were nice. Will be backRecently competed our 3rd or 4th (I've lost count) stereo and/or TV and/or lighting project with Vic & Mobile Masters, and we've been totallly satisfied every time.  Vic is versatile & creative, thorough & professional, and gives very fair & reasonable pricing.  We'll keep going back to him for future projects/upgrades, no doubt!I've taken my puppy to K9 Day Out for Daycare and for boarding and they've definately taken great care of him!  He's always thrilled to see Danielle when I drop him off and he comes home tuckered and in a great mood.  It's also great to see pictures of him having fun while I'm away.Awesome place! Spacious! Generally filled with people of the upper class (me excluded). If it's date night, get a table ...away from the bar. When the bar area gets full, there's standing room only. I cannot seem to understand the people who are complaining about the noise level when they are sitting in the BAR AREA! If you want peace and quiet, make a reservation and sit your arse in one of the dining rooms! 

This place goes the extra mile to make sure patrons are catered to properly. All staff that I encountered were friendly and adorned with smiles. Gabby and Daniel made a point to introduce themselves to me. The food that I've ordered have always been presented to my liken.  Nice, unusual bathroom setup.I have ZERO to complain about here. Although being located in not one of the more glamorous hotels in LV, JVAIS was a real gem! Our waiter set the tone for our fun filled evening, he was professional, polite, and excited about helpling us I got a gin drink from the house drink list, it was the first drink on the menu, WOW possibly the best gin based drink I have ever had!!! My date got the Cosmo which was also very good. I orderd the rack of lamb and she got the porterhouse, we split the sides of the mashed potatoes and the asparagus. Both the side were DELICIOUS!!! our Entrees were both cooked to perfection and both amazing. Our food was excellent, the service was excellent, the drinks were excellent! Dont let the surroundings fool you, this place is great!The best pediatrician EVER! Seriously. I love this practice. Everyone is so friendly, helpful and nice. Bailey at the front desk is so sweet and accommodating. Dr. Mousser is the best pediatrician you could ask for. He is very thorough and talks you through everything and makes sure you understand everything in great detail all while making you feel like a friend. You can tell he takes great pride in his job and in his practice. He makes sure every question is answered even the ones you dont think to ask. When my daughter was born I took her here after a friend recommendation and I'm so glad I did. He found a heart murmur that her other ped missed! I bring my other two kids here as well and I cannot say enough good things about this place! Make an appointment. You will love All-Star Pediatrics!Sooo loved!! From the ambiance to the food..def be back. It had a fun atmosphere/feel to it. Music vids playing while ESPN highlights (for the bf) played! And the food was amazing. Got the paradise meal and it came with everything..appetizers, soup, rice (bulgogie rice was super good), and meats & veggies! Can't wait to go back!!I can not wait to go back!! =D Absolutely LOVE this place from the ambiance to the food to the service!!!! Everything was AMAZING!!! Make sure to try the king crab in the ponzu sauce and for dessert get the shaved ice cream (kinda like the korean paht bing soo)!I like this location because their employees are always friendly and their service is top notch! The store is always clean, usually busy, and they also have so much to offer as far as food selections and good deals.

Also, they have free wi-fi and ethernet, so if you have your laptop or smartphone, you can use their service. They also have tv so you can tune into whatever channel they have it on. 

I recommend this location whenever you're in this part of town.The digital projectors they have in this place are crisp! Not to mention the great shopping and dining areas they have around it!  Wish they had a club card like regal does, but other than that I love these theatres! They're bathrooms are even cool!This is certainly my favorite theater in Las Vegas.  The seats are very comfortable and the movies are all digital projection.  Gotta love the clarity of the pictures.  The audio quality is great also.  It is a bit pricier than your typical movie complex, but for the space and the quality of the movies, I don't mind paying the premium.I like this movie theater!

It is always clean, and they always have all the new movies and even some random ones that the smaller places skip.

I don't bother with the candy/snacks here, but there is a candy shop right before you walk in LOL.  

Just another great reason to visit Town Square...great areas/activities for kids, shopping, decent restaurants, grocery store, and the movie theater of course!So happy this place is finally here. Me and my family have visited quite a few times and it has been wonderful each time. The wait can be a little long but it's not like there is employees sitting around playing on their phones, twiddling thumbs. I have seen them through the window-HUSTLING trying to be the quickest they can be and i appreciate you guys. EXCEPTIONAL customer service. I think it's silly how people are complaining about the sizes and prices. These are very generous sizes in my opinion. I usually can only eat half at a time and to say they are overpriced?? Did you know they use organic and local ingredients? I saw that is an AMAZING price for what you get. My favorite is the Greek salad super yummy. Me and my husband will continue to send people your way and congrats on doing so well!
#supportlocalbusinessesI loved my stay here at this boutique hotel.  My partner and I planned a stay in Vegas for Valentine's.  At the last minute he surprised me with a room at Nobu.  I really enjoyed everything about my stay. 

The hotel itself is inside the Caesars Casino which was a little confusing at first,  but once we realized it,  it was all smooth sailing from there.  

The staff were very attentive.  They made us feel special.  The hotel has a definite VIP feel to it.  The suite was your typical boutique suite with a Japanese flare in the design aspect.  Very chic and sexy.  I would definitely stay here again. 

One little tip... During our stay we ate both at Nobu Restaurant as well as room service. We noticed we ordered the same food from room service that we ordered in the restaurant  and it was cheaper. Go figure.  Next time we'll take all our meals in bed!  LolI've been to Sleepy Dogs a few times now and have not been disappointed yet! The service has been outstanding and my most recent visit proved that they really have some of the best wings that I've ever tasted. Another one of my all time favorites is the pretzels and beer cheese! I am a huge fan of beer and they have an excellent selection of Brews. I truly enjoyed the Red Rover Irish Ale and the Scootcher Scottish Amber Ale which I never would have tried had it not been for the manager Anthony. He was so patient and helpful in suggesting different beers and giving me samples to make sure I would be happy with my selection. I also had a really good experience recently when going there to watch football last Sunday night. Jake was our server and he had a great personality in addition to his distinct ability to find food choices that we thoroughly enjoyed. I love the vibe at this place...the live music is great and it's so cool that our dog can join us on the patio! I highly recommend Sleepy Dog Brewpub if your looking for a great atmosphere with excellent service and delicious food and beer!I have been getting lashes for over 4 year's am slightly addicted and I love them! Lily is amazing, professional,and a perfectionist. I would highly recommend her to EVERYONE. She is welcoming and makes you feel right at home. She is extremely clean and sanitary with the instruments she uses and it's so relaxing I sometimes fall asleep! :) I am constantly getting compliments! The best part is she is very flexible and gets you in as soon as she can. Call Lily!!!!!Just so you know...you will wait.  I waited 45 minutes for food for five people. Just so you REALLY UNDERSTAND.....IT IS WORTH IT.  I tasted the ginger, scallions, the garlic.  no excess oil in the noodles or fried rice.  The food is prepared FRESH, FRESH, FRESH! Everything is prepared so beautifully, so carefully....people, GO!!!!!!!  You will not be disappointed.  I live over fifty miles away and I will and I mean this, I WILL BE BACK!Amazing place to stay especially the newest edition to the hotel. Club was rad too. Cheapest drinks in all of Vegas and bottle service too. Lots of fun down here. No dramas, all good times. Highly recommend.I've had a couple of visits here, and while I'm usually not into big, swanky, franchised properties like this, I gotta give 'em a 5 for the players club alone.  They've always been good about comping 2-3 nights any day of the week with just a little bit of play, and there was one visit where they honored my accumulated comp dollars and points from a previous visit four whopping years beforehand.  I've never seen any casino anywhere honor points for that long of a duration.

I've stayed in a couple of the standard rooms, and they were nice, but it's always been a situation where I wouldn't ever pay money for them, as they're usually quite expensive if not comped.  I've never really checked out the bars, restaurants, pools and other amenities.

TIP:  Don't move, consume, eat, drink, or touch anything in the refrigerator, wet bar, or snack tray, because you'll be charged outta the yang.  Usually a good rule to follow at any casino hotel that has these things available.  There was one visit when I wasn't thinking and completely cleared out the refrigerator to make way for my personal beverages, and it took a good hour on the phone with the front desk to get the $275 charge reversed, plus about a good 2-3 weeks for the funds to return to my debit card.Once again, another stellar meal last night. Tried some new rolls this time and nothing disappointed. We were remembered even though we've come in once!  I had mentioned enjoying the fresh wasabi and we had some brought to our table without even asking. That's quality customer service. 

Amber jack was just brought in and we had it sashimi style. My husband DOES NOT eat sashimi or nigiri and decided to try it and loved it!! I was shocked. Since he enjoyed it he decided to try some of the "Screaming O" I ordered and ended up eating most of it himself. Sushi Catcher has officially made him a sashimi lover. 

The highlight hands down had to be the soft shell crab appetizer. It came served with two sauces -- a soy and a creamy sauce. The batter was so incredibly light and flaky, unlike anything we'd ever had before. My husband described it as powder in his mouth. Not an overly crunchy shell and just a succulent inside. Being from the mid-Atlantic, I'm fairly picky about my soft shell crab. Steamed blue crabs with Old Bay are typically my crab of choice, but this is now my number one. No joke. My rurally-raised husband even enjoyed it and doesn't care for crab. 

I can not emphasize enough how much I love this place. Although it takes a bit of a drive for us to get there, this is worth the trip every month. I hope the sushi chef sees this and knows how much we appreciate his quality and artistry as we have never had the chance to tell him since he's so busy!

A side note -- my OB told me she is okay with me eating sushi during pregnancy as long as I trust the source and limit the amount of fish I eat each week. We trust Sushi Catcher!!Yep, this is gonna be our new go-to place for sushi. It's small, the staff is very friendly, and it's a block away from our home.

I had the Philly, golden California, Dragon, and Volcano rolls. It was too much; I didn't expect the rolls to be so big. I schlopped off as much as I could to my boyfriend, but he could barely finish his salmon teriyaki Bento box. We left stuffed and with plenty of leftovers. Next time I will just stick to two rolls.Pretty damn good!  just moved from Cali like 2 months ago...decided to go check this place out with the boyfriend. We were skeptical at first but once our food arrived it had a nice presentation and the sushi looked pretty fresh. Food took a little while but I don't know if it was because we were starving lol. Overall it was a great experience, we ordered spicy tuna, 2 Philadelphia rolls, tuna roll and rainbow roll. Reasonable prices ended up paying around $30 drinks included. Must try! Happy hour all day... Oh P.S if you like chef specialty rolls, don't expect it here.. They stick to the basic stuff really.I must say great addition to the neighborhood! Great food and atmosphere. My wife and I have made this one of our regular food stops. We love the guacamole and the salsas! We have tried several of the items on the menu and have been very pleased with all ! Breakfast is also great!Otro cafe is easily the best Mexican restaurant I've EVER eaten at. The consistency from order to order, dish to dish, through the entire wait staff is effortlessly top notch!After passing by this almost every week we finally came in for breakfast. This is not the greasy diner I would have expected,the food is fresh and has lots of flavor. 

The menu has more options than most places and the food is mostly from local sources and taste very fresh.

We had a scramble and an omelet both were veggie and they were great. The vegetables in both tasted and looked very fresh. Both plates had a good portion of food and left us both full. 

The coffee was also good,it is a light roast and smooth.This is our favorite brunch spot! We eat here probably once a week. We stumbled on it while looking for a breakfast spot that came with high marks in the Acadia District. We never made it here, and have never seen the need to find it since discovering OBH.

The food is so delicious. It's made with care and the best of the best in terms of ingredients. You can taste the difference! I love breakfast food and whether I am ordering eggs, bacon and toast or going for pancakes, this is simply the best food I've found anywhere. The bread is sliced thick and from a bakery. The jam is like homemade. The bacon is thick cut and peppered. The pancakes are delicately flavored with lemon and ever so light and fluffy. The banana pecan pancakes are just delicious. I like to top my meal off with the fresh brewed iced tea.

It just doesn't get better than this and the prices are reasonable to boot! Once you're done here, you can head down the street to "A Second Look" for some fantastic consignment shopping.Great coffee. Locally roasted beans.  Sour dough French toast.  Great has browns. Five egg white scramble is delicious.After trying Juan's, it instantly became one of my favorite restaurants.
The chips, salsa and bean dip they bring before your meal are great. they never let our drinks go empty. the fajitas came out with rice, beans, guacamole, and sour cream with your choice of homemade flour or corn tortillas. i love fajitas and this place has got some of the best in town.

highly recommend this fine restaurant to anyone!LOVE this place, and here's why......
- GREAT, friendly and fast service. There are always 3-4 people coming by your table and refilling water/soda/beer/chips/salsa/bean dip! They are on top of it!
- Fresh tasting food. A lot of Mexican food around town (and elsewhere for that matter) taste like it's been sitting around for hours waiting to be served. This almost always seems fresh.
- Fair prices! The prices for items and combos are great! Great happy hour too.

I recommend the rancho style tacos and (of course) the fajitas!

I hope people support this place and keep it in town. This is a hard location for businesses to prosper it seems. SUPPORT GOOD BUSINESSES!This place could not be better. The food is so delicious I wake up wanting it and I'm not even vegan. The menu is so unique with really interesting parings it is hard to choose. The staff is amazing and completely engaged. It feels like a place you can sit and sip (super delicious) coffee without being rushed out. It is very low key, relaxed and comfortable. I've been there MANY times and plan to return MANY more!

highly recommend the goat cheese pancakes but seriously everything is to die for!I had a horrible dent in my 2010 MDX.  Dentpro fixed the dent and the door panel looks as good as new.  I recommend Dentpro to anyone who needs dent repair. The staff is very professional and helpful.  I will use Dentpro in the future.Breakfast is my favorite meal of the day, and I am in love with the Egg I Am! It is so cute and family friendly. I always love to have tea with my breakfast, and last time they brought out a whole tea platter!! Can't wait to go back!Great experience! It's open and inviting, and the staff was very friendly. The poutin was very good and way more food than one person can eat (in my opinion). The piece if cake was AMAZING! We also got to try the malt- again really, really good. Desserts are an afterthought at some restaurants, but not here. Beer was more of a 3.5 stars, but it was satisfying. I would say only downside is no full bar and no other beers besides theirs.If you're running between flights in Phoenix Sky Harbor's Terminal 4 please don't miss a visit to Tammie's. Wonder food and wonderful service. Yes that's right it's at an airport!!!Wow. Based on the first 30-ish reviews, haters really are gonna hate, aren't they?

Came on Saturday (4/27) of Hakkasan's opening weekend. This place is seriously amazing for so many reasons:

1. Girl/guy ratio was probably 10:1. Basically, it was a club full of girls, and then a small minority of guys who could afford to be there. Awesome.

2. Such a pro staff. Showed up with my wife at 10pm. No reservation. No ticket. Line at least 700 deep that I just wasn't going to deal with. Bless you, Drew, who referred me to Dave, who handled the situation like a vet. 2 line-jump passes later and we were in the door. 

3. The interior is awesome. Three different levels. A separate room for hip hop (Pharrell was celebrating his bday there). An incredible light show throughout.

4. The bottle service booths and couches were well monitored and looked super comfy and plush. 

Calvin Harris and Tiesto came on. J. Lo and her Kevin Federline dude were on stage. 

Overall, this was one of the best clubs I've ever been to. And I've been to many.

Regarding some of the other comments I've read:

1. Yes, there are alot of stairs. And I saw at least six girls go tumbling down them. Well, it is what it is. Don't wear the 5 inch heels if you can't walk in them.

2. Is it pricey? Yes. You know what? Deal with it. Or don't. But don't come expecting to get a Ferrari but only pay for a Ford. That's on you, not the club.

3. I agree that they let a few too many people in. The dance floor got suffocatingly packed and it was hard to actually dance.

But overall, a great vibe, a pro staff, and a really killer layout and design.

I will be back, Hakkasan. I will definitely be back!My name is Diana, and I am a nail biter. Pam is TRUELY an artist, therapist, and a great person. I have been looking for a dedicated, OCD, perfectionist and bad ass nail tech all my life! Pam schooled me on the wrongs and rights of nail health and I thank her for treating an ingrown no one had been able to remove. She even texted me the next morning to make sure my toe was doing well. How sweet is she?  Pam is great at what she does and made my day by listening to me vent. Pam's fruit infused water is refreshing and delicious. Her place is cozy and relaxing, the decor is too cute :) if you have been looking for a nail tech that pays attention to detail and doesn't let you leave unhappy, then this is the girl for you. Thanks Pam!!!!!Yes 5 Stars! It is as good as it gets and I am not just saying that to be bias because I love locally owned mom and pop type shops the most.  I do love the service a million times more than chained restaurant businesses. I especially love when the locally owned businesses are severely welcoming and happy to see customers coming through the doors.  

Lets get on with the review shall we:
Chicken pot pie- A-
Blueberry- A+ (esp when you go home to heat it up and put some ice cream over it!)

I cannot wait to try some of my boyfriends green hatch chili pork and his lemon cream hand pie.  When I was younger I was in love with the little hostess or safeway pies that are glazed with chocolate pudding or apple fillings so I cannot wait to try the rest of the hand pies from this establishment in a few days. So Good! 
It can be tricky to find if you aren't around the area but if you know where house of egg roll is, it is tucked away in the corner in the back. 

The service here obviously gets a A++++ :)
So go ahead run down there and grab a bite its totally worth your time and money!Working with Josefa was wonderful. I came to her with confidence issues and body insecurities, and she really helped me delve deep. I still now realizing how much it has benefited me! She is very down to earth and relatable, which only adds to her coaching style.Perfectly priced with a wondrously varied selection of wings. You don't get sides here just more wings. And then some more. I came here with a group of 14 for the quiz which was compiled by a funny, gruff and sarcastic scot. The atmosphere was fun and friendly, with the comic book decor adding a bit of geeky coolness. Great for groups, maybe not a first date place. The two varieties I had tonight were whiskey pepper and maple BBQ with bits of bacon. Oh and if you like to go for the ultimate challenge in spice then the suicide challenge is for you. 6 wings, a list of undisclosed ingredients and your face on the wall if you survive....I mean complete it. (My friend are two, he said he could have eaten three but his insides were melting)My best find since moving to Scottsdale!

Shaving Grace exceeded my expectations. Cool, old world shop. All of the previous reviews are spot on. Clientele during my visit ranged from early 20's to late 50's. 

I highly recommend Alex and look forward to my return visit in a few weeks!Dave design a prefect engagement ring for me and in a timely manner couldn't have ask for better service it was in price budget 


Thank youCustom made women's business suit

I now have 5 impeccably designed pieces of modern, yet classic and classy suiting: jacket, pencil skirt, dress in fabulous tropical weight wool with blouses that pull it all together.

Why custom made clothing?   I was tired of purchasing top end dept store suiting that was basically disposable after a couple years;  I still had to have it altered; I still had to shop for accessory pieces.  

Why Lana?   Creative, amazing details to each piece, fit to flatter my figure!   I asked Lana for a classic, yet modern look and Lana created my vision.  Lana is a lovely designer and total commitment to ensure you are thrilled with the outcome. 

I look forward to our next project!I have tried just about every fitness fad that has come to town.  At 20 I weighed 195 lbs, I lost 70 lbs  over 3 years backs in my twenties but never gained any muscle tone.  I am now 45 years old and have finally seen results worth talking about.  I try to go 5 times a week.  It's not easy setting aside other activities but it is SO WORTH IT!!!  

The instructors are amazing!!!  I love that they know your name and try to help you at least once in every class.  Veronica & Marirose are the owners and it is wonderful that they are sisters & best friends.  You can tell they truly care about each other and everyone that comes into their studio.  The studio just has great karma.  

You walk in for your workout but crawl out.  It is an amazing workout program that gets results.  As soon as you leave class, you can't wait to go back.  I recommend this studio to anyone who wants to get results sooner versus later.

#purebarrelife #lovepurebarreThis place is hidden in a plaza and it's literally 2 min away from my place. I looked up yelp for a restaurants around my house to go with my girlfriend and checked out barrelhouse. Once you walk in, it doesn't feel like your in chandler. Great ambiance, great service and food was spectacular. I had the steak for my entree and my girlfriend had the lobster roleno both were amazing . We also had the driving scallops for small plate .. All together I give 5 star for food and service.Sangria was great as well as the artichoke bruschettaGet a LVH players card and you might get free tickets!! This show was EVERYTHING!! I rocked out in the crowd with my husband and the rest of the crowd. It was definitely a great show!! I knew alot of the songs considering I'm actually an 80s baby, but that show confirmed my first soul was in the 60s or 70s for sure! lol...I really enjoyed the brief history lesson as well. I loved looking at the older crowds eyes as their favorite songs came on and how they lit up in joy!!! I have that same light when a song from TLC comes on!!
It is definitely a great show and alot of interaction so that makes it even better!!! And don't let those old fellas fool you on that stage they have more energy than me at 27 years old!! So standing ovation to them!!! I loved the guitar players the most though!! 
Please so see this show when you go to Vegas!! Anyone who has an ounce of appreciation for Rock Music will love it.Awesome.

Try the buddy system, one on one, or a class to start with. Chris will make sure that you are working at the level that you can finish with, which is more than you think it is. You will be exhausted.

Not only am I getting way more fit, I am also learning how to box and defend myself, which is great. I feel stronger and more confident. 

Everyone that I've met there has been really friendly. There are some kids training, women training, lots of men training. Pretty much all sorts of people. Don't be intimidated.I am so glad that there are healthy places like this near the strip.  The watermelon chiajuice was amazing!  My boyfriend & I both got different sandwiches so we could switch a half & share.  Yum!   My new favorite vegas spot!   Super friendly staff too!Absolutely amazing ramen! Kept a rowdy group of 14 guys silent for a whole meal. This is the real deal. Everything is prepared for hours and hours and you can practically taste the effort that goes into it. 

Not to mention the staff is incredibly friendly and knowledgable. This is my favorite place in Tempe and I can't wait to come back.I passed this place everyday while driving home and thought to myself that I should definitely try it. Try I did and was very pleasantly surprised. This is a wonderful place - excellent decor - simple, muted and not overtly loud - and great food ! They have some very different options to your regular sandwiches. We had the salami sandwich (forget the name) and the pig sandwich of the day ! totally mind blowing ! and their green tea is awesome. And don't forget the house chips ! Went there for lunch. Will try for dinner sometime.I have been eating at this place about 2-3 times per month for the last six months or so.  Their breakfast options are incredible and delicious with great portions.  Their breakfast sandwiches (and options) are well crafted and yummy.  I have had the breakfast special (2 eggs, 2 bacon or sausage, potatoes (O'brien), and toast- love the amount of potatoes.  I also had the Greek omelet - amazing!  

I look forward to catching dinner here again as well.LV nails and spa is under new management (Amy and mark from creative nails on fort apache) and is an amazing salon! I used to go to creative and followed Lynn to LV nails because she does an excellent gel mani. My manicures never chip and always last at least 3 weeks. The salon is very clean and relaxing. They also use very high end products and provide water and coffee for customers! Please check them out because you won't be disappointed :-)My wife and I ate at the SOLO trattoria on the six month anniversary of their opening. This little place was sparkling clean. The service was impeccable. The food was fresh tasting and delicious. I couldn't ask for more. This is a family owned place and it shows.My fiance and I went to this range today. He's shot all his life, I've never even held a gun. When we got there, Josh and Kim spent time explaining the different kinds of guns they had and what would be best for us. Josh was our instructor and couldn't of been more helpful. He was so patient with me, walking me thru each step over and over, allowing me to get comfortable with the gun and how it operates. He never got frustrated or made me feel like I was wasting his time. It was such an amazing experience and we had such a wonderful time. The staff and the facility is amazing. We will definitely be back.Love this place.  Friendly staff great food.  Jamies is a great guy, always trys to remember everyones names.Weeee! You have to love Broadway :) And this show is hands down amazing! These guys met at Phantom here in Vegas and after it closed started up their own group. Each guy has his own show that he performs songs from, and they all tell you about their background in music and their life.

If you like oldies, this is for you. If you like Broadway hits, this is for you. If you like live music period, so for you. These guys give it their all and you can feel it in their voices. Take the trip downtown to see them, you won't regret it!It's just a MUST for me to give this eccentric, cozy and nice coffee shop a FIVE- STAR rating!
I am not a morning person, but as soon as I'm in love with this coffee shop I challenged myself to wake up so early in the morning. Two days in a row, I woke up at 5 AM just to have my single or double espresso as soon as they open!
I just love the atmosphere, a number of seats available, the ambience. It's just perfect. 

Been reading some reviews about their internet connection, well, for me, this is like the best internet connection compared to other coffee shops in town! They don't limit only for two hours and youtube loads just fine here- so really, it's not as spotty as they said, especially when you work in the morning.

I have been quite productive, reading, writing and revising my proposal there! I'm so happy! The service is super good, they have the nicest barista and staff!

Tomorrow, the day after tomorrow, and days after that, if I am not at the library, or at home, or at SERF swimming pool, or zumba-ing or yoga-ing at SERF, I will be at Colectivo! :D 

If you happen to see a nice and smiley lady with some colorful scarf, just greet her! :) She's in love with Colectivo, so she's always in the good mood even with some books and a lengthy paper! Thanks to Colectivo!!!!!!!The North Bridge Brasserie is the restaurant within the Scotsman hotel, so if you are thinking of tea at the Scotsman, this is where you'll end up. It's a bit confusing, but none-the-less delicious, regardless of what you call it!

We had afternoon tea here, and it was all delicious and well-served. 

The sandwiches are what you would usually expect - egg salad, chives and sour cream and cucumber, ham with mustard, and something else that I can't remember but was definitely Scottish. 

The scones were delicious, and made even better so with jam and clotted cream. But honestly, what isn't better with jam and clotted cream? (I can hear my doctor wince as I write that sentence, but hey, it's a holiday, right?). 

We made a reservation in advance, but on the day we were there at 16:00 it wasn't particularly busy. 

The teas were excellent and the service was great. They indulged us with group photos, were accomodating to our particular requests, and overall made for a delightful afternoon tea experience.After a long day at work, (work week at that) I only ask for a few things:
Feed me
Pamper me
And the third I guess is inappropriate.
But lets be honest, what person doesn't enjoy that?

First of all, the place is really cute, I have to say the marble countertops (I think that's what they were) are really attractive, the music was relaxing and the staff! hands down the best nail shop experience I've had.

In a town where everyone is in a rush, especially in these salons, it's nice to be able to relax and wind down.

My nails are perfect, THE CORNERS are painted! -I don't know how many of you guys have experienced the missed corners because of rushing. Precision, precision, PRECISION!
Love it! Check out this spot!

Tech: Kevin
Toes: Kevin's "street bro" as he called him lolGreat place for sushi and drinks!

I went here for my birthday before the Daniel Tosh show. We had a big party of 10 people and they sat us at the coolest table. To start it was a circular table that had a huge rotating lazy susan in the middle, so we could share our food. That was such a genius idea!

That had a ton of cocktails for women and men. My favorite was the Tokoyo something, it was a perfect mix of citrus and sweet! The service and food were great and timely. 

I will definitely go back here for sushi next time I go down town.This review is LONG overdue. I LOVE Jill! So does my husband. We both want to keep her all to ourselves.  I've been in Vegas 9 years, been to multiple different places for massages, and Jill is by far the best!! She has ruined my experience forever with getting massages at the strip, because she is way better than any massage you would pay $200 plus for. There is NO comparison. 

Where do I start? She knows her stuff, she lives fitness and healthy eating and healthy habits and healthy mind. I am sure I would get great relaxation if I were to shut up, but I truly enjoy my time with Jill and trust her opinion in many ways in regards to exercise and overall health. She is knowledgable in all areas of health. She does what you ask for in the massage and has helped me through many back problems, neck, shoulders, knees, etc. I was injured from Crossfit for a few months and Jill helped me and now I can workout again. She even cares enough to tell me to do something better for my joints such as swimming instead of something hard on my joints. I find this very caring and I appreciate her advice. 

She works her magic hands like no other. I love her warm towels on your feet and face. I never found a massage therapist as good as her. 

My husband asks to go to her all the time and after he gets a massage, he is in heaven for the rest of the day. 

Her prices are reasonable and I hope they stay the same. I promise you, a massage with Jill is perfect! If I was able to, I would go to her weekly.Now that I write this, I miss her.  I think I need another massage ASAP.A massive storm went through on the day I was leaving and it canceled all the flights and push my departure 3 days after I was suppose to leave.  That put me in vegas for 1 day.  I called them up.  They spent hours on hold for me with the airline.  I didn't have to wait.  They called me back and told me the situation.  I was able to cancel and get a full refund.  I'm 100% satisfied with my service and will book all my vegas travel through them.  I recommend this service.  It saved me from a ton of headaches.Their pizza is really good -- my favorite in Las Vegas, actually. The crust is amazing and it always comes hot and fresh. Their subs are also good (the ones that I've had, at least). Best of all, the family that owns La Bocce is friendly and they make you feel like old friends when you're there. Oh yeah, and there are a lot of Buffalo-themed decorations that give the place the feel of that old pizzeria down the street back East.Looking to Vape for the first time and decided to give this place a try after reading some reviews on Yelp.

Staff is very friendly. I went in during Sat afternoon, not much people in there so lucky me! The first guy explained a lot to me between the different e-cigs. 

After selecting my e-cig, another guy, Aaron, was very helpful in letting me try out the different flavors they have, after going thru about 12+ flavors, I chose 2 of them, and Aaron was nice enough to help me assemble it together along with the flavor (juice/liquid). 
Showed me how to use my new e-cig, along with how to charge it and how to change out the filter piece when I need to.. etc.

Overall, very friendly and knowledgeable stuff... I highly recommend them.Best Philly in Las Vegas I've ever had! Sad that geris closed on trop but once I discovered this place it's no question and a lot better. They use fresh and expensive meat the rolls are a lot better than great buns and amorosos. You can tell easily. It makes Pops on Decatur and what you get at the San gennaro feast taste like garbage. This is the real deal the owners are very cool from Philly and taught me what a real Philly is.dont waste your money at the canival ever again go to Hanks!I was deprived of food, and thought I might try this place out after work. They ship their steak from Philly, and it's definitely quality over quantity. I ordered a Philly Cheese Steak with Kraft Cheese Whiz, and mhmmmmm, twas top notch. The bread had this crunch to it, and everything was well proportioned without anything being overpowering. I'd definitely recommend this place.

The owners of this place are also extremely friendly! I like happy people. c:I walked in as a reg customer not telling them I was back because the manager contacted me but I must say I was very impressed. My pedicure was great.  This time was way better than the first time. The first time I got a deluxe service and this time was the basic and it was on point. This may be my new nail spot. I can kill 2 birds with one stone. Get my car wash across the parking lot while I get my feet done.We've been to the Supercube quite a lot of times in the past 3years or so, and it simply turned into our favorite past-pub activity on weekends and even weekdays. Went back last Saturday on the occasion of a birthday with a large crowd, and even though we just walked in without prior reservation everything got set up quickly and we had a fantastic night - yet again. 
As for the price range for the rooms, I found that most if not all of the times we went there we were able to get a very fair and decent deal (we're almost always 8-12 people). Prices for drinks are appropriate I'd say.yes yes yes! came here last night for the Grand Opening and was so im pressed. The owners Pam & her sister Christina have done a fabulous job here. 12 craft beers on tap and an array of craft cocktails they know their stuff. My favorite drink is The Green Bitch, consisting of green charteuse, strega, lemon, celery, egg white, simple syrup, and curry bitters... amazing. after two of them i had a pretty strong buzz. the bar has almost a Victorian feel to it. i really like it. the only gripe I had with this bar is the location, its not really in walking distance to the other bars downtown that I frequent but totally worth the drive! i highly reccomend this place to check out :)This is the first time I've needed glasses and Brian & Angela were AMAZING!!! They were so patient, kind and all-around awesome--helped me find the perfect pair of cute glasses. Angela explained what I should expect with my astigmatism clearly. They're the owners too, bringing both expertise and superb customer service. Love these guys and recommend them highly!!!We decided to give Domestic Landscape a call to do an estimate on our landscaping project after reading all of the glowing reviews here.  We were not disappointed.  We hired their company to remove/replace old shrubs in the front and back of our house, along with replacing all of the decorative rock in the backyard.  They also replaced the weed barriers and drip lines, amended the soil and even hedged some bushes for us.  The work was TOP NOTCH!!!  I don't typically write reviews in yelp, as a matter of fact this is my first one, but I need to spread the word.  There is no reason to call any other landscape companies from now on, Domestic Landscape is the best.

It was very refreshing to have a landscape company return phone calls and emails promptly, show up early for appointments, and even call to confirm the appointments.  This has not not been something I've typically seen when working with other landscape companies.  Bill Miller and his father are very professional, courteous, honest, and are very fair on price.

Thank you Domestic Landscape for the great work you did!  I highly recommend Mr. Miller and his crew.Best pour over coffee in Arizona.  Cold brew coffee, whole bean sales and home brewing equipment.Outstanding show!!! One of the best shows in Vegas. It cost more than the other Vegas cirque shows but it was well worth it. Would love to watch it again. 

If you enjoyed the Beatles Love show, you'll love this show. 

The show was given a well deserved standing ovation at the end.I've seen quite a lot of cirque shows now and this one was just amazing. The music alone was incredible. Performers were very talented. This is a must do when in Vegas!!AMAZING, BEAUTIFUL performers, very very immersive experience, worth every pennies!!! Best seats sit and watch is about 8th from the stage, centered, so you can get in all the view from front, sides, and back because the performers will come from every corners of the theater to give you that immersive experience.Loved the food!  Fresh and flavorful.I don't usually write reviews but this place has won me over. Excellent quality food. Free range chicken. The salad that comes with the combo is delish! I love this place! The owner is very friendly.Great menu with a ton of both healthy and more savory options depending on your mood, great/friendly staff.I thought my food was delicious! It's a bonus that it was also healthy too. I had the seared ahi tuna in garlic butter with brown rice. The sauce, by the way, was super tasty! The Manhattan clam chowder was also good too. The staff was nice, but I really liked the atmosphere. It's very clean, relaxed, and comfortable. My friends and I had a great meal and are definitely going to return.My girlfriend and I stumbled upon this establishment while looking for a cure to our PHO desire. We recently moved to the opposite side of town so didn't have a particular place...until now. Friendly, laid back atmosphere, good food, fair prices has made this our new Viet place. The hot green tea I ordered was great and freshly made, as a vegetarian I recommend the vegetarian spring rolls (#3)I was lucky enough to attend a high school that valued the performing arts just as much if not more than athletics. Then I was able to attend a classical BFA program and earn a degree in Acting (what were my parents thinking) when all my friends were studying to become lawyers, teachers and doctors. I graduated college and was a professional aaaaauuuuuditioner (heh, heh), then switched roles, moved into arts administration, and became a Company Manager for two different regional theatres, one in Chicago then one in Arizona. 

Why am I telling you this? 

Because I have a deep appreciation for the arts. No. A hunger. I know first hand how important and influential theatre, music and dance can be and I wish more people felt the same. The arts enable us to tell stories, to feel, to understand something about our selves we may not have been aware of before the house lights went down. And while you might not love everything you see, one thing's for certain: Art brings people together. It fosters dialogue and debate in ways television doesn't. 

And I wish more people agreed. 

Warning: Sweeping generalization coming at ya:

I don't think Madisonians support the arts as much as they support Packer football and crazy consumption of cheese curds. I can't tell you the number of people I meet that have never heard of Forward Theater and don't understand that their work is rehearsed and produced right here in Madison, not trucked in from somewhere. On the few occasions that I've partnered with them and raffled off tickets to see a show, I'm amazed that people aren't fighting tooth and nail for a free seat! Perhaps people are afraid of what they don't know? Well let's get you familiar.

Forward Theater is celebrating five years of sharing professional and exceptional comedic and dramatic work with the citizens of central Wisconsin. They hire Wisconsin talent when they can and supplement with exceptional theatre artists from surrounding areas. Their season is as diverse as the beer line-up at Old Fashioned and plays aren't any longer than a feature film, so while you might not like everything, there's enough variety that you're certain to spot something that moves you. Tickets start at $10. TEN DOLLARS! Can you see a movie for $10? And last up, this is their job, a crazy career path they've chosen. Yes, they do it because they like it, but it's more than just fun for them. It's a profession. It's a way of life. 

So far I've seen Sons Of The Prophet and Red, and while I didn't enjoy the former as much as the latter (more an issue with the script than anything else), I still enjoyed being a part of the evening. Because what happens when you go see a show is you say to Forward Theater and Overture Center, "I support you." And it shouldn't matter if the arts were an integral part of your upbringing, you can support live theatre because producing organizations like Forward support you, and they've created something they want to share with you.

A Facebook friend and freelance Madison-based Stage Manager had this to say yesterday:

"GO SEE A PLAY. There are lots of shows happening here in Madison and I'm sure there are lots wherever you are too. Save up a few dollars and go see some live theater. Theaters rely on ticket sales. We can produce better work with more money, people can improve their craft if they can make a living doing it, and dammit, it's awesome! It's not enough to just say that you support the arts, you have to go out and actually do it."

I can't agree more.I'm so excited that there is finally a Cane's near my house. I went about a week after it opened around 11PM and there was nobody in line at the drive-thru. Service was outstanding. The kids that work here were enthused and made conversation with me. Probably their first jobs or something because they seemed excited lol. Everyone was cool though and the food was hot and fresh. Cane's overall has gotten stingy with their fries. I'm not too happy about that. Toast could've been crispier but that's okay. I'm happy there's finally one in my area. Welcome!Love love love femme art boudoir photography!!  I hired Pamela for my maternity boudoir photos and it was an amazing experience. She made me feel so comfortable and beautiful in my own skin.  The photos turned out gorgeous and I was sooo happy I did them.  Since she did such a fantastic job with my boudoir photos I hired her to do more maternity photos of my husband and I, newborn photos and 7 month mommy and me photos.  I have been very pleased with the results of all the photos and Pamela's professionalism and direction during the shooting.Heavenly. That single word sums up how I feel about Lush in general as well as this specific Lush location.

I feel like I should just dump the contents of my wallet out when I walk in. Lush has so many amazing products, trying to stay within my predetermined spending budget is a constant struggle. 

The fresh face masks are only available in stores because they are made fresh daily. I am always asking the Lush sales associates a million questions about which masks do what, they are always so gracious and helpful with their responded. 

And the bath bombs! I don't even take a bath anymore if I do not have a Lush bath bomb to use. They are THAT good. 

Another reason to adore Lush is they care about the planet. Ingredients for their products are responsibly sourced. They do not test on animals. They donate to charity. They have a recycling program: Bring in 5 empty fresh face mask containers, and they will give you one for free! 

Friendly and helpful service, amazing products sold by a company that isn't just about profits... What's not to love about Lush?!Great service! Even offered a sling for my baby's car seat which was awesome!

We ordered the corned beef hash! Which looked and tasted great!

Would recommend this place to everyone. Although don't come here on a Saturday for brunch it's very very busy!My roommate and I decided to try this place for a late brunch on a Saturday.  The wait was about 40-50 minutes but that was something we expected. Luckily they text you when your table is ready so we did a bit of shopping while we waited. Our waitress was really nice and attentive despite the morning rush. I ordered the Ham Benedict III which was absolutely delicious, and my roommate had the Sandwich I Am which was also very tasty. Both came with hash browns that were amazing! It was a tiny bit loud, but otherwise a very pleasant atmosphere!  Overall a great experience, I will definitely be back.I've just discovered my new favorite breakfast locale! 

I had the bangkok bloody mary and the snooze breakfast burrito.

The bloody mary: It was great! I love bloody mary's that are spiced with Siracha. They add crushed red pepper to the rim of the glass. That was a cool delicious add on. 

The breakfast burrito: Wow! So good. I will say, that I customized it. I had them do egg whites, avocado inside, no cheese and sauce on the side. Tons of moderations and they got everything correct! The black beans in the burrito are purred which is delicious. 

What a great little breakfast place. Good food, good drinks, good patio.....a win in my book.I am obsessed with this place.  I am so glad they are about 25 miles away from my home, otherwise I would be there every weekend.  The wait is a little long once you hit 8 am., however I am "lucky" the twins wake up at 5:30am everyday.  After getting ready and gathering everything we needed we headed out.  We made it just after 7:30 am.  The only sad thing I realized this time is that the balloon twister person does not arrive until 9:00am.  Oh, well.  I am here for the food really.  I almost had a repeat of the first visit, but I decided to try a different pancake this time.  You can make any kind of combos.  So I decided for the Chilaquiles benny and the sweet potato pancakes.  I am torn, I think I almost liked the sweet potato pancake better that the pineapple upside down cake one.  I guess I have to go again to make sure.  The chilaquiles benny were so perfect.  Instead of an english muffin is a tortilla base round, so yummy, with a layer of pulled beef barbacoa, topped with a perfectly poached egg then draped with this creamy spicy sauce.  Sooooo good.  The kids had pancakes and my hubby had a breakfast taco plus the chilaquiles benny.  This time I also enjoyed the blackberry mimosa and the hubby had the am margarita, which was so strong he couldn't finish it.Our evening was perfect. We loved the Calamari right from the start, our entrees were delicious and we finished with the fabulous dessert.  The restaurant is themed after Al Pacino, so look forward to going back in time with the appropriately outfitted staff to the music, the beautiful paintings and hospitality.  The hostess, the entertainment, waitstaff, appetizers, entrees, dessert, Frank & Alicia, we couldn't have asked for a nicer evening. Looking so forward to visiting again soon!I love this place. The frozen ice and yogurt mix is to die for.   So much better than FRO yo or shaved ice.  Best of both wordsI have never had anything bad here! Whether you're looking for baked goods, a meal or even just a cup of coffee this is where it's at! My favorite is the apple bread pudding! I can't get enough of it!This place is awesome! I knew nothing of this place before coming here besides that it was located somewhere downtown. I also believed they recently remodeled with the help of Zappos! Inside there is full bar with multiple tvs, a cute little snack shack and a huge lounge area with day beds, trendy bean bags, lounge sofas, the theme of it all is very nice. What blows this place over the top is all the games! Life size connect four, life size jenga, sack toss, pool and more! It was a bit chilly to be outside but they have a beautiful outside patio lounge as well. Open 24/7! I definitely will be coming back here with more friends!It was a Vegas Saturday afternoon like any other. My head was in a fog, my words slow, mouth dry and I was back on the prowl for a little hair of the dog, seeing as it was the only way to set things straight. As we stumbled into Gold Spike I was pleasantly surprised by the tranquility of the place. No ringing slots, no flashing lights and barely a soul in the room - a much needed escape from it all.

Drink in hand, we walked around the "playground" built for giants. Giant Jenga, giant beer pong, giant Connect Four and my favorite of the bunch, giant corn hole. Seriously, this was exactly what the doctor ordered! I wasted no time and grabbed some bean bags reminiscent of small bags of potatoes and proceeded to whip some ass while barely breaking a sweat. Actually, I didn't even break a sweat in the cool comforts of this air conditioned oasis... just drinks and bags, drinks and bags, drinks and bags. Not a bad Saturday and truly a great place to mix up the Vegas routine a bit.If you only eat one thing in your silly, stupid, little life, eat the bacon wrapped dates at this restaurant. Ridiculous.Everything we ordered was absolutely fabulous. Food was served very quickly, excellent service. Loved the atmosphere!Great food. We ordered a variety of selections and it was all good including the deserts.We love this place and Kelli is great. The Island Favorite is always fresh.  Portions are perfectI had the opportunity to try Pomo summer of '13.
I'm not from the area and wanted to try something local and authentic. Well BAM!! Pomo was it!!!
I've tried authentic pizza from Napoli and this was it!!!! I was very impressed with the fresh flavor and the awesome service. The cooks were great and the owner was a charm!
When I go visit family again I will definitely be stoping by to get my Pomo fix!!!
Yum!! Yum!!Tried tonight for the first time and I must say we are lucky, very good and very close to home :) Nice ambiance. Both Daniel the owner and Michel the Chef are really friendly and make you feel amazingly welcome. Everything we tried was good and I was particularly pleased with the duck confit with calvados ... interestingly a mix of ingredients from my mother's region (South West of France) and from my wife's parents region (Normandy). The menu is not extensive but everything had an appeal and I must say I was surprised by the "Roasted Airline Chicken Breast" explanation ... if you visit they will explain! A must try if you leave nearby.Amazing! Just like a lot of people I don't trust just anyone with cutting and styling my hair. I was referred to Steph by a friend and it was the best choice I made. She listened to exactly what I wanted and did just that! I love my hair and I can't wait to go back!John Showed up on time. They were friendly and efficient. I called the day before for a eviction lockout and they were able to accomdate me. Price was flat rate. They were great. Def would and will recommend. Thanks guys, 911 safe locksmith - I will call them again. =)I went in today for a pedicure and when I walked in, it was clean and not overwhelming with chemical smells. I liked that!!! I could breathe and relax. My experience was very pleasant :) Thanks LeeCame back for my bike and they customized it at no extra charge. Amazing little shop!Excellent Brazilian! I admit that I was a bit hesitant about seeing a male aesthetician, but Dale immediately put me at ease and treated me with as much, if not more, professionalism than some females that I have seen for the same service. The appointment was not rushed and the end result is fantastic. I look forward to going back next month.Seth is KING! 
Very professional & great hair stylist!
You come out the salon like a brand new person :)Delicious! I had the infamous "Ivan" for the first time tonight. This wondrous mound of meat along with a cold pilsner was the highlight of my day. 

The beef patty was thick and made exactly how I ordered it. I added a side of avocado because I like it on my burger. 

The Attic is small inside and parking is limited, but our party of 3 had no problem finding a table at 7pm on a Monday. 

If you're looking for a good burger, I recommend giving this place a try.My husband loves this place and I have to agree, their burgers are pretty damn good! 

I would appreciate a larger more diverse beer list, but for what it is, I will definitely go back!Very nice restaurant. Nice decor. Staff was wonderful and friendly.  I would be definitely come back a gain.A most welcome addition to the coffee scene in Edinburgh.  A weekend only pop up, Lock Up Coffee serves a new & exciting roast every week, so you are always going to taste something different from a variety of roasters. Owned & run by the crew from Freemans, they bring their expert knowledge to the Broughton area.

The blank space works well, helping to showcase the coffee and they are currently partnering with Pekoe Tea to offer some delicious blends to Edinburgh Tea lovers.

They have a fun & quirky reward system whereby you write your name on a board and get a free coffee after a certain amount of cups bought.

As with Freemans, the service is always super friendly.

A great place to go for a superb cup of joe while perusing the shops of Broughton street.Damn good pizza! We have it for our meetings, and it's faaaaaar superior to the Papa John's we used to get.I cannot say enough good things about this gym or the trainers there. They have a wide range of ability levels, from crossfit veterans to complete newbies, and nobody ever makes others feel like they don't belong, whether they can do the full workouts or not. Make no mistake, the workouts are grueling, but you scale them to your ability level and the trainers will help you focus on your form so that you can improve gradually without injuring yourself. The main emphasis here is on form, then consistency, and only after your form is consistently correct do you think about increasing weight. It's a very cautious, long-term goal-oriented approach to the sport that I think is the perfect way to go about it. 

Anyway, the trainers are fantastic and the other members are super supportive of each other and of new people as well. I'm so glad I tried it out.So happy to find our favorite New York eatery closer to California. Fantastic service, I saw examples of team service over and over again, large portions and the food was absolutely delicious.A Madison summer classic.

Grab a picnic blanket, some snacks (I recommend cheese, sausage, & crackers), and a bottle of wine and enjoy an evening outside listening to music!

It doesn't get much better than that.Have been there several times for breakfast and lunch and it has always been very good. The BBQ ribs are outstanding and most recently had the build your own egg skillet and it was excellent. I added Bacon, Jalapenos and Feta and it was just right. The bacon was crispy and the fresh Jalapenos add just the right amount of spice.My dad and I were looking for a new spot to go to dinner, and this place was phenomenal! It was pretty quiet on a Thursday night, but it was clean and personal and the food was to DIE for. Family recipes with an incredible amount of flavor and variety. 
I've always wanted a thriving downtown CG, and restaurants like this are the way to make that happen! 
Make sure to support this local delight -- start with the Tostones and take your pick of the entrees! The congri is delicious as well.Food was fantastic! Always love when you can go to a sports bar and get quality food. Service was great too.That was the greatest find ever!! We went for valentines dessert and split a "trio" which is $24. An hour of desserts, entertainment (watching them bake) and cookies to bring home was very worth the money. I left thinking I should tip more, that was delicious, entertaining, and the workers are super sweet. I will definitely be going back!Another great addition to downtown. Sorry to all the other pizza joints but this place is Legit!! After reading the new opening section I wanted to Pizza Rock that happens to serve my favorite food(Pizza ; ) 

We started out with a Caesars Salad. It was a decent size that three of us shared as an app. Nice crunchy croutons and shave fresh Parmigiano Reggiano on top. The server offered fresh pepper as he delivered the food.
 
The Margherita- this was brought out first. The San Marzanos tomatoes make this pizza so tasty. The dough is soft and and cooked in perfectly. Defiantly reminds me of Italy!

Classic Italian style- decided on the Prosciutto and Pomodorini. This was my favorite of the two. The fresh arugula and the cherry tomatoes adding some acidity. Also this dough had more of a crisp to it. amazing! 

Service was excellent. We had plenty of questions and our serve helped along the way. Some many more different styles of pizza to try and the other items on the menu as well. I will be back this weekGreat atmosphere. Excellent service from Ty. Pizza was awesome.   The Ramana 2 is the best.A very welcome addition to downtown Las Vegas!

The menu was a little intimidating at first, since they have such a wide variety of pizza types, and each type shows what type of oven it is baked in and at what temperature. 

I selected the New York style pizza, and it was five star.....very fresh sauce seasoned to near perfection, superb crust, quality cheese. 

It's hip, in one sense, but more hip in a 1998 kind of way, but that's fine because this place is about the pizza and service.  I enjoyed the mostly 1990's soft alternative rock playing while I was there.

The service I had was also five star, and I got a 15% locals discount.

I'd be proud to take out of town visitors here.Awesome happy hour!  Unfortunately, I was too....tired...to remember what exactly the deals were or what the times were.  Oops.

I know they have a happy hour that starts late night (10? maybe?), and the sign out front says happy hour is only during the week, but the menus say happy hour is every day, and they let us order happy hour stuff no problem.  I think a quart sized can of PBR was $3 or something ridiculous.

The pizza was good, but nothing special.  Probably better than a lot of what you could get in the area though.

Great service.  Several craft beers on tap.  Bloody Mary looked legit.Wow!  Loved the happy hour menu!  We had a few drinks at a great price (not watered down at all like on the strip), meatballs for an appetizer, and two individual pizzas.  All were fantastic!  I had the Cal italia and thought it might be a bit "foo foo" for me...but noooo, I have been craving it ever since we left.  Can't wait for a return visit to what will become one of our favorite regular stops in Vegas.Recently moved to scottsdale and was looking for new tailor. This place was recommended by dry cleaners I use. Irena knows her stuff. Everything comes out perfect. Not only tailored to perfection but always ironed/ steamed. Also pretty fast. I highly recommend this place.Hands down, the best place to shop for your pet anywhere in the country...believe me, I have looked in pet stores everywhere my travels take me to!  

The owners, Tony & Vince, make the experience so enjoyable.  They truly get to know you and your pet and make recommendations that are always spot on.

They have the most unique items from clothing, jewelry, toys, beds etc.  Everything we buy for our dog, Lily, comes from Mackie's Parlour.  I love that they gave her a VIP card too...guess that means we buy a lot there!

Trust me, you must check this place out if you are a pet owner...totally worth your time and money!Our new Favorite Yogurt shop!!

Great selection with great prices and in good location.

Good selection of toppings to go along with itIn the quaint little plaza I call Gold's plaza(because of the gym), lies this "new", "woodsy"-smelling with minimal decorations place of thirst-quenching delicious-ness!

The owner is super nice and allowed us to take our time while he checked to make sure his planks were straight and in line. I was drawn to the larger cups but realized they're just shaped differently. 

I ordered the Black-Tea Sesame milk tea with boba and my BF ordered Almond milk tea with pudding and honey boba. 

If you have ever had the black sesame pudding that's found in Asian markets in the Red Box (fond memories of my childhood), then order the black sesame milk tea. 

The almond milk tea was also good and not so sweet as most other places, I never tried pudding in my drinks previously but it was a nice change. 

They offer a stamp card! Will definitely be filling it upThe drinks here are delicious! As with most here who agree that although the boba at Chinatown are delicious as well, it's VERY convienient to have a shop such as this located in the Henderson area. Although I am a regular at buying milk tea drinks, I decided to switch gears and order one of their "Ice Milk" drinks. More specifically, I ordered the Ice milk with caramel, pudding, and honey boba.

One thing I can definitely say was that this was the most refreshing boba drink I've ever had. It was the perfect amount of sweetness for me, as well as the smoothness (for slush). The ice blend/slush made the milk so refreshingly sweet and cold to the point where I couldn't put this drink down. The caramel added more flavor (almost resembling that of toffee).

I also had pudding for the first time in my boba and it was yummy as well. Not that much flavor in the pudding except for a slight vanilla or custard taste but, hey it works and definitely makes boba more enjoyable to drink.  I'm not too picky on boba texture, but it was chewy and soft and the syrup blended well into the drink.

Overall, this drink resembled a light crème brulee. I would absolutely order this drink again.

On to service. I was happily greeted and as I was ordering, he (I forgot to catch his name) had informed me of the various sizes of the shakes, why they are so big, and also provide me with a stamp card. As I received my order, he informed me of how to mix their drinks since all of the goods are at the bottom (the best part). The shop is very spacious and has minimal seating area. Can't wait to stop by here again!I really enjoyed my experience at this place and it was mostly the service that made it a fun time. We had bought a living social deal to try the food and the two guys who waited on us, I believe their names were Dave and AJ, were so friendly. We've never done crab maryland style so they both took the time to show us how to do it and made it a really lighthearted and silly experience. The food is a bit pricey for the quantity, especially the appetizers, but everything was tasty the crab was really yummy! We also had beer and watched football, they even put the game we wanted on, which added to the charm of this place. It is the type of place with awesome food and a chill atmosphere, we will definitely return to mallot some crabs!Best crab i've had in a while!!! thanks for the great times too!!This place is awesome!!  Brian and staffs was so helpful!!!OK.. I finally saw this show completely and left mesmerized!!! He is an amazing Illusionist, magician etc. Some of the things he did left us all in AWE. My husband was picked several times for things and it was so spot on and I can tell we do not know this person. If you can go see PARANORMAL!!!!
p.s the air conditioning is working and it was so nice!!I have lived here since the end of march and love everything so far... Grounds are kept beautifully .. Everyone that works here is super nice tooExceptionally good Hawaiian fusion food. The sauces are amazing and the coconut bark desert is addicting. I hope the expansion plans go well and would recommend this restaurant to anyone.Best workouts I have ever had!! The results are amazing and I couldn't feel better!!!Choose your crust ( white, wheat or Gluten Free), sauce, cheese (dairy or dairy-free) and as many fresh toppings as you like and for $8.95. Yes please! I like this concept you cannot phone in your order but you can order to go. These are thin crust pizzas but they are tasty! Thank you My Pie for opening up near my home.Came in from San Diego for SEMA and was hoping that I'd get a chance to see what VAPE was all about too. (CALI is a tough state and there have been cities in SD County who have banned vape) However, I drove around LV most of the day to see the city and check out other the VAPE shops. I found myself on Flamingo and walked into this store and immediately noticed and felt a really good vibe.The owner Taga was friendly, knowledgeable and helpful to educate someone like me (who no longer smokes) what the hooplah of VAPE is all about. I notice he does builds for customized vapes and has a menu of flavors that can be tested if the customer requests. I learned that there are levels of nicotine in the juices that range from super low to high amounts. Its WILD that there are tons of people, especially in Las Vegas, who are dependent on smoking for sport who need serious doses of nicotine in their vape juice to equate to their 3 pack a day habit. I was in the shop when a few customers came in and was happy to see how well Taga spoke to each of them, treating them with Pacific Islander kindness (business with a true smile). This store has a good owner, a friendly appeal to it and a variety of product. I hope the very best for this business and will be sure to pass along the good word when friends and family ask for a spot to pay visit to next time their in Sin City!Normally I would avoid a mom & pop used appliance business but on Feb 3 I drove down to Phoenix from Flagstaff to see a stove here because they got such a great review from Krista. I was not disappointed. This business is run by two sons and their mom. The sons are quietly competent while the mom is friendly, talks to you like she's known you for years, like a neighbor would. She recommends appliances as your mom would, i.e. "it has this cool feature or has a good reputation for that." The vibe she puts out is that her sons have found good used appliances and they will take care of any problems so you just have to decide what features you want.  And I've found that they will actually stand behind their stuff. For 30 days they will come fix anything that goes wrong (if you're in Phoenix). I am up in Flagstaff so I had concerns about that. When I installed the stove I purchased, everything worked but the baking. It won't keep the temperature. I troubleshooted for 2 days so I could tell them exactly what was wrong, then called to see what they would do long distance. They listened, discussed offline, called me back promptly and will send me the part they think is the problem. I am pretty good with a screwdriver so I look forward to receiving the part in 2 to 14 days.  They said if this part doesn't work, they will send the next possibility and so on till the oven works.  Now that's support! I will edit my review to 5 stars if this works out. If it goes sour, I will edit correspondingly. So far, this company is a shining example of good business. BTW, the receipts and credit cards are accepted and delivered via cell phone, like your hairdresser, which I'm cool with. march 22nd I returned the stove. everything worked on the stove except the oven would not reach or stay on the set temperature. Apex sent me a new sensor then a new igniter (which they would have brought and replaced for free if I lived in Phoenix) but to no avail :0(  When I was sure the oven just wouldn't work my father-in-law died and I had to fly to east coast for 3 weeks, yet they honored their return policy and they even offered to meet me half way between Flagstaff and Phoenix to return it but I had to come down to Phoenix anyway. So, I hold no ill will towards Apex. Just didn't work out. If I lived in Phoenix, I would have tried a different stove and bought a refrigerator. Oh well :0)This place is not too far from the McCarron Airport. They have a pretty good menu with some of the items having a fusion flair. The first visit, I ordered the Salmon with a soy sauce dipping sauce. The rice was good which contained edamame and corn. The second visit, I ordered the tonkatsu which was also good. By the way, they have home made soy sauce which is good too. But the thing you must try is the crepe cake with thai ice tea sauce.....WOW!! The owner of the place, Crystal, is very nice too. Can't wait to go back  :)I went here when I found a Groupon, coincidentally 2 days after returning from a trip where my iPad screen had shattered.

Despite being overwhelmed with calls due to the Groupon, Sara was able to get my iPad in the next day and would have been able to fix it within several hours had I needed it.  I opted to let her keep it overnight and picked it up the following morning.  The screen had been replaced and the bent/dented corners of the aluminum case had been bent back, making the iPad look as close to new as a 2 year old iPad that is used daily can.  Should something happen to any of my other devices in the future I will be going to see Sara, even without a Groupon.Food was delicious. Our party had a great time and the hibachi chef was the most entertaining, especially with children. The location is right near a movie theatre and parking was available. We were seated right away and the decor was beautiful!Stopped in for a burger. It was tasty, fast, and juicy, just like I like it! Fresh cut fries and a soda, around $7 and worth that. Staff extremely nice and encouraged feedback. Working nearby,  I will def be back for lunch another time! Also in the same strip mall as SubFactory which is my all time favorite lunch spot so this makes it perfect for me and my coworkers. Also, check in on yelp and get a discount!Wow, I stumbled across this place here on Yelp with its 85 out 105 Reviews at 5 Stars!?  How can you skip trying a place like THAT??  So I whipped over here today, joined by Jackie C. & Mike C. & went with a Detroit Coney Combo, which is a Detroit Coney chili dog plus ground beef added to the chili, and a regular order of fries.  The hot dog and especially the fries were great!  Like In-N-Out, they don't blanch the potatoes but rather cook them all the way through at once, and in this case with the skins on and crispy without having to ask for "well done."  YUM!  Add in the very friendly service from the Detroit counter guy (Owner?) & you've got your 5 Stars, for sure!     :-))

Detroit Coney Combo $4.95, Fries $1.95.Went for lunch and was so happy we stopped by. Great prices and delicious!!! Spicy That Rice, amazing. Pad Thai also delicious. So glad they're around the corner from my house. I will be going back!!Was first introduced at the farmers market. These guys rock!! Such great flavor and no sugar!! Makes me wanna lift something heavy! The sales people are really knowledgable, I think his name was Seth, Nice guy. I will be back ! Ohh and now they make nut butters , damn ... Good on you guysGreat store with an excellent selection of furniture. We went twice to looks at couches. We decided on one we fell in love with, and had amazing service. We never once felt pressured by sales staff and prices are reasonable. On our second visit, Vicktpria helped us and was phenomenal. She helped us get exactly what we needed. The delivery was amazing. They carried our heavy couch and love seat up three flights of stairs and unwrapped all the furniture. This is a team that works hard!OMG! Best day ever!!!!! Quick tip: when paying for a photo with a celebrity keep in mind, you can have 2 people per ticket, so you can do halfsies with a friend!Don't go anywhere else! Their prices can not be beat. Even more awesome now since they have expanded, and location and extended hours are great too!Wow! Best restaurant food we had all year!
Got myself Carne Asada Tacos - $8.95, wife had Fried steak burrito - $8.95. Both loved it. If you are on low calorie, I suggest Carne Asada Tacos. Otherwise Burrito. Burrito is huge ! Got dessert, Churro with Icecream, which was delicious. Margarita, spicy and hot- $7.95. I'm coming back!!I'm a very picky person and hard to please.  I checked out other OBGYN offices and I wasn't satisfied with any of them until I stumbled upon Brenda Martin and her office.  When I first called to make an appointment, unlike other offices that asked if I was sure I was even pregnant, Dr Martin's office gave me a great big congratulations on the phone.  They sounded interested in me and everything I had to say, they scheduled my appointment quickly and sent me all the information I would possibly need to help navigate the overwhelming times.

When I got into their office, it was clean, the staff was prompt, friendly, and they had all my insurance information worked out. Don't get me started on the number of places I was told I was contracted with and ended up receiving huge out of network bills being told it was my fault.  Not with Shea Women's care, they are amazing.

I was terrified my first visit, but this office made it smooth sailing and turned it into a great experience.  Most of my questions were answered before I even asked them, I loved the convenience of the ultrasound tech being in office, and it was just an amazing experience all around.

All I can say is I hope Dr Martin stays with Shea Women's Care for a long time to come.  It's hard to find a great and caring doctor plus a friendly and knowledgeable staff all rolled in one.  She, and her office, have got me for life.A long time ago, (actually, only a few months) in a galaxy (called Hendertucky )far, far away... (AAAALLLLL the way up on Boulder Highway)

                                         Episode 1

                              A New Glimmer of Hope


It is a period of the Snow Ice wars. A bear named KUMA, a Taiwanese kitchen, and a couple of boba spots called Icy Juicy and Easy Life emerge from hidden spots in Chinatown and battle it out, claiming they're the best in the Snow Ice empire. Las Vegas Yelper Mike K. makes the LOOOOONG trek to Hendertucky
after being disappointed by one of the imposters and lets all the fellow Jedi Yelpers know that a diamond in the rough exists with some totally legit snow ice.

During the battle, spies(?) managed to steal a tent and a generator belonging to Frost Bites Shavery's ultimate weapon, The Seal Trailer, an armored snow Ice station with enough power to blow away the snow ice competition in the 702.

Also pursued by Frost Bite Shaved Ice, Mike and Will remain optimistic and get through their growing pains, race to change their name to Snow Flake Shavery and search for a more centralized location so they can save the people from snow ice withdrawals and serve up the best snow ice in  town at their new galaxy, Chinatown.....


(C)hoose from their seven cool combos or customize your own
(O)verkill on the drizzle and toppings is a no-no....the snow is the star here

(I)'ve tried all the snow ice flavors offered, even the Yuzu "prototype"
(L)ocated in the Seoul Plaza next door to ZEN Curry in Chinatown
(L)as Vegas Yelpers have supported Snow Flakes Shavery since day one...

(A)rtificial flavors and nasty powders are not used in any of their snow flavors
(N)ot going anywhere but here is what'll happen after your first taste of SFS...
(D)o yourself a favor and GETCHOA$$OVAHEA!!!!!

(E)gg custard and mochi is a must with your "liquid cotton candy"...

(!)!!!ALOHA!!!


********************MAY THE SNOW BE WITH YOU******************************I had been waiting for this place to open and today I was the first customer.  First off the place is clean and staff very friendly and helpful.  They have a variety of fresh toppings and the fresh doh is great and soft.  This is truly Italy pizza.  They also have other food which I'm sure is great! Gelato too!  I was even quite impressed that the red pepper shakers have the flakes finally chopped up so they actually go through the shaker which shows that they pay attention to everything and the qualty was excellent.  I will be a regular here for sure and I grew up on New York and NJ pizza.Found this hidden gem. Usually we never know what to expect in the richmar complex. It seems like businesses fail here. We were pleasantly surprised to find this amazing build your own napolitana style pizzerias. Family run. Super fast. Affordable. Delicious. We will definitely be back!!! Amazing !Been here for few times since they open, and love the food and people! Recommend for everybody. They are doing delivery now, which is a plus for students in ASU.  Love their sticky rice roll, pork steak with rice, kong pao chk and much more~~Since it is so close to my work and home, I'm eating there almost everyday now, and haven't get tired of it yet. You can also request dishes that's not on the menu! Love it!I have been a member for a year and a half and have loved it. I got to experience a lot of plays and shows that I never would have even known about. I actually added it all up the other days and I have used 52 tickets at a face value of over 1000.00 since I signed up. I give it two thumbs up. You just have to make sure that you check it every day so you do not miss out. They do go quick!Great location and ambiance.  Loved the skewer app and my ribeye was super tender and flavorful. Also, we got the onion rings to share and OMG! Best onion rings ever! Super light and flaky and served with a yummy white BBQ sauce. Our server was very helpful. In fact, we were going to order a side of mashed potatoes, but instead of racking up our bill unnecessarily, she warned us that both of our steaks came with potatoes already.  Will definitely go back for a special occasion!If yelp had 10 stars I'd give this place 10 stars...
1. AWESOME customer service from the minute you walk in til you leave. The staff is very friendly n helpful. Just plain AWESOME.
2. The owner builds GREAT. He'll help you build your mod like he builds his own. 
3. Yummy juice flaves... I've tried several n I think 75 % of that I  absolutely LOVE.... like the ROCKET POPS, WTF, SOFA KING UNREAL, KUUIPOI, UBE .. Oh man the list goes on. ..ALL I CAN SAY IS GO CHECK THEM OUT... I've been to TONS of vape shops n this one IS NOW MY ULTIMATE FAVEREVIV is really amazing! Vegas can certainly take a toll on the body, but one visit to REVIV and will be ready to go. Don't waste your time or money on those oxygen booths that are all over, just go to REVIV and you will feel amazing!I have had three appointments so far and have been very pleased with the manner in which Dr Le Provost handles himself, his business, and his employees. Before I begin I must say this is a CASH BUSINESS. Your insurance will get you nowhere. And buying more or less cosmetic medical supplements is not going to be cheap so don't be like Doug H. and think you will walk out with any sort of quality treatment for a $100; especially not an initial visit which is VERY thorough. Initial visits cover, your lifestyle, health, health history, diet, supplements, family medical history, etc. He then covers the basics of what he does and how things work and explains your options. He also covers the cost of said options. You both decide on a plan and move forward. His assistant is a great kid with lots of enthusiasm and a great asset. The young man covering the front counter is also very pleasant and helpful. I am a current patient and will continue to be for the foreseeable future.I am so GLAD to have gone to Gladly, having gone from other positive Yelper reviews.  The place had an open contemporary open feel.  Staying at the bar for Happy Hour was a nice way to enjoy all the goodies during Happy Hour.  The Happy Hour fare were well portioned and not skimpy plates.  The hibiscus drink was so good- not too sweet, just enough vodka and good for a second round.  We had a pretty good mix of different variety of foods, all of which were impeccably prepared, even down to the last green olive in the roasted vegetable platter.  I never eat pate, but decided to give the chicken spread a try which was a smooth combo with the homemade mustard, capers and bits of procuitto.  Who thought brussell sprouts on top of grits could taste that good?  They paid attention to how it the food was cooked, grilled or roasted, and the cooks brought out the natural flavor of each dish with minimal sauces and complimentary oil and spices to the highest level of attention.  This is on our list of places to return too.Awesome interior design.    What a great location with spectacular views.  The menu had lots of great items.  The chopped salad is a MUST have!

Went for breakfast also and it was fantastic.  Super waiting staff that were very attentive and personable.Food was soooo delicious.  Chilaqulies tastes so authentic. You really can't go wrong no matter what you chose. It will be DELICIOUS !!!!!!!!Loved this place!  The beers were excellent, the burgers were delicious, the atmosphere was perfect.  The duck fat fries were amazing.   It seems like the beers on tap are constantly changing, which is great.  We came on a Tuesday night and the place was mostly packed, so they must be doing something right.  We will definitely be back!Lori and Molly took such great care of us! I called on a Tuesday night and desperately needed condo cleaning on a Wednesday. Lori rearranged their whole schedule so that Molly could come help us out! They did an amazing job. Molly had cleaned the shower 3 times by the time I spoke with her!!! Lori kept me posted throughout the day (condo needed a lot of help and they wanted to make sure I was ok with charges). Very friendly, very accommodating -- they will be my GO TO company. Thanks ladies!!!!My wife and I were at the butcher shop a couple of days ago and the meats looked amazing.  But even more amazing was the butcher, Tori, who served us.  She knew everything about the different cuts of meat and how the meat was specially sourced.  She couldn't have been friendlier or more polite.  And, by the way, the best looking butcher I've ever encountered.

Have since had a chance to eat some of the steaks we bought.  Outstanding!Amazing customer service with Tony and Travis will definitely purchase all my vapes here.  Will also tell all friends about thus place ...Great greeting followed by great service. Had 2 sandwiches, both tasted good. The place was clean, including the restrooms!Had a dirty chai latte with almond milk that was quite tasty. The cranberry scone was excellent as well. But even better was the smile we were greeted with and the amazing service. will definitely come back.This team remembers the basics--good food and good service. The mahi tacos were great! The sliders were tasty! As for service, ask for Thomas, a top-notch server. GSWFriendly and casual. Nice outdoor patio. Great homemade food at a good price. Will definitely return when we're back in town!Cozy cafe atmosphere.  Food top notch from scratch.  Pancakes REALLY tasty.  Huevos Madrid with smoked salmon and shrimp outstanding.  Cartel coffee was perfect and owners are so friendly!I usually wouldn't write a review for a Starbucks, but this one is special. 

Located in the Old School plaza on the corner of 7th Street and Osborn, this is one of the most well designed Stabucks I have seen. There is a nice shaded outdoor space with a giant couch and several tables. Inside, there are several 2-4 person tables with one large family style table in the center.

As for the service and coffee...its what you would expect from Starbucks.I hit the deli and am so glad I did. The man working the counter was very friendly.
All the regular deli meats are Boar's Head and reasonably priced. All the meats and cheeses were good and sliced super thin. For me through the real treasure is the baked goods. A large Cheery Apple Strudel for $1.75. A Euro desert sampler for $2.49. A chocolate on chocolate brownie that was amazing for $2.49. My Aunt got Tiramisu that she said was fantastic for $2.99.
They had lots of other imported grocery item, but I had to get out of there before I spent anymore money. I'll be back for sure.
Oh and try the Hot Cappy.........Amazing falafel! I was greeted by a kind and helpful man. The ingredients were all really fresh and you could customize to your liking. Super happy I found this place so close to home. They will know my name soon.Amazing! I Purple rice makes me healthier.
I had Las Vegas roll, Crunch California, Oh My God, and Crazy roll. Foods are soooo good! I will revisit there again!China One is awesome! I remember I had a bad experience with them a few years ago, but I ordered delivery a few nights ago, and I must say, they've definitely redeemed themselves!

I was sitting at home hungry, while my boyfriend was out with his dad, so I decided to go out on a limb and finally make a decision on my own :P I just so happened to get a flyer from China One with some coupons on it, and I can't resist a good coupon, so I made my decision!

I got the honey walnut shrimp and a large order of Thai tea, the total was a little more than I'd anticipated (delivery charge?) so I used the coupon for free crab rangoon. The food came in a timely manner, and the lady who took my order over the phone was really nice, which definitely added to my experience! 

As far as the honey walnut shrimp goes--OMG! Hands down the best honey walnut shrimp I've tasted! They don't skimp on the shrimp either!! This could definitely feed 2 or 3 people! So flavorful and it surprisingly felt healthy! I knew I made a good decision that day! The Thai tea wasn't too flavorful, but it complimented the meal perfectly anyway. 

Will definitely go back for seconds in the future!I'm surprised that I can still check-in after I came home.  I love the power of Yelp!   It felt just not the same tonight since my phone was out battery.  No check in, FB, Tweet, and no photos.  Where was my spare battery when I needed it?

We all got two tokens to use for drinks.  I started out with the rum punch.  
That was one of favorite drinks.  The coconut shrimp, onion bloom petals and mushrooms were fantastic.  A great selections on the happy hour menu. 

The waitstaff were so attentive and on the ball with the drinks and food.  The bar area was spacious and with private booths.  I guess you can bring the kids.  

No phone was the downside of evening, but everything changed when I won the loverly gift basket.  I love Yelp BINGO!  

Another great yelp event organized by our favorite CM, Lindsey.  Thanks to Kevin and everyone at Outback for making my Tuesday evening a lot better!My wife and I have been going to Dr Sue for more than a year for weight loss and to get healthy. We have both had excellent results working with her. Dr Sue's weight loss programs are tailored to the individual person and she leaves you with the tools to maintain your health and well being. She is very caring,  compassionate and is a great accountability partner. We recommend her to anyone looking to get and stay healthy.DIANNE did an AMAZING job..the staff there was EXTREMELY friendly and helpful :) I showed Dianne a picture of what I wanted my nails to look like and she did an even better job!!! Would definitely recommend DT NAILS to everyone I know!!After years of taking both of my dogs to a previous vet I was recommended to Dr Roach for some help with the breeding process. Dr Roach and the staff are very kind they are not pushy with trying to sell you everything under the sun! The office is brand new and very clean. We have now switched vets and will continue to take our pups here for all there needs from now on!Thank You Thank You!  Finally good food and it's Gluten Free!  My first pizza in a year! Fresh salad AND Carrot cupcakes are to die for!Not enough good things to say about this place. So happy to know that downtown Vegas has places like this to just come and enjoy a nice Sunday brunch, casual breakfast or a weekday lunch.
Food. Well. AMAZING. I felt like the "needy" client because I ordered several things from the menu and they graciously helped me with my order. 
The server, her name is ERIN by the way. Not only a beautiful girl but so pleasant and sweet. It made the experience even more incredible. 
Perhaps one of my favorite places in town. It is definitely A MUST CHECK OUT!. 
One extra pointer. Please try the hang over burger. Out of this world!came in  for  breakfast  with my family  of  four  on  Sunday the 17th  not  only  were  we  seated  promptly  but my  kids  loved  the etch- a- scetch  that  they got  to play  with while waiting  on food,  so much so  that they now  have that on  there xmas  lists.  food  was melt in your  mouth  good, I  got  the  chicken in  waffle  and a  side  of  sausage, my son  got  the  crustless pb&j,  my daughter  got Mickey mouse  pancakes,  and my boyfriend  got a  skillet!  our  table  was so quite after the food  showed  up  cause we were  too busy eating,  which  can be a  challenged  with kids sometimes  as all  parents  know  to well  :)service  was attentive  without  being  too  attentive, and super  friendly.  you  can tell  the staff  really  are  as happy to be there as  the customers.  this  quickly  has become  our  new found  Sunday spot!Amazing!! My gals and I came here twice in 48 hours. Great, fresh food. Huge cups of coffee, attentive cheerful service and we voted- cutest chef and owner in Vegas!

Highly recommend. We will be back.As an expert in good fried chicken, I was compelled to try the Kentucky Fried Chicken. On top of a mash brown and topped with an over easy egg, the chicken was the tastiest that I have had in a long time. This restaurant is the place to be. Wonderful food!I absolutely love this place and cannot wait to go back! The atmosphere is so laid back and the style is so rustic chic without being forced. The service is wonderful, everyone is so friendly, cool and helpful! Absolutely loved it!I'm so happy that there is a thai place close to my house. I went in and tried the pad see ew and it was delicious. Good amount of flavor with lots of chicken. I will definitely be back.Collette is amazing. She's such a great person and does a great job on lashes. I constantly get compliments on my lashes. I've never been so happy waking up in the morning and looking in the mirror. I'm a busy mom with two little ones and this service has saved me so much time getting ready for work. Thank you Collette I'm so happy.Came here with my friend and absolutely loved the place. The Pistachio latte was EXTREMELY delicious. They brought our drinks and dessert out to us and it was all very nice. We also tried their waffle and their honey toast. The waffle was just crunchy enough on the outside and soft and fluffy inside. The honey toast was pretty amazing as well.  The cafe was pretty cozy and intimate and the baristas seemed very knowledgeable and made some great suggestions. I will DEFINITELY be back here!This place is great.  I only wish they opened earlier so i could grab my morning coffee from here.

Had the honey bread and split it with my wife, it is awesome so long as you like honey.  Like nothing i have ever had before.  Cappuccino  was also solid, made by a person and not by pressing a button on a machine.  I will be back.  Great decor as well!I've had a lot of good pizza in my life, but this by far as to be the best I've had.

The folks at Buddyz are very nice and treat you like family when you come in.  Will definitely be returning!!!  Can't beat true Chicago style deep dish!!I have been in Arizona 5 yrs and by far my favorite pizza place. My wife is from Chicago and loves the deep dish. I am from NW Indiana and I have to say the thin crust tastes just like home. The crust is perfect with the outside being a little crispy.   This place is worth the drive :)Kailyn's has become my "second kitchen" as I go there at LEAST once a week. They've recently undergone a renovation with new furnishings, new paint, and a new look. They've found a good balance with the new menu, and if you are a burger lover this is the place to go.  For something a little lighter try to Chipotle Chicken Club sandwich.  They are now open for dinner and I've not been disappointed with ANY of the entree's.  If you like meatloaf, this will be your new favorite place.  Give them a try soon, and be sure to try the deep fried cookie dough!There is a lot to insurance.  Between work and family I can't find the time to figure out the insurance choices that are out there and what would best fit mine and my family's needs.  I'm very glad that I met Jason.  He helped me to quickly understand my insurance options and gave me great advice on what plans would be best for me and my situation.  He is a friendly and easy to talk to guy.  It is easy to tell that he really cares about you as an individual and as a long term client.I had never heard of them but the kids thought that the name was funny/inviting. We are greeted promptly and asked if it was our first time. They explained the ordering system quickly. Our 'wiches were made to order promptly and they were delicious. Later I googled them and found that they are a new chain and are opening stores all over. They are worth a try!!From start to finish there's nothing that should be changed about Jimmy's barbershop. Every time I walk into Jimmy's I feel welcome. Jimmy and his family are just some of the warmest people you'll find. The fact that he's consistently given me the best haircuts I've received EVERY SINGLE time I've gone in makes me refuse to go anywhere else. You can really tell when someone loves what they do. At Jimmy's the passion is shown in the enthusiasm, the quality, and the shop itself. Give it a shot.Wow! This was our first time eating here & we loved it! Everything was great, the service but even better was the food. A must have is the Bacon Wrapped Dates & for sure the Paella Valenciana. The shrimp in the paella was perfectly cooked. Chef Oscar Sanchez even came around to greet the patrons. A job well done :-)Love this place! The chef comes out to greet you! He remembered that I was a gestational diabetic and made sure he made the food for my needs! Also, you can get a gambling card and they give you a free $25 when you hit a 100 credits... I hit that in 20 minutes!Nom nom!!  Oh how I love Cornfusion, let me count the ways!!  This place has everything ~ Popcorn, tons of flavors (I chose a mixture of cheddar, caramel, and garlic parmesan), gift containers, specialty sodas, shaved ice, fudge, caramel apples, cake pops, charming staff members, and comfortable seating for my friends and family members.  

As soon as we walked in, we were hit by the delicious smell of fresh, sweet popcorn and the colorful decor of the shop.  Then, the customer service = awesome.  Then, the popcorn and fudge = delish!  After I "accidentally" ate my entire bag, I ordered extras to share.  SUCH a treat after a long day of running errands with the kids :)This is the spot to go ryte here... iv been to many barbers and asked for a stright razor cut on the bottom part of my head and no one would do it. Well I found my new place they took care of me with hot towels and all...I will deff be back there every two weeks...gud looking out!All I have to say is I went there 3 times in 1 week.  The chicken tikka masala was exceptional.  The service isn't always the greatest but the food makes up for it.  Go here and thank me later.Calling all hipsters: your home has been found!

I have enjoyed the Cornish Pasty Co.'s in Tempe and Mesa; Scottsdale's locale does not disappoint. Yes, the crowd is different. Rather than college kids looking for good food or the older crowd looking for their silverware in the darkness of Mesa, you get more of a hipster/Old Town vibe. The ambiance isn't as unique as other locations. From lighting and use of space, it doesn't compare to other locations.

But the food is better. The portions are bigger. The pasties are tastier. If you are looking for outstanding food just off the Old Town strip, you are home. I'll be back.I am self employed and the health insurance market has always confused me.  I never felt like I knew what I was doing when trying to figure it out in my own.  I met with Rob to talk about what health insurance options are out there and what would best fit my needs.  He was very informative and answered every question thoroughly.Absolutely delicious!  Big portions, nice staff & they deliver!  The Buffalo Soldier is to die for!We had a fantastic meal here tonight! It is a great, quiet restaurant with quality food and service.We tried the tacos (Bulgogi, Pork Belly, and Calamari), KoMex Nachos w/KimChi, and Wonton soup. Everything was delicious and the meat was really cooked perfectly! There wasn't a bunch of fat on it and it wasn't rubbery or chewy. Their slaw they put on the tacos is kind of sweet and if you want hot sauce they bring you 4 types (2 Mexican and 2 Korean), though none of it is really that spicy. Food portions were decent and my wife and I ended up with take out after ordering only a half size nacho and soup to split with the tacos. Service was friendly and the price was reasonable. We will definitely be back.This little hole in the wall is a gem! The pizza is some of the best in town. The lasagna and pesto pasta is wonderful! The garlic knots are super addicting. The staff is very nice. (Not a big fan of their spaghetti and meat sauce but everything else rocks!!)Loved the set up, loved the cashier, loved the whole experience and especially the FROYO! I like the interesting flavors and the variety of toppings. Only wish they had peanut butter cup topping... Then I might just die! Will be a frequent customer for sure!!!Coolest eats in Arcadia.. Excellent and brief menu.. Fantastic Ahi, Dee-Lish burgers.. of note Ingo burger topped with Kool kraut.. Umm, Yum! And the chips kick Ass! U slide nicely onto the groovy orange bar stool, to the best service. Very chic and urban.. Great concept with taste, service and palate. Beers and wine fit perfectly with menu.. Can't wait to show up in the warm months on the cruiser! Viva Ingo!Ok, I'm a lover of Le Grande Orange and this concept restaurant for LGO meets, no exceeds, the exceptional food quality I've come to expect from LGO. INGO may be small on size but don't let that fool you. Their food has BIG flavors! So I started with the shattered potato chips. Crispy, crunchy, and served with a lemony tazaki like dip (whatever it was- it's super tasty!) no need for ketchup for these chips! Then to the grassfed beef burgers. When they say cooked and served with pink - that isn't a lie. BUT they are so juicy and delicious. I has the Paris TX burger- a delicious blend of BBQ sauce, pancetta, aged cheddar, and pickles. Ok, so I am usually not a fan of pickles on my burger... But these aren't your usual salty, vinegary, overly dill pickles. They make them fresh and they are the perfect blend of dill and sweetness with the crunch of a fresh cucumber and they compliment the burger amazingly. Overall 5 star food for a 3 star price! 
Now I put the food first because let's be honest - that's why you review a restaurant!  But the atmosphere is worth mentioning. Indoor and outdoor seating with an open kitchen and bistro lights. Driven by on a Saturday and it seems like a great hangout. If you arent in the mood for an amazing LGO pizza but rather a juicy burger - cross the street and enjoy INGO!!!!Found lots of items for my home at great prices. We were able to check and test everything before purchase and most of the things we bought were 50% off retail prices . A++++Omg my friend bought me chocolate sweet potato pumpkin muffins. They are awesome. The nutrition facts are amazing my next thing I want to try is the cinnamon apple cheesecake... 

I love the muffins thank youSaw a Groupon for Tiabis, decided to try it. It was very good. Using Waffles for the sandwich bread is great idea. Tried the wafflezilla and now the vegan burger. Tremendous! They're homemade are pretty amazing as well. Will be hurting this place up when I'm in the area.What a great find! We visited this restaurant after seeing a gift certificate for it on Restaurant.com. We were warmly greeted when we walked in and told to make ourselves comfortable at any table. There were two other parties finishing up their meals when we got there about an hour before closing time on a weekday. I ordered the three-item appetizer plate with fried pickles, green tomatoes and green beans. It was absolutely delicious and well-seasoned, a perfect portion! It also came with a healthy side of ranch. My boyfriend ordered the BBQ entree platter with brisket, mac and cheese, mashed potatoes and fries. We certainly got our money's worth and had tons of leftovers! 

We were extremely happy with our dinner choice and will be telling our friends about this wonderful, unique eatery. I just became more of a fan of soul food than ever before!This place is wonderful! The decorations are authentic and neat and the food is delicious. They have a HUGE selection of salsas, I enjoyed their guacamole and peanut salsa. My boyfriend and I ordered yummy Mexican Coke in the bottle, our favorite. I ordered two of their carne asada tacos with pickled onions and chimichurri sauce which came with rice and beans with fresh cheese on top, it was fantastic. My boyfriend got the bullet burro which he absolutely loved. We'll definitely be coming back to try more of their salsas!This place is pure perfection! 
Unbelievable boba smoothies.
The coconut and strawberry smoothies with boba are the best I've ever had.

This place is the new standard for boba spots!!!!!!Love this dog park. There's two separate parks - one for big dogs and one for small dogs. Both have benches and picnic tables for sitting, and the small dog park has a nice little ledge along the grassy area for additional seating.

There's a few different trash cans, a community pooper scooper, and lots of free bags available if you forgot to bring something to clean up after your pet. There's also a doggie water fountain and a second for humans if they get thirsty.

Lots of parking, and it has some good lighting. I think this is my new favorite dog park in the Central Phoenix area.When I moved back to Arizona after living in Texas for a few years, I was ecstatic, overjoyed, couldn't contain my happiness! That is until I had to go grocery shopping, then I missed Texas just a bit. You see in Texas I lived less than a mile away from a beauty of a store called Aldi. I had the grocery shopping down, most staples at Aldi, a monthly Costco visit and then a Kroger and Tom Thumb every 2 weeks. Coming back to AZ I had to start all over, with the  visits to Walmart, Fry's and Safeway but not really happy with the prices or quality of their store brands. I still missed Aldi's bargain prices, the amazing quality of their store brand products and how super fast their cashiers were. 

Where was I? WinCo. Yes, this review is for WInCo. 

I drove by WinCo on a trip to Chuck e Cheese, so I made a mental note to visit. The first time I was there I was extremely happy! Now I have become a "regular" and since they have two stores close to me I try to alternate between the Mesa and the Gilbert store. 

The Gilbert store is much bigger, but they are both equally clean.
They have some weeks were prices are not as discounted on my favorite items, but they are still low enough that they beat competitors prices. 
They will not bag your groceries, they will not help you take them to your car, but they compensate in their prices. I can bag my own groceries.One of my favorite shows I've seen in vegas yet.
Small Venue, a REAL band with a terrific performance.
 A little crowd participation too. Lots of fun, will go back for the Evil Dead show!If you are looking for something different, this is the place to go!
It will be the best flavored fries you will every try! It's awesome too that you can watch them prepare you food through the window!I can't take credit for this awesome find, I owe this one to Ms. Shelly who introduced Theresa into our lives more than a year ago and I have been a loyal follower ever since. 

In a word .. Theresa is absolutely AMAZING with color, styling and cuts. And she uber talented and is the epitome of the Aloha Spirit. The Hawaiian Islands' loss is most definitely Las Vegas' gain! 

Theresa is THE hair stylist I've always wanted. Not only does she somehow end up doing EXACTLY what I want with my hair, she's so personable and laid back that my haircuts always feel like visits with a dear lifelong friend. She has done color for me many times and I am always so happy with the finished product! Highlights in all the right places!   She knows what I like, she knows what my hair needs, and she sends me away feeling awesome. 

This woman is really great at what she does and is passionate about it. So go make an appointment with Theresa! You won't be disappointed! She's simply the BEST!This salon is amazing!!! Super modern, very clean, and everyone here is incredibly professional. They know hair and my blonde is not orange or strange yellow. It's pretty a blonde and the lady next to me just left with beautiful chocolate brown hair !!! If you want pretty hair this is the only place to go!! Trust me, I have been to all the other typical salons in the area and they can't compare to The Waverly!!!! Try it once and you will be back every time!!!!!I've been going to Patty for years and cannot say enough good things about her!  From cut and color to extensions the girl knows it all!  If I'm being indecisive, but want something knew she always has a great idea and it turns out better than I could have hoped for.  I'm always getting compliments on my color and have referred multiple people to her.  It also doesn't hurt that the salon is beyond gorgeous!  It's so fresh and inviting that it makes the whole haircut an experience.  LOVE HER!Expect greatness when you walk through the door.  They go out of their way to distinguish themselves as something extraordinary, and they succeed.  From the servers' elegant outfits to the carefully selected decor to the classic chairs and benches, 2nd Story LB is out of the movies we watch and wish we were in.  

I took my mom and brother here for a special occasion and that it was.  The food was memorable, succulent, and served in perfect unison with the menu description.  The drink menu was typical for a place aiming at mixology drinks but nonetheless excelled in taste.  I ordered a Diablo something and beyond the taste even the glass was classy.  

Our server Brittany was unstoppably attentive, humorous, and A+ all around.  

They need to work on dimming the lighting a bit but otherwise the mood is perfect for a date spot.

Last thing I'll say is it twas a shame that some putzes showed up wearing shorts and t-shirts looking like casual tourists. Though they were perfectly accepted by the staff, this place is a classy joint...so if you go then at least have fun and dress up a bit more than being in your family room on Sunday watching the football game and enjoy the cool elegance of something wonderful.

Looking forward to seeing this place thrive.Short and sweet is always neat....

Banger? Who?

It's just this little amazing local brewery located in the Fabulous Downtown Las Vegas.

The men behind this brewery had a dream and more importantly worked to make that dream a reality. Banger went from a small home brewing operation to winning awards at local Las Vegas beer festivals to finally founding their own brewery.

This is a must stop spot if you go to Downtown LV. Support the local scene!

I highly recommend Banger Brewing downtown. These guys are friendly and will talk beer with you! The beers are local favorites and these guys are just now getting serious. Las Vegas is a growing beer culture and Banger is definitely adding to the scene.

Head on down and try the Perfect 10 Pale!I had a salon appointment near by and I was searching for a quick bite and found Binks. I asked for a Menu and Nick the server, gave me the happy hour and dinner options as well as their brunch and lunch. I wasn't sure about the food on the menu at first, so I decided to walk to the restaurant next door and then I found myself back right back at Binks.

Nick ended up serving me and I'm glad I came back because everything was fantastic. I ordered the octopus app- delicious complicated flavors working well together. I ordered a glass of gruner vetliner, which he described very well, and I thoroughly enjoyed- they really do have a great wine list..,and then I had chocolate pudding cake for dessert.

I'm a sucker for great service and great food. I will be back. The patio is charming,I've been here twice - once for dinner and once for happy hour - both times my experience was fantastic. Service has been very attentive and food is great. 

When I was here for dinner, I ordered the trout as a main course - cooked and prepared perfectly. They have a great selection of sides featuring local, seasonal produce - we tried the asparagus and beats, both were excellent. 

Their happy hour is hard to beat - a good selection of small menu items and drink/wine specials.  I wish it went later than 6:00!My office is nearby so I come here way too much. The staff knows me which is awesome but also a sign I might need to branch out....maybe ;)

I love the cheese plate. Chef Ryan mixes it up so there are always new cheeses to try. The staff can recommend a good drink or you can peruse the menu for something. I usually have wine but the lavender lemonade is great too - not too sweet & very refreshing.

The lobster roll is great if you want something more than a cheese plate. I've also had the kale & avocado salads. Both are good. 

The plates & utensils are eco-friendly recyclable stuff so don't get bent out of shape when they give you a plastic fork...it's saving the planet!Had Dana as our waitress outstanding service had fajitas shrimp and chicken incredible ask for extra tortillas. Tortillas soup very good and burrito is enormous bring an appetite.  One of the best Mexican restaurants in Vegas. Make a reservation this place is crazy busy and you can make reservation on yelp. Great job by entire staff.Dear Lord, this woman can work some magic with some thread. And she was funny. ("Oh, why are you tearing up? Don't worry, you won't miss that hair.")

Online appointment scheduling, clean studio and work area, and reasonable prices are also big pluses.Best gyros in the world customer service is great I would really recommend ALS Chicago Finest Gyros!!!!! Good food service and yummyPo' Boys Galore!!!

Short Review:
Not just hype, Streetcar Po' Boys is pretty close to what you expect to get in NOLA.  My opinion...I've had some better Po' Boys here than I did in NOLA.  Give them a shot. The service is excellent and the food is as good as what you expect to find in NOLA itself.

Long Review:
Every restaurant visit starts off with service.  The service starts the tone and I have to say, Streetcar started off with great hospitality.  At least 8 employees personally greeted me and once we were all seated, the 5 star service didn't stop.  Great job so far, great job.  

But it's all about the food, right?  So here we go...

1)  Fried Mac N Cheese, Hush Puppies, and Corn Fritters:  The hush puppies were good, the corn fritters were great, and the fried mac was awesome.  My only complaint...other Yelpers on our table loved the fried mac too, which meant less for me. 

2)  Fried Pickles & Okras:  This was actually Victoria Q's dish and she was willing to share.  Not a huge fan of pickles, but became one after trying their fried version.  As for the okras, sorry but just okay. 

3)  Pirogue (Crawfish & Sausage):  This was our first Po'Boy to try.  I admit that this was my first crawfish and sausage Po'Boy.  So, I didn't expect this one to be a mushy one.  Considering that I'm not the biggest fan of crawfish and sausage, I still thought it was pretty good.  

4)  The Streetcar (Shrimp, Oysters, and Catfish):  This was my favorite out of all the Po'Boys that I tried during my visit.  Crunchy catfish mixed with shrimp & oyster.  You would think that your taste buds would get confused, but they don't.  I loved how this Po'Boy was seasoned/spiced. 

5)  Crescent City (Muffuletta):  5 different meats all inside a great tasting, fresh muffuletta.  This one was a beast to eat and perfect for all you meat-lovers out there. 

6)  Marie Laveau (Boudin Sausage):  If you like spiced, pulverized, and mushy sausage, then you'll love this.  

7)  Bourbon Street (Roast Beef):  I only got a small taste of this one since I was already stuffed from the other Po' Boys.  This was a little messy and flavorful.  This Po' Boy reminds me of Mother's infamous Debris Po' Boy. 

8)  Desserts:  I tried the bread pudding, beignets, and praline King Cake.  I thought that both the King Cake and the bread pudding were phenomenal.  As for their beignets, they look good, but I thought it was too airy and bland. 

All Po'Boys have two sizes, a regular and a large.  Like what you'll find in New Orleans, there's a big difference in size, but not in price (about a $2 difference between a regular and a large).  The Streetcar was my favorite, followed by the Crescent City.  However, depending on your taste or mood at the time, you can't go wrong any any of their Po'Boy's.  All were packed with flavor, huge servings, and really inexpensive.  But the highlight in all these Po'Boys had to be the bread itself.  The breads are so fresh, which only made each Po'Boy that much more tastier.  

Trust me...Streetcar has to be on your list if you're craving authentic Po'Boys.


PS:  Norm K, I accept your offer for a free meal.



YELP PERSONAL CHALLENGE - (051/366)Bartender was so cute and nice and the beer is really good- Paul's pale and pb porter!We dined here while visiting friends who live at Encanterra. I'm told the restaurant is open to the public. It is outstanding. Excellent menu (Salmon is quite tasty), wine list and deserts. And superb and friendly service. It is a very well managed establishment.  You can eat inside or outside. The bar is also a great place to enjoy a drink and the outdoor patio sitting offers a fabulous view of the golf course and distant San Tan mountains. I will return.Great tacos, great atmosphere.  Looking forward to returning to try more dishes.  My friend had the enchiladas and they looked fantastic.  Good appetizers too.  So much better tasting than Taco Guild!Delicious! Loved the option of ordering a Thai Tea with my donut. Friendly staff too. I will definitely be returning.WOW!  We had dinner here last night and the service was spectacular.  Maybe the best service we've ever had...from the valet, to the hostess, to our server, to the manager.  Our server was Cristian L. and he did a wonderful job.  I couldn't have asked for a better meal or a better experience.  I am so impressed by this Fleming's location.  Incidentally, we were at the Mandarin Oriental the day before and the service at Fleming's was so much better!  We had such a great time and I've already made reservations for Valentine's Day.There are only 2 other places in town that I've enjoyed sandwiches from, but this place tops them all!!  

There is just something about someone else making you a sandwich that makes it taste better! Goodwich however, makes you want to make everyday a sandwich day!  

On this trip, the husband and I shared the Fluff and Nut which consisted of crunchy Nutella, and Marshmallow and we had it Monte Cristo style on wheat, which tasted almost like a smores sandwich.  We also tried the egg, cheddar, and bacon sandwich on white which was perfectly cooked.  Last we tried their famous Foie, which had crispy chicken skin, cabbage, almonds, onion jam, Foie Gras Mousse.   All were delicious but the winner so far is the Foie!!!! Lucky to have had the last one of the day!! 

From what the owners shared, they have plans of opening up a shop and though I can't wait for them to expand I hope they keep this cute and convenient stand too! Now back to daydreaming about their sandwiches!!!I love this place. Now that they are under new management and have a new menu,  I'm excited.  I tried the Yoshi roll, which is my ultimate favorite, and I tried the Burn Your A$$ roll and that was also very good. I wish the rolls came out a little quicker but all in all I love the rolls here and the staff. Highly recommend to anyone who wants to try something delicious n different.A nice quiet hangout for getting work done, with good coffee.  Area was clean, and staff was very friendly.  I also loved the fresh flowers on each of the tables!We had the climber smoothie and it was awesome! Great tasting and very healthy. The service was very prompt and courteous.  I have been here before and always enjoyed the drinks and service. Prices are not bad and really with it being so healthy why not go for it??The pizza was sooo delicious!! $3 pepperoni pizza slices and two cannoli for $4. Looking for a good eat while in Vegas found this gem. Service was fast we ordered slices of pizza and were pleasantly surprised that they were about the size of a personal pizza. I would recommend anyone to stop by. I will definitely be back. Try this place you won't regret it.I have the biggest food baby right now thanks to TNB. Second time to eat here. First visit I had the panini with bacon jam and today the TNB signature burger with mac n cheese on top. Both times I stumbled out of there like a full term pregnant woman. This place is a must try, but I would suggest not eating anything beforehand.On my last visit to Vegas I stopped in for a drink and then came back again for the food and again with a co-worker. This place is great! The ambiance is modern and relaxed, the staff is great, the drinks are amazing, and the food is delicious. Coming from the strip, the value for the price is excellent. I mean, if you want ridiculous value then go to Taco y Taco, but if you want value for high quality food then this place has that. My favorite dish is the shrimp and lobster mac 'n cheese, which is a full meal. On my third visit I had the pizza with the sausage, pepperoni, onions, and mushrooms (I don't recall the name) and it was very good. I see other reviews about the margarita pizza and I've heard the same, so I'm sure they'll fix it. They are new, so when you stop in ask, since they're in improvement mode. I don't even think they've had their grand opening yet. The mixed drinks are high quality and the bottled beer selection is a great mix of craft and specialty beers along with a few go-to beers if you're not a beer person. My advice, go there now; it's only a matter of time before you'll need to make a reservation or wait in line. I'll definitely go back on my next visit.What else do they have to do to accommodate their customers? Nothing. Far exceeding my expectations with excellent service from Jose. EVERYTHING was fresh and delicious. I can see myself frequenting this spot!Stopped in with the family for brunch and was very pleased by the friendly staff and cleanliness of the place. We ordered the meatballs(excellent) pork nuggets (Very tasty) tuna inside out (refreshing)  and that was our appetizer round. The pizzas are packed with flavor no matter which one you choose. The Lobster&Shrimp Mac ń Cheese was creamy and delicious. This is my 5th visit, so I found it fitting for a 5 star review based on every visit. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu!The word "wow" doesn't begin to explain how great High Tide is. We showed up at close and not only did the owner welcome us but the staff treated us like celebrities. 

The food was nothing short of exceptional. We had the cioppino and I would recommend it to anyone.  We will definitely be back to adorn this local business. Please check out High Tide and you will not be disappointed.4.5 stars.
Three visits now! Still living this place...
Friendly, helpful service.
Cute, inviting interior with Cracker Barrelesque gifts available for purchase.
Ample outdoor seating with parking lot views (could use some potted trees).
Oh, and the food, can't forget the food!
Their French Toast is fantastic. Thick homemade bread lightly dipped and served with sliced strawberries, whipped butter and caramel syrup--I was told it's unlimited but two slices will fill you up for sure!
The breakfast sandwiches come standard in a croissant but we opted for the ciabatta bread and, while a bit big for the egg, bacon and cheese, it was so fresh and soft! So much easier to eat than the tough ciabatta bread at most places. The orange juice tasted fresh-squeezed and was an appropriate $3 versus the $4-6 they charge elsewhere.
Took a couple of chocolate chunk cookies to go and they were soft and yummy!
We are going back. And soon!This is such a cool new addition to the strip in Vegas. Party in the sky. 30 min round trip.So fun. First of all go at night. Second of all buy discount tickets on Groupon or LivingSocial. Third it's air-conditioned which is an incredible bonus fourth it's not scary at all except for stepping on and stepping off which gets a little dicey the rest of it though phenomenal view of the cityWe tried the Italian beef sandwich today and all I can say is WOW.  The beef was lean and sliced thin with onions, spicy peppers and melted cheese.   The roll was outstanding, light and fluffy with a crispy outside.  A side of au jus that had a nice flavor and wasn't too salty.  The sandwich itself is gigantic, more than enough for two people.  Grabbed a couple of slices too and they were delicious as usual.

As I mentioned before, the location is awesome because they have good parking and the grocery store is right around the corner. If you live in the area you are missing out if you haven't tried Rochellis!Great food, great bar, great server Kori. Keep it up Baby Kay's. The gumbo is delicious, the red beans and rice rock, the wings are to die for, and the fried chicken is second to none! Do yourself a favor and go get ya some!This is our first time here. Great food, great service, and great prices! So good that we decided to bring friends back here for dinner the same day.Great Food and Great Service.  Our go to restaurant in Cave Creek!!

Service is top notch and the food is delicious.So happy they opened one in Goodyear!  Work across the street so that's awesome. Great coffee, cool vibe.bought a 6 pack consisted of a red velvet, lemon meringue, black & white, milk chocolate, Cuban coffee and strawberry. Cupcakes were all very good, moist and not too sweet. 
I also got a scoop of captain crunch ice cream on a red velvet waffle cone because 6 cupcakes wasn't enough right?! Lol. 
Desserts were good, staff was friendly and helpful. 
I never heard of sprinkles before so I'm not biased of the hype put upon them but they do certainly have good treats!I went for the first time a few days ago and tried the sweet Thai Chili pork sandwich. It was great and I don't think I will be able to pick another sub place other than firehouse from now on. The staff was very friendly and brought the food to my table.  I recommend trying firehouse subs if you haven't yet.I have the most amazing experience with this company!!!
Professional ,Extremely Friendly and right on point .I  recommend them  to everyone that needs appliance services of any kind  
I needed my dishwasher fixed and after I called Katanny the scheduled appointment the same day and the job was done the same day 
LOVE IT !!!!!!I used Sun Devil Taxi Service when vacationing in Arizona for a birthday celebration and was very delighted with my experience! Eric picked us up in a beautiful brand new SUV with awesome navigation and free candy! He was polite and timely. Thanks for a great experience and will definitely use you the next time i visit Arizona!This shop is great. The people are very friendly and willing to help you out and explain any questions. I will absolutely go back to try their juice!!The Chuck Norris burger is insanely good as are green chili fries. My wife ordered a plain and simple cheeseburger with plain and simple fries and it was plain and simple delicious ! 
Highly recommend- great service and food cooked perfectly 
 You gotta hit this place in the Scottsdale Quarter -Great place to come and relax with friendly service. I've been here twice now and both times were fantastic.  I highly recommend this place.I have no idea how they do it. Most of the time I come here, their gas is 15-20 cents cheaper than everywhere else around here!

I have been to a variety of Costco gas places in different states, but from what I remember, savings is generally in the 5-10 cents range. Some places you didn't even save anything. 

But 15-20 cents? I can't buy gas anywhere else anymore! I have a 3 percent reward on my Bank of America credit card, but I've stopped using it because Costco saves me so much on it's own. 

The ONE and only downside to this place, and Costco in general, is that they don't take other credit cards. Would love to get additional rewards on top of the incredible savings! (To clarify, any other cards but AMEX, which I don't have!)Nice and clean location. Always packed!What an excellent dinner we had, best chicken picata and my husband said his spaghetti and meatballs was the best he had ever eaten.They make their own bread and pasta everything is homemade.What a gold mine in our neighborhood.Will definitely be going there again.This is such a great restaurant!  Fresh, clean, wonderful food!!!  The restaurant has been completely redone to make it open, attractive, and comfortable.  Good wine list!  Outdoor seating.  Owner/chef, George, could not be more personable.  We have been back twice and expect many visits as we enjoy good food - that is prepared with exceptional care and quality.Excellent food and exceptional service. Our server, Ray, was great. Very attentive and gave great recommendations. The manager even stooped by to check on our experience.
He had a delicious beer (can't remember the name) and I had the Monkey Wrench.. YUM!!
We started with the Triple T fries, seriously, ridiculously amazing!
I ordered the drunken fish tacos, and he had the original smash burger..again, amazing.  We finished with the fried ice cream sundae. Wow.Such a fun event! Always love to be able to take our dog Ziggy out and the pup cakes from sprinkles are his favorite treat! Thanks so much yelp and let's get more dog friendly events going!We were looking for a place to have brunch that didn't have a 45 minute wait or more on Easter Sunday (yeah right).  We were going to try out Mr. Mama's,  but they were closed and we're just going go drive over to the Cracked Egg, Egg & I, or something similar.  As I was driving up Russell, I looked over and saw Bachi HLK and we decided to head there instead. I guess the word isn't out yet that this place has delicious food because there were only two other tables with customers besides ours. I was surprised that they weren't busy for Easter brunch.  Kinda stinks for them, but awesome for me and my family.  They've only been open for about a week or so. 

We were promptly seated, of course, by our server Matt. He gave us our menus and explained a few things in the menu to us.  He came back with waters for us to drink and took our additional drink order as well as appetizers. Hubs and daughter shared the beignets. The menu has so many delicious dishes on it that it took us a little longer to figure out what we wanted. I was torn between the 36 hour short rib loco moco or the shrimp and grits. I asked Matt and he suggested the loco moco. Hubs got the flaxseed coconut pancakes and our daughter got the waffle. 

Our food came out soon after we ordered. The waffle and pancakes come with your choice of whipped butter or almond butter. You also get a choice of syrups. They have maple,  coconut and blueberry. Hubs chose the whipped butter and maple. Daughter chose almond butter and maple. The pancakes were a decent size and came as a 3 stack. The waffle was the size of a plate. They both enjoyed their choices.

What can I say about my short rib loco moco?  It was so delicious!  It came with 2 eggs (over easy as Matt suggested), fried rice, orange lentil gravy and the short rib. Matt gave me a steak knife for the short rib, but I didn't need it. The short rib was so tender. I used my fork to break it apart. The fried rice was good and the eggs were cooked perfectly. The orange lentil gravy is different from the typical loco moco brown gravy,  but was a refreshing change. The gravy had orange lentils in it and was reminiscent of bbq baked beans, but not as thick. I mixed the egg, rice, gravy and a piece of meat together. I could still taste everything separately,  but it all worked well together. 

Service was stellar. Matt didn't hover, but checked on us a couple times during our meal. The manager came to our table to talk with us and give us a to go menu as well.  We will definitely be back. Only down side of this place is that they do not offer bottomless mimosas/bellinis like a place up the road on Fort Apache. That is not worth bringing it down a star; just merely a hint/suggestion. =) We'll be back!!I've been to this restaurant twice now, and I'll keep coming back. I'm so excited to have this new place to eat and hang out at in my own backyard. They have a great atmosphere and great food. I had the tacos last night, and they were fantastic. Great drinks too.This place was great! Wonderful and  friendly service, delicious and hot homemade tortilla chips, and delicious entrees. We had vegetarian enchiladas and the chicken torta.  Everyone loved their food and we will definitely come back.Thanks for opening up right by me.  I've been to other locations but this one is my favorite.  The cashier Mei is super friendly & helpful.  Walking in & being greeted by her smile name this great experience even better.  The food is great. & well worth the price.  You get huge portions. You also get a free drink with purchase, you can't beat that.  I had the Salmon & Garlic Shrimp & I highly recommend it.  This is a new location & they keep it very clean.I've been here twice so far to hit Drai's Nightclub (rooftop) and Drai's After Hours (subterranean):
- Cool UK English decore.  I enjoyed both the rooftop nightclub and the subterranean after hours club.  
- Similar to The Cosmo, this place attracts the 20s crowd (other properties seem to get the 30s crowd, or older).
- Blackjack tables have $15 min for 3-to-2 payout on blackjack, and $10 min for 6-to-5 blackjack.  For players who request water, they provide complimentary Fiji bottled water (a nice touch).
- Currently tied for being my favorite Strip property.Robyn is very professional and able to carry out her visions clearly. She works quickly and efficiently to get shoots done in a timely manner without sacrificing the quality of the photos. I highly recommend her for her work.Well, as a native Texan, I thought it was the best restaurant barbecue I have had in years!  I had the brisket sandwich that I could quite literally cut with the plastic knife provided.  While real Texas barbecue is smoked, loved and rubbed, you won't find it bathed in sauce, that is always on the side.
I found the sauce to be very good...tangy of lemon rather than vinegar.  Not too sweet like Tennessee sauce. I prefer my sauce a little spicy but I would consider it mild.
I had potato salad that I thought was good and would rate it 3 1/2 stars.  The baked beans were not what I expected or would consider traditional style, but very tasty, tangy pinto beans.  I would give the beans 4 stars.
I will most defiantly return for more awesome goodness to try other menu items.  I highly recommend this dining experience for the casual style and for the food.OMG I love this place!! I had the jerk turkey burger it had all kinds of flavors inside.  They also have a lot of specialty drinks that are not on the menu you have ask the bartender. They're opening up a patio area on the top of the venue July 4th weekend looking forward to it!Found out about The Revival after sifting through 17 pages of the same old Yelp results looking for a place for lunch - I live and work in Tempe and am running out of new places to eat, so I was stoked to find out that this place had opened just a few weeks ago. As soon as I read about the chef's association House of Tricks, I knew I had to go.

We got there around 11:40, which was perfect because it was right before the lunch rush started rolling in. Being a new restaurant, I wasn't sure if it would be busy, but it was once it hit noon. Clearly the word is spreading fast!

Everything on the menu looked amazing, but I decided to start by trying the Charred Korean Pork Belly sandwich, which was great. The flavors actually reminded me more of Banh Mi than Korean food, but being Vietnamese I can't complain. :)

The atmosphere was casual and relaxed. A great place for lunch, but I can also see myself coming here to unwind for dinner and drinks during happy hour.

Basically, I just left and I already can't wait to go back! It's definitely a place I can see myself frequenting in the future.Justin has been outstanding to work with. What ever i've needed, he's always come through for me.
