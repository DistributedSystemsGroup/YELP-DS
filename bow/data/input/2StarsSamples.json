Imperial Garden has been getting progressively worse over the last few years. The waitstaff has always been attentive and professional, and the wait time for food is reasonably short. The restaurant itself and the bathrooms are clean and spacious. The ambiance is relaxed and pleasant, and noise levels are comfortably low.

But none of these things can save the mediocre-to-bad food. That is, if you get your food at all. On more than one occasion, they have forgotten to include entire entrees or side dishes when I've picked up take-out. I now double-check all of my orders before leaving. The egg rolls taste like they came out of a box in the freezer. They are greasy and heavy, with very little flavor until you douse them in sweet-and-sour sauce that's so sweet it might as well be syrup. The same problems plague the entirely unremarkable crab rangoon. I've had the hot and sour soup, and disliked the taste quite a bit. Not spicy enough, and far too sour. I usually order the ginger beef stir-fry. There's hardly any ginger flavor, and the sauce is thick and also fairly sweet. If they halved the amount of sugar in everything, it would be a good start. I've had more success with the sizzling black pepper beef, which has a punch of black pepper and a good balance of meat and vegetables. On a recent trip, a friend got the beef lo mein. It had a nice quantity of beef, but an anemic quantity of vegetables. It was also very greasy and watery, and tasted extremely bland. The only reason I go here as often as I do is that my grandmother (the poster child for stereotypical Wisconsin taste buds, bless her heart) loves the three delicacies sizzling rice.

I did discover one saving grace: if you dump sriracha on the food, it blends very well with the food and elevates all of the flavors. Too bad they don't have any of it at the restaurant, it could save many a dish. Bottom line: there's much better, more authentic, more balanced, and less heavy Chinese food available in Madison at comparable prices. If you're looking for good Chinese in town, check out Hong Kong Cafe on Regent or Orient House on South Park instead.pricey for what you get (average cut, average color), the place is cramped otherwise nicely decorated but the mold smell from the basement sometimes gets horrendous. Wish they would clean this up, the owner doesn't seem to care.The manager was very nice. The pool was nice and deserted as well as the hot tub. The room was fine but NOTHING fancy.
The 3 people at the front desk ignored us when we first came in. They were on the phone, but couldn't even give us a nod of acknowledgement. After waiting 10 minutes I tried to check in and I told them we had registered online and we were cashing in our Best Western points. Immediately the man checking us in got a strange look on his face and without saying anything he turned and walked into a closed door behind the desk. I was left feeling confused. When he came back he started to ask us a question and the very rude blonde check in girl interrupted him to say, you can't use those points to pay for a room, that has to be done ahead of time ONLINE. We had just driven 5 hours with 2 wild boys in the car to find out we couldn't stay there? That was what my brain was thinking. I was just really confused and surprised at to why she would get so abrupt and defensive and not even ask us any questions. Oh and she was still on the phone. The timid looking check in guy said the manager would be over to talk to us. He still had not said a word about whether or not we could use our points. I tried to ask him, and he seemed to have absolutely ZERO knowledge of how that worked. Maybe he was in training. My husband travels for work and stays at Best Westerns all of the time. He has never had a problem like this. The manager was extremely nice and we gave him our account/approval number from registering online. He was younger than both of the people at checkout and much more helpful and professional. He got us registered within 10 minutes. I just thought someone should know about this incident. I work with people and would NEVER be so rude to customers as the front desk. They never even smiled and we did not get anywhere until the manager came out. We will not be staying there again.My girlfriend and I recently ate here, but it wasn't anything I would recommend. At least, not to anyone I liked...


The Expectation:  Her Dad wanted to take the two of us out for dinner, and his wife had suggested 'The Old Spaghetti Factory'. I had never been to the place before, but I know a few of my family have went there on separate occasions with nothing but good things to say. So, I figured we'd try it, I'd say I was even eager to do so.


The Wait:  We arrived for dinner, roughly about 6pm on a weeknight. We were told by the hostess that it would be about "ten or fifteen minutes" to seat our table of four. At first, I thought that was a little weird, seing it didn't appear ridiculously busy from the lobby or by the amount of cars parked outside, and it wasn't like we were an abnormally large group. But it was cool, they had what seemed like several waiting rooms with different types of chairs and sofas to sit on, and some cool, old "stuff" to look at.

...Twenty minutes later.
It seemed like there were at least three different, larger groups of people that came in after us, and were seated before us. I wasn't really sure how that worked, but, just as I was just about to approach the hostess podium to inquire about our wait, the hostess called our party's name and began to walk us to our table.


The Service:  Our hostess sat us at a four top table, located in one of the corners of the main dinning room. She apologized for the wait, noting that the area we' were sitting in was supposed to be closed, but they were making room in order to seat us, she also mentioned that our waitress should be by in a minute or so. It didn't take long for our waitress to come by to tell us she'd be right with us, but then it took forever for her to return and take our drink order.

One of the least pleasant particulars of the evening was our waitress being super short with us at every encounter. It was like we had done something wrong by sitting in her section. By the time she returned with our drinks, I think we all knew exactly what we were ordering; which seemed to somehow catch her off guard, as if she was stressed to take our order.


The Meal:  I had the Chicken Marsala which came with Mizithra Cheese & Browned Butter, and my girlfriend had the Spinach & Cheese Ravioli. Both entrees included bread for the table, and the choice of soup or salad. I had a Caesar (upgraded at an additional cost.) and she had a side salad with vinaigrette.

The salads were alright, iceberg lettuce, which was 'meh' and the Caesar came with tomatoes, which I scoffed at, just a little. My entree wasn't horrible, although, it did seem like a pretty measly serving for the price. It tasted just mediocre, - I could've swore the tomatoes/sauce on the Raviolis was canned, whatever it was, it was pretty bitter. 

I'm usually not one to complain about the waiting staff allowing you to enjoy your meal in peace, but that was not the case in this instance. The waitress rarely came by the table to check on us, at all. She came by and asked us if we enjoyed our meal, (laughable,) if there was anything more she could get for us, or if we needed to-go boxes, while taking our dishes away. She left us, again, for an eternity. Returning with our check and some small boxes.


The Outcome:  I tried to keep the group positive while we sat, as others around us seemed to be enjoying themselves. But without another, much improved dinning experience, I would probably go elsewhere. Honestly, I don't love/hate/mind Olive Garden, but this place wasn't even that good.

I walked my girlfriend back to our car with a disappointed stomach, and a sad little to-go box, both half-full of mediocre food. - Maybe we can go somewhere good on Friday night...I guess that the organization overall is good, but wonder why one of the most needy populations in all of our communities is dismissed by this organization.  I am referring to kids who are in foster or kin placements through CPS.  I know we have tried multiple times to get children hooked up with a big brother or sister only to be told that CPS kids are too transient with their case managers and placements so they wont work with them.  Who cares if the case manager changes, if the kid is in a placement that wants to have them stay there for years or even adopt them.  Case mangers and social workers at schools and hospitals change but they will set those kids up with Bigs.  I don't understand why this company wont work with Arizona CPS kids.  

Kids who have been removed from their parents are more at need of a positive mentor than any other population, yet are pushed aside by VBB-BS.  And when you ask for a reason why all you get is the "they are transient" story. And I guess the kid with the single parent who cant keep a job is stable?

They appear to me to be an example of "get the good PR", and forget the rest.Being from Southern California, the "scene" is so much fun. There are several clubs to go to and any night is a great time. That brings us to the Phoenix scene and The Cash.Oh wait, there is no scene for the ladies. Not going to bash them to hard, because it's the only consistent place that we have. Yes it caters to the Country music crowd, but they do play spurts of other music through out the weekend evenings.The mixed drinks could be better, but the prices are reasonable.This was a sadness pile on a failure plate.   I have had worse but never in a place so widely considered a treasure by the Yelping community.  From recent reviews it looks like this place is a shell of its former glory and that's sad, because the potential is there. From my experience tonight, the rumors may be true.I ordered the Chicken BBQ sandwich...was not that great. The chicken meat lacked any flavor. And the bread of the sandwich was extremely mushy. Plus, no sides and no kid options!! Just FYI...What happened to you?

This place, specifically this Macayo's, used to be so good when I was a kid. I came back here last weekend and I was so disappointed. Everything about this place just seemed way sloppier than how it used to be.

Essentially, Macayo's is one of the staple eateries of Phoenix. It's like a bastard cousin of Garcia's (RIP). It's the typical Americanized Mexican food, nothing too spicy but plenty of taste and it's heavy too. It's true though what the reviews have described it as: a Mexican TGI Friday's or Denny's.

It's so sad to see Macayo's in the state. It's like that girl you used to think was cute when you were in junior high... but then you bumped into her a few days ago at the grocery store and she looks worn out in every sense of the word after surviving through four kids and three divorces. C'mon, Macayo's! Take care of yourself!Oh, AJ's. If you didn't exist less than 3 blocks from my apartment, I would never go to you. Although you have high-class pretensions, and several amicable sommeliers, your employees are aware that you are a ripoff.

Case in point: I go to AJ's on St. Paddy's day, 2010, looking for some corned beef. 1 corned beef steak remains. About 2 pounds. Price: 25.00. When I lived in Oregon last year, I was able to get 4 pounds of corned beef (a very cheap cut and preparation of beef) for under $10. I mentioned the price gouging to the guy behind the meat counter, and I quote: "Hahahahahahahaha!!!" -- Nothing else. No joke. They know they're overpriced. They sell the exact same things as food city for 4x the price (same company owns fry's, food city, and AJ's) because they know that a tamale will be something the whitebread customers of AJ's will consider a delicacy unavailable outside of the Spanish Mass at their local catholic church, and worthy of more than $2 apiece.

Furthermore, more whole and organic foods are sold at any one Sprouts, Trader Joe's, Fresh and Easy, and Whole Foods than any AJ's that ever existed.

Avoid this place unless you're a yuppie with too much money and not enough sense, or unless you think one of the sommeliers is hot. 2 stars for the awesome beer selection.I'm thinking that the normal staff was off yesterday. 

I went to Cherry Blossom with very high hopes thanks all the positive yelp reports and was very disappointed. This onetime experience won't stop me from coming back to give the Cafe another chance...as I think I might have been transported to a parallel universe for this meal. 

First off... cute little place, there is no doubt that this is not a chain. The interior of the restaurant is simple and looks more like your dining at an authentic Asian bistro in Vancouver rather then in a central Phoenix strip mall. Our server was a little slow getting to us, again, this is not a chain, so that was overlooked. 

I ordered a Summer Roll (per menu - Shrimp, lettuce, avocado, cucumber and rice noodles) and a Shrimp tempera roll. When the orders arrived the summer roll looked great, but was stuffed with a "bonus" of that weird crab lookalike stuff made from fish heads and fins.. YUK! Not a problem, I'll just scoop it out onto the appetizer plate... 

so when I counted, the Summer roll with shrimp, did have shrimp.. 2 of them, and I kid you not, 1/2 cup of that crab stuff. 

When my "shrimp" tempura roll arrived, guess what?? its a fake crab tempura roll with one shrimp... lol... The rice...VERY sticky... By the time the meal was over, my app plate was mounded with about a cup of this crab scented stuff... such a waste... 

My friend's pasta ( Marsala Chicken) was great... the chicken was all breast meat, with a really good Marsala sauce...it was impressive! ... So overall... weird experience... will it keep me away??... no, well not unless it happens again...

The strangest thing about this whole ordeal is the fact  the main ingredient of my appetizer and sushi roll was not even on the menu.Overrated! Service was terrible and food was below average. Tables were dirty and server refused to get cucumbers from the sushi bar, even we offered to pay for them. I offered the Gomoku Yaki Udon - pork was overcooked and overrun with whole calamari that still had eyes... Interesting decorating - Asian, Italian, and French with Christmas lights. Disappointed... :/I'm done with the antiquated Turkish bazaar style of sales "technique" car dealerships provide. In this day and age we shouldn't have to spend multiple hours going back and forth just to make a purchase. Sitting in empty offices while the salesperson disappears to "talk to my manager" - don't BS me, I've seen Fargo, I know what you are really doing.

Everyone uses the internet to research the type of car they want, you can look up the MPG, the cargo room, the legroom. You know what colours are available and what trims. You can even look at the dealer website and see what inventory is in stock, complete with accessories and MSRP* (The Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price excludes destination freight charge, tax, title, license, dealer fees and optional equipment. See your dealer for details)

So I had gone onto the GMC website, found the exact model of vehicle I wanted to buy with the exact specifications that fit my need and my budget. I got a generic email from John, the Coulter Internet Manager telling me he's my man. There were two models listed in stock, so I sent an email to him with the VINs of the cars I was interested in, together with the make model and mileage of my trade-in. I never heard anything back.

So a couple of days later I walk into Coulter. This is not your typical dealership with hundreds of cars on the lot, there are maybe 6 cars out front and a couple more in the showroom. Imagine the scene - I walk into the showroom which has car salesmen all hanging around each others desks, chewing the fat and yucking it up. They scatter like cockroaches when I walk in. An older gentleman approaches me, 

You looking for parts?
No, I want to buy a car
Well if you are looking for parts, it's down that way
No, I want to buy a car
Oh, come this way

That's how I met Dean. Dean has a PhD. I know this because it's on his business card AND on the door plate to his office. Don't ask for Dean if you are in a rush, because he moves like molasses. Up we go in an elevator, through a door to a second floor garage. We are looking for the car I am interested in. Dean is half listening to me. I tell him that I have the exact car I need to see. I tell him that according to your website you have two in stock, one silver and one white. Let's find either of them. He doesn't know where they are. We look in the garage; we look out on the lot. We go back down the elevator to his office. I give him the VINs, he disappears, comes back and off we go to try and find either of the two cars. After much searching and much shuffling we find one of them, out on a parking lot, behind the service area, mixed in with private cars and one with the whole side missing. Yep, you guessed it, Dean doesn't have the keys.

When he finally returns with the keys, he reluctantly takes me on a test drive. No you can't drive it out of the lot, we have security. Where is this security when we were looking for the car? Maybe they can instigate a search for the white one I was really interested in. We then go on the most pedestrian test drive ever. No freeway exposure, just literally around the block. I'm driving a V6 I want to let it go, see what it can do, but nope.

So the car drives well, the MSRP is right. All that is needed now is to work out how much they are going to give me for my trade-in. As a good internet user I have researched the Kelly Blue Book value of my car. The KBB trade-in value is low, I expect that. They offer a range based on the condition of the car, from a low number if the car is ready for the scrapheap, to a high number if it is in pristine condition. I figure I'm somewhere in the middle. But it is what it is and with the range in hand we begin the negotiations. Cue Dean's exit again, this time with my car keys.

At first he can't get the VIN entered into his computer, so he figures he wrote it down wrong, then he takes his iPhone and snaps a photo of it, that doesn't work. He asks me if I have my insurance card and he reads the VIN off that. Finally, he gets the computer to accept the number. Lots of button pushing ensues, then he curses the printer, then he prints something, then he's off again.

When Dean finally returns, he has a price for me. $2,000 less than the low price on my range! Are you kidding me? At least he doesn't try to spin me a line about the age of the car or the condition. Just this is the price, take it or leave it. I say I'll leave it. This is a critical time in the car sales negotiation process, I waited half a second and then it came.

"What can we do to get you in a new car today?"

I said you can stop insulting me with that price and offer something within the KBB range. Ok, he says, "Let me go talk to my manager". So Dean makes his final departure. When he returns he shakes my hand and says we are getting nowhere, just wasting each other's time and goodbye.

So here I am, three hours later no further forward in the car buying process than I was before. 

Sigh. I wish Amazon sold carsLet me just say that, despite what you may have been lead to believe, I am not that cool. I still think Alanis Morissette is cool. I still wear black and pink sometimes. That is how uncool I am. I am not cool, and will probably never be cool, by the exacting standards of Buffalo Exchange. 

I know this. I knew this. But I cleaned out my closet and ended up with a stack of mostly designer duds that no longer made me feel fancy... it was time for me to brave the arctic wilderness of shirts with pearl snap buttons and dresses with cowboy boots that is Buffalo Exchange.

I see that some reviewers are a little insecure about their coolness. "They didn't take my stuff! I hate them!", or, "I didn't have enough body mods to be considered an indie badass! Eff those heartless hipster drones!" 

Listen, dudes. Who really cares what some icy jerk at Buffalo Exchange thinks about you, or thinks about your clothes? I already know that I am not cool enough for Buffalo Exchange. That is why I was stolid and unsurprised to receive little more than a dismissive grunt from any of the buyers/sales staff working there today. Actually, one of them did call me "honey" at one point. I liked that. 

While the gentleman at the "buy" counter was perusing my stuff, I wandered around and saw a lot of cute things, some outrageously priced and others, very reasonable. I saw a few shirts that I've purchased at Last Chance over the last 6 months hanging on the racks there, for triple what I bought them for. I also saw some cute designer shoes, jeans, and dresses at prices that are truly a steal and a half. Really cute accessories, too. I had to use major restraint in that department. 

They took, like, 3 items out of the multitude of junk that I hauled over there. I wasn't itchin' for a fix or trying to pay a bill or needing to buy baby formula or whatever other reason there is that people might complain about the amount they're receiving for their clothes. I took my sweet $16.50 in trade, and peaced. 

Was anybody nice to me? Not really. Did that make me feel bad? Nope! Avoid Buffalo Exchange if you have a fragile ego, and if inscrutable, potentially unfriendly facial expressions bother you. If you're just there for the deals, and couldn't care less about the trappings, you will probably spend $20 on something cute and go home and feel a little bit cooler.I found my uncle's Fossil watch in a box of old pictures on Christmas Eve. He died 9 years ago so it was a very sentimental find.  I wanted to get it resized, shined, and it needed a new battery as well.  I called ahead and asked if they did watched repair which they said they did. While they did replace the battery they maladjusted the watchband and as a result the watch would not latch.  This was very disappointing since it now fit worse than before. The young man who had been helping me admitted to not knowing what he was doing and that they did not have a watchmaker on staff and was kind enough not to charge me for the battery.  He meant well so the experience wasn't a total bust. However, better to say you don't know how to fix something than try and fail at the expense of the customer's time.All UPS stores aren't created equally (they may have the same look 'n' feel, but they're individually owned). I've stopped in here a couple of times -- on one occasion the employee didn't seem to know how to work the copy machine, and on another occasion I discovered that this location doesn't do passport photos. On all occasions, this particular store has had an unkempt, cluttered appearance which seems unprofessional. The last time I was in here (which will be the last) I noticed the mailbox fees on the wall. Why someone would rent a mailbox at a UPS store instead of the much less expensive post office-option is beyond me. I also never got the impression of "I'm happy to see you, customer! How can I help you??"

My advice is to avoid this store. If you need UPS services, visit the UPS store on the SEC of Camelback & 32nd St.I travel thru-out the country and stay at many hotels but I was not impressed with the Ritz-Carlton Phoenix. The staff is welcoming and pleasant but the hotel itself is not up to the standards of what a Ritz-Carlton should be. The rooms are outdated and the gym / pool area are small. To be honest, I've stayed at Hilton Garden Inn's that were better. I'll be staying somewhere else the next time I'm in Phoenix.Had eyebrows done and esthetician ripped my skin off in two places. I called and spoke to the manager Casey and she was rude and blamed me for it. I explained I have had this done a number of times and never had any issues. She asked that I come back in and I was seen by a different esthetician. I saw the new esthetician who was extremely professional and relieved the pain I was feeling in my eyebrow. She apologized and explained to me how this could have happened. When we finished she thanked me and apologized once again. When I was leaving, we saw the manager Casey and the esthetician explained to her what happened. The manager never apologized or thanked me for my business. This woman should not be managing a spa of this caliber. I don't plan on going back there again.I was excited to try this place and when I saw the travelzoo deal I jumped on it. I was trying to think of the best way to describe their food and it reminded me of convention center food.  I think they have catered to too many weddings and have lost the art of cooking quality meals.

This is also one of those places where you get the feeling that its cool to pay more for less. We were seated inside after requesting a patio seat and we brought the average age down about 30 years. It was hot and stuffy and the seats were so uncomfortable I had to take some advil when I got home. Had the worst french onion soup I've ever seen/ eaten (not sure how you mess that up?) and the salmon was too salty even for me.  I'm would not consider myself a food snob but I have eaten plenty of good food and this place just doesn't make the cut.  The only plus side to our dinner was being able to walk around the mansion and see the decor afterwards.  If we had actually been able to sit on the patio I"m sure the view would have been nice.

In summary.... 
Average age: 65 
Food quality: sub par 
Decor: antique 
Bill with discount: $110 
Recommend? NOThe last time we ate at Houston's, we waited 90 minutes for a table. They had quoted 45. We complained. They told us "just five to ten more minutes"  a few times. I was super hungry and expected something to be comped. Anything. I guess they didn't feel the same.

And let's not kid ourselves - the food is just okay. I'm convinced people eat at Houston's because it's at the Biltmore, everyone wears their church clothes, and the decor is pretty nice. Dining here makes you feel like you have money, even though it's not very expensive. Or maybe that's just me.The location is pretty much the only reason I stick with this place-it's right around the corner from my house...
the is always a couple broken machines and the place is smelly (not like typical gym smell because I'm a practical person, I realize people sweat...I'm talking needs to be cleaned smell) and couldn't be paid enough to use the locker room.
Additionally, there have been a lot of reports lately about cars being broken into and theft. However, the staff is very nice and I get the workout I need so I'll be sticking with it for a while.T. Cook's and I have a long history but T. doesn't know it.  The first time I met him was over ten years ago when I was just making it in this town.  I had reached my goal for my office and in celebration, I took some of my friends and biggest cheerleaders there to celebrate.  T's food went right to my g-spot and I had an orgasmic reaction right there at the table.  
I saved T for special occassions.  The next time I went was again for some celebratory occassion with some friends and once again, T's food went right to my g-spot and I had another orgasmic reaction.
The third time, I've been spoiled so I was secretly rubbing my legs together under their pristine table linen in anticipation and didn't care who saw me as I licked every delectable morsel off of my plate and fingers, groaning with pleasure.
With gloating praise of T., I got a group of friends together for a private dining experience at the Delano Room (min. $500 spending) for a holiday dinner this past Christmas.  When making the reservation, the lady was a bit snubby which I can accept when I am anticipating another orgasmic experience.  
We gather for a evening of fine dining . . . except this time, T. had performance anxiety and failed me.  First the waitress looked like she was overworked and coming into the Delano Room was an inconvinence to her because she has just way too many tables outside that were more important to her.  When my dish came, it had been under the heat lamp for so long that it was completely shriveled that I could not tell what dish I had ordered.  I gave her one look and without a word, she took the dish back and asked me if I would like to order another dish.  Where my g-spot was left high and dry was when we got the bill, the antipasto dish that the waitress had recommended we ordered as a 3-person portion was a whopping $45 per plate.  She had said that "some" additional amount would be added for a larger portion- she neglected to clarify that it would be a whopping 3x's the amount.  And we had 2 plates of those . . . $90 for 2 antipasto plates??  
So what was supposed to be my most savory experience with T. was completely anticlimatic and totally blemished my memory of him.
I know T's popular so he'll have many suitors- just not this one.It seems to me that many Phoenicians have a "jaded" (pun INTENDED) view of what real, authentic Chinese food looks and tastes like, and those people are the ones who said this was the best Chinese food they've ever had. 

I'm sorry, but I was NOT that impressed with the food here. I came here last night with a group of 6 people and we did the whole "family style" thing. A couple people ordered potstickers and said they were really good (and at least the waitress warned them that they would take 15 minutes to make) but others were not that impressed with the wonton soup. 

My dish was actually pretty good (Ginger Chicken), but a couple of the other plates looked a little sketch (I mean, the Walnut Shrimp was literally a plate with shrimp, then a huge serving of broccoli and then a pile of walnuts....IT WASN'T EVEN MIXED IN!!) I was also disappointed with the "fried rice" they served with the meal, which was just fried with some soy sauce (no eggs, no veggies). The Mu Shu was ok, but I actually prefer the one at P.F. Chang's. 

All in all, it wasn't horrible, but as the 2 Star rating indicates, I've DEFINITELY HAD BETTER!! 

Almost three stars for great service, though!!!I have not been here in awhile, so I thought since I am in the area I will pick up a lunch togo.  I ordered the sesame chicken lunch special (chicken, rice, and an egg roll).  I bought it back to the office, it smelled good and the togo box was stuff with food.  I wished it tasted as good as it smelled.  The sauce was kind of bland.  I was so bummed.  I guess I need to find another chinese take out place.Good prices but bad service.   I shopped and found a nice set for a good price.  I went home measured and ordered online in the morning on a Thursday.  Later on Thursday early evening I had not received a call.  I called the store and confirmed they received the order.   I had requested a Saturday morning delivery online.   The rep told me that usually they have a 4 day window for deliveries but he would do me a "favor" and schedule it for Saturday.   Are you JOKING?  The competitors all have next day delivery.   I had to be nice since I wanted the Sat. Delivery so I thanked him.  On Saturday morning I had not received a call.   I called and they said the store does not call, the customer has to call for a delivery time.  Oy!   HELLO, the customer should not have to work so hard!   The delivery was delayed past the 430 time and you guessed it they NEVER called.   I threatened to cancel the order and it was at my home 15 minutes later.   I will NEVER go back.  They lost another customer.We were invited here with some friends and the food and drinks and service were alright.They were not terrible, but not worth going back for. Just very cheesy and greasy and I am sure a fat and calorie bomb!The prices are ridiculous here...$55 for a used bookcase that you can buy new at Ikea for $30?

  I came in looking for a decent used suitcase.  They want $30 for a nasty old thing that might have cost that much when it was new.  I can not understand why they would price donated items so high.  People that shop here want a bargain and will just go and purchase something new if there isn't much difference in price.   Sad for the charities this store supports.I was tempted to go with a one star on this one, but I finished SOME of my dinner.  We ordered delivery from this place tonight and it was pretty awful. The delivery driver was super nice, but it was all downhill from there. We ordered egg rolls, hot and sour soup, General Tso's chicken and vegetable chow mein. The egg rolls were fine, nothing exciting. Good crispy wrapper, not over-fried, with a flavorful inside. According to my BF the hot and sour soup was great. However, the entrees were really terrible. The General Tso had no spiciness at all and the sauce was very gelatinous. It was almost more like a hot and sour sauce, with almost a ketchup-y aftertaste. The breading was soft and mushy (which I guess is to be expected for delivery) but the chicken inside was super yucky. WAY overcooked, rubbery nuggets of chewy dried out chicken. I ate about three small bites and gave up. It was probably the worst GTC I ever had. And I've eaten a lot of bad General Tso's Chicken. The chow mein was edible but not what I would call good. It was almost flavorless. The veggies were ok and had more flavor than the noodles, but overall it was little more than something to chew and swallow, not really enjoy.  I definitely wouldn't try this place again. I guess the quest for decent Chinese food delivery continues.Ok, if you like canned chicken, no spices and little flavor, this is your place!

The chicken Tortilla soup was good, and the chips... The salsa and everything else was processed, canned, pre-made garbage!  Fuck this place and it's food!

Miguel was very nice and the bathrooms are clean, but beyond saying hi to a nice waiter or pissing on clean porcelain, don't bother!Not sure if 2 stars is fair or not, so here's my story.

We rent 2 small (5X5) units from them and have for years now. Over the last few years they have changed managers several times. They have also upgraded their automated access a few times.

We've been locked out before for non-payment (they system automatically does this) but it was never urgent. Today it was, They have pay at the gate so it cost me $79.00 to get in, they were closed so I either waited or paid.

It's important to note that we have never had a late or missed payment since we've been doing business with them. When I go in there they always fix the problem right away. 

The facility is always clean and well maintained. If it wasn't for their automated system locking us out all the time I would probably have given them 4-5 stars. The billing/lockout problem has gotten worse over the years but the property itself has improved. I guess the bottom line is it doesn't matter how nice it is on the inside, it's useless if you can't get in.

Update 12-14-09
They were very apologetic and will  be refunding me the money. The regional director even sent me an email. Great customer service, tech department needs work. Now that the regional director is involved maybe it will get fixed.Meh.  There's so much better food and service out there in Phoenix/Scottsdale.  We tried this place again, only to be disappointed by the small portions and very poor service.  Our third time here was not a charm!Ok if you are looking for a quick fix of sushi / sashimi, but nothing to go out of your way for. Pleasant staff but a little ho-hum , some strange patrons !

If you want a good sushi bar go to Yasu on E.Cactus .I felt lazy to drive to a better place to eat, but since it was next door I came here. The staff isnt the friendlyest and the food reflects it. They are very cheap on the amount of meats they put on the sandwich. You get more at Subway, if you want to compare. Also, for what they charge your better off going to another place. If you want a really good sub sandwich, go to Jimmy Johns. They have much better service, food and always have a friendly greeting when entering or leaving there.The tortillas are worth 4 stars, but I think the rest is overrated. The machaca always struck me as bland.  Same with the tamales.  I'd much rather go up the street to Ranch Market/Tradiciones.

And the hours are frustrating. Closed Sundays and shuts down too early the rest of the week.  The Cactus location is open later, but the food is no better and the dining room is depressing.I don't get it!

I've heard a lot of about this place so I had to try.  At first glance this place gave you one of those uh-huh moments.  Yep, sketchy and a little ghetto I thought.  However, I risked my life for a burrito before!  I ordered the taco platter and my sister had the enchiladas.  I had to get some hot sauce out of the ketchup dispenser, which didn't look too clean, but I took my chances.  I would like to stress "hot" since it seemed like it was just "sauce".  I can't say too much about the taco since it felt like sustenance.  My sister's enchiladas weren't too bad.  Coming from the barrios of LA I definitely had better Mexican food.  

The place itself is pretty simple. Basic tables and chairs nothing to wow and pop anybody, but I gather they weren't trying to.  Needless to say I've had better.... much better and I don't think I want to risk my life for this.  -  Enjoy!This airport really sucks.  The layout for one is ridiculous.  I felt like we spent most of our two hour layover walking from one terminal to the next just to grab a quick meal.  The saving grace was Paradise Cafe.  It was the only high quality and decently priced place to get a meal that both my child and I would like.  If you're traveling alone I'm sure you can find other places but having a kid really limits the choices!  Also they have a complete lack of power outlets!  Most airports these days have a long row of nice leather chairs with outlets in the arm, but PHX is lacking this.  You just have to hope you can get a seat by one of the columns with an outlet in it, but then you get the death stare from ten other people when you plug in!Not a fan of the airport being 10 miles away from car rental... Easy to get around but plan extra time for the shuttle ride.i first checked out the website before going here, and the website gave me the impression this place was something waayy different from what it actually is. Total let down, i was expecting to ride some good rides, when actually this place is for kids.. i mean little kids. Only two rides you can consider adult friendly, and still were not all that impressive. the one big roller coaster is alright, but really short and the "Flyer' is probably their best attraction. Would i go back?? prob not unless i took kids..if you have kids they would love it though.I disagree, this Taco Bell is NOT the best. They FOOL you into THINKING it's the best because they repeat your order back to you in the drive-thru, in the order that  you ordered the items, and then you feel confident that they got it right, then you pull up to the window and they repeat it to you AGAIN, giving you MORE false confidence, and then you check the bag and everything LOOKS right, then you drive all the way home and discover you've got the wrong items, things you didn't order, wrapped to label what you asked for. 
Granted, at the end of the day, it's all the Bell and pretty much the same. So you eat it anyway. But you still harbor resentment for the trickery.I don't understand how this rates so high.
 As other reviewers have said, this is not good sushi. It's edible (thus the 2 star rating), but it's not great. I have been to this restaurant 3 times to make sure I wasn't missing anything, and each time I've been only mildly satisfied. They do not serve real crab, their rolls fall apart, and the service is not that great. Maybe I'm going at the wrong time? I have been there during lunch time each time I've gone and have not been impressed at all. On the 3rd try, my friend and I decided that we would not be returning any more.Came here today to get a full-set put on. When I sat down, I requested more rounded tips, rather than square. When he went to file them, I reminded him again to please make them slightly rounder. He seemed irritated with me and shook his head like there was something wrong with me. A few moments later, after studying my nails for a minute or two, I was asked "why do you keep looking at them!?" So, I was honest and replied, "Because I think I would like them a little shorter." Again, I recieved a nasty look and a shaking of the head. He mumbled something and continued on with my nails. I was so uncomfortable! Last time I checked, I was the one paying for the service...I've never had an issue before in getting what I ask for. And mind you, I was the only person in the entire salon. I wasn't taking up any other customer's time! Really unfriendly service.

I had a pedicure after, which was short but fine. She did a nice job. However, I would not come back to this place again.BEWARE THE FISH MINT!!!!

This was a new experience for me.
I've been to oh-so-many pho places all over the country, and not one of them used this traditional (but disgusting) herb called FISH MINT.

Spring rolls - basic - can't go wrong?  oh but it could...

Everyone kept tasting this fish taste and we thought maybe the shrimp had gone bad (we are in AZ, folks).

Then my friend's salad came out.  FISHY.

Then my bun.

I put all the leafy greens in there liberally (I do love my greens), and then I got this big mouthful of... ROTTEN FISH.

BLECH!!!!

I literally spit it out and almost gagged.

Finally I called the waiter over cuz I was bankin' on a free meal (what with the vegetables being left out with rotten fish, or something), and he just laughed and said,
"Oh!  That's diep ca!  It's very good for you.  Some people don't like it... Next time we'll leave it out."

and that was that.

Ick.

Who likes the taste of rotten fish?  I actually like the taste of fish sauce, so it's not like I'm a total nay-sayer on all things fishy... but DAMN... that $h!t tasted NASTY.

I had to google it, cuz I thought he was just making it up.  But there really is an herb called FISH MINT.

BEWARE!!!

The Pho is safe.  Apparently they don't serve it with pho.In short: A monument to crappy-ness.  Decent food muddled by horrible service, becoming a bit overpriced as well.

Well what can I say about best hong kong?  Rather than going on a tirade of negativity, I'll list the good things about it.  The food is decent, half the time...... well that's it, I guess.  Now the tirade: When you go sit there, it doesn't inspire you to eat.  Looks dirty everywhere, it may not be actually dirty but you just feels creeped out.  The staff is rude from owner/hostess up front, any one of the non english speaking waiters, and the bussers.  To get something extra like rice or water is like taking a kidney from them.  Food is sometimes good on not so oily but it's hit or miss really.  Only reason I go there is for the duck, it's probably one of the better dishes anywhere.  I don't bother dining in anymore, just get my duck and vamoose. It used to be pretty affordable, but over time the prices have gone up a lot.  When I started coming here the whole duck was 12$ now half a duck is 10$. 

Although I have never been chased by the staff, two of my friends were chased out to the parking lot demanding 15% or more on the tips.  There service is probably deserves a -15%, it's that bad.  I'm really surprised by the general disregard for customers.  Another funny thing is that the staff understands english pretty well but if you have a complaint then they pretend like they are hearing english for the first time.  It's pretty funny to see.  Don't go here if you can help it.I am in full agreement with others about the equipment condition. Though I get a good workout because of the variety, there are MANY repair issues as evident in all the "broken signs" that seem to stay on the machines forever. Even machines that work could use maintenance. I had been a member 10 years ago and will say that when I came back 5 months ago because of my daughters request, it was a deja vu.....NOTHING has changed. 

As for cleanliness, the place could use a really good cleaning especially the bathrooms. There are many customers at this location so I cannot imagine the repair/cleanliness issue is to blame on financial reasons.  This is obviously a poorly managed location and I have written to corporate 2 months ago with no reply.Dont waste your time, or money. This place is mediocre at best. The atmosphere is great, especially for large parties. They are very accommodating for something like that. However the food is not that great, I would recommend Olive Garden over Bucca any day.I've had good experiences at this Fletchers in the past, but the last few times I've been there have been frustrating.  

They do not have a good system for oil changes - I have waited all day for an oil change more than once.  I have had conflicting information from different employees on scheduling appointments, and when I politely informed one of them, they acted like I was lying.  I agree with another post that sometimes it feels like they are working against you.  As a person myself employed in customer service I have to wonder how being against your customer can ever work for you.

On a positive note, they had the cheapest battery in the area (after checking several other stores, we ended up coming back there).  But my past few negative experiences there have overshadowed the positive ones.

All in all, after they were frustrating on the phone this morning (the oil change run around), I decided to pay a little extra and try Big O' Tires on Crimson.  Customer service was great and it was done over lunch.  I even used a coupon from their website.1677 W. Chandler Blvd.
Chandler, AZ 85224

After arriving home from working the night shift I heard a hissing sound in my garage. Closer investigation revealed a foreign object in one of my car's tires. Drove to the Discount Tire on Chandler Blvd. It was 7:00AM and they don't open until 8:00AM. I parked in front of one of the bay doors just before the tire went flat. At exactly 8:00AM the store opened and several minutes later I was approached by a sales associate. I explained my situation and asked that the tire be repaired. After removing a 6 inch bolt from my tire I was informed that the tire could not be repaired "because of previous improper repairs" made on the tire. (???) The tires were approaching the end of their life so I decided to purchase two new tires. The installation went smoothly. I inquired about the TPMS system (Tire Pressure Monitoring System) being reset and was assured that it had been taken care of. I drove home and everything seemed fine. A few days later a TPMS alarm light began illuminating on my dashboard indicating a problem with one of my tires. The display confirmed that there was no pressure reading from one of my tires. I manually checked all four tire pressures and narrowed the problem to one of the new tires. All four tires were properly inflated but one of the new ones was not sending it's signal to the Unit. Since I had been charged $20.00 for "TPMS rebuild kits" by Discount Tire I returned to the store. A technician brought out his little analyzer and made the light on my dash go out. All four tires were now sending their pressures to my display and the all was well with the world......for about a day and a half. Same problem; different "new" tire. Returned to the store after a few days and repeated the process, with a different technician. When I made the comment about being charged for the TPMS rebuild kits he told me that $20.00 charge was "obligatory"  with all new tire sales. He also suggested that I return my vehicle to the Dealer and inquire about have the system looked at if it was still under warranty.
Long store short.....the dash light came on a few days later and the problem persists.
I'm going to have the Dealer look into it at my next oil change. As for Discount Tire; they lost my future business due to their lack of concern for my problem, (a problem THEY initiated), lack of persistence in fixing it and an apparently bogus $20.00 charge for an "obligatory" TPMS rebuild kit.Stop in on a whim to pick up some pizzas. Got a specialty pizza and some honey hot wings. We even ended up getting a large cheese pizza for $2 since it was a mistake by the cook..so we walked away with a lot of food but were not that impressed. The wings were a huge disappointment for my lova' ( he is a wing man) and they did nothing for him. The pizza was good and settled our rumbling stomach pains but didn't eat leftovers and leftover pizza is one of my favs..for me to pass on it was a sad morning when i usually would have went for that cold pizza which of course, is breakfast of champions.

Wompwomp


p.s it is big inside..good for kids to be loud and run around..tvs and all that..but the food was just meh...The food was pretty good for BK.  The service was fast and the value menu has decent deals.  However my past two visits had errors though.  Fries rather than onion  rings last time, despite being clear.  I also asked ranch to go with my onion rings this time and they forgot that.

They'd have gotten 3 or 4 stars if they'd not left stuff out twice in a row.I reviewed this Ulta a few weeks ago and I visited again to give it another shot. 

I came in for a sale on NYX baked powder eyeshadows, which were about 40% off. Awesome....IF ONLY THEY HAD THE ITEMS IN STOCK. 

There are about 20 different shadows and I was only able to purchase 10 because all of the others were out of stock and/or damaged.

Next I went on to the NYX liquid liner. ALL OUT OF STOCK.

Maybelline eyeliner, OUT OF STOCK. Maybelline shadow combos, OUT OF STOCK. Almay shadow pallettes, OUT OF STOCK. Everything I came for!?

I asked the assistants walking around if they could check for stock and they said it was "stocked this morning"....even though there is no product. Then another assistant came up and said it hadn't been stocked but she wasn't willing to go look for me :(

How can this Ulta operate when everything is kept out of stock all the time?! This is extremely frustrating! 

I made my purchases, also purchased a large and heavy lighted mirror, which the cashier conveniently placed on top of my shadows in one bag. Seriously? I just got my bag home and 4 of them are cracked/powder is completely out of the socket. 

I am extremely frustrated. I've spent $520 there in the past two months and it is obviously unappreciated. I will stick with MAC from now on.Went once and never again! awful service and food mediocre.Store is clean, greeters are always nice and pleasant, but when it comes to the dressing room, it's terrible! It's always as if I have to beg to try on clothes. The attendant is almost never there, and when they are, they're in the corner not paying attention to customers walking in and out. Rep had her phone bulging in her back pocket, which is tacky in my opinion. There were about 5 people working out on the floor and one on the register. So while I had to witness one representative ring up all these guys clothes and then spend 10 minutes taking off the security tags I just dropped my clothes and walked away.I stopped in here to feed my enchilada-style burrito craving, something that should only be done at a small, hole-in-wall place serving Sonoran style food. Espo's fit the bill on that account, and it has gotten some good reviews recently so I decided to try it out after shopping at nearby Chandler mall.

Right off the bat, I noticed the place was kind of dirty. I wasn't expecting anything immaculate, but I've seen nicer Filiberto's. The tile floor badly needs a mopping.

My veggie burrito came out quickly and steaming hot. It was mostly a disappointment after that. First off, no sour cream or guacamole came with it which is my expectation for enchilada style. The red sauce was tasty with a very nice kick to it. I still added lots of salsa too which I also enjoyed. But there was way too much of the average tortilla, and the filling was a major letdown. Was I wrong to expect that a veggie burrito would contain veggies? Shredded iceberg doesn't count! The beans were too liquidy, and the rice had little flavor.

This place did nothing for me, but luckily there's plenty of other burritos in the sea.Not going to lie, was not super impressed.  

Used a yelp deal for breakfast, the lady who took our order then walked back and made the food.  

Feel like I could have made the food better at my house.  

Probably won't be coming back any time soon.  

Obnoxiously playing spongebob on the tv extremely loud, even though there were no kids there.$16 per adult is way overpriced. My wife and I went here for the "Chili and Pumpkin Festival." Just calling something a "festival" doesn't make it a festival. How is it a festival? There were very few pumpkins to choose from to take home and after paying $32 to get in, why am I paying another $10 for a pumpkin? Not to mention the $5 snow cone. It's price gouging galore at this place! Unless you like children's rides I don't see how this place is worth $32 for a couple, when you aren't likely to stay more than a couple of hours here.

On the positive side, it was a beautiful day and there were many nice photo opportunities to be had at the corn fields. I just don't see the justification in the amount of money they are charging. Perhaps if you had kids and you took them there for a half day it might be more reasonable. I did notice that the place was lousy with kids and teens. Not good for couples, however, other than picking up a pumpkin for Halloween (which you can do many places) and some nice photo ops.Unimpressed with the lack of attention and follow through of the employee in the guitar accessory area. Wasted over an hour of my time only to find out they didn't have the part in stock. I suggest you try Milano's Music in downtown Mesa instead - better selection and MUCH better service.First, I want to say from my experience, Chompie's food is very good. Not excellent, but very good.  The service, on the other hand was very poor.  Chompie's is a bit on the expensive side. If there service was good, I might accept that but with poor service, I can't give it higher than 2 stars. 

I went to the bakery during lunchtime on Sept. 13th. It was busy so I waited in line like everyone else. As I moved along in line I was asked for my order which included a few bagels, some cookies and a takeout sandwich.  So I'm pulled out of line by one lady who want to ring up my order at this cash register at the stat of the line, not at the end of the line where you usually pay.  I start to take out my wallet and she tells me credit card only, if I want to pay with cash,  I have to get back in line and wait for the OTHER cash register.  O.K. I give her my credit card to pay, but I'm thinking that was annoying. 

She tells me my takeout order will be ready soon. It was a simple bagel sandwich.  So I wait, and wait, and wait. 15 minutes later I ask the lady for the status of this, and it turns out the lady never sent the order to the kitchen so of course its not going to be done.  5 more minutes and its finally done.

They need to get a bit more organized and provide better service, or I can tell you I will never be back.  There are too many other good places around to deal with one that couldn't care less about my business.Ive been going to Randy's for years, ever since they were at the old place which is now a Safeway.   Needless to say I've had just about everything on their menu. Randy's used to be a reasonably priced restraunt with great food, but it has slowly turned into an over priced restraunt with smaller and smaller portions.  Breakfast is still a pretty good buy, but lunch and dinner are simply not.  I just came from Randy's and had the buffalo chicken salad like I have so many other times.  The salad was $8 and looked like an oversized side salad.  I have noticed this very same thing on many of there other meals.  I ve probably have had my last dinner at Randy's tonight but I may make another breakfast trip.  To end on a good note the servers are usually the best!Service was lacking!! Took forever for her to take our order. 
But the worst part was seeing the waitress behind the counter and lift her dress and pull her shorts down. There is a bathroom for this!! Then to not go and wash her hands GROSSThis is about 2 steps up from IHOP. If you're looking for a quick breakfast place to hit outside of the typical weekend brunch hours, it could suffice, but definitely do not stick around if there's a wait.Sometimes Active body has great things but nothing you can not find in other stores, In addition to poor customer service they are rude. Who needs that aggrivation.Went to the melting pot for my husband and I's wedding anniversary a few weeks ago. The service was good the food was tasty, but now I remember why we don't go very often ..because it is so darn expensive and you cook your own food!! It was nice to have the photo of us that they took as a memento, however that was the extent of the anniversary goodies. (They have an anniversary package that they make you pay extra for which we did not get). The restaurant was also super dark inside. Probably won't be going back anytime soon since our bill was well over $100.. Yikes..We found this little cafe by chance and actually had to come back to that side of town in order to check it out.  Service was quick and efficient and friendly until we told the young lady that the potatoe pancakes were not to our liking.  She offered mashed potatoes, telling the cook that she "had some unhappy campers and they need something else".  I had the marlin special which was great but the risotto was just nasty...mushy and not the taste I had expected.  My partner had the pot roast, which was very tender and good but we found that things were very salty.  We started with the trio plate that had hummus which was quite spicy and a great salsa and tomato-based tabbuoli.  We have to share that the worst part of our dining experience was watching and listening to the constant bing of the microwave oven, which is right there for all to see in the little serving window.  Really???  Why are you nuking things before serving?  We watched a pasta dish get zapped for several minutes, taken out, stirred, and slapped back in for another minute or so.As Chart House locations go, this one is hit & miss.  I've definitely had much better luck at the West coast spots such as Malibu, Redondo Beach and Lake Tahoe (on the Nevada side).  Anyway, the Prime Rib is usually outstanding at any Chart house, along with the bread, salads & desserts -- I'm going with two stars for the Scottsdale restaurant because of the service not being what it should compared to the others.  You usually can't go wrong for nice night out if you pick Chart House but in my experience, it seems the Scottsdale one can be 'hot or cold'.Excellent food. Poor service tonight as it's during Barrett Jackson auto show and place is slammed.This vet went downhill when all of the vets left a couple of years ago.  We really liked the vets they had, but had not so great experiences with the new vets.  The staff is really great, but a lot of them left as well.  When more than half the staff leave makes me wonder if there are some issues at the higher levels.I used to love this place. No more...

The pico de gallo used to win awards, but now it's bland. The guac is a version of the creamy goop you get in a bag from the super market... No thank you.

I'm a huge fan of pork flautas, but this came out as a gigantic thing that looked as if it were wrapped in some weird pastry batter. Didn't taste much better.

Looking for Mexican in Fountain Hills? Try something else.Slow service and way over priced. They didn't even use air freshener either. I will not be returning. It's unfortunate because the location is very convenient.I haven't been to Gameworks in about 5-6 years.  I remember the one in Michigan being a lot different.  I thought it was a pity when they closed but I think I see why after my visit here.  

Holy expensive!  I bought the deal on Groupon.  I thought a little over half off was a good deal!  $20 for a full day of games. (This is based on what we could play with the groupon) If I would have known that the place consisted of a high majority of extremely similar fighting games and racing games I would have probably passed.  Quite a few of the games either were broken or did not work at all.

The restaurant has good food. My better half was a little upset paid $9 for only 4 chicken fingers, but they were tasty nonetheless. 

I'm not impressed, they have nothing there that would convince me to go again.This place sucks.

Now I understand that's not the most helpful assessment, so I'll elaborate to save you from ending up at this crap hole should you think, "Oh Erica, you must have just been cranky that day!" Not so.

It all started when I had a craving for hummus earlier this week. I work too far from just about every hummus slinging place in Tempe but Byblos. So I decided to try something new, and was left with a sour taste in my mouth.

First off, the place is located in a shitty plaza of decaying shops (home to the Yucca Tap Lounge if that's any indication) and it's right next door to a Mexican food restaurant that I've never seen anyone enter or leave, so it looks like a front for some shady 'business' dealings. But my craving would not be deterred by a craptastic plaza, after all, Capistrano's is in the same plaza and it's delicious. Looks aren't everything. Hummus would be had.

We enter. It's empty and dumpy looking. The only people here have a mean age of 70. We significantly bring this average down. Waaaay down. We are escorted to a table and peruse the menu. The server (I assume it's the unfriendly server you had, Kelly B., because he looked like he had a stick up his ass that had been festering there for the past 60 years) took our drink orders and came back with two itsy bitsy little cups. Seriously? You're going to charge me 2.50 for six ounces of lemonade? We order. He frowns for the umpteenth time in our short interaction and waddles off to the kitchen. The food arrives.

The hummus was straight up GROSS, and the pita bread was shockingly similar to cardboard. The hummus tasted sour with a texture that was a combination between chalk and paste. If I can corner a five year old, I'm going to conduct a taste test between the two substances and see if there's any discernable difference. My money's on no. The presentation was nice, with pickles, tomatoes, olive oil and parsley, but if I wrap a piece of dried up dog shit in ribbons and bows, your gift would still be a piece of dried up dog shit. Maybe you could use it as a paper weight? 

The tomato soup that came along with lunch was pretty decent,and the gyro meat was well spiced. But the fact that my gyro was wrapped in the aforementioned cardboard pita bread was really unappetizing. It's like they took rock hard, stale pita bread, heated it in the microwave to make it pliable, molded it and let it cool in its rigid formation. 

So if you're 70 and your senses are slowly numbing, you might like this place. Other than that, stay away. It's unwelcoming and unappetizing. The antithesis of what a restaurant should be. Let it slowly decay along with the rest of the shops lining this creepy little plaza at the corner of Mill and Southern.The employees were all very welcoming and acknowledging. The downside was communication amongst employees was awful! 

I had issues with an immediate entrance door not reading my room card, but it could open the door to the next level, although miniscule it was a huge inconvenience. I contacted engineering 3 times with no rersponse until the 3rd time when their was a card left in my room stating "the problem with: your AC has been resolved." There was nothing wrong with my AC!

Secondly, the woman answering the room calls was short and rude with a bad attitude.

And finally, I left a book in the room, I had to call 3 times to get a response whether housekeeping found the book. Once they did a young man called and wrote my information to send me the book. Two days later, I receive a phone call for shipping department asking me if they had the book, are you kidding me?!Went to this place for dinner after reading the reviews. Not what I am looking for as far as Chinese food is concerned for my taste.  Portions were decent but lacked taste.  Will not return as there are better places out there for me.Kohl's is like any other department store really.. the deals are great and the store is usually kept up. The only reason this review is receiving two stars is the lack of customer service I have received the past experience. 

I was there with my mom a week before Black Friday and found some boots that I liked, my mom as well liked the same pair. I grabbed size and was trying to find hers however they were not stocked so we locate a employee and my mom says "Excuse me, could you help me out?" Couple minutes go by the lady either A. didn't hear us B. ignored us or C. didn't understand what my mom was saying (complicated question i know) So again, my mom nicely asks the same employee, "Do you mind assisting me?" and the lady grunts and her! Yes, GRUNTS. I was taken back and tried myself. As I'm holding the boot showing it to her I said "Excuse me, I would like to find this boot in a size six, there are none on the floor" She looks up at me and waddles off to the display section, as she turns I say, "Ma'am the display is in my hand, the number you need is here." She keeps walking.... So i just wait for her to come back. She comes back and says "No size six:" I responded, "I understand that, what i'm asking is if you can check in back". So she goes and checks in back.. "No six".. Okay fine. My mom and I thank her and go over to the kiosk... Get all the way down the the check out section and tried to apply a coupon and the machine freezes so of course we find another employee to assist us and our luck again, a cranky old woman lets out a big sigh after we asked for help and says "I don't know how to work these things".... WHAT- you have a machine in your store you can't even function? AT ALL? So she stands there and pouts and watches myself figure the stupid machine and says "Yeah these break all the time".... WHAT... At this point steam is pushing out of my ears... IF your employees can't help your customers why are they there? Why hire old hags that get overwhelmed by doing their JOB? Mind boggling to me... needless to say we got the boots with the assistance of no one and went on our merry way.I consider just going to a different cox store. I know that their customer service on the phone is excellent. But whenever it comes time for me to pay the Cox bill, their bill paying machine is ALWAYS down. 

The seriously need another location in the north valley, because I'm always waiting atleast 20m to pay a bill. I go to United Beauty Supply two doors down while I wait. 

The staff can also be rude. I've had great experiences and horrible experiences. They're not really informative about anything. If you ask a question, they ask a counter question. Example: Yesterday I went to pay a bill, and I said, "Can you put me on the list, there are atleast 25 people here, I'm just going to run next door for a second." "Are you leaving?" STOP. ANSWERING. QUESTIONS. WITH QUESTIONS! He didn't give me an estimate after that. And it was honestly a 20m wait. There were people lined up outside of the store, that's how crowded it was, no joke!Ive seen better stocked Walmart in my time.... Ive been to this location a lot do to location and it seems as if i want something there always out of it.... anywhere from food to car parts... pretty annoying... staff is friendly though.... also there's no tire and lube place here but that's all rightOk, the first thing I am going to say is something positive...because I have been told to find the positive things in life...I focus too much on the negative.

Their cornbread was friggin amazing.

Whew, now I got that out of the way.  Now I can go on with my happy self and tell you why this place is lucky it is getting 2 stars  (and really it is only because my cousin had something nice to say also)

The story goes...I never experienced such horrible customer service in my life.  My cousin was in town from Michigan and loves the show "Drive-in's, Diners, and Dives" (is that the right order?)  and heard about this place so we just had to go.  (My grandparents mentions Bill Johnson's Big Apple, but I said I would just go home if they were going to go there.)  So Aaron and I ordered our entrees with a salad, and my grandfather order his entree with chili.  (Grandma doesn't eat much...)  Aaron also ordered fried dill pickles for an appetizer.  (Note: My grandma and I wanted a baked potato that on the menu said that are availabe after 5pm but the waitress said they wouldn't be ready until 5:30pm)  Aaron and I got our salads...and Aaron asked about the pickles..."Oh, they are cooking them now."  Ok...so then my grandpa asked for his chili, which should have came out with our salads, and the waitress replied "Listen, I have other tables that have orders also.".  Wow....I even replied, "Are you serious?" 

So besides that, I found the decor a little nauseating (how many pink pigs do I need to see and why are they seriously playing "Babe" on the TV?  Like I want to eat pork now)  The food was so so...cousin said that his ribs were cooked just right, but the sauce was too sweet to his liking.  Grandparents thought that their sandwiches were too big.  I thought that my mashed potatoes had a funky flavor too them.

So with the review of the ribs and their awesome cornbread (which I ordered a 2nd helping of) I give it 2 stars.  

Where oh where can I find some awesome barbeque????I've eaten here before, and it's never been great, but NEVER has it been this bad. 

The first thing I want to mention, is that I have very little tolerance for heat. As in, their regular salsa that comes with the chips is on the 'just-a-bit-to-warm' side.

Started the night with mini-chimis. These were OK texture wise, but a small dip into the sour cream obliterated all pretense of flavor.

My Grande Margarita arrived sans alcohol. I didn't order a virgin, but there was either no alcohol in it or so little that there was no sign of buzz on a 6 hour empty stomach.

I ordered the Carne Asada, which normally comes with salsa and hatch chilies. I asked for them to hold the hatch, however a few bites into it - when it finally came out -  the intense heat hit me. I rolled back the cheese on top to see a healthy serving of hatch underneath. Yeah, no. Half my virgin Grande Margarita later and the heat finally started to subside. To boot, the steak had been boiled and over cooked. When we informed the waiter, he was very apologetic and removed it from the bill.

My partner ordered the white sands chimichunga with a side of hatch. (yeah he's a heat nut) Since it's fried and smothered with sauce, it was fairly obvious that it had been sitting awhile given it's sogginess, lack of temp and the beginnings of film on the cheese.

My son's grilled cheese and fries were hot. (painfully hot actually)

The waiter was nice but food was poor and service was very slow, which is why I'm listing at 2 stars.

If you MUST have Arribas, spend the gas and head to the one in Scottsdale.I stayed at this Hotel on 10/8.  We checked in about 3am, after almost falling asleep at the wheel.  I was advised the cost of the room was $69 + taxes, but when we went to check out they had added on an additional $32. not advising me of the charges.  It wasnt until I looked at my bank statement did I see the charges.  While we slept someone broke into our truck and stole a very expensive printer and the clerk refused to look at the camera to see who it might of been that stole it.  I called the owner Mr Shamsher Singh and  he advised me I had signed for the extra charges one being the charge for having pets in the room. And also told me he wasnt responsible for the theift. At check in I was never advised of the charges nor was I asked if I had pets.  I feel its the responsiblity of the check in clerk to advise the customer of the charges before they sign the papers.We loved this place a few years ago, but great food is on the menu but exiting the kitchen. Both of us here and I eat alone.Paid $100 bucks for a one night stay.  The full sized beds were TINY.  Two grown people most definitely do NOT sleep or fit comfortably!!  Breakfast was decent. They offer waffles, cereal, juices & milk, some fruit, boiled eggs, yogurt, bagels or bread for toasting.   The pool was nice as well as the pool area itself.  The location is pretty centralized to a ton of restaurants, sports complex, and shopping.Have been going to the place since it opened in the 90's.  Over the past few years the service has really taken a dive at this location. 

It seems to me that this bad service is not the fault of the wait staff, but more the fault of whoever is managing this place.  The wait staff is always running around frantically trying to tend to all of their tables. It is apparent that the place is chronically understaffed or whatever workflow they have is not effective. 

If you do have the patience to through the process of getting the waiter's attention, and ordering drinks, and waiting for bread that is almost always "in the oven", waiting to order desert, and waiting for the check, the food isn't that bad.Not good at all  I got a grilled chicken burrito the chicken was so much fat I will not go backI've been to many Ulta's and this one was by far the worst I've ever been to. The place was so unorganized they didn't have many products that I was looking for and when I asked one of the employees she told me they had been out for a month and wasn't able to tell me when they would be getting new shipment in. The employee didn't seem to know where anything was either . They mostly were all chit chatting instead of helping customers. I definitely won't be going back to this Ulta.Attended the 15th anniversary and had a mixed experience.  How can you knock 15 cent beer, pizza and wings?  I can't, especially when the beer is pretty damned good.  Now the bad news...the service.  I was standing in line at the beer stand near the sports book.  I didn't mind waiting because they were fairly busy due to the cheap prices.  As I got to the front, I was second in line.  The guy behind me asked the guy pouring the beer a question and to my surprise the server asked him what he wanted and helped him.  The lady in front of me turned and said "I guess we wasted our time standing in line."  The other server, a blond lady finally helped us.  When it was my turn, I ordered 4 beers.  She told me that she could only give me 2.  That would be fine except that 2 out of the 3 people in front of me were served 3 each by her.  I only remember that because I was trying to figure out how to carry 4 and was watching how they carried their 3.  If the rule is 2 per customer, fine, but don't arbitrarily enforce the rules.  It made me feel discriminated against and irritated me the rest of the night.  I hadn't been in there for years but was enjoying my night.  In an instant, it turned and now I won't be back over something that could have been avoided.Played black jack.  I put $20 near betting spots, Double Deck, for dealer to change. He dealt right past my money.  I put the money down while he shuffling.
Left that table and went to a BJ shoe game.  Deal never smiled or said a word.  Would never play BJ here again.  Got the feeling my business was not, in the least, appreciated.
Wanted to play poker, but it doesn't open till 6pmAs far as Chipotle overall goes, 2 of these stars go simply towards that.  Taste of food +1, service overall -1 (yes, it's that bad).  If this wasn't the closest one to my house I would definitely stop going.

They have screwed up my order more times than gotten it right -- and this is from ordering online, where they have a physical piece of paper directing them what to put into it.  Several times I've ordered online and come to the restaurant at the pick-up time given on the site and come to find out they haven't even MADE my order yet.  Not terrible since it's fresh but why bother putting a pick-up time?  They weren't even busy either.

I think this location just has a lot of lazy employees.  Food quality is still good in comparison to other Chipotle restaurants, but perhaps speaking slowly and clearly would be ideal when placing an order.

If ordering online, it's a mixed bag.  Sorry.First of all I love Chipotle. Eat there several times a week. This location however disappoints me. They are slow and rushed to make every order.

Today takes the cake. I should have paid attention to how they put my bowl in the bag because sideways equals a soaked bag  and car seat when I finally got home. The Las Vegas Boulevard location is way better.Where do I start. Well first off the receptionist at the front did not want to be there. She never gave me eye contact. In fact she continued to gossip with the people around her while blindly handing me things to fill out. Very cold. Next when I was finally called to the back, the lady was getting irritated at the fact I wanted to see the difference between 1 & 2. I mean common! Rude and cold again. I waited for the doctor to come in, he told me my prescription and when I asked how it was that my left eye was worse than my right when I could clearly see better out of me left he jumped around the question and left. It seemed as though he just wanted me out. At the checkout area, the woman spent the majority of the time on the phone with a friend and every time she looked up she remarked "she use to work here." I'm sitting there thinking to myself this is unbelievable. She's on the phone having a conversation while I'm waiting to be checked out. The staff was very unprofessional. The only good thing about the place was on lady who ran after me to give me a pair of contacts. She was more help in answering my questions than the doctor or any of the others in the back. She is the only reason they get 2 stars and not one.What a let down. This place looked promising when we arrived at 2am and there was still a wait.. 

Shrimp spring rolls: http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=9sd-x39edTuwg0Fvz3hZhw&userid=rMRSt0r8q0AvpUllXgrH2w
Decent. The rice paper was fresh and super soft.. Dipping sauce was made with the right amount of peanut butter/hoisin sauce. Nothing amazing, but it was good.

Vermicelli with charbroiled chicken and egg rolls: http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=nzg_OREoJBP_6vMKY156AQ&userid=rMRSt0r8q0AvpUllXgrH2w
I'm going to be honest.. This was probably one of the worst vermicelli dishes I've ever had (and I've had this dish at many restaurants). The chicken lacked flavor.. It didn't have that Vietnamese "charbroiled" taste. And more importantly, the fish sauce was bland!! It didn't taste right.. almost as if it was watered down or they didn't make it correctly. I ate 1/4th of the bowl and ended up wasting the rest of it.

My friends ordered the pho and porridge, and they also left more than half of their food because it just wasn't good. Maybe because we're spoiled with Viet food from Garden Grove? Who knows. Oh, and service here does not exist.. Typical for an Asian restaurant I guess. 

Note: The Yelp hours are wrong! They're open 24 hours.Food: 3 stars, service: 2 stars, price: 3 stars.

The food was decent. Compared to our izakaya & yakitori experiences, this was a disappointment. We tried most of recommended dishes: breaded calamari, breaded octopus, yellowtail tar tar, breaded quail eggs, braised pork belly, Kim Chi fried rice, beef tongue & chicken skewers, and miso black cod. We attempted to try their honey toast.
There were no real "wows" in our meal. The best dishes were the cod, tar tar, and Kim chi fried rice.

As for the service, I was very unhappy since the beginning. We mentioned to the host that we were in a hurry and trying to get our friends to the airport. He insisted it will only be a 10 wait minute. Well we waited 20min. Once seated, our dishes were dirty. Even though there were 4 of us, only 3 plates, bowls, waters were served. Then lastly, we ordered the "recommended" dessert, honey toast. But after 10 minutes, we were starting to think they forgot and upon inquiring, we realized that they didn't even put in the order and it was going to take another 10-15 minutes to finish. I'm sorry but did we say we were in a hurry. 

I like the idea of late dining options here, but I will definitely not be returning due to the poor service and mediocre dishes.Ate here the other weekend with family.  The atmosphere was nice.  Felt like oldtime Vegas and our server was good.  So, one star for that.
And one star for the Apple martini... the best part of my meal!
I ordered the veal parmesan and it was dry and a dinner salad that was swimming in dressing.  My bf order the ravioli and it was fried (what the heck?).   For the cost of this meal, I would rather have gone to the roulette wheel and bet all on green 0.The small restaurant was cute, the service was good not great the $5.00 breakfast was ok and the reason it was okay is because it hash brown were the pre packaged, pre cooked type (McDonald's hash-browns) yet our wait time was inexcusable because all that had to be cooked were the eggs. (You need to know that we were the only customers at the time that we ordered).  

The music at night sounded great, this is a place I will visit again because the hotel was great and the price was great.Ok, this store has a great selection of products.....however, the service here sucks, which is why I gave it 2 Stars.  I would have given it 1 Star but the selection of products bumped it up to 2 Stars.

Was shopping with my son for a pair of shoes and had to ask for assistance.  There were 3 people working within 10 feet of us and none of them came up to ask us if we needed any help.  Meanwhile, my son was trying on shoe after shoe.....he tried over 10 pairs of shoes and still no help from anyone.

We finally found a pair he liked and went to pay for it.  It was about 30 minutes until closing and there was a line of about 20 people and 4 cashiers.  When we got to the front of the line, I could hear one of the cashiers say really loud to another...."Damn, where the hell did all this customers come from?!  Don't they have better things to do?".....now, she said this with contempt in her voice.  Clearly she wanted to go home right at closing, but with a store full of customers and a long line of PAYING customers, it was cutting into her free time.

That comment made me sick......in today's economy, she should be happy that they had a long line of people at the cash register!  Ungrateful.....she doesn't understand the value of a customer.

Based on her comments & the lack of customer service from the 3 lazy people who was near us and didn't offer help.....I've determined that it's not a one-off situation, but a regular problem with this store.  Clearly they don't know how to service customers.

I wish my son would have found something he wanted at the Adidas store....they were very friendly and helpful.

Will I return?  ~with a frustrated voice~ Only because there aren't more options for Nike Outlet Stores.....just the one on the South End of the Strip, which is inconvenient for me.First off let me state, I really wanted to give this place more stars, but try as I might, I just can't. 

The servings were plentiful, they skimp on nothing. The dishes were spicy, but not hot, just the way I like it. 

I'm thinking the cook had an off day. I'm hoping the cook had an off day. 

The place is really, really quiet. It almost feels deserted. And the fans cause this strobe affect that makes it difficult to focus, let alone read the menu. The server was very nice and friendly. Unfortunately he wasn't very well-versed with the ingredients and we spent time going back and forth from the table to the kitchen and back. It has a large, distracting TV as well. 

The Fried Spring Rolls we got were over cooked and appeared dark and tasted slightly burnt. The filling inside was overcooked and slightly greasy as well. Not off to a great start here. At least the weren't served at a scorching 250 Degrees like most places.

The Hung Ley we go with pork ( a nod to Dan on the suggestion ). It was not what I was expecting in a good sorta way and overly strong in a bad sorta way. I liked the deep, smokey flavors. But they came on a bit strong as the pork was a bit dry. But the sauce was complex in an earthy way that wasn't like mushrooms. We went a three and it was just right.

The Kang Pa ( Jungle Curry ) which was our mutually agreed upon favorite dish. Bright. Lemony. Spicy. The curry was delicious and accentuated the sharp crispness of the peppers, green beans, and other veggies very nicely. We are going to try this cold, as we think it could work well just as well. We got our spoons crossed. We went a three and it tasted like it was spiced twice as much. Careful, this is a naturally spicy dish to begin with.

Drunken Noodles do not do well if they are slightly burnt. This dish suffered all way round because of this. It tasted as if it could have been so much better if it just wasn't slightly burnt. This was ordered at a four.. But this time it could have used a six, at least.

So, true to my curmudgeonly ways, I have to lay it out and sock it to 'em. Not my favorite Thai place by far. I may give another chance here because I taste promise, but two is all you get.I came here a week ago and bought a banana cream pie. When I got home and cut up the pie, I discovered that it was a lemon pie disguised as a banana pie!  I came back today to buy a real banana pie and also let the manager know what happened. He did nothing about it. I'm annoyed and done with this place. There are too many good places with great customer service to be putting up with this bull. Had he apologized, I wouldn't be ranting like this. But to tell me they look a lot alike and expect me to accept that? No thanks. See ya, Marie! This replacement I purchased better be the real deal.Olive Garden "jumped the shark" years ago.  They are a drain on the income of the company that owns them because they can't justify the prices they charge, thus less people are going in year after year.  The food is bland and overpriced, example, $13.00 for spaghetti and meatballs, $16 for lasagna????  Your food better be damn good at those prices, and Olive Garden is not even close.  There are so many restaurants that have better food and lower prices in Vegas that it's just a matter of time before Olive Garden is no more....one caveat:   the servers are really good, they try their best to do everything right, I can't fault them for the company's food and pricing problems.**Review only on the Horchatta***

Came here drunk one night during our spring break vacation. It was kind of hard to find since our GPS lead us to an apartment complex. We finally managed to find it after we got out of the apartment complex...it's literally in front of that and next to a gas station. 

We went to the Drive-Tru and I ordered the small Horchatta and my girlfriend got the 2 enchiladas. She did say they were good but they FORGOT to put forks and spoons into her bag so she had to eat it with her hands and use the sauce container cover to scoop up the sauce.

My horchata was cheap and delicious...very refreshing and cinnamony. It was a little to sweet for my liking so I couldn't finish it all but it was still pretty good.I have to start off by saying this restaurant is visually very appealing, but when the food arrives it's like finding out Santa is not real- every time. Seriously, the salsa was so watered down I bet a baby could drink it out of a bottle and not flinch. Super Mex, I want to love you. Your prices are really reasonable, the staff friendly, but it all comes down to the undesirable food. Here's the scoop on what I've tried:
Chicken Chimichanga-  Now the meat is moist and flavorful, but the burro doesn't seem crispy enough and the toppings are bland. Even trying to put everything on my plate on my fork at once cannot save this dish.
Guacomole- I had everyone at the table try this and we agree this cannot be fresh. It tastes just as watered down as the salsa!
Steak Fajitas- Chewy meat chunks, but good veggies
Cheese Enchilada- This was the only selection I mildy enjoyed. Snaps for that Super Mex
Overall, what is a Mexican restaurant without a decent salsa and guacamole? Simply not a fan, amigo.Talk about bait and switch. Ads said prime rib dinner $9.99, steak and lobster dinner $11.99, steak and sea food dinner $13.99, etc. So we show up ask for the prime rib dinner, no prime rib dinner here, it's at the buffet... Strike one.  Ok steak and lobster dinner $11.99 ... It's not available until 8pm. Strike two.  Ok, steak and sea food dinner $13.99 ...  We'll that's part of the early bird special.. It's 6 pm - strike three -your out!  No early bird, no late bird, no prime rib. We end up having the queen cut prime rib and the chef's special, orange roughy. This included a soup/salad and bread.  Overall the prime rib was ok a bit over cooked. The roughy was good, although the orange flavor was a bit much after awhile. Bottom line: food was ok but the price was a bit much for what we received. Hoping for the special and getting an overprice meal doesn't give you a good taste in the overall experience.We checked out this place because we heard about their bottomless margaritas, and my wife was in the mood to get her margarita on.  We were very optimistic, but were ultimately disappointed in our visit.

Drinks:  The margaritas were fine, but the refills on them were VERY slow to come.  This was a Sunday night, and not very busy, so I was disappointed at this.  


Food:  We ordered a queso fundido for an appetizer. It was fine, but not as "dip-py" as I was expecting -- I was hoping for more of a cheese dip, not just melted cheese, which quickly congealed, and was hard to get on the chips after five minutes.  I ordered fajitas, and they were pretty tasty, standard, no complaints.  My wife ordered a chimichanga, one of her Mexican favorites, and was very disappointed to find it not at all crunchy/crispy, but more soggy.  Very disappointing.

Overall Service: Aside from the margarita slow down, the rest of the service was also very slow -- timing of courses lagged, and for a slow night, the food came out very slow.  Most Mexican places we've been to are MUCH faster.  The water lady was VERY prompt, and came by many times, and that was great.  My wife drinks VERY fast, and we rarely had an empty water glass. It's too bad that lady wasn't in charge of refilling margaritas.

We would give the food 2.5 stars, and the service 2 stars.  The price isn't that great for a Mexican place off-strip in Vegas, and there are a lot more authentic places with reasonable prices and better service.I used to love this place a lot. They're a bit on the expensive side, but the pizza was great. Not NY pizza great, but great for what it was. I picked up a pie on Tuesday (6/2/09) and it was devoid of flavor. Not the first time this happened. What makes a pizza place great in my opinion is consistency. I've dined in a few times and the staff seemed annoyed and came off as rude.
I'm officially done with Northside Nathans.We have brought our previous dog there and we had a good experience, the vet that took care of him was thorough of what was going on with our dog. The next pet we brought there didnt seem like she cared. When it came to talk about the bill she seemed more interested in that. When they called us that our dog will be discharged that day, the vet wasnt even there to talk about his aftercare on how we should take care of him at home. Anyway, we took him home and the next morning he passed. We have paid alot of money to them but they have not gave good treatment to our boy. I felt that the vet who so-called took care of our pet, took advantage of us.This has gone from being the best Starbucks in Las Vegas to one of the worst. 

The service tends to be on the rude side these days. 

They close extremely early. While most Starbucks close at 10, this place closes like at 7 or 8. 

There is never any tables open if you want to use the wifi. The same people loiter here all day long, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. 

My last drink here tasted like some guy  grabbed a stale cookie, crushed it in the palm of his hand, and dropped it into water mixed with chocolate syrup. It didn't even taste like coffee. 

There is no such thing as half n half here. 

It's so loud in here that you have to scream in order for the barista to hear you. 

It's so loud in here that you won't hear the barista scream your name when your drink is ready. 

There is a group  of middle-age men who sit outside with their puppies in order to get the attention of cutie-pie teenage girls. These guys have been doing this for so long that the puppies are now full grown dogs. 

Also remember how this is Summerlin so everyone acts like they are 11 years old. They will complain about every little thing. If you are standing in line, the guys behind you will constantly keep bitching about how they hate waiting in line. This happens at every Summerlin business I go to. Why are Summerlin folks so impatient? 

The parking lot in this particular area of the shopping center is very cramped. Either these people drive really bad or they are confused and think that this Starbucks has a drive-thru. I don't know how many times I narrowly avoided death in this parking lot.  

These days I go to the Starbucks in Centennial near Floyd Lamb Park. The internet is much quicker, and they close at 10.Today is the final straw. First I would like to add, I love working out and finding a decent, convenient location to work out at is a plus in my book. That is the only reason why I go to this location. Furthermore, I would like to say, that the staff not all, but mostly, is very fucking rude. The reason why I say (that actually two people), is rude, is because I shouldn't have to put a lot of energy into actually acknowledging my presence. "Such as saying hello". 

 I'm not the type of person that really feeds into negative people's energy normally but when you're having a bad day and someone is working in customer service, the last thing you expect is bad customer service in a customer service field. 

 One in particular, this "girl", not a grown woman, always has an attitude.  A few months ago, I actually engaged into making a conversation with her. Just so I knew, that maybe it wasn't me that she always had an attitude with or thinking it it was something that I did to her. And even then, she acted like she had an attitude, like she didn't want to be bothered. Her excuse was as I was being cordial with her, "are you having a bad day" and in response "I'm just a little tired". So I said to myself, okay just let it roll off. 

  But then everyday after that the same cold nonresponsive attitude. She doesn't even say hello at all she looks the other way or looks down. Then I started noticing some others that she worked with acting the same way. (As if they had a little click against me.) 

  Like I said before I'm a very laid-back, and I just kind of keep to myself. So I don't understand what's going on at this location. So if anybody experiences the same thing, please let me know. I don't like taking things personal but it's a shame that I have to go to a different location where people actually have common decency and respect for each other at a different location. 

I gave this two stars because, a person can really make or break the environment with their attitude and energy. The place can be in immaculate shape and clean and all that. Which this place isn't always clean and decent and I pretty much ignore it. But the energy here, always weighs me down at this place. Then you start noticing when people, like to shit literally, in the showers and other things that isn't wiped down properly, etc.

So there you go. My epic review and all truth. Good luck to all.It's actually very hard to review this hospital fairly with one rating because one aspect of the visit was HORRIBLE and the other aspect of the visit was the total opposite. I am basing my star rating on my ER experience because I'm guessing that is more of what people would check reviews for.

The ER situation is atrocious. I've been in the hospital a LOT in my lifetime (unfortunately). I've lived in several states, experienced ERs in both private and public hospitals and I have NEVER had a wait as long as I did here. There was zero privacy for triage, there were absolutely not enough seats in the waiting areas and they had people who had been seen brought back out to continue waiting (I'm assuming for test results?) in the waiting room - some in hospital gowns, others in wheelchairs... who wants to be sitting half naked in a freezing waiting room??? I was in the waiting room for over three hours. At NO point in that time did anyone make an attempt to come out and perhaps look at disinfecting/cleaning after patients who had come and gone. I was not in with any time of infectious or contagious disease but there were people coughing, both adults and children vomiting into plastic bags all over the waiting room... who wants to sit in those seats after that?? The whole process is frustrating. You stand around waiting for someone to take your name. Then you wait to see triage. Then you wait SOME MORE to see someone in registration. Then - you guessed it - more waiting to see a doctor finally. 

Once I DID finally get into the actual ER, I was kept overnight and every single nurse and doctor I interacted with other than one was extremely kind and caring. The one nurse who was the exception seemed to hate his life - I could hear him complaining about the staff, the hospital, all of it, from my room. But everyone else was truly a blessing who made a horrible situation for me much more comfortable and I felt they really did care. 

Overall the medical staff at the hospital was fantastic. But if I ever had to go to the ER again, I highly doubt I would return here.Are you serious?  Hooters sold enough hot wings to open a Hotel/ Casino/ Hooters?  Well, they hired enough *ahem* talent  to pawn off their mediocre wings across the country.  Gotta admit though that they have some hot waitresses here.  Food still sucks.  Might as well enjoy the view while I choke down the food.So, a Hooter's in Las Vegas would be really over the top, right?  The Nexus of Sin meets The Strip Mall Equivalent, should be antimatter versus matter in a no-hold's-barred test of tits, right?

Boring, incompetent staff, stupid wait for a seat at the bar... but A-plus on tolerance and good-humor.  They dealt with a real winner at one end of the bar who, in Jersey, gets thrown out with a smack upside the head.  It's nice to see people being nice to stupid animals.

The burger was good, actually not a bad place for cheaper eating options but I'd be inclined to skip it, and it ranks low against other incarnations of the franchise.

-CBad #1 Check-in.  had no idea how to enter our reservations in computer,  so we could get our vouchers for free breakfast and so we never got it.   #2 Dirty halls and unmaintained guest rooms. #3 Different drink prices thru same hotel all run by hooters. #4 No free internet. #5 One pool is ice cold. #6 Does not follow up on complaints. #7 No one wins at slot machines. #8 Ghetto towels for pool so you don't steal them. #9. Parking garage is just filthy. #10.  There is no manager it just runs itself!

Good #1 Security.  #2 Price of room when on special. # 3 Good music outside at the one heated pool. #4 Lots of Hooter girls #5 Onion restaurant specials and service  Note: Will probably never go back. Worth the extra money to go elsewhere.As mentioned before, the girls who work here are overwhelmed.slow service, drinks kinda crappy.food was ok and tables are run down and shoddy.Tasty pizza, but hardly supreme.

We ordered a 12 inch thick crust double bacon cheeseburger pizza, and paid about $15. The crust was thick, soft and tasty, but the sauce seemed to be straight tomato paste with no seasonings aside from an excessive amount of oregano. They were stingy on the meat, to the point that we had to hunt for the bacon and even the hamburger seemed overwhelmed by the flavors of oregano and pickles (yes, they put pickles on their cheeseburger pizza).

I enjoyed the food, but there are a lot of pizza places in Madison, and you can get better food for less at most of them.Great location and staff, average to below average rooms. I think it was clean?Walk-in humidor was well-stocked though I did not detect the familiar "closeness" that a humidor's humidifier creates. A broad selection of top brands was available. Prices ranged from about $5 a stick (for low-end brands) to about $18/stick for top of the line stuff. The median price range was about $7 to $10. The staff seemed cordial though a bit distracted and not particularly helpful. I would probably only resort to this shop on a "plan B" basis.There is only one reason to bother coming to Chin's: the cream cheese puffs.

If you get anything else, you're wasting your money. I'm not saying this because "It's not authentic Asian!"--I'm saying this because the flavors are generally bland, the food is generally overcooked (or has been every time I've been here), and the food tastes real bland and repetitive after the third bite.

Otherwise, as others have mentioned, you can get better American-Chinese elsewhere and for cheaper. But if you want the real-deal kind of Asian food, Fugu is the one. Normally, I wouldn't suggest going to other places, but Chin's is such a rip-off compared to other places.

However, I will say this: Chin's has a very neat ambiance and the setting itself is much nicer than any of the other Asian food places on or near State St.Based on the food alone, this place would be 4 stars based on what we had today.
We were in town over the weekend, and breakfast is my favorite meal of the day.  My boyfriend googled and this place popped up on the Madison Better Breakfast Bureau (what a fantastic idea, by the way) -  so based on the ratings on that site and yelp, I was SUPER excited to eat there.
So why such a low rating?  I really hated the set up.  It was this morning (Sunday) so I knew it was going to be crowded.  I thought it would be like a normal restaurant where you go, wait an excruciating amount of time for a table, and then sit down and have some time to look over the menu, decide what to get, and order.  No. That is not how it works... I felt very rushed the entire time I was there.  I felt as though I had 25 seconds to look at the menu.  Order, get a number and sit at a table and wait for the food.
The coffee is self serve (which is not the part that is the problem) but is  in such an inconveniently located place directly next the to the cash register that it is super crowded, you can't get refills because the crazy line is ALWAYS in front of it.  And I'm sorry, but if I'm paying $2.25 for a "bottomless" cup of coffee, that means I want a refill.  And I was under the impression the term "bottomless" stems from a waitress coming over and refilling your cup before you see the bottom... Anyway - no way to get refills of your coffee... Moving on - 
I was also sitting at a table directly near the coffee station, and where the food comes up from the kitchen (and also located directly next to the seats where people who have already ordered and are waiting for tables are sitting).  My chair was bumped no less than 30 times by people walking back and forth (staff and customers alike).  
Now - about the people waiting for tables - I am eating my breakfast.  I do NOT want you staring down at me because you have already ordered and are waiting for your food.  It makes me feel uncomfortable, and made me eat faster, and not really enjoy my meal.   That is not their fault, but rather the fault of the set up of the restaurant.  Perhaps you should not have people order food before they definitely have a table.  
Overall, it was just very odd.  I would definitely not return based on the set up..  The food was great (Ham and Gruyere Omelet for me, Chorizo scrambler for boyfriend).Was looking forward to celebrating a new job with dinner here.
The food was great but the service was awful. We waited over ten minutes just for our waiter to come to the table. He didn't introduce himself or offer anything (drink/menu specials, etc) but he did make an excuse that it was really busy (on a Tuesday with four empty tables around us). He took our orders and said he'd be back with bread. He took another ten minutes to bring bread and drinks. When we were done eating, he came by to see if we needed a box. When he brought back the check, he left it on the table and ignored us for 20 minutes. We tried flagging him, telling him we were ready  and I finally had to stand up to stop him from ignoring our table again. We watched and listened as he talked to the elderly couple behind us, offering up the specials and explaining dishes to them. He literally ignored our attempts to stop him and several times turned and walked away! 
Really disappointing.I learned about Bluephies from a food blog I frequent that is written by a Madison resident. She gave it such good reviews, and after looking at their website I was sold!

I came here on a double date with my boyfriend and another couple and we were seated right away. Service was a little slow, but we were having a great time so it didn't matter. I ordered a black bean burger and was super excited to try the specialty tater tots. I paid an extra fee to get them and they arrive and there is....4 freaking tots on a plate?! I could have had fries for no extra charge, but 4 FLIPPING tots are going to cost extra?! I was incredibly disappointed. 

Dessert saved the meal for me. My boyfriend and I ordered choc chip cookie dough egg rolls and the other couple had cheesecake and both were divine!

I would for sure come back for dessert, but dinner was way too expensive to leave me wanting so much more.It's a standard Super 8 two star. Clean enough, nothing fancy, and some funny smells here and there. Sirens outside throughout the night. The night clerk said a few things that didn't make sense and were confusing. The thin door to the next room let me hear the dude coughing all night. These are all pretty standard for this type of hotel, but all together I'd probably consider staying somewhere else if I had to stay another night.This location is ok, I have been going to this location for a few years and I loved the pizza so much; however, the quality of the pizza has changed drastically, the dough it's so bland, you can't even taste the tomato sauce and in general the pizza it's very soggy, I don't know what happened. Their salad bar could be so good if the manager would put attention to what their employees are doing, I have seen many times when they refill the veggies just by putting them on top, they don't even bother in flipping out the container and put at least the new veggies at the bottom and the old ones on top. Somebody can get sick easily by this poor food management. I used to go to this location twice a week and now maybe once every three months and just because deep in my heart I have the hope somebody noticed what is happening there, but I really doubt it. Besides, the walls are so dirty all the time, my God I can't believe parents bring their children to this place. If you stop by, at least check the place carefully so that u can judge if it is a safe place to eat with your children.Minimal bagel selection on a Sunday morning was disappointing.Pretty same subs as every other location except they charge $2-3 more for the same thing. The staff was pretty stingy with the vegetables too. Save your money and drive 5 minutes to the mineral point location.I was not thrilled with this gym.  At the Fitchburg location, there is plenty of equipment, and the little TVs are a treat.  It is clean.  My biggest complaint is the trainers, who spent more time chatting with me than helping me develop a routine I'd actually do.  At first I was really excited about the group classes, but then I realized the instructors don't make corrections, which is not only disappointing, but can be dangerous.  I'd recommend taking full advantage of the 14 day trial period, as the fees end up being quite costly if you aren't going to use the gym.HOLY CRAP!!!
OK, now before I get into a pissing match with anyone I just have to say this, the place is ridiculously expensive. 
I don't get why you have to spend almost $200 on 1 pair of jeans? I mean come on!! I guess I would expect this from a store like this, but it's mostly all graphic t-shirts and pants..I do like the style..but I mean everything in there is graphic-ified. haha.
I did purchase a purse from there that I still wear today, but they are cheaply made. The lining of the purse tore open for some odd reason, I'm not ruff with my pruses and don't keep knives in there..all the time.. ;)~
I do know they have a sale rack in the back that is unmarked which I found odd..basically you have to read the tag to find out how much your paying..it's always a good hunt! 
I'd say go in, look around, but don't waste your money on their clothes. Or purses. You can find better quality. ;)~Used to go here for sushi all the time. Good food, decent prices. We stopped going because the wait staff was always very rude to us... we were good, frequent customers, so I don't know what was up. We go to Takara now... just down the street and they're awesome.It was fine for the area when you're in town for work and need a place close to the hotel/mall. However, I would not recommend.Ordered chicken wings (small) & a Garden salad, took them over an hr & 10 minutes to deliver. Then when the delivery guy carelessly handed me the food, it almost fell to the floor & he expected a tip. The food was ok, not worth the wait. Would not recommend this place.I stayed here for Phoenix Comicon 2013.  You expect a bit of noise during an event of that kind, but the level of noise I could hear in my room from the open atrium was astounding. 

The hotel and rooms look like they're in need of renovation.  

Internet access/WiFi was prohibitively expensive.  I got free Internet last month at Motel 6 !    

The only + was the proximity to the convention center.Stayed here for a night for a convention. For that the location couldn't be better. The bed was comfortable too. That's why I gave a second star. I reserved two nights but left a day early to spend Father's Day with my newborn son and they refused to refund the second day even though I checked out before 10am. They have no parking and will not validate so guests pay $12 per day. If you take the little $5 Aquafina bottle in the room, walk to a 7-11 later and buy one for $1 and replace it in the room before checkout. Don't even bother with the pool or hot tub here. There is no free Wi-Fi. That will cost you another $10 per day or $15 if you want premium. Was glad to check out. Not what I expected from Hyatt. Nothing against the nice ladies at the desk, but I was much more welcome when I got home! :)I have read a few reviews here and some rate this place pretty high despite their feedback on this place.  This place is probably one of the only Irish hell holes in Phoenix that resemble those nasty pubs from the ghettos back east.  Dark inside with unfriendly asshole bartenders, and the waitresses seem to run like chickens with there heads cut off when ever your in for lunch or a concert night at the dodge.

The food is definitely not a love maker, I can only imagine the old cookers and fryers that produce a less than average fish and chips and stale Fries.. UUURGGHH
 
Only reason they get two stars? There are cool bike guys that will shuttle  you to the dodge for a concert.

Stay Classy!Boo on the Food! This place is way over hyped. They tried to charge $7 for a little waffle and 2 cold, greasy chicken thighs. Not impressed at all. The only reason it gets 2 stars is because the waiter was nice and the place looked cool. 

First impressions are everything, so they say, and in this instance I would agree. Since moving here over a year ago I have heard people go on and on about Lolo's chicken and waffles, especially when they find out I moved from the south. "Oh it is the best soul food", "They have the best fried chicken I have had anywhere.." are some of the things people have said. We live in Mesa and there is not a location near us but this morning  we were running errands in Phoenix and drove about 15 minutes out of our way so I could finally try this place that so many people have raved about. The place was decorated nice, it was not too long after they opened and it was not busy, we were seated right away. Took about 10 minutes before we saw a server, our drinks were brought out fairly quick and our order taken. Our food came out pretty quick but what difference does quick service make when the food is cold? The skin on the chicken was not even crisp on the edges, they had obviously been sitting around for a while. I tried a bite anyway, good fried chicken is good hot or cold and this was not good. It had the overwhelming taste of flour and I think the cook forgot to put seasoning on it at all. When the waiter came over to check on us I told him the chicken was cold and I didn't want it, at first he took the plate back and didn't say anything at all, when he brought the check he apologized. I have heard people say how good it is and maybe my experience is isolated but if it really was an uncommon experience then why didn't the waiter seemed surprised when I returned it? Why didn't he offer to get me a fresh plate? Why didn't a manager come over to see what they problem was or to apologize? Maybe they are used to serving sub-standard food, that is the only thing I can think of. This place reminds me of a lot of places that were really good until they got popular, quality of food and service goes down, prices go up and the only reason they stay in business is because they are "cool" or trendy. 

Bottom line - Don't think I will try this place again, there are so many really good restaurants to try in the Phoenix area and when you are going to spend an average of $10+  per person to sit down & eat somewhere, the food should at least be fresh. 

Oh yeah, one more thing, a glass jar of kool-aid should never cost $3, unless you get to take the jar with you.I like the six pool tables in the back of the room. You probably won't have to wait if you wanna play! Yes, the jukebox is legit as well...it's got a lot of the more underground, independent rock and rap. And the sound system does every track justice. 

Drink prices are meh...for a grimy place with more rugged patrons, I'm used to seeing a bit lower. Draft beer selection is less appealing than I'm used to in this neck of the woods. Having one unique brew just doesn't cut it these days! 

Another weird thing about the layout is that there's not really a place to sit besides the bar or next to the billiards. A lack of tables to socialize with your friends tells me it might not be THE best place for groups, since you'll all just stand around awkwardly. Maybe it deserves another chance during peak hours. Maybe I'm just missing something really cool about this place. For now, it doesn't seem to do anything better than other bars in the area, and that really lowers the return factor for me.California has much better vermicelli. The fish oil had no flavor. The grilled pork wasn't seasoned like it should and the vermicelli not good.Stopped in here for a 2-Piece Meal for lunch today & specified FOR HERE when the cashier gal asked me.  Soon, a guy appeared from the back with my meal packaged TO GO.  I nicely reminded him that it was for here, & he shoved a tray at me with a big serving of attitude!     :-O

Went to wash my hands & there were no paper towels in the bathroom, & not even one of those air blowers!     :-O

CHURCH'S CAN DO A LOT BETTER THAN THIS!!     :-((Mcdonalds is obviously the most generic hamburger place. It is also the most succesfull despite being one of the worst. Outside of the beloved french fries, what does good ole Mcds have going for it? Carls Jr beat their $1 drink with one for 69 cents. The new wings are horrible. Yes they are bigger then the kind you get elsewhere, but not the right kind of spicy and too expensive. The "special sauce" always brings down the burgers which arent that good to begin with. Now that Mcdonalds is planning on eliminating the dollar menu and replacing it with a $5 menu, maybe its time to try the Sonic up the street.The last three times I've been here, the service has been horrible. The wait staff is slow and not very friendly. We were done with our appetizer before anyone even came to get our food order. I ordered my steak medium well and it came out medium rare and cold. It took me 15 minutes to get the attention of the bartender (sat up at the bar) and then another 15 to bring my re - grilled steak back, meanwhile my date had finished his steak (which was also undercooked but he didn't say anything). The manager brought the steak back, offering no apology. After we left we realized we didn't get offered the bread selection that comes with the meal, let alone any kind of bread. The time before that, our "reservation" was over an hour late in being seated on a random Tuesday night, but at least we were given a bottle of wine for the table of 10.   Won't be back any time soon!This review is kind of late at being posted.  I have a handful of friends that come here often so come near years eve this is exactly where they wanted to go.  They always have the best stories about all the fun they had when they came here so I jumped on that bandwagon to go there for new years eve.  Specially when I found out that there was no door fee, or maybe it was no door fee before a certain time.  Either way I didn't pay to get in there.

The place was shockingly huge, I didn't realize how big it would be, how many pool tables and other games there would be.  I loved that there was plenty of space where you wouldn't have to wait around forever for a table.

But bummer, the place was also dead.  We sat around there for well over an hour waiting for it to pick up and when it didn't we opted to just go back to my friends house for new years night.  Maybe it was busy after we left, I wouldn't know because it was pretty dead the one time I went there.

Didn't really seem like my kind of place but I know 6 other people that love it here so I'm just one of the few that wasn't into it.I was going to give this place three stars and then realized there really isn't any reason to.  While it is cheap ($6 the night we went, with free nachos and soda), in this case you get what you pay for.

The rink surface was nice, but the roller skates were crappy, and the back of the place smelled like urine.  There is also no air-conditioning, just fans.

If you really want to go skating and are looking for an adventure, give it a shot.  If you're looking for a classy date spot, keep looking.Went here for dinner last night. Won't be back for quite awhile. Our server was a young female who knew nothing about the menu or customer service! I ordered the prime rib , medium and it came well done. Cold potato, the cheese wouldn't even melt. Husband ordered the ribeye and it too was cooked well done. Yuck! We ordered Chili instead of salad, when it didn't come out we asked the waitress and she said she brings it out with the meal... Usually it's brought out when the salads are brought out, so she went and got them. Seconds late here came our dinner with more chili...she asked of we wanted it, we told her no, then she went to the table behind us and asked if they wanted it. She told them not to tell anyone she did that and then came back and took the chili from our table and gave it to them.  Needless to say our food was not up to par, not was our service or experience!Came here after work to get my car repaired.

I told the mechanic my driver side axle was broken. he told me the axle was fine and said he could do a diagnostic for 50 bucks, but that would come off the cost of the axle.

he drove around for 15 minutes and with the help of another mechanic.. diagnosed that it was, in fact, my axle. Quoted me 300 for a Nissan Murano axle. I told him brakes plus did it for 200 (read my review on brakes plus for my experience after this one), he didn't believe me,  saying that he had the best prices in town and he would match Brakes Plus. We called up Brakes Plus on speaker- and they quoted me 200. he was angry, lied and said he couldn't do it for 200 any more. He wanted the diagnostic money, but I told him they had incorrectly told me it wasn't my axle when I walked in, so he shouldn't charge me up front. He was cool with that, so I drove off.The return policy here is ridiculous. I bought a blower/vacuum for $89.99, I got it home and a couple weeks later attempted to use it. Hats off and high fives to you men that work these machines like pros. I couldn't seem to get the leaves to blow in a pile, I just blew them all over the place. I saved my receipt, and next time I went to Lowe's I tried to return it. No go. The policy states you can't return power equipment after 30 days. Even if it is in perfect condition (manual original packaging ect.) and you have the receipt. So now I am stuck with a blower/vacuum I spent over 90 bucks on and can't use. And the chick at the counter was completely rude and condescending. I wanted to smash her in the face with the box. At least then I'd get some bang for the 90 bucks. Lucky for her I completed my anger management classes...The service part person was rude and had a bad attitude.  We will go to the Internet for parts next time rather than making the drive. The two stars was for the nice selection of things in the store.They have great food if you can get service.   Last time I went wewaited 30 min and didn't have any service at all so we left and done 20 min to another restaurant. We just phone order wings and pick them up nowFood wasn't so bad, but service wasn't great. We sat down waited about 10min for a sever. We ordered drinks and it took forever to get our drinks out. Once they came we order and our food came out immediately. During our dinner our drinks ran out and our sever didn't check back on us for drinks.  Our kids were thirsty and we had to wait and wait. Finally our sever came we ordered another round of drinks and it took 20min to get our order. We actually walked up to the bar and noticed our server hadn't picked up our drinks which were ready. Once we got the check it took even longer for them to pick up our check so we could high tail it out of here.This is a review of the golf course...

Do not know what has happened to this historic course, but the condition was horrible....AND this is high season (course conditions are at their best due to great weather).  The grass on the sixth green was spotty at best - the course filled in the dead grass with sand??  Not contusive to an 'ok' putting surface.  The sand bunkers were packed in so much that it was basically hitting off dirt.  Bunker shots had to be played as chip shots off hardpan.  

Sad to see this course in this poor condition!  I enjoy the layout, the people and challenge, but the condition has declined over the years.  I hope the owners are able to put some money into the course to bring it back to its hay-day.  As of today, I suggest you seek other courses at comparable prices (i.e. Bear Creek, Ken McDonald, Dobson Ranch, Oakwood).They charged me $165 per night, the room was not clean, but the it was quiet and next to a golf course. However the staff specially one lady at reception was absolutely incompetent, she messed up even getting us a ride to chandler airport and we ended up paying $20 for a ride that should have been free, beside putting up with the aggravated driver. 

Be cautious of the staff since they really are not trained and do not know what they are doing. the breakfast is also horriblePossibly closer to 1.

My family has eaten here for as long as they've been in business.  Mostly I really like the place.  I can remember having macha and eggs and coming no where close to finishing it.

But I'm afraid those days have passed.

The last two times we've been there have been exercises in mediocrity.  

We order biscuits and gravy with bacon and 2 eggs (over easy, not over medium, not over hard. OVER EASY DO I REALLY NEED TO TEACH YOU HOW TO DO IT???!!!

Ok the good news.  For me, as long as you don't burn it, you cant screw up bacon.

Biscuits and gravy.  Well first it's not a biscuit.  It a cake like device.  This is not to say it's bad, rather it's to say it's not a biscuit in the traditional sense.  Gravy comes out cool to warm....but never hot.

Ok onto the egg.  I want it over easy.  That means if any of the yolk is hard, it is not over easy.  This shouldn't be a hard concept to grasp.  I when you flip the egg onto the plate and you see hardness in the yolk, don't sent it out unless someone asked for a n over medium egg.   I ASKED FOR OVER EASY THIS IS NOT HARD TO DO!!! WHY DO YOU INSIST ON SENDING ME AN OVERCOOKED EGG??  I GAVE YOU AN EASY TASK I WANTED TO CHALLENGE YOU I WOULD HAVE ORDERED MY EGGS SCRAMBLED BECAUSE I KNOW YOU WOULD HAVE SCREWED IT UP OUT OF HAND.  BUT NO I ASKED FOR OVER EASY...COOK THE WHtIE ON THE FIRST SIDE, FLIP THE EGG 20-30 SECONDS IT'S DONE.  WAS THAT HARD??? THEN WHY AM I SENDING MY EGGS BACK????  ARRRRRGGGGGGHHHH!!!!!The food was pretty good, but the service is horrible, and VERY VERY VERY VERY SLOW!!!!!!!I was really looking forward to eating here because I had read good reviews. Maybe we went on a bad day. They were very slow but it took way too long to get our food and they screwed up my friends order. I got a chicken, carne asada and fish taco. The Chicken was the best. I didn't care for the carne asada or the fish. Guedos fish tacos are far superior. I don't think that we will return to Elmer's with all the great Mexican food choices in the area. Sorry.I went here because I had a discount coupon from one of those daily special type sites. Everyone there was pleasant, the decor was nice. That being said, my brows were shaped very square and pointy, not really a normal shape, and to top it off the wax er left me with a long red abrasion on one of my eyes that lasted for over a week. I won't be going back.I am a big fan of Eggs Benedict and when I saw the pictures online (not how it looks in person anymore)  and read the menu I thought I had found a new favorite.  Not the case. The muffin was soggy (even though I asked it to be more toasted) They changed out the ham for prosciutto which made it way to salty.  There was very little Hollandaise sauce.  My server didn't really seem to care about my experience either.  On the bright side the monkey pancake was awesome. 

Maybe next time I will just focus on the pancakes, french toast, or eggs and hope to have a better experience.  The monkey pancake was good enough to get me to come back and try the bananas foster french toast.Really?

$5.95 for a one scoop sundae?  Yes!

Me: Excuse me, this should have whipped cream and a cherry.

Them:  Sorry, our whipped cream machine is broken.  Would you like a cherry?

Me (thought):  1. Tell me up front.   2.  Send someone to the store to buy Rediwhip!

$5.95?  Really?  Are we in Los Angeles at these prices?I started doing Bikram yoga in 2004, but I have never been one of those fanatics who goes everyday, or even every other day.  I prefer once, maybe twice a week, & this is mainly due to the cost of classes & my very busy (often spontaneous) lifestyle.  I would also like to add that Bikram yoga is not my only form of exercise, however it is my favorite.  So with all of this being said, I am a firm believer that when someone buys a package, whether it be 5 classes, 10 classes, or 25 classes, the paying customer should be able to choose when they use their classes.  This studio places a 6 week expiration date on their 10 class package, which is ridiculous.  All it is is a way for the studio to make more money.  People should be able to practice yoga when they choose & on their own schedules.  Not everyone's lives revolve around going to yoga everyday.  If yours does, good for you; if yours doesn't, this probably isn't the studio for you.

On another note, this studio is very nice & very clean, & most of the instructors are fabulous.not for picky eaters! im one, ill admit.

everybody seems to love this place but i cant figure out why. we went with another couple who raved about it. i wasnt impressed with the menu -- it was certainly interesting and different, but nothing amazing.

it was okay, but i probably wont go back unless a group is going and i dont have a choice. i dont what all the fuss is about.I went here for lunch disregarding the not so great reviews. When you first get there it's pretty abandoned looking, but once walking inside I was surprised by how many people were there. I thought, "GREAT! the reviews are wrong."

I ordered a las vegas roll and a teriyaki salmon. When I opened my box that help my roll...I was disapointed. The roll was very pale which normally indicates that it wasn't cooked long enough. I still gave it a try, and I could tase the doughy batter. Once I peeled off the outside of the roll I was left with cream cheese, salmon, and rice. The rice wasn't very good either...After about the third "piece" I gave up after my stomach started to hurt. I would not recommend this roll, I would much rather go to RA and spend about the same amount of money on their sushi. 

I haven't eaten the salmon, but from what I was seeing that and the chicken are very popular...Here's hoping when I'm feeling better, they will get an updated review.This place has seen better days. Wildly inconsistent service and food quality. Stick with the lettuce wraps and chicken soup as only viable options. Kid city.ummmm...ummm...There is a Captain Morgan statue in the back. 

That is about all I got! Drinks are overpriced and the door staff is a bit much.A Rogers Park girl finds herself in Scottsdale AZ and where does she go?  Don & Charlies of course!  Wow, how exciting to walk into a place that models itself after places I grew up with.  The ambiance is second to none - the Chicago sports memorabilia is worth millions.  Totally what I had hoped.

Sadly, we caught Don & Charlies at the worst possible time ever.  Our reservation apparently happened just moments after the ASU football team showed up.  It was by far the worst service I have experienced in a long time.  One of my kids fell asleep waiting for his mac and cheese.  And I couldn't get a drink to save my life.  We sent back two of seven meals - and we are not the fussy food type. 

I would give this restaurant a single star (because I am a sucker for Chicago memorabilia), but, I give it a second star because the manager was amazing - taking care of us even better than I could have hoped.  He was obviously embarrassed and apologetic.

I will try it again and hope the other reviewers got it right.   But, couldn't justify more than a couple of stars for tonight's dinner (I didn't eat).We were headed out of town and looking to get a great dinner before hitting the road. Grimaldi's and Bandera both had an hour wait so we decided to stop into RA. They had no wait (now I know why). Their sushi was mediocre.. at best, and quite pricey. It didn't taste as fresh as I would have liked, and the flavors didn't seem to stand out as much as they should have. The miso soup was my favorite part of the meal. I will not be back to this location. I like the one in Vegas for happy hour, but I'll pass on the food.We have been back in the Scottsdale area for the last month and have probably visited  Rancho Pinot three or four times with generally good results. Our last visit however left quite a bit to be desired. Things got off ok with our server until we ordered a cocktail and appetizer prior to placing our dinner order. We mentioned that we would need just a little time to select our dinner order. Well, that was the kiss of death. Our server disappeared from the face of the earth never to be seen for several decades. We subsequently ordered dinner and it was just fine but the evening was somewhat ruined by dreadfully poor service and lack of customer attention.

As their menu states, "should you have a problem please mention it to us before yelp".
Well we did but our waiter's response was "couldn't get to you as I was too busy getting drinks for other tables" . Brilliant.Beautiful rooms and views. Room service is awful. The tuna tartare was tasteless and my quesadilla was so burnt I had to send it back. The room also had a number of technical problems that the staff could not solve, such as the tv in the bedroom not functioning. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this hotel.This would be our 3rd time visiting Cove Trattoria.  The first 2 were exceptional.  Both times we went on a Friday night, so one would expect it to be busy - it was not.  Service was fine, food was great.  This is why we went for a 3rd time.  

Big mistake.  We went last Thursday and it was quite busy, but there were several tables available.  We were asked if we had a reservation of which we did not being that the last 2 times, it was empty.  We were told that the 2 tops around the bar were not open seating (which must have changed because they were before).  So, we waited for 10 minutes or so only to be seated with the menus to have to wait 10 minutes for a drink order.  Worst part is two "regulars" came in, sat themselves at the same 2-tops we were sitting at and got prompt attention.  Still no waitress at our table.  When we finally did get a waitress, we waited another 10 minutes for our drinks and weren't lucky enough to get the same bread our neighbors got.  Again, after ordering our food, we waited approx. 30 minutes to receive it!  Luckily our food was fine and we didn't need anything because our waitress never bothered to check on us.  

I am positive the regulars get great service based on what I witnessed, but looking at all the other sad folks around the restaurant, their experience was similar to ours.  

Good thing we had a Groupon to use because I would've been even more upset had we paid full price for the so-so food and horrible service.This is the first time at this location and while the food was great the service is horrible. Our waitress was forgetful and took forever. It wasn't busy at all. Also the music is so loud that you can't hold a conversation with the person next to you. 

The food was great and came out quick. If you just want the food, then this is the place. If you want great service, go someplace else.Cheba Hut is a place I love and hate. I love the quality of the sandwiches and the fact they're toasted! They have veggie options and all kinds of sides and unique drinks, and a variety of tasty desserts. I hate how it can be hard to order your food cause the cashier or sandwich maker is high and slow as shit. The weed theme is amusing, but it can only go so far before it affects the quality of the service and the work ethic that a business has. Numerous times I have had rude, stoned jerkoffs answer the phone and treat me like I'm a fellow piece of shit stoner with all the time in the world, which is bullshit. I know other people have had the same problem and the management needs to address this; tell your employees to leave the herbage for their own time, and to bring their A-game to work!The pizza tastes okay. It's not the greatest pizza on the planet, and their prices are average. It's not much for "New York" style pizza. Their large pizza is HUGE, but their crust is flavorless. Their wings are okay, but not great either. 

Their delivery times are off. Sometimes they'll tell you 45 minutes and they'll be an hour, or they'll be 10 minutes early. It's weird. Sometimes they just wont answer their phone. Sometimes they wont tell you when they'll be there. Once, they actually forgot part of my order. In terms of customer service, they're less than stellar... for sure.

Why do I keep eating there? My boss wouldn't eat anything else! I think if I have another Gus's pizza, i'll yack! I would recommend Pizza Hut over Gus's... any day.Granted this place is probably known for their beer and not their food, but really, how hard is it to supply some decent food?

I tried two appetizers - both were not good and both overpriced.
I'm not a huge fan of greasy fried food so can't speak for their fish and chips.

In terms of service, one waiter was really nice but we were passed around to different waiters and I can't say that the others were helpful at all.

My recommendation would be - don't eat here.While in Tempe for the 2011 SLUTWALK TEMPE, I Yelped and found Monti's. It was close to the start of the Walk plus it's an historic building, the oldest in the area, belonging to the famous Hayden family. That's always fun to make such a discovery.
The service was fine and our server was nice and the ambience was delightful. Lots of historic photos and artifacts on the walls.
The food: This is the reason for the low rating. Mainly due to my partner's ordering of a fish and chips dish. To quote: "The fish tasted like it came right off the deck of the boat." She could not eat it. The fries had a peculiar taste also and were left uneaten. Throw in the fact that it was a rather expensive dish, let's just say, this was not a happy lunch hour.
My BLT with onion rings was quite good. I have no complaints.

In retrospect, I wish one of us had spoken to our server about the terrible food. Somebody in the kitchen needs to know about that fish and chips dish.

Based on this experience and the fact that along Mill Ave. there are some fabulous-looking eateries, I doubt I'll be back to Monti's any time soon.Cool atmosphere.  Very laid, chill environment.  Good price on beers, but thats all I can say.  The server was pretty awful, not continually checking back with us and not friendly.  There were 4 of us and 2 of us order food initially and the orders came out about 5 minutes apart.   My friend order 1/2 dozen oysters (its an oyster house) and from his experience the person that shucked those oysters obviously was not a lover of them.  There were small broken pieces of the shell around the edges, and the bottoms were absolutely filthy dirty.  For being an oyster house you would think that would be the thing they take pride in, but not that night.  Then the remaining of our group ordered food and both those orders came out at separate times (almost 10 minutes apart) and one order was just a side of fries.  It's a great drinking atmosphere and a cool place to chill, but I wouldn't go expecting great service of great food.i don't see how this place is much better than some other fast food establishments. i'd rather go to in n n out.As a disabled veteran, I received donated passes for an event here. Upon arrival, I told the box office I was having a hard time walking, and asked that they assign me seats that didn't involve stairs. I made it very clear to her that I was not asking for "preferential seating", just anything with as few stairs as possible. She said the best she could do was put me in seat 1 at the very end of the row.

She gave me the tickets and told me to take the escalators to the left... so after walking all the way down the concourse we found out those were the ones coming down, and the one's going up were on the opposite end. Not one staff member offered help, or asked if I needed assistance getting to my seats. (In contrast, US Airways Center staff have always been amazingly helpful.)

So we finally make it up two escalators only to find out they put me in Section 203, Row A, Seat 1. TOP LEVEL AT THE BOTTOM OF A  FLIGHT OF STAIRS. In addition, none of the concession stands were open on that side of the arena.

My kids and I walked to the opposite side of the arena to get something for all of us to drink ($5.75 for a 20oz bottle of Diet Pepsi). When we got there, we noticed over 3/4 of the seats were empty, so I asked to sit at the very top of Section 214 in a bunch of empty folding chairs. Mind you, the seats I was given were in the FRONT row of the top section... I asked if we could sit in the TOP row. I was given plenty of attitude by the usher, but was allowed. However, my two friends, my kids, and I were given dirty looks, and harassed about everything and anything by the usher.

Well, one thing I can say for social media... is that it certainly got SOMEONE'S attention that day. My friends and I started posting about the way we were being treated, and sure enough a supervisor came up and moved the usher to another section. About an hour later, she returned to our section... all smiles.

I understand that some people with disabilities abuse the kindness of others, but when a guy asks to sit in WORSE seats than what he has tickets for... he's probably not one of those people.Ok gel manicure.
The whole process took way too long and I was left with nothing special. The awkward small talk really made things that much worse.
To top it off it was way more expensive than most of the places I go to. 

I will not be returning.Tried this place (twice) because it is close to us but the convenience of it is not worth it. The first time we went in we were a little creeped out by the darkness of it and that it was desolate. My husband tried the Mac and cheese and I had the spicy chicken sandwich. Both were bland and unimpressive. The fries were limp and tasteless. We decided to give it a second try because we really wanted it to work. The second time the atmosphere was a bit more lively. The food was no different - bland. My husband gave the Mac and cheese another try, I had the fried chicken, and the kiddos had corn dog bites. My chicken was rock hard, the skin was a strange brown/burnt color and there was also very little meat inside. Needless to say, we will not be back and if we ever come back it will be with great trepidation.Men's Wearhouse is a clean store with curteous clerks.  To bad they aren't diligent in their jobs.  Twice we've rented from them for events and each time there were numerous mistakes.  For the most recent event we had I ended up with scuffed shoes, no socks, and no suspenders.  My friends had numerous problems with their rentals as well.   

My best advice if you decide to use them is "renter beware" and make sure everyone for your event checks their rentals to make sure that they have everything and it all matches.  In their defense, Men's Wearhouse is very polite and apologetic about their mistakes but after two events where they got things wrong, giving them another chance is a tough sell.This place is ok if you live near by.  Mostly generic brands of feed at brand name prices. So no bargains here! They claim most of their stuf is Purina off labled branding...  Besure you smell the feed, bought some rancid smelling rooster mix the other day. Also they charge extra for credit cards, which is against visa's merchant policy, so not much integrity at this place! and sometimes they charge tax on poultry feed, sometimes they put its tax exempt, so watch your receipt. They are very nice at this place, just be careful! they know what their doing...Ive tried this location a couple times now and it has yet to grow on me.

They never seem to have any produce I need when I go in, Its always crowded and the staff is not very good at interacting with and helping customers.

If you pass by the cash registers with any groceries, 
staff is right there in your face asking if you are ready to check out.

I understand they are trying help out with time spent in line but my god.
All I feel like they are doing is rushing me to get out of the store.
no need to bombard me, 
half the time I'm just passing to get to the other side of the store.
If im looking towards the registers and you feel I am trying to find a short line, by all means, help out a little.
but come on,
I shouldn't feel rushed EVERY TIME I go into the store and I do.

SO ANNOYING.

if you're looking to enjoy your grocery shopping experience drive a little further to the 215 and aliante location.
Its so much nicer and more relaxed there.

this location is for people on the go that want to get in and out quick.

its also for the lower class customer.
people always walking around in pajama pants, slippers, hair a mess and smelly.
gross.

on one trip walking from my parking space to the front entrance, I was almost hit by two different cars pulling out of spots. so obviously this is the store the idiot customers come too as well. like HELLO, im literally standing directly behind your car. MIRROR CHECK, HEAD CHECK!

the location isn't that great either. Its not convenient at all.
its on major cross streets and the parking lot is always full of cars.

aliante and 215 location is so much better,
trust me.This airport is dirty, ridiculous, and not user friendly. What I mean by user friendly is... they need more outlets around the airport, so folks traveling for business can plug their lap tops and cell phones into for charging.  If you have a lay over here... good luck! I hope you're not late! You'll be walking a good mile before you reach your destination. As if traveling isn't already stressful. This airport adds to the stress... not to mention, you have slots machines every where- lose money quickly if you dare.this place for years has always been well known for their teriyaki bowls.  eh...i dont really care for teriyaki bowls, i like dishes like pork lau-lau, or kalua pork, etc... i really try to only eat the market street cafe downstairs in the california hotel for their awesomely famous oxtail soup.  so, one day my lovely dining companion joined my cousins for a quick bite to eat at aloha specialties.  oh, crap...for $15 a combo plate of pork lau-lau, macaroni salad, ahi-poke, and beef stew, plus a side order of spam musubi and 2 drinks.  first off that pork lau-lau look so sad...it was so dry...that the vegas desert dirt looked more moist.  i bit into that hard, dry, unflavored chunk of meat and yelled...wtf!!!  i didnt dip the meat in shoyu, i had to stick the meat in my mouth and then drink some shoyu to get something out of the dish.  my lovely date and i could not stop laughing at how sad the meal was.  the spam musubi was no better because it was probably sitting out too long.  the seaweed did not break off as you tried to bite through the musubi.  it was one massive chewy thing.  ooh, i hope there are better items to eat here.  it is pretty busy all the time, so there has to be something good to eat.  so i will try again...and let you knowWhen I learned of the 99 cent shrimp cocktail on one of the hundred Travel Channel shows about Las Vegas, I've been committed to try it if I ever went to Vegas.  It is the absurdity of discount food, seafood no less, and its 'famous' status that gets to me.  Similarly, on another show, a 99 cent giant hot dog was presented.  It was available at  another casino, Slots a Fun, further south on the strip.  Yeah, it looked like loaf of baloney (yes baloney, the proper word might have you think it's higher in quality or something), but I was still going to buy and eat it.

So the years have passed and the price of the shrimp cocktail has risen, 1.99 in 2008, and now this year when I finally do visit Las Vegas, 2.99.  That monstrosity of a hot dog is gone, replaced with hum drum standard Nathan's franks.  Then there it was in front of me, a tulip glass full of pale shrimp, doused in a smooth red cocktail sauce.  They were cold, watery, and completely flavorless.  Any and all flavor is just  the spicy horseradish and tomato of the sauce.  Unadorned shrimp lacked so much of everything, that taking a salt shaker and sprinkling the contents into your mouth would evoke more of an ocean-y thought.

Oh right, about the casino.  All of the table dealers were nice, even though I have no idea what their faces look like.  Craps is a low roller friendly $5, and the machines were fairly loose.  I'm glad I got that out of the way, although I'd only come back for the ample chests and gambling.Average for me, NJ pizza rules, this place was ok, no complaints.Stayed at the Carson Tower last week.  My elderly friend was mugged by a black woman who entered on the 10th floor.  She was knocked down and her purse was stolen.  Security should have been better!!!  Not even a word of apology from the casino.I would have given more stars because it was a cool experience going there, but when i got home to NY i researched the vintage "Hummel" figurine i bought, and it was a knockoff made in "occupied Japan."  It was listed at $100 with the word "Hummel" right on the tag and on the sales slip, but i talked them down to $75 thinking i got a good deal.  Apparently the max it's worth is $20 to $30 but i've seen similar ones on ebay for $5 to $10.  My boyfriend bought a 1 oz silver piece for $48 which apparently is worth $30 to $35. Not as big of a ripoff  as mine though and it's nice.  I thought at the least they'd be honest about what they were selling in terms of the Hummel figurine, and i thought they were experts who would know this.  I do like the figurine but just feel duped and that ruins their credibility for me.  It's one thing to over-price things, but when on top of that you are falsely advertising that is pretty low.First when i arrived at the casino about 8:30 pm we had to wait in the lobby for 25 mins because there computers were down and we could not check right in..Then there's an odor in the casino that hits you when you open the door gross..We check in and the rooms suck the carpet looks like its never been washed the lamp had food stains on the base gross...The best thing about this place is the shower and I must admit the food at the courtyard is great worth the trip 2 eat there but don't stay here...Then we called about the elevators because we saw previous reports and they said OH WE HAVE NEW ELEVATORS yea right...They were so slow that when u finally got one it was over crowed because everybody wants to get on and at one point there was a shoving match so they sent security which was the maintenance man to ride up and down..REALLY....We will never be back...Thank god the rooms (regular ones might i add) were nice, pretty spacious and most of all CLEAN otherwise this would've been a 1 star rating.

Moving on, 
The things that made this review a 2 star include hookers (we actually saw hookers getting arrested), Also a hooker at our starbucks meeting a hotel guest by the Inpamena tower elevators!  So this place was infested with hookers and very shady looking people.  

We ignored the hookers, but couldn't escape the late check in! HORRIBLE!  We showed up pretty early at 1pm.  They gave us a paper saying to call back and check if our room was available.  We called around 3pm and no success.  4pm we try again and were told to wait until 6pm because they are backed up.  Seriously? what hotel does that?  We ended up settling in our rooms around 630.  Wasted our first day in vegas!

Location? Well....it didn't even feel like we were in vegas.  Sure we had a car, but how inconvienient is that to always drive around, where as hotels on the strip you can walk around whenever you feel like it.  

Rio buffet was a bright spot however.  Not sure if its the "best in vegas" but it was better than average.  

Room service...I tried ordering $16.50 chicken strips, NO FRIES, and was told it would take an hour and fifteen minutes.....at 1am. On a tuesday!  okaaay...canceled that really fast.The hotel is rather dated, and is far too worn to be pulling the crap they do with all the nickel & dime charges they want to pinch customers for.   

Called to ask about an check in early and was told there would be a $20 charge.  Really?!  Decided to pass on the early check in and waited till the end of my day to go check in.  

After being scolded for pulling into the wrong valet lane so I could unload my suitcase and check in (I should have been in the common folk lane, not the super duper multi-star lane), I checked in for a two night stay.  Finally got checked in and headed to my room.  The bathroom area has a nice seated vanity area, but THERE WAS NO MIRROR over it.  Clearly there should have been because you could see the spots on the wall where there used to be adhesive.  Got past that.  Was happy to see that there was a Keurig coffee maker on the counter near the vanity.

The next morning I got up and went to make a cup of coffee.  Realized there was no coffee nor coffee condiments on the counter.  I called housekeeping and they advised that there IS coffee, but it is part of the honor bar and there is a charge if you use.  Are you kidding me?!  Another "amenity" that they want to nickel-and-dime-you-to-death with.  

Once ready to head out I decided to leave the "do not disturb" on the door as I didn't feel like securing all my valuables and computer.  Come back after a long day, slip off my shoes and am getting comfortable.  Head into the restroom area and catch a glimpse of myself in the mirror over the vanity.  Wait a minute - there WAS no mirror over the vanity this morning!  Apparently the housekeeping and engineering staff decided to completely disregard my "DO NOT DISTURB" on the door and help themselves to my room, while all my personal belongings, valuables and electronics were out in the open!  I felt violated, unsafe and totally pissed off.  When I called the front desk to complain, they asked if I'd like someone from housekeeping to contact me.  Why?  Why would I want that?!  The customer relations person I spoke to were less than sympathetic nor concerned.   I slept uneasy that night, and vowed I will never step foot into that place again.  I didn't find anything missing but that is besides the point.  They had no right in my room when I asked for privacy.

And the icing on the cake of the mirror suddenly appearing in my room was that they didn't even bother to clean it after they installed it!  There were smudges and hand prints all over it.  Nice.

So if you decide to stay here - make sure you lock up your stuff even if you have the "Do Not Disturb" placquard showing.  Because they do not respect your rights or privacy.A bit of a disapointment after some of my other dining experiences at The Palms. 

The retaraunt is set up horribly. All half table half booth combinations, the booth seating allowing for me to sink so low into the seat that I felt I needed a booster chair. 

For an appetizer we had the calamari, which on it's own was very ordinary. But the sauce that came with it was amazing! 

I am a big sushi fan and ordered the spicy albacore and yellowtail roll. It was a big waste of $9. No flavors whatsoever. Very bland.

For my entree I ordered the orange chicken. Upon arrival of my plate I was pleasantly surprised. The aroma caught my attention first, it smelled fantastic! And the portion was a good size. The taste however again was on the flavorless side.

Would have been better off catching a cheap bite at the Palms food court.Ended up staying here as my original vacation date changed due to work.  Well, you get what you pay for.  While the hotel really wasn't for me, I suppose if your trying to do Vegas on the cheap, this is a great option.  Just expect hard beds, outdated decor and slim options for dining.  The casino is large though.  

The good - I had a great view of the strip on one of the higher floors. Good drinks on the casino floor. Everything is in walking distance. 

The 'not so good' - No (decent) shopping in the hotel, (the aforementioned regarding the beds, decor and dining) and no elevator/floor security.

Excalibur needs a LOT of updating in order to compare to the true 'resort style' hotels in Vegas or it may not be around to much longer.This hotel scares me for some reason.  Scary druggies and prostitutes seem to hang around this area.  I have traveled thru a couple times to only be glad I wasn't staying there.  Had the worst glass of wine ever in Sherwood Forest sports bar on casino floor.  Krispy Kreme upstairs makes it less painful.I dragged myself this morning via the (expensive!) monorail to the Convention Center for a geek tradeshow setup.  Hmmm, what can I say, it is huge but quite tacky and old school!  Perhaps because I live a few blocks away from our very own hip Moscone Center and have worked the booths at Moscone for Oracle World many times, I found this Convention Center too old school.  What's up with the flashy carpet circa Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin and Sammy Davis, Jr.?  Quite tacky, I would say...

I was not quite impressed, in fact, I think it needs major upgrading, please update thyself, after all most geek conventions occur here, at least have a high-tech look.What I remember Goldilocks to be was a turo-turo place in El Cerrito, CA at the Pacific East Mall. (That location is closed now :( Oh, how I miss thee)

I used to love going to that one with my mom as a child.

This one was, I guess, a step up, but nothing like I remembered a Goldilocks to be.
An actual sit-down restaurant with "cooked-to-order" meals.

I would go here every now and then while attending classes at UNLV, and although I like some of the food here, it's just okay. 

What really put me off about this place is the service. Sure, they may come around for the initial greeting and order taking, but after that, it may be hard to find them... EVEN if you are one of the only people in there!

I've had a lot of the breakfast "silogs" there. I love them, but once, the waiter suggested we both get garlic fried rice with our breakfast plates and did not even warn us about the extra charge it would cost us! He acted as if it was a free upgrade. C'mon. You just cut some garlic up, throw it in some oil on a pan and swirl around the rice? That cost $1.50 extra, EACH plate. WTF? Oh well.

I've also had the crispy pata, and the pancit palabok. Not worth discussing. Decent at it's best.

Pricing wise, it's a little more than Filipino food actually costs, but it's a restaurant, so I'll excuse them. Still, they cost less than Salo Salo Grill.

I still love the baked goods, though. Pianomo rolls always are good and Buko Pandan is one of my favorite desserts hands down!

I'd suggest going somewhere else, though.My return here will be my last. I expect more from Wolfgang Puck restaurants! Two parts make a dining experience pleasant: the food, first and foremost, AND the staff. Both plain sucked at this place. Our waiter was rude and never really came by to ask us our dinner was going. In fact, the only time he ever really spoke to us aside from taking our order was while arguing with my boyfriend about beer knowledge. BLAH. My boyfriend ordered a steak that was just okay,and I ordered a pizza that was good but nothing special. There are so many other restaurants worth trying over this one!I'm somewhat shocked that this place averaged 3 1/2 stars.  Coming from Los Angeles, I've had my fair share of Mexican food.  From the hole in the one senora style to even the finer dining version of Mexican restaurants, this place was not too shabby. 
First of all, the location is a hit. Right by the canal for viewers to watch gandolas go by, it's a perfect setting. 
Then, munch on some nachos with their salsa and guacamole while sipping on some fruity margarita, dinner seemingly sounds better.
We feel the buzz from our delicioso margaritas so we go the high route and order the most expensive dish on the menu - the AZTEC BONE IN NY STEAK.  It came with the the crab cornbread with truffle butter.  Lets just say that the crab cornbread with the truffle bread saved this order because this side dish was worth going home to write about.  As for the steak, if you love overdosing on sodium or you just came out of a sweaty and exhausting basketball game, then this over salty steak is just for you!  For folks who don't crave that saltiness (that's me), I would not recommend this dish.  We had to ask for it to be redone and the waitress was extremely nice about it.  I can tell the chef or cook was snooty about this because the 2nd steak we got back had absolutely no flavor, just the meat itself.  You can tell easily what the chef was thinking when he was told that the customer didn't like his steak.
I was a big fan of the cornbread.  If you think the cornbread is worth $37 and you have money to dispose, I would give this order a shot.
And so what the steak came out overly salty and then the second one came out tame.  We had the salt from our margarita glasses that we used to pick and press onto our flavorless steak and made the most out of it.

All in all, the cornbread, the margarita, chips and salsa and the setting was good.  Just not the salty and unsalty steaks.  If you're looking for a good Mexican restaurant in Vegas, try Border Grill at The Mirage.I've been taken on some rides, and this one bites the big one. It costs about $7 to cab it up the strip, but the sign to the monorail beckons us near the entrance of the MGM Grand.

It keeps beckoning for at least the next twenty minutes, as we get lost in jungles of slot machines, and even two tigers are sitting in a glass cage with two people. I think they paid to be there.

So we finally get it, then debate where are we going to get off. Unfortunately, we go with my choice and we end up at the Hilton I think it was. We could see our hotel in the distance, and gradually it got further away as the monorail curved its way right away from all the popular spots. The cab ride back cost us $8, for a total ride cost of $18 between two.

Who came up with the route? At least Seattle's monorail goes somewhere, but even with that, it shut down.

Stay away from this unless you know what you're doing.This was my first experience eating Ethiopian food.  It was a fun communal experience as our dinner club ate with our hands getting food from the center of the table.  We ordered the combination platter to sample a variety of food which I enjoyed.  My friend had the Ethiopian wine which had a smell that I wasn't use to, but was different to me.  Service was fine and the waitress was friendly.  She educated us on what to order.  I did notice a roach in the bathroom crawling on the sink. I hope they exterminate.  The place is in an old strip mall that doesn't look like the most visually appealing area near the strip, but its a hidden ethnic joint for Las Vegas foodies.Definitely the rudest hotel staff I ever encountered. Everyone was rude. The check-in people were rude, the concierge was rude, the maids were rude and intrusive, the restaurant staff was rude, the people who worked at the gift store were rude, and the luggage storage guys outside the hotel were rude. It's like, "Wow, I'm paying a butt-load of money to stay here and I'm being treated like dirt." 

Steve Wynn must not care about keeping his customers at all because I never want to step inside that hotel again.I came here on a saturday afternoon and it was my first time there. HOUR AND A HALF WAIT?!?! There was a big long booth and 4 tables open? You kidding me? 

I'd like to give zero stars on the service because let me tell you, I have never experience the type of service they were giving that day. Dora, the hostess had an attitude on her. Every so often I would check about how much longer until our number will be called and she said "I am sorry I cannot give you that estimiate because it depends on how fast people eat." Really?
Then our number was skipped because she said they had to get the table ready but there was two other tables ready, I didn't understand it. I saw a customer trying to ask her a question and she turned her back at him and was like you need to go talk to your waiter and the customer was so upset, he just walked away. I think Dora should brush up on her customer service skills and be a little more happier next time. 

I gave 2 stars and put up with the wait because I heard the food was worth it. In the end I was very satified with the food but it just didn't seem like a happy environment. The place seemed stressed out.I'm sure at some point this was a nice hotel but lack of upkeep has driven this place to rock bottom. I guess also my taste is a bit skewed since I frequent the Venetian, but this hotel was free with my company for CES 2011 and I wasn't about to pass that up.

The whole hotel was pretty dirty, I thought at any moment the garage elevator might break or that one day the doors would open and a hobo would be waiting inside with a knife. Also, when I arrived at 10pm, the valet was closed...umm hello..this is Vegas...nothing closes..WHY ARE YOU CLOSED??!!!???

I also took a nap around 2pm and woke up at 6pm with a swollen eye, I blame it either on dirty pillows or one of the cleaning ladies punched me while I was sleeping because they couldn't clean the room...who knows...

I will give them points for having 76 cent water in the gift shops, comfy beds and fast room service (we asked for extra towels to be brought up.) Also, (being a girl) taking a shower and having the mirror fog up is a pain in the ass since we need to get ready afterwards. I don't know what crazy system they had but the middle of the mirror never fogged up and let it be known that I take hot enough showers to where you can't see your hand in front of your face.

Also if you want to gamble in peace, this is the place, practically dead in the casino any time of the day I came to find out. 

So not bad enough for one star..not good enough for 3...I have experienced better, actually.

I mean, just walking this place and you can feel something is missing. It for sure needs renovation.

It's really not fair. This place opened in the 50's and you can tell it's iconic and has had many stars and amazing people walk through it's halls.

However, time has clearly passed this place over. The carpets are stained and dirty, the casino feels outdated. Even the shows don't seem to call to me.

I've made a conscientious decision to plant my ass in the hotel where I'm staying at (that's the whole point, right?) throughout my weekend trips; and so I didn't linger anywhere and stayed put here.

Upon check-in, the clerk gave us the wrong room number. We had some girls come with us in a different room and they gave us another horror story of a rude check in clerk.

When I tried to watch TV, I kept fiddling around. Found the porn channel and they were charging over $12 to view it. No thanks. Internet porn is free. Thanks.

So after roaming the casino, I found a bar that seems to be the reason why I gave this place an extra star. $1 beer. That's truly something special to have.

As for everything else. The food court is dismal and one friend told me the service was horrible at the Indian food place. The Banana Leaf Cafe was horrible as well. I didn't even bother with any of the shows because none of them appealed to me, unfortunately.

The R Steak restaurant was the only saving grace here as well. The only gem to be found and clearly a reason for you to visit the Riviera.

The pool was pretty neat, up until I went by the 3-ft area with the stairs to climb out and found a bunch of debris and a floating Corona cup. Not quite cool.

To make matters worse, my final night I ended up taking a walk towards Encore/Wynn, a hotel who clearly over-shadows the Riviera by a long shot. Upon entrance I can spot a difference IMMEDIATELY. There were so many beautiful women walking around and even if you took that away, you had people walking everywhere, it got so full at one point that we  almost got lost in the midst of it all.

Their nightclub 'Tryst' has more swag than the whole of the Riviera combined. And I HATE the word Swag.

Finally going back to my hotel in the wee hours and I just felt deflated. No nightclub to speak of, no night-life. Just old folks gambling.

Which brings me back to my original notion. It's not fair that an older establishment like this should be compared to by other more modern casino's. There is a certain charm to this place that should be absorbed. Unfortunately, in this day and age, I don't think that's enough to stay on par or ahead of the competition.Good concept and nice menu set up, just wish the quality of the food had been a little better. The burgers were alright but nothing special. They were a bit dry and not too flavorful but the toppings I picked helped make up for it. I topped my medium sized burger with cheese, bacon, an egg, and the obligate onions/lettuce/mayo combo. I absolutely LOVE getting a fried egg on my burger because it adds a nice rich creaminess to the experience. I was underwhelmed with the toppings offered but the standards they do offer (and the fried egg, of course) will be enough for most people. 

I tried their skinny fries but felt they were bland and boring, and I wasn't into their super thick onion rings either. If I were to go to Fatburger again I'd probably try their dogs or chicken sandwiches just to see how they stack up but I think if you're in a pinch and hungry late at night while passing by, it would be worth it to grab something here.

Though you are in Vegas, so if you're not too intoxicated or tired to walk a little farther then you'll probably find better options within a block.I was only slightly surprised when I pulled this place up to find it was a one and a half star establishment. I really think the low rating is attributed to the fact that people are hyped up expecting a bar like the one from the movie...

Sorry ladies and gents, this place is a pseudodive-bar located by a casino entrance...dead give away to what you really can expect. The bar itself is nothing special. Its extremely overcrowded with men and pretty much the only place you can find girls is on stage or behind the bar. I can see why this would be disappointing because its like a strip club with everyone scantily clad yet showing absolutely nothing interesting...

Moreover, the only people who get "free shots" (like in the movie) are the girls who actually get up on stage...I figure this is how they keep girls around long enough to lure more men into the place. OH but there are usually people standing around passing out free admission/no cover passes by the elevator like 15 feet away...so look for that if you wanna just go in and check it out!Only because the male strippers were funny as hell just trying to be sexy but fuck... if we don't want a dance from you don't bother us... HIS NAME IS CHILI... ugly as hell guy who kept trying to give us deals so he can dance for us.. which none of us wanted... some of the guy dancers were really nice though.. I met a guy who was from San Jose, CA pretty funny.. but seriously main room girl dancers NO FUCKING SEATS.. WTF.. but we kept getting asked to join the guys who had bachelor parties but we didn't wanna sit with them.. and saw a guy getting a hand job by some ugly stripper... HAHHAHA.I knew I wanted to look at rings before I walked in.  I was not greeted.  As soon as I got someone's attention.  I asked if the gold ring came without stones.  He said no, and turned his attention to other customers.  I had more questions and wanted to find the right gift for my brother.  I was turned off he made no suggestions and did not care to help me.  I waited minutes longer to at least try them on and see them outside of the case.  A lady finally came, she was pleasant and answered my questions.  Ultimately I wasn't interested in making a purchase from the experience I had.Wow, I'm really glad I was able to avoid this place for so long. I finally got sucked in and went for dinner with a co-worker. I thought it was bad stuff. Terrible and flavorless - tasted like crappy TGI Friday but in the jungle. Honestly, didn't enjoy anything from appetizer or entree ordered. I do not suggest it - touristy and awful. Cool waiter saved this from being a total disaster.I may have stopped by on an off day, but over the weekend, we stopped by to try out their pizza buffet (since CiCis closed down the street). The price was $6.49 per person, so I wasn't expecting a whole lot. On this particular day, the pizza felt like it was under the heat lamp for way too long and there was nothing really fresh. The fried chicken was dry and soggy. I can honestly say, the only thing that was decent was the pepperoni pizza, as that was edible. Everything else, meh..We used to come here alot when it first opened , then the novelty wore out .
         Claim jumper has good food and huge portions and a very large and diverse  menu .  They have pretty much covered there bases as far as pleasing a far ranging customer base, while still maintaining some type of quality.   I know i said the menu was huge and diverse , but as much as we used to eat here there menu didn't change much,so we moved on , anyway we decided to eat here or i should say i did.
                        The food , for apps we had the fireroasted artichokes and parmesan crusted zucchini.  The artichoke needed a little more fire roasting but was still good.  The zucchini was really good it had a nice crispy coating and  had very good flavor. 
                     I had the citrus chix salad ( lettuce, apples, dried cranberries, mandarin orange, blue cheese , candied pecans and jerk chix.)  It was a good salad with a nice sweet vinergerette, great texture, crunchy, chewy tart , sweet .  It was good but did not blow me away, kinda disappointing.
              I always order this as a side salad with my entree ,but decided to order the dinner salad portion it comes with chix.  I was always impressed when I ordered it as an  app. salad so i was expecting more out of the dinner salad.   Overall , I think they lost a step since i first came here, maybe the economy  , had something to do with it ,before on a Saturday night at 7 pm like on this night it would be a 30 min wait for sure.   Tonight seated right away and the restaurant remained half full.
                     I hope they bounce back to the claim jumper i remember, Because in -laws coming to town and they really enjoy it here.I only gave 2 stars based on prior visits while Dr. Carney was still there. Now on their own merits they would get 0 stars.  Now it is a total numbers racket and today they took my dogs into the back to get their shots. ALWAYS before they gave the shots in front of us. I'm quite doubtful that we got anything other than a rather large bill.  All services are a la carte including various exams which used to and should be all inclusive. Money, money, money, ching, ching, ching. I'm all for making money but for God's sake provide a little service for the buck. Me:" My dog's rear legs shake when she stands" Them: "Would you like to pay us to examine her for that?" Me: "I am paying for an exam." Them: "That's not included". Dental exams are free but of course the cleaning is $150.

We are looking for a new vet. Any suggestions?They only get 2 stars because the food was good. The service was horrible. The female bartender with the dark hair and a knitted white hat completely  ignored the women in the bar and only  seemed to be attentive to the single guys. Several different times, I had to wave my hands around and yell just to get service.  When we wanted to order food, the waiter ( a young guy with buddy holly glasses) was too busy chatting with his friend over at a table to take our order. I had to scream out for the bartender to order our food. We stayed and waited for friends who recommended the place, otherwise, we would've left.If you are on a diet this is the place to go, we felt as if we were on a salad, soup and breadstick restriction.  By the time our second soup refill made it to our table, which would have been still the first on the GV OG location, we were looking to getting out of there. Avoid the place.This place came highly rated on yelp so I was excited to try it for myself. Read that I must try "the Bobbie" which is a turkey, stuffing, and cranberry style thanksgiving sandwich.  Received my sandwich only to find that it was cold and dry which was a surprise to me. It had an almost leftover feel which I would find acceptable only the following days after Thanksgiving. I went up to ask to have it run through they oven to heat it up only to be swiftly shot down with a "we don't heat up The Bobbie...."  

Next time I want a Thanksgivings style sandwich in Vegas Ill stick with Earls of Sandwich down the street.  Thanks for the disappointment Capriottis....There are only a few good things to say about the dinner at Lupo. The service was reasonable and the wine glass portions were more like 1.5 or 2 glass portions, but at the price of about a glass.

Unfortunately, the food wasn't very good. I feel like any top chef can come into a city and put his stamp on a restaurant and feel free to charge whatever he wants.

Our spaghetti was just OK, and the prosciutto on our pizza was a bit stiff, and as such, unappetizing.

While Lupo isn't horrible, there are much better places to go for the price.The only thing super about this Super Wal-Mart is the length of their lines.  They are always super long!  I wish this place had self check out that would make things sooooo much easier.  I stop by here on my way to work sometimes to pick something up to eat for lunch later.  I tried to do that yesterday and only 2 registers were open and there was at least 5 people w/full shopping carts in line.  The line kept growing and growing and growing and growing.  A junkies dream come true.  I had to make a choice of being late for my job I dislike or being on time and arriving empty handed.  I didn't wanna be late so I left.  Before I left a black lady was getting irritated and yelled about the lines being long.

The second to last time I was here a new line had just opened up and I had to power walk to it quickly and sneakily cut in front of an old couple so I could get out of here in a timely manner.  This place is a retail warzone.  Not really but the lines annoy me.So now that I am the second one to review the Cinco De Mayo Massacre I will sail away in the boat of Asshole with Matthew C. I understand Cinco De Mayo is like a national holiday for drinking and eating lard filled Mexican food but holy frijoles this place was ridiculous.  As far as I know one of our fearless leaders called and made prior arrangements for seating for our group. Well, by the looks of it, they reserved the waiting area for us and forgot that we wanted to eat.  

My night started off crappy after standing at the bar trying to get the attention of the ladies working the bar for about 20 minutes before leaving the bar empty handed and frustrated. We then finally got seated and the waiter asked us what we wanted to drink... We ordered  Margaritas in hope we would be put into a Tequila Coma and that was not the case.. It was like pounding a bottle of Margarita mix hold the tequila. 

Next Misti Y.  was awesome enough to hook the table up with the table side guac, and I happened to be sitting with a group of other "Hot and Spicy" fans so we asked for our bowl to be HOT.... I think they took the lead of the person making the margaritas and kept out the main ingredient. Jalapeno. 

So by this point it was damn near Seis De Mayo and they took our order. We all put our orders in at the same time and i will say that all the food came out quickly... Well almost all the food... Matt C. was sitting to my right with nothing on the table in front of him. we all tried to get the attention of the waiters and when they finally listened to us, we said," he did not get his food" the waiter said okay let me go get it. About 10 minutes later we had to stop him again and this time he had to ask Matt what he had ordered and basically started this process all over again.. Horrible!!!!

Yes, I did open the door for them to earn another star back from us in which they did, but I am glad Matthew C. did not end up with a chipped tooth or something worse. 

I will not be back to this location... Esto era horrible y nunca voy a estar de vueltaStaff in front are fakes except a select few that actually say hi.  Salesman are nice when you sign up, but are two face when you're actually a member.  Some of the trainers are cool and some I just wouldn't listen to.  Most of the guys are upper body beast that walk on straws for legs, but not all.  Are your legs not part of your body? Yes, we can tell some of you are juiced up.  Who cares though, its your life. Lol.  Smoothies are good but overpriced.  Girls are nice to look at but it seems like all of em are conceded.  You're a living, eating, breathing, shitting creature like everyone else, shut off the insecure force field. 

All in all....this gym has good equipment. ..go around noon or midnight to avoid the above lol.

And advice for the staff...treat others how you want to be treated.  

And thanks to the cleaning staff...you guys need praise and a raise.Ok, I probably had one of the most irritating experiences here this past weekend.  All started when I got my room and then they send me to the concierge to get my parking pass.  The dude then tries to make an appointment for me to come to they're "owners update meeting." If I go, then he'll throw out some Vegas shows and freebies at me.  It's the same spiel I get every time and the goodies have all become crap items now. So really, it's not worth me sitting in an hour presentation.  But, I figure if I have time I'll try to come by Sunday "if possible".  The dude then makes an appointment for me and gives me something to sign.  I notice at the bottom he writes $20 and I ask him about it.  

Concierge: Oh yes, you're required to pay $20 if I you don't show up.

Me: HELL NO!  You shoulda let me know about that beforehand instead of trying to make me sign it without telling me! 

Concierge: I'm sorry sir, don't worry about it, I'll wave the fee.

Me: Yeah, after I just caught you in the act!  If I didn't catch you, I'd be stuck going or have to pay!

He then rips the paper he wanted me to sign and says, "God Bless You."  Like I'm supposed to feel bad for him trying to swindle me.  Yeah, I caused a scene and I was pissed! I've been an owner with Monarch Grand Vacations for over 5 years now and not once had I experienced such shadyness. That's total bs!!!!  

Also, during our stay we had to wait over an hour and a half to get more towels.  I was about to go downstairs and get it myself since it'd be much faster.  Because of the delay we were unable to get ready in time for a show we wanted to see and ended up having dinner really late.  Plus, one day during our stay, we took out the Do Not Disturb sign to have our room cleaned and guess what???  It wasn't cleaned! AAARRGGH!!!

To top it all off, when I checked out of the room I had a stimulating conversation with the lady at the front desk.

Front Desk: So how was your stay, Sir?
Me: Not so good.
Front Desk: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

That was it! WTF??  Why even ask, if you have no care as to why my stay was not so good. It's like they got robots at the counter! They even had a problem with their computers and they couldn't give me a receipt. The lady at the front desk wanted me to have a seat and wait. By that time, I'm fed up with this place and I just tell them to email it to me.(I'm still waiting on that email and will probably never get it!)

I can't believe this.  I've been hyping this place up to my family for months since it's the first time they'd be visiting.  I even told them how they could become owners.  But really, I couldn't justify recommending the place after the horrible experience I had.

I'm sending a letter to management about my experience but I'm afraid it may be handled by deaf ears.  We will see.  I'm still an owner and I like the place. The room is comfortable and the large pool is great. It's the people that need work.  I'll be back again and the service better have improved or I may seriously look into selling my timeshare.Good sandwiches but horrible service.  Staff of young boys are rude and unprofessional.I was sorta unimpressed.  I have been to many of these strip mall nail joints, and know what to expect.  However, I would not return to this one.  It is way out of my bubble of safe places to go to (within a certain distance from my house or various other places I run errands) but I was on that side of town and needed my Gelish nails redone.

The place was dirty, I don't mean maggots and moldy food dirty, just a lot of nail dust, dust and general untidiness.  It was the end of the day, so I can forgive it (but it was clearly not from just one day)

The tools weren't taken out of individual pouches like I am used to and just looked sketchy. But since she wasn't clipping cuticles, since that isn't in their gelish application like it is at C&N where I was going before, I wasn't too worried.  

The other problem was there weren't using the Official Gelish products. They used the colors, but not the base, or the cleaner like most places do.  

My Gelish also lifted super fast.  It doesn't last long for me anyways, but this one was the fastet lift ever.  I gave up on Gelish after.  

I hate giving bad reviews.  Please forgive me!  

OH! And I paid a lot more there than I did at C&N for less of a service.For some reason, everytime I go to this Home Depot (which unfortunately it is the closest one to me) I have horrible luck with the service and products. There is always 1 person to greet me at the door to send me in the right direction but after I walk away from the entrance door, i'm left on my own. I can never find anyone to help and when I finally do, they have no idea what I need because I had to travel across the store to find them in the first place and what I need is not their area of expertise. Almost every time I go there, when I am looking for something specific, they never have enough or I can't find the product. I like Home Depot the company, but this location is awful.They were fast- I got most things that I ordered within 10 minutes, but was quickly disappointed. Key word being most- they forgot several of our orders for well over a half hour and brought out the wrong beer for one person- we got a comped beer but still not a promising start. The tuna was a bit too grey. The yellowtail nigiri was described as "crispy" by one of our companions, who also claimed to have gotten a bone in his bite. The rolls were stuffed to the gills with imitation crab and a few of the fish pieces were picked off due to their unpalateable look. We've eaten at a lot of sushi places, and I was stoked when I heard people actually speaking Japanese! Plus the scallop sashimi, unlimited uni and oysters was a huge selling point for me, which was the main reason I harassed my party of four into going. While it's nice that these items are offered, the overall impact left a lot to be desired. We tried the salmon- which was OK, the highlight of the sashimi. I got scallops- a bit dull and chewy, oysters- which were fresh-ish but not fabulous, shared the "Skreem inor gazim" which was one of the better moments, a bit of soft shell crab [soooo much better at Bluefin!], a few mediocre pieces of yellowtail and tuna... one of our companions opted out of eating anything, the other barely picked at their food. I had high expectations and really wanted to like this place- I mean, AYCE sashimi?! OMG, that'd be AWESOME if the fish were more appetizing. I'll stick with Bluefin, the fish tastes a whole lot fresher and I like their in-house specials [cajun albacore, special rolls, appetizers, etc] a lot more, plus the lower price. The poki at Hikari didn't compare to the poki at Island grill or Yama. It was fun being able to speak japanese with them, and they were fairly attentive, but not worth the trip from my side of town and not worth the price for the quality of the fish. :{ Bummer!Underwhelmed
Plain and boring interior, Snooty waiters at the bar and pizzeria, staff is short and slightly rude. Pizza is good but not the best, definitely not worth waiting hours for. Overall lack luster. Will I be back? Probably not. Will I recommend to friends and out of town guests? Probably not. I can go to La Piazza Al Forno in Glendale for brick oven pizza that is much better, less wait time,  more options on their menu and genuine friendly service.I finally dined here for the first time last night and I have been meaning to come for 8 years but never managed to justify the long wait.  However, yesterday we were at the Science Center and it was early enough to not have too long of a wait, if you can say that 1.5 hours is not too long.  We grabbed a few glasses of wine at the Blanco Bar next door and settled in for our wait.  What a cute place, old rustic European country decorum in a renovated house from the 20's.  Very charming and pleasant however the wait staff...not so much.  Very odd thing here, as the staff is not outwardly rude but they are aloof and disinterested in their customers, at least from what we observed.  I had to go and ask someone for a menu and the girl who was waiting in our section had come by several times to fill water and get things for her other customers sitting right next to us.

We were finally seated and I guess I didn't specify that since we were waiting all that time that we wanted a table, as we ended up sitting at the bar, which sort of sucked.  It is a cramped situation with no real place to put your feet and I kept hitting my knees on the front of the bar.  My feet went to sleep several times from tucking them on the rung of my chair as that was the only place for them to go.  I kept bumping into my poor neighbor while I was trying to eat since her back was turned towards me.  I think she must have figured out by sitting that way she could put her feet on her friend's chair rung too, more options!  In short, I felt a bit like Alice in Wonderland after she had eaten the cake that made her grow so large.

Finally the food came and I totally agree with Gabriel's review.  Very, very fresh ingredients but sorely lacking in seasoning!  We had the Caprice Salad, the mozzarella wrapped in prosciutto and the Margherita Pizza.  All of which were made from very fresh high quality ingredients but I found that I was salting everything!  The food was simply too bland.  I do not understand what the hype is all about frankly.  I don't understand why the long wait, outside of the fact that the place is like a friggen dollhouse!  And the waiter behind the bar was arrogant, like everyone who works there.  He could care less about who we were and if anything, I felt like we may have been putting him out a bit.  How dare we order more food and wine!  Christ I needed more wine to deal with the attitude and seating.  And OVER PRICED  for sure.

I think Cibos and the Parlor have much better food and you don't have to wait an eternity to get a table.  In fact, I'm coming to realize that Cibos is the best brick oven pizza in here in the valley.  

At least I can take this place off my list and to be honest I will not be going back.Was so excited to eat here after all the hype. A bit disappointed. CIBO has much better food and much more variety!  My husband doesn't like "fufu" food so difficult for him to pick a pizza!  He chose the Bolognese Parpadelle (meat spaghetti) and it was bland. My pizza came out a bit burnt.This review is for the stadium itself and the ambiance, not the team/mgmt/etc.

The stadium is probably the ugliest, least interesting, industrial, darkest stadium I've been in.  I've been to 15-20 venues and I'm always depressed watching a game here.  I get it, its a dome, but why it was designed with almost NO windows/light is beyond me.

The content on the jumbotron/entertainment between innings is boring and causes the crowd to lose interest.

Finally, the rattlesnake "rattle" which sounds like super loud radio static is terrible.

I like the dbacks, but ugh this stadium makes me sad.Literally a clone of Miller Park in Milwaukee, from the layout, big screen in dead center field, retractable roof, and Fridays Front Row in left field. It truly is a mirror image with better weather...but little atmosphere, fewer beer options, no sausage races, and worst of all, since it is in the heart of downtown Phoenix, no place to tailgate!For being a discount clothing and shoe store umm... some things like purses are not very discount for the damage or quality issues it may have. 

Its always like zoo in there, just to but one item would be ridiculous for the amount of time you would have to wait so not worth it.It was my first time in Vegas and I went with my friend John, now John is a vegas junkie, usually he travels out there in November and March every year. He loves hitting ther strip during March Madness.

Anyway, he had found a deal at his travel agent, he booked us two different deals, one was at Treasure Island, that deal included airfare. The other deal was two days and three nights at the Stratosphere, free. When you checked in they gave you 100 dollars in free slot play, 50 bucks cash, and free buffet. All we had to do was check in, go to the room, mess up the beds and go stay in comfort at  Treasure Island. One catch, we had to participate in a slot tourniment one of the days we were there. You had to sign up at the front desk. The tourny was every hour on the hour from 8 am to 8pm. So we signed up for 2 pm the next day to fullfill our requirements to recieve the free room.

The Stratosphere was in some sort of finacial trouble it seems and were giving rooms away to get people to gamble in their hotel. So we got our room keys (NO BELLHOPS?) we took a very old, creeky elevator to our floor and when John opened up his door he noticed people in bed watching TV, it was pretty funny, not to the people in bed though, but I still chuckle about it when he brings it up. They got it straighten out and apologized.

The place was a hole, I mean a real dump. We couldn't wait to get out of there and check in at Treasure Island. We each had fifty bucks cash from the Stratosphere and returned the next day to play in the tourny, I did'nt do very well, there but i did dump the hundred dollers in free slot play in a 5 dollare machine and walked out well ahead.

But seriously, there are so many nice places to stay in Vegas.

PS, rode the roller coaster at the top, I will never do that again, that is one crazy ass ride!We had beef pad thai and their special, #68 (difficult to remember spelling, kaag omm?), for 20.

- Hidden gem fail. You'd think this place would be great: delicious food at a ridiculously cheap price, bc its in some ghetto plaza, but it was far from a diamond in the roof.
- YES! when  you go inside, its beautiful. Pretty pictures, nice tables, and huge selection of wines. They even have a bar. 
- This place needs to be in downtown! Deceiving!
- I ADMIT! pad thai tasted great. but if you can finish it in literally 5 big bites for $10, NO WAY. Filler FAIL!
- 68: inedible. They put so many different spices to get the right flavor, that at when you're almost finished with it, you can't eat it bc the curry has too much spices and crap. 
- The bowl is CURRY (which to me, honestly is soup, lol, but really not bc its just without coconut milk) is about the size of a bowl of cereal or as much as you get when you make maruchan. haha
- This place should be called TAPAS of Siam!!!Not the best in town, and no clear vegitarian/vegan options. I always have to adjust my order to fit my dietary needs and then pray it comes out correctly. My suggestion is to walk across the parking lot to Komol Thai, way better and more bang for your buck!The Osaka on Sahara is great.  The Osaka on W. Lake Mead Blvd not-so-much.  Amazing that this restaurant can drag down one that has repeatedly been on the "Best of Las Vegas" list.  Sushi was nothing to scream about.  Even though it was on the menu, staff seemed a bit bewildered when we ordered green tea ice cream.  'Twas horrible.  Tasted like a chalky green tea powder mix.2 stars: Meh. I've experienced better.

Nothing is as polarizing as the simple hamburger.

There's so many different arguments that can be made as to what makes the best burger. 

Simple and cheap at some stand that's been around since the turn of the century? Gourmet and requiring a credit application to order at a celebrity chef's latest brainchild? 
And every single combination and permutation in between. 

Hubert Keller is kind of accomplished in the same way one would say Matisse was a good painter, or Larry Bird was a good shot with a basketball. 

With that kind of resume, comes a certain amount of pressure to perform. 

And that's my fundamental issue with Burger Bar.

It's been around for a while now, and it's definitely on its way down.

I've been here more than a few times, and after the novelty of the Rossini burger wore off, including texting pictures of the receipt to prove my street cred, and the novelty of making a few custom burgers - ooh, i can choose from different grades of meat, that are all pretty good, and don't really make a substantial difference once ground up and seasoned, to 99.97% of eaters,  this place strikes me as a big buck version of Fuddruckers that happens to have a celebrity chef endorsement. 

Seriously. Think about it. 

They both offer hamburgers with different grades of beef. 
They both offer burgers with different types of meat.
They both offer customized toppings.
They both offer multiple types of fries.
They both have milkshakes and floats.
They both serve beer.
They both cost more than in & out. 

The last 2-3 times I went to Burger Bar, the service has been mediocre and delivered with absentee-level attention. 

The food has been inconsistent as well, and what kind of irked me the most recent time was that I created a spicy burger, and when I told the waitress that there weren't enough jalapeno's, she brought me a thimble sized cup with more sliced peppers, and I found an extra charge for them on my bill. 

Seriously? 

You're charging $14 bucks for a burger and you want to put another $0.85 cents on my tab because I mentioned that the burger didn't have enough jalapenos on it when it came out of the kitchen? 

Some nerve. 

There are so many other burger spots and so many other celebrity chefs in Vegas with burger spots that this place is completely irrelevant at this point. 

Unless you are here to try the Rossini on an expense account meal, don't bother.I dined at the bar during my stay here at Caesar's. I had to wait for just a few minutes for a seat to open. I got their white peach margarita to start. The margarita was made strong and well. I couldn't taste the white peach but it was very good nonetheless.

I ordered my appetizer and entree based on the recommendation of the bartender. The blue corn pancake with duck for appetizer and the ancho chile honey glazed salmon for entree. The blue corn pancake was more like a crepe which paired perfectly with the BBQ duck. This dish was very good! 

The salmon was cooked well but unfortunately it was too salty to eat. The first few bites were delicious - smokey flavors with a sweetness - but once I was working towards the middle of the filet, it became just salt. Then I found a big bone in my salmon as well. I left the rest of the fish untouched - at this point, it was inedible.

I rarely send back a plate and I did not send it back this time either. The bartender noticed and asked so I told him what was wrong with the dish. He offered the kitchen to remake it for me, which I appreciated, but it was late and I was already thrown off by the dish.

I was disappointed by my experience with the entree at Mesa. I wished it was edible.Irksome gimmicky pub atmosphere, like a classier Bennigan's.I like this place and think it is one of the better Madison Thai restaurants, though I think the other location on University is better and more consistent. Had take out and only one dish was memorable. Still, it's my go to take out place when I am visiting the parents on the west side of town.They seriously have THE coolest set up & ambiance- but it ends there.

Food is overpriced.

Hardly any healthy options.

Servers were overloaded so it took forever to get anything.What a disappointment.  The hotel and rooms is dated but pretty clean.   I'm sure it was great in its day, but there was worn carpet, mystery stains, the bathroom mirror frame was delaminating, the mattress creaked, wall paper was torn, and the wardrobe had veneer peeling off of it.   Right outside our room there was a hole kicked in the wall.  On the main floor where its designed to be Paris streets, everything is dingy and depressing, the novelty wears off as you walk for probably a half mile to the parking garage or monorail.  The front desk is surrounded by casino, so you have to walk through the smokey slot area to check in and then get to your room.

The cable tv has about 5 basic cable channels we would all expect, and the rest are weird international channels in other languages.  Wifi is $15 per day and dropped the connection consistently.Originally posted on winodepot.com

Hummm.....where do I start. This was recommended to me by my dinner companion when I went to Ame, a palate I trust. So even after many disappointing fine dining restaurants on hotel properties, I figured I would give Nobu a shot. Should of known better...

Standard menu as well as two different tier of omakase available, $100 & $135 if I recall correctly. We decided to do the $135 version for all three of us, three cold course, two hot course, followed by soup, sushi, and dessert.

Writing this up a week later, can't remember exactly what we had, weekend in Vegas tends to short circuit one's memory.  
Think we started with a course of Bonito sashimi, which was fresh and nice flavor combinations. The two other cold course wasn't particularly memorable, very apparent since I can't recall much details on them. Moving onto the first hot course, which I do remember, but for the wrong reason. Some sort of white fish (Cod or Halibut), done in a sweet and sour stir-fry style with touch of spice. Sorry, but if this is what I am looking for, I'll take my money to Panda Express or any food court at a local mall.
The second hot course was a steak, filet is the cut...I think. Topped with a piece of seared foie gras, couple slices of egg plant, and Shitake mushroom. Probably the best course of the evening and one of the very few steak course I've enjoyed as part of tasting menu, definite a rarity.
Soup, sushi and dessert were brought up to conclude the omakase menu, all pedestrian, nothing to write home about.

Not only was the food not very interesting, the decoration of the space also seem kind of odd. What's suppose to be a fine dining restaurant, really has a very cheap feel to it. For anyone thinking about trying this place, think again, avoid if possible.Do you like big checks and hype...then this is the place for you. I have heard tons of great things about this restaurant but at the end of dinner I was really let down. 

Things I liked: 
Rock Shrimp Tempura with creamy spicy sauce 
Miso Cod 
Fresh Yellowtail Sashimi with jalapeno 

Things I didn't like: 
The waitress was not very friendly. She informed us that our sushi dishes would come out last...guess what?  The sushi came out second...of course, we ate the sushi and our waitress came up to our table and asked if we wanted more food...she had no idea that we didn't even get our warm food. Please dont  tell us our meal must end  with cold sushi and then the food runners can not even get it right. When you are paying this much for dinner, you expect to get treated with some love. 

The sushi rolls were extremely fishy too. My friends told me that it is the seaweed that they use...all I know is that I wanted to gag. 

Also we asked for two orders of the Fresh Yellowtail Sashimi with jalapeno and they put both orders on one plate. That is fine but we received 11 pieces...so does that mean when you get one order you only get 5.5 pieces? The math does not add up. My friends told me that they noticed that they have been shorted before. Wow and my friends still like this place...Oh yeah expense account!!!

Small Dishes with Big Prices!!!   If you are on an expense account then I recommend...go for it...run up the bill and try everything. If you are paying for it out of your pocket, then I would save my money for my kids college fund!!!Night number two was NOBU located at the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino. Our server was younger and unpolished. The menu was overwhelming with choices and pricey. The three of us agreed on what we wanted and away we went. Out of what we ordered there are two highlights, the yellow tail with jalapeno and the Kobe beef. Again, none of the rolls were spectacular; in fact we sent one back because it tasted too fishy. I didn't feel it was worth what I spent, and felt I have had better sushi in Colorado and Houston!

FIND PICTURES ON http://jenn-uncorked.comLike the location of Monte Carlo, don't really care for the hotel rooms.  The foyer where you wait for check-in is quite nice looking.  It makes you feel like you're staying at a really nice place.  That's about the only nice part of the hotel that I can remember...

Rooms = Our room was at the end of the hall, right next to the fire alarm exit door.  Standard 2 queen room that had a leaky tub faucet.  I thought the room was bland (nothing special about it at all), the window had a hand print, and I swear to you I want to say I saw blood on the walls.  I already felt dirty.  I don't like outdated, non-decorated rooms... I felt like I was staying at one of those INNs or Motels.

I will say that if you're drunk, hungry, and like Mc Donalds... you're in luck.  There's a food court downstairs.  I don't remember what time they are open till, but I do remember being there at one point.  

The hallways are kind of creepy, but that may have just been me.  There was this one time I was leading everyone back to the room... I slid in my room card, but the light kept flashing red.  I knew that we were the very last room next to the fire exit door, but when I looked at the room number it was different - like the numbers had moved around.  I seriously felt like I was in an episode of the Twilight Zone and started freaking out, hahaha... (mind you... yes, I was not sober - just imagine how you would feel).  That's when my friends realized we had just walked down the wrong hallway - each hallway looked exactly the same.

Yes, the rates are cheaper than other hotels on the strip, but my experience here wasn't up to my standards.  I would possibly give Monte Carlo another try if I was on a super tight budget, other than that... the room they gave me was no bueno.Sexy Vegas show - Yes.
Cirque quality - No!

When I go to a Cirque show, I expect to see a lot of impressive acrobatics.

This, in my opinion, was just burlesque with a twist.

If you want a sexy show, then go. If you expect to be impressed by the acrobatics, don't bother.Not worth it. 
For as much as it costs to stay here, the staff should be kissing your ass, not making you feel like you've overstayed your welcome immediately after check-in. 

Add some of the surliest dealers on the planet, and this place is a pass. 

Start of the day, after about 30 minutes at the blackjack tables, Dealer 'X' has been ruthlessly taking all our chips (what are the odds of the dealer hitting blackjack 3 hands out of 5?) We're all taking it lightly, cracking jokes about it. Dealer 'X' is expressionless, seeming annoyed by our presence. 
One of Us: "Dealer X, why so serious? You've barely said anything or even cracked a smile." 
Dealer X: "Maybe I'd talk more if you give me a tip" 
One of Us: "Well for you to get a tip I need to get a winning hand" 
Dealer X with unveiled hostility: "Maybe it's time for you guys to move on" 

We're paying for this abuse?
We moved down the strip to where the regular folk lose their money to good natured dealers. Unless you are chock full of haughty attitude yourself or enjoy being talked down to, I'd recommend you do the same.Ruined birthday surprise!: Our mini suite was great- it had a wet bar, comfortable bed, marble floors and a great view. There were several things wrong of a maintenance type: light bulbs out (dining area and shower), bath tub drain broken, phone near bed broken, profanity in amenities book, and the shower didn't drain.

What really ruined it for me was The Mirage ruining the surprise I had planned for my husband's birthday. I asked for Strawberries and Champagne sent to the room on his birthday. When I called to order this it took the girl 20 minutes to get my name spelled right! It isn't that difficult! Then when we arrived they called my cell to confirm... Hello! I'm with my husband! Then for God know what reason, the stuff shows up 2 days early! And what does the card say??? "Happy B-day Love," not even my name, and they couldn't write out "Birthday"??? Horrible! When I called they apologized and didn't charge me but it had already been ruined. 

I'm kind of tainted by that experience. Otherwise it seems like you are bothering a lot of the staff- from the reception desk to the hostesses. And tipping the bellman for taking the bags from the car to a 'holding area' then tipping a separate guy for taking them to the room? Please! Next time were staying at The Bellagio!

Oh, and a little trick at the pool... go any time of the day and ask an attendant to help you find a chair. They will locate chairs where people have left towels for over an hour and remove them for you! It saves you from being the 'bad' guy!THIS REVIEW IS STRICTLY FOR THE CASINO:

Came here to gamble with some friends.  We joined their players club and played on some slots.  One of the things I noticed was the crappy service from the cocktail waitresses.  They would pass you on by without even asking if you needed something.  But when you finally did flag someone down, they would take your order and never come back!!  It was really frustrating.  I waited a good 20 minutes or so and I finally realized she wasn't coming back with my drink.  I finally gave up and realized the only drink I was going to get was the one that was sitting in my hotel room.  

Slots seemed pretty tight here too.  Kept putting money in, with little to no return.  

Don't think I will be back.Looking at all the reviews, maybe I went on an off night, but I've had better steaks at home on my own grill from the local market.  Went with a group of 9 and ordered the "surf and turf" consisting of the ribeye and a seafood mashed potato combo.

The good - Mashed potatoes were excellent, generous lump seafood, very tasty.  Side dishes also were excellent.

The disappointing - The ribeye.  Ordered it medium rare, as did my friend next to me.  Both of our steaks were probably cooked closer to medium, neither was juicy or tender, there seemed to be no marbled fat content at all, and the texture was almost grainy.

I'll eat everything from In N Out to more foodie type establishments, always with a smile on my face, but this experience was a bit of a shock to me.  I've had ribeyes for 1/3 the price but infinitely better.  

Weird.  But I think I'd rather try somewhere else as I wouldn't want a repeat experience at that price point.Came here Friday for my birthday and it was crappy from the beginning. We walked into our room and they had not cleaned it. There were peoples bags and clothes all over the place. The bathroom was disgusting so we went back down to get another room. They comped us a free buffet which was not enough to make up for moving us to a room with a crappier view. Probably will not stay here again. The casino is boring compared to places like Planet Hollywood.what happened to the lions?!I never like TI much, but now I don't like TI for sure. So we had a bachelorette party over the weekend and everything was booked in advance and I just came along. Right before I arrive, I learned that we got a suite, but only ONE KING SIZE BED. You've got to be kidding me!!?!? Why would they even offer a SUITE with one bed? That's ridiculous and we couldn't get one with Two Beds. So 8 girls crammed into that suite with one bed. We manage to accomodate, but it was horrible. There were two bathrooms which was a good thing, but only one shower and so we all had to take turn with the shower. You can imagine how long it would take to get ready in the morning with 8 girls and one shower. Let's just say 3 hours later we still haven't left the room. 

Back to the hotel. I wanted to gamble and I did. It was dead in the casino. I played Blackjack and I never win no matter what! The dealer always end up with 21 which was ridiculous that I was starting to think the cards were rigged! I go to a lot of casinos and that never happens that 10 hand straight, dealer keeps getting 19, 20, 21. I lost $100 right then and there. BOO! Not a lot of good restaurants either which I will review in a different review.So, yeah, the Imperial Palace is inexpensive and it's right on the strip, but nowadays, the other hotels have reasonable prices too.  Get slot cards from all places and USE THEM...  They'll get you good deals too.  But if you don't gamble, and just want a cheap place to stay then Imperial it is.This is one grimy hotel and casino. Of course I didn't expect much of the IP to begin with, but I was pretty disappointing. I was actually surprised that they had keycards instead of keys. 

Pros:
1) Great location. Centrally located and is on the center strip.
2) Prices are relatively reasonable.
3) You could actually walk onto the patio and have a view of the strip in the penthouse floor.

Cons:
1) Check-in lines at the front desk take forever because they only have a few staff working.
2) Every time I step into the elevator there are more beer bottles and cups lying all over the floor. Feels like the aftermath of a college party.
3) Restaurants aren't the greatest of quality. Only ate here because it was convenient.
4) Casino is pretty small.
5) Rooms are poorly decorated. Looks like they haven't changed the style since the 1990s.I don't mean to be harsh, but I'll never eat there again. 

Sirloin should not be prepared that way, it was flat and tough. I've never had a sirloin that was as tough as that. I got the steak classic, sauce was good, but couldn't deliver the steak. I hear the view is nice on the patio but we ate inside to escape the heat so I had to leave my rating at two stars. FYI, total came out to $31 for 9 ounces of "Sirloin".OK, I admit I'm attracted to any restaurant styling itself a French Bistro, let alone at the Paris in Las Vegas. And when I'm famished, I go directly for my favorite French comfort food -- Steak Frites! Hence my visit to Mon Ami Gabi this week, where I took little note of anything else on the menu and ordered this house specialty.

At MAG, the signature "Steak + Frites" bears little resemblance to its ubiquitous French namesake, as it's a pounded, "triple tenderized" paillard of sirloin covering most of a steak platter and topped with crisp fried ribbons of potato that were difficult to eat gracefully. Amazingly, the chef managed to flash grill it to my specified "rare", but my steak knife really got a workout with the sinews throughout the meat. There was a tasty "amuse bouche" to start (with an extra serving offered by my stellar server Missy), a delicious mini-baguette that would delight most and a very nice wine list by both the glass and bottle.

The patio would always be my choice for dining here, weather permitting, and it's heated in season. With its view of Bellagio's Dancing Waters complete with audible music, this is a good spot for an enjoyable Las Vegas evening meal, but if I were you, I'd order something else. Most around me did and seemed to enjoy their choices. Bon Appetit.Steak was tasty. Service was bad-ok: they didn't clear plates between courses (I had a pile...and they kept walking by) and the service wasn't as friendly as elsewhere.

BIG gripe: they've tried to be 'cool' with their fries - they've fucked it up royally - they're so thin and crispy you can't actually eat them with a fork. A total joke - hence two stars.We came here for the view of the strip.  The ambiance was cool, very Parisian.  They told us we had a 15-20 minute wait, but our buzzer began buzzing within 5 minutes.  We went to the check in and there were 4 people working the check in counter, and it seemed nobody knew what to do.  They said, oh, two more minutes please.  (Then why did you buzz us?!) Two different people said, "Melissa, party of 4" while we stood directly in front of them and said Melissa, party of 4, yet it took another minute for someone to walk us to our seats outside.  It took some time to get served, and while 3 of us enjoyed our coffee once we ordered, it took at least 10 minutes for our fourth girl to get her cappuccino.  The menus were disgusting, covered in food, and one of the coffee cups had to be returned because it was dirty.  The menu was surprisingly filled with lots of options.  I had the eggs Benedict special which was just okay.  The eggs weren't juicy which is the whole part of eggs Benedict, the yolks were 3/4 of the way cooked.  My friend ordered the nutella waffles and seemed disappointed because the nutella was inside and pretty sparse.  Don't come here for the food, its just okay...come here for the people watching!Terrible service and terrible nachos.. large portion..didn't matter..took a couple no bites and left the rest for the dumpster diversGreatly Disappointed

 We spent 3 nights at this hotel during our stay for a conference in Las Vegas in September 2005.
The room was adequate...but we expected much more for the amount of money we paid.
The pool is always crowded - to a point where it's unpleasant. It's a beautiful pool, however, they close it frequently to cater to private parties - as early as 5PM.
During our last night, the hotel decided to have a party for, what the security department said was 10,000 people in the courtyard, which about 50% of the rooms face. It started at 8PM and continued until at least 1PM. They had the sound system blaring and it was unbearable. They are more interested in making money off of private parties than keeping their customers happy. In order to have 10,000 people - you need a VENUE - not a POOL outside of everyone's windows.
However, upon our complaint (since we had an early flight to catch we had to sleep!) they did find us a new room quickly. They didn't offer to move all of our stuff for us, but they did bring up the key. The room we were moved to was almost worth the $230 a night they charged. Almost.
So, if you're planning a stay on the strip, I have two pieces of advice:
1. Book EARLY so you're not stuck, and
2. Do NOT stay at the Flamingo.
The Hilton Company should be ashamed!
P.S. Our last stay was at the Luxor which was great...check it out!We stayed here October 20th & 21st, 2012.   The Cons: The Hotel is worn down, rooms have been upgraded, but poorly.  The floors are the plastic wood and the TV's are small 32' flat screens.   The carpet in the hallways are so old they are buckling up.  Yes, in Vegas, the rooms are mainly for sleeping, but a decent room always makes the stay all that much nicer.  The air is stale and rooms have low ceilings which I can touch and I am only 5'3".   We used to stay here regularly in the mid to late 90's, but the Hotel has definitely gone down.  Sunday night the electricity went completely out in the north wing -all 28 floors!  The elevators worked, but no water on the upper floors.  Electricity was out for about 3-4 hours, but was restored by 11:00pm.  
The Pros:  The Lobby is still presentable and their pools are still nice. Lots of plants, birds, waterfalls, picture spots.   Self-check in is a plus.   Carlos and Charlies is an ok close place for drinks and decent meal.   Margaritaville is conveniently located for a nearby drink hangout.  Conveniently located in the middle of the strip.  Don't think we'll stay here again anytime soon.   
The Recession shows on this hotel and per the reviews, it seems like other Hotels are in disrepair.  
Sad.Arrived around 2 AM. on Saturday morning.  Washed up and went down stairs to check things out.  Started to play some machines for about 20 minutes and noticed there were no cocktail waitresses.  OK... so i went to the bar and ordered two drinks, belvedere sprite and Bombay Sapphire with tonic.  It was about $21.00. The drinks were very watered down and my girlfriend didn't even finish hers.  Ended up going to the little market inside the hotel and making our own drinks. Buffet was very generic. Not coming back.Not a fan...my husband and I took our first trip away from our daughter with friends. We picked this hotel because all our friends were staying there, from the website we were under the impression that the hotel was recently remodeled. If by remodeled you mean 1980's style bathrooms-tub and sink draining-optional, by heating and A/C, be prepared to heat the hall, not your room, if you like arctic temps, A/C will be right up your alley.... Cold? Too damn bad.....only sheets provided. But I must say the upside was the staff-minus those annoying Windham reps-R-U-D-E (well most of them). I definitely wouldn't recommend this resort  to friend and family. Time to step it up....I recently stayed at the Luxor while in Las Vegas for a convention at the Mandalay Bay. I stayed in the East Tower (not the pyramid) and found the layout to be a bit disorganized to get from the lobby to your room and from your room back out to the strip or other hotels. It's not a big deal, but you can certainly tell that the towers were an afterthought and not very well planned. The in room non-wireless internet was nearly unusable which seems a bit poor in 2011! The room itself was clean and well maintained. The staff were pleasant. I would recommend that if you're looking for something other than a cheap place to sleep you find another hotel. If in-room internet access is important certainly find somewhere else to stay.Terrible customer service all around. Front desk, both Starbucks, food court, buffet... everywhere. Rude and incompetent employees.  The one exception is the bar staff at the pool.  Those guys were really cool. The only reason I'm giving 2 stars instead of 1 is because the rooms were clean, comfortable, and affordable.  Still not worth staying there ever again.

Ashley, a front desk/check-in receptionist is outrageously rude.  I'm sorry for anyone who encounters her.  She's young, long dark hair... rolls her eyes a lot and gives answers like, "I don't know, I don't work in house keeping" when you ask her when your room might be available to check in.

Perry, a manager at the front, is also entirely useless.  We came at 3:00 to check in, as that's the designated check-in time, and our room was not ready.  He apparently could not find out at all when it might be ready.  Last I checked, housekeeping has walkie talkies on them and can easily be reached.  He told us the room could be ready in 5 minutes or as late as 10:00pm, that there was no guarantee on check-in time.  F that.  That is unacceptable.  We booked a suite, check-in is at 3.  Not whenever the heck they feel like it.  It was absurd.

Takes 20 mins to get an iced latte at Starbucks or a sandwich at the food court.  Also, the host staff at the More buffet is incredibly rude.It's a nice hotel, the biggest draw obviously being the pool area. With multiple pools, lots of seating (although no shade unless you pay an arm and a leg for it), and a beach, it's a great area to hang around on a sunny afternoon.

The hotel itself is decorous. It also has great food options (I enjoyed breakfast at Raffles) and bar options. Both items are very important for a Vegas hotel. 

The carpeting in the room itself was in desperate need of a good cleaning or replacement. I do not really want to be reminded of the years of partying that it has endured...

Also, as numerous reviews below have mentioned - the elevators at times took FOREVER. I thought people were exaggerating. No, they were not - and I have been in Vegas for multiple New Years Eves when there are masses of people trying to get to their rooms - this was worse.

The reason for only 2 stars, and my biggest complaint, was our check-in experience, and our overall customer service at this hotel. The woman that checked us in was very rude to us (making fun of our name!), not helpful when asking about upgrades (yes, I was trying to give them more money!), and then gave us the wrong room number!! After waiting an hour to get an elevator to go to our room to find that someone else was already in that room, we had to trek it all the way back to the desk, where she insisted we were mistaken and we should try again! Then, after looking at her computer says, "oops, I was a number off". And then essentially pushes us off to help the next guest. I realize people make mistakes all the time, no biggie, but a simple "sorry for that" would have gone a LONG way.

We experienced more rude workers at the pool, valet and our service at Raffles was beyond slow. 

All in all, I have stayed at most hotels on the strip (from the Imperial Palace to Encore), and this was the worst for customer service. Why spend the money to stay there when there are so many other options that still value customer satisfaction??I planned for our visit for two months and agonized over which steakhouse we would eat at...I should have listened to more of the naysayers. 

Like they said..food and service were ok and bill was big for what we got - $250. We also got seated in the bar area where they have a few tables with weird couch-type seating on one side. Anyway, it was Friday night and crowded but we had reservations after seeing Ka. Bread was good but not to die for like folks said. We ordered kobe skirt steak, angus filet, corn, potato puree, and mushrooms. Steaks good but not worth price they charge -- I get better beef a our local Beef Palace in Huntington Beach (look it up for best steak in OC). Corn and puree pretty tasty but the mushrooms tough, dry and rubbery..c'mon $15 bucks for that crap. BTW, we sat before the two parties on either side of us and they got served first. Wasn't too thrilled to have all the bar folks standing up behind me while I ate. 

Good gracious, I should've gone and tried Vic Anthony's. Was a fan of TC but after this I'll always start out Top Chef by giving him the stink eye.As a Chicago resident, I have dined in just about every high end steakhouse my city has to offer, so I know a thing or two about what to expect from a place that the caliber craftsteak portrays themselves as. My wife and I dined there on 09/30 for my B'day while in Las Vegas- we chose this steak house because we are both Top Chef fans and thought it would a great way to celebrate. Upon arriving, we were seated in a prompt manner and that was probably the best experience we had all night. In short- I was HIGHLY disappointed with our meal and experience. 

Our service was terrible because our waiter was awful. They use a "team" approach, but one guy was the main person for our service and he doesn't even belong at an Outback. He more than once tried to entertain the table seated next to us- while engaged with my wife and I, he challenged my wife on a glass of bourbon she ordered from their menu (made a bit of a show by flipping threw their 100 page drink menu at the table instead of inquiring with the bar), never told us anything about the menu, and when I asked if there were any chef specials for the night, his response was "our menu is printed every day, so I like to think that everything is special". He was very unprofessional and he never once talked about the steaks on the menu they had to offer!! Needless to say, I didn't order one. 

The basics of service were never covered. I even had to order another glass of bourbon from the bus boy after sitting without one for about 10 minutes- that's how bad it was. If you are going to charge the prices they do, I don't care if you are busy, slow, or completely dead, there is a level of service that is expected and should be executed on. Tom C talks about this all the time on his show, and maybe we got the only bad apple out of the group, but we were both appalled by at one point, upset about it. 

Regarding the food- I have to say that it was overpriced. I had the braised short ribs- a specialty of Tom C and was very happy with them, but everything else was just average. We had high expectations that night and both left the restaurant with a bad taste in our mouths.For all the hype you hear, this place just sucks.  Maybe it was better before, but I get the feeling that if you don't look like a Hollywood elite, you're scoffed at.  Our waitress (who finally decided to bless us with her presence) explained that happy hour was 2 for 1 drinks.  Great, the wife and I said, and we ordered 2 margaritas.  She shows up with 4.  What's this, I asked.  It's 2 for 1, she explains, you order 1 and we bring you 2.  If I wanted 2 each I would have fucking asked for FOUR!!!  When I told her I didn't want 2 each she looked so put off (is this REALLY the first time this has ever come up sweetheart?!?) but did take away the extra 2 margaritas.  We had a few more beers and a lackluster appetizer sampler and bounced. Fuck the Pink Taco.I read an article a few years back, and the writer asked Thomas Keller what he thought of Yelp, the restaurant mogul was unfamiliar with the site.  After reading many Yelps for Bouchon, many diners are spreading their love for Keller, which was why we chose to dine at Bouchon on our holiday.  We walked into a pretty vacant restaurant, and were seated promptly.  This place is very "fine dining" but because it is located in a hotel you get all sorts of tourists.  Lets say Thomas Keller might not approve of a diner wearing cutoffs and running shoes, while choking down a $22 breakfast, but hey, what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas.  My sis and i  both ordered the the breakfast plate that came with  two eggs, potato croquettes, toasted brioche & applewood smoked bacon.  Moments later our food arrived, and my sis took one bit of her bacon, and pulled a face, the food was cold.  We debated just eating it, but if Keller can make oysters and pearls, can he not make bacon and eggs?  We told our server our issue, and she seemed shocked that there was an issue, and returned it to the kitchen.  Our plates came out again, this time they might have been 1 degree warmer.  We didn't want to send our food back for the third time, so we sucked it up.  The manager was very generous accommodating us with a box of pastries for the trouble.  
Overall i wouldn't go back, I think Thomas Keller has stretched his name a bit too thin, and this restaurant is not dishing out the same quality of food that he would oversee at The French Laundry.Food was decent, but nothing life-changing. Yes, I know it's supposed to be "simple French bistro food" and it was ok but...

Just because Thomas Keller got a lot of money to slap his name on it, you are not really eating at a Thomas Keller resto unless it's French Laundry or Per Se. This is just a very slightly higher-end La Madeleine with inflated Strip hotel prices. 

I gave it two stars because of the noise and flaky service. For food alone I'd easily give three maybe four. It's a cavernous space and they really try to pack 'em in and flip the tables as quickly as possible to generate volume, pretty much the antithesis of a what a genuine, relaxed bistro experience in France is like. The noise level was almost deafening. My dining companion was seated right across from me and we were literally shouting at each other during several points in the meal. A conversation was pretty much impossible and neither of us are hearing-impaired. Although my ears were ringing all that night after...this is absolutely not the place for a relaxed and intimate dinner. Don't be fooled into thinking that just because it's "French" food.

Courses came out at odd intervals and aside from when it was time for us to pay and run out (flip those tables!) our server just didn't seem to be very good at his job. Maybe he was having an off day, got caught in the weeds...but I honestly think in his case he's just a bad waiter. 

Started with a nice platter of oysters. They didn't make us sick so that's good. Not that I expected them to. 

My dining companion had the roast chicken which really was delicious and so well done. Chicken is usually one of the most boring things to order on any restaurant menu but this is an exception. If you've always wanted to try one of those flavorful, moist classic French roast chickens you've heard are so good, here is a place to start. My trout almandine was quality. Simply prepared and I liked it. The rhubarb cake dessert was tasty.

This was my first visit back to Bouchon after I had gone several times a few years ago. Prior to that it was always for breakfast and lunch. It's was less crowded and quieter at those times. However, service there has never been especially good and it suffers the endemic Strip celeb chef phoning it in for the tourists problem. 

I'd recommend going for lunch or breakfast (especially during the week if you can swing it) avoiding weekend dinner there and not setting your expectations for food and certainly not for service, all that high.I really wanted to like this place. I heard so much about it. I also went there for the view of the fountain of course (that part was great). But the food man... my goodness the food! I expected so much more. More flavors and creativeness. It did not impress me at all.Recently had our vacation, so we picked Todd English Olive ' s mainly for the view of Belligio's fountains, reviews were good so reservations were made, but unfortunately we could not get a window seat. 
The restaurant is very dark. Their drink menu is lit up, so you can read it, but the menu isn't lit, so needless to say it's very difficult to read.
The wait service was very curious and quick, but the food was up to par. We had the tuna tar tar appetizer 
( which was very bland) and the shrimp scampi flatbed ( which was very salty). Dinner consisted of also a very bland Olive's Pescatore, and a Flat iron steak, which was not bad, except for the 2 grilled gulf shrimp that were raw ( well under cooked ). I think since this restaurant mainly serves vacationers. It's a place to avoid, due to the $$$$, and there tons of other places to go.
Just look at the fountains from the sidewalk. It's a lot better and closer view!We always need food consumption after a night of dancing, alcohol, and...whatever else.  We ended up here after Vanity at 4a or so because one of the Vegas residence always comes here after her partying.  No seriously! The waiters even brought her usual order before we were given menus. 

But we obviously need to come more often so we get her treatment because holy crap did we have to wait forever for our food.  I think the majority of us were contemplating jus ditching the restaurant and going up to our rooms.  But alas, our food was served.

It's diner and after partying food so there's nothing to rave about but it's not bad.  They even brought out a piece of chocolate cake with a candle in it to celebrate our birthday lady.

If your in HRH then, of course, come here for eats but if not, then go elsewhere.  I'm sure there's plenty of other places that are prepared for the after party crowd and you won't have to wait till you pass out for your food to arrive.Brewpubs tend to be my first target whenever I visit a new city. Great Dane happened to be a couple blocks away from the punk rock show we descended upon Madison for. I was stoked... until their beer touched my lips.

It is very, very difficult for me NOT to finish a beer, no matter the circumstances: bodily capacity, time constraints, ore even a little Armageddon. But I actually abandoned some of my Crop Circle Wheat because it had become unpalatable 2/3 through the very generous pour. I enjoy wheat and citrus-y beers, but couldn't manage to finish a glass of it. 

The fact that a pair of fruit flies kept landing and launching off my lemon slice every sip didn't earn this brewpub any favors, either.

NOM'd: Crop Circle WheatUgghh what a giant clusterf**k seriously. Just stand outside and try to get in. This was a rare occasion of me +15 so they split our group up. None of the guys had to pay to get in though and the wait was less than 30 minutes. However my friend has bad luck with bouncers and he got kicked out. Inside even more of a CF. You might as well get really intimate with the 5 people that surround you, you are gonna be touching them the whole night. Go upstairs and get fresh air. Some of my party didn't like techno so they went back down. Now I love journey but damn, why are you playing that in the main room when i'm trying to get my freak on? You want us to sway left and right or something? Can someone please tell me why a 6oz bottle of water costs 8 bucks? It wasn't even a boutique brand just some plain water probably bottled from tap.

I heard on our way out one my girls was being hollered at by Mike Tyson. She told me on the elevator ride down that she was really scared because he wouldn't leave her alone. Now if I was there I'm down to save any girl but damn its Mike Tyson! I'm pretty sure he would have put me in a coma.Pure was on our agenda the second night in Vegas. We had gotten in touch with a Promoter earlier in the day, placed on the guest list, open bar til midnight for us ladies, and we were set for later that evening. 

We arrived at Caesars "fashionably late," late in the sense that we probably should have gotten there about an hour earlier not at 11PM. But, hey we figured shouldn't be to much of a wait, WRONG. There line system well it fails, I think they skipped the elementary instructions of line creation, I don't even think I could count how many different lines I saw and at one point what looked like a line was pretty much like people being herded as cattle bunched up and getting impatient, bad situation my friends. 

I make fun of the herded cattle, but MOO, haha. Apparently that bunched of group "line" was the guest list entry. I'd say the figuring out lines situation and the herding moment it took us about an hour to get into Pure, low and behold midnight no more open bar, womp womp.

Upon entry it doesn't look to crowded as your walking down hallways, then there is a people explosion. Downstairs, and my opinion is solely based on downstairs because the whole upstairs was closed off this night. There are three sections: main room in the middle, and two smaller sections one on the left and one to the right. The decor of the club is pretty plain, guess I expected a little more ambiance. And the restroom placement, I don't understand who designed this, they must have a sick-twisted sense of humor. They are located in the furthest possible corner of the main room behind the DJ, requiring you to actually navigate through/across the dance floor, not fun times. 

While I cant say I had a completely horrible time here, in all its chaos dancing was done, I just cant say that I'll be attending PURE on a future trip to Vegas.Let me tell you my experience . The first time I went there Thursday January 23rd 2014 was with my bf . I was let in and it was fun . My bf paid 10$ because I guess we were at the guest list . The reason why I put 2 stars was because the drinks are ridiculously expensive but you know it's Vegas . A bottle of beer is 9$ or other mix drinks are 14$. The dance floor for me was really small even though you can dance anywhere and there are tables to hangout with . The bathroom was kept clean . The VIP tables takes all the space . There are 2 bars and the bartenders are very friendly (maybe for the tips) the ladies gets a free drink till 12am only with VODKA AND SOME SPRITE , coke (typical sodas) . I mean I heard other clubs gives away free drinks till 1am with more choices . 

THE SECOND TIME I WENT Was last night 
I should have never came back. We were at the guest list line  until the bouncers checked my I.d. Saying that it wasn't me. Asking me about my middle name and when I graduate high school. The picture I had on my license was 4 FUCKING YEARS AGO , I look totally different PLUS WE ALL KNOW THERE ARE DMVS OUT THERE THAT HAS POOR QUALITY CAMERA. The middle name I had in my license was my moms maiden name (I guess in my tradition you have to put your moms maiden name). Asking me how to spell it and I did correctly and they still wouldn't let me in. EVEN TRIED DOING MY OWN SIGNATURE .and asking me if I have other card that has my name on it(which of course they didn't look at) I'm not saying all this because I am mad about that I'm just saying that this club isn't worth it at all. 

IF YOURE LOOKING FOR A CLUB TO GO ASK PEOPLE WHO LIVES THERE LONG ENOUGH .  

MY ADVISE : make sure you look like your IDENTIFICATION . Have plenty of money to spend for drinks . I GUESS THE BOUNCERS ARE MORE STRICTER  THAN THE TSA AT THE AIRPORT .This USED to be the best brunch/buffet in Vegas.  Under the new BLT name, I don't know if it's due to new ownership, management or culinary team, but Sunday brunch was terrible.  Yes the waitstaff''s service was still very attentive and the champagne was still Perrier Jouet.  But those were the only things that remained from the old beloved Sterling Brunch that I've been coming to and raving about for the past 7 years!  I've brought my mom and her friends, all are TR Diamond and 7Stars members, everytime we go to Vegas (which is way too often!).  They have enjoyed it so much, they've been bring their friends and family.  This time I brought a colleague and friend and the experience was hugely embarassing!  Just about all the seafood was oversalted (from lobster bisque to crab legs) and all the meats were way over cooked.  The lobster tails were 1/3 the size they used to be, and overcooked, dry and salty.  The crab "legs" were more like left over scraps from the spread of the old Sterling.  The "chilean" sea bass was dry and salty.  The Filet mignon was so overdone it's inedible.  The lamb chops were completely brown and tough.  There was no sushi.  No duck.  Desserts selections were also pathetic.  No crepe station.  No ice cream. No creme brule.  Overall there were only 1/2 the selections of food and at 1/4 of the quality.  It is now a waaaayyyyy overpriced mediocre buffet living off its past reputation.  Unless management raised the bar back up to pre-remodel/rename, I will not ever be back and would discourage friends and family from doing so.Okay, first, the service here is totally shitty. -5 stars, duh.

The burgers are yum. +3 stars

The beer selection? OMG BRB S&M BBQ LOL. AWESOME. +4 starsMy friends raved about this place and finally took me recently and I could not have been more disappointed.  The service was horrendous and slow.  I could have walked to either China or Mexico before I got my food.  The Diablo Chicken was dry and uninspired and the rice and beans were medicore at best.  Not sure what all the fan fare is about this place but I'll never go back.Tasted worst than a college dorm cafeteria. UC Davis has a better eating experience than this buffet. Limited selection and undercooked meat.The food is subpar here. The Rio is way better.
I came here because it's part of the Buffet of Buffets.

Go for the Cotton candy and pre-sliced crab legs. The chinese and indian stations looked very sad. I made myself fancy salads with chilled shrimp and snow crab legs.

The crepe station makes sweets only. It's really greasy compared to the Paris buffet.

It's a pretty small buffet.Not impressed.  Variety of food was good. The quality; not so much. Desserts were tasty. Not worth the expense.  We were charged $5 extra per person for being a group of 12....although our server was gone most of the time.  A good steak house would have been a better deal.That'd be an ICK for the food and a YAY for our waitress.

The food was super disappointing. We went in thinking we'd have a good breakfast, lots of options to choose from, and leave feeling happy and full. 

Instead, the food was marginal, overcooked and dry. There really wasn't much variety, which was sad, considering they have so many stations promising things like "Asian" or "Mexican" or "Italian". It was pretty much the same thing at each stop, with a few variations.

On my first pass - still nursing some high hopes - I grabbed an Andouille Sausage corn cake, a breakfast quiche, a scoop of hash browns, an Egg Benedict half and some scrambled eggs.

The corn cake was hard and dry, and if there was Andouille sausage in there, it was hiding from me. The breakfast quiche was so dry I couldn't even swallow the tiny bite I took. It was seriously like the Sahara Desert inside that thing. The Egg Benedict was - predictably - overcooked, though that's on me for grabbing an Egg Benedict from a steam table. If the egg was poached when it was set out, all that time above the steam and under the lights just kept right on cooking it.

The eggs and the hash browns were the best things I had that day. Both were buttery and tasty, without being too greasy. Score.

My second pass - hopes understandably diminished, but wanting to get the most out of the buffet prices - was forgettable. I tried some sautéed fruits (peaches and apples), as well as a scoop of cheesy grits and one of the pastries from the sad dessert station, but nothing blew me away.

The best thing about the morning was our waitress, Nina. She had the best personality! She joked with us, made us girls feel special, and made sure to get us what we were asking for. She then made my husband and I feel super special for having participated in the half marathon the day before, even though we weren't feeling extra special at that point. 

I wish everybody had a good, friendly, open attitude like Nina did. She's definitely the best thing we experienced at Spice Market, and I hope they appreciate her there!I had pretty high expectations for this club, seeing how it is one of the premier clubs in Vegas. I have to say that I am a bit disappointed with the overall experience.

First, I had no problems getting in as I was a guest at the hotel, unlike some other posers who had to wait in line. Once inside, I found it to be a bit disorganized, with small dance floors scattered here and there, none of them with enough room for the amount of people they were letting in. Going from one place to another is a pain in the ass, since there are tons of people and as another reviewer noted, lots of bottleneck locations. 

The bar is by far more disorganized than the rest of the club. There are so many people crowded around that it's almost impossible to get a drink. Think Dave and Buster's on thursday nights, times 10. I really do not like having to wait in line to get a drink when I can be on the dance floor having fun. Of course you can't do that because there are so many people, so all you end up doing here is pushing and waiting until you're tired and convince yourself that it was worth it.

Bathing chicks are nice but they do not redeem the club.the bathroom situation is a disaster. not only can i not find it b/c the layout of the club is ridiculously confusing, but the line to the girl's bathroom on the top floor is like 50 people deep. i ended up hangin around the girl's bathroom on the first floor so i can get easy access...ha ha ha! music was forgettable. guys average looking. had a good time gettin wasted w/ friends but i can do that anywhere.Really disappointing.   Extremely expensive and I've had better food at the olive garden.  Service and atmosphere are the only positives.  The bill for my wife and I after tip was $350 and we didn't order dessert.  My wife's seafood risotto was so salty it was almost unedible.Been here number of times. Have always had good food. 
Yes it is pricey. And well aware of it! 
Last visit, we asked just for a glass of their house Cab. 
$28.00 later, for a house glass. And no-one informed us.
Very sneaky !!
We felt very violated.
When brought up to Bartender...yes this is our house. It was Brunello!Very dissapointed in my visit to SW Steakhouse.  I made reservations 2 months ago for our anniversary and requested outdoor seating.  When we got to the restaurant they told me that wasn't on the reservation and tried to sit us inside in the corner.  My husband requested outside and they told us it would be a 1 hour wait.  We ended up waiting 30 minutes and they still ended up seating us inside.  Our service was awful.  We weren't drinking because I'm pregnant and my husband is training for a triathlon and I think the waiter was bugged that our bill wouldn't be as much.   After we finished our appetizer which was the lemon marinated shrimp we waited way too long for our entree.  Our waiter came by and filled up our drinks and didn't say a thing about our food so my husband asked is our entrees almost ready?  Then he said I will go check on it.   Our waiter was AWFUL and our food was ok.  During our dinner they sat a table of 15-20 next to us and we couldn't hear ourselves talk.  So much for a romantic anniversary dinner.  I will never go back to SW and I don't reccommend it to anyone.  There are much better steakhouses to eat at in Vegas.In one word... "eh..." Most expensive of our three dinners this weekend and the weakest as it goes... We shared the entire meal and had 2 glasses of their most inexpensive wine (it was good though)... Ap, Steak + 2-sides and dessert... $250 - holy cow batman...

Service was excellent! Seared Foie Gras... excellent! Bone-in ribeye - "eh" just ok... so as this is a steakhouse, how do you rate it any higher... sides were ok... can't remember em so go figure... Chocolate dessert was pretty good...

BUT NOT $250 GOOD - for a shared meal....Okay, so the food was actually pretty good in my book. Some things were overpriced ($12 guacamole), and some things were tiny ($9 gorditas), and some things were different than the waiter described ($9 tortilla soup), but the overall experienced was made TERRIBLE by the SLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOWWWWWWWWWWWW service. 

45 minutes to bring the food out. Really? Not when the restaurant is 1/2 empty...unacceptable Diego.When we came the first time we were told we would have to wait 30 min so we left. However, when we passed by 10 min later the place seemed to be working again.

We ordered 2 crepes. One was barely warm, the other was cold inside so we had to ask to make it again. To make things worse, the supposedly vegetarian tomato mozzarella crepe had pieces of ham in it!

If you want a crepe, do yourself a favor and go to Jean Philippe Patisserie in Bellagio just across the road - it's INFINITELY better!Was not very thrilled about Ghost bar for a couple reasons.

First, they make everyone pay $20 to get in, even girls, and you may have to wait in line.

Upon entering they have a bar, drinks are ok, but then you have to walk through Ugly people trying to freak dance to get to the end where there is a view.

The view gets 4 stars, because it is a view of the entire strip, from a perspective of being off the strip. Great photo op, but then you have to walk through the people dancing again...

It seemed claustrophobic to me as well, and although they just remodeled it, It did not seem novel in any way.LAME!  This is my first Cirque show, and hopefully will be my last.  Yes, the engineering on the stage movements and design is mind boggling, and the performers are talented acrobats, but I didnt know what the fuck was going on during the entire performance.  I was afraid the performers would notice the contorted look of confusion and dismay on my face and fall off their ropes.  First they're on a boat that sinks, then some of them wash up on a sandy shore, then somehow they're in an arctic tundra, and then in a lush jungle, and finally in some volcanic underground lair.  Again, WTF?  The synopsis on the Ka website didnt help.  Just dispense with the impossible to follow "storyline" and have the players jumping around in colorful outfits doing insane things with their bodies.  I can accept that.  And why are the characters talking in gibberish?  And why must there be the insipid comic relief elements, this time in the form of bad French-like mimes?  And this might be picky, but during group scenes, some of the performers were out of sync with one another.  Sometimes a performer would notice he was out of sync, then stop what he was doing, and join in again later when he could actually keep up the pace.  I know these performers are generally talented, but I guess I was expecting more from Cirque.  

Maybe the nudie Cirque shows are better.I miss the more acrobatic CDS. KA was good but not great.  A lot of dancing and not a lot of acrobatics as the first CDS show I saw when they were first introduced many years ago.  This is the second time seeing one of the million CDS and I don't think I will be back to see any of the other ones.

The theater was big and interesting, staff was friendly and engaging and the production was good, but like I said it wasn't for me.

I will stick with the comedy, one time shows etc.Everyone hide!!! I'm going to kill someone!!!!! Did I just pay 130 dollars for food that is dennys quality at best. What a freaking bust. That jailhouse lunch cost almost as much as a night at the hotel here. I will not be back. Maybe if I win the lottery, ill come to buy the place and shut it down.Rice cravers don't eat here...  I Didn't like it.  Service was fair for our party of 3.  I would have rather eaten at the food court if it had been open.Why oh why... I really like dimsum and I expect a very good dimsum from a very cool modern chinese restaurant that has piano player on weekend and lots of fishy tank but oh boyyyy.. it doesn't taste as good as restaurant settings. I still remember how it tasted better one year ago when I came to this place.. but oh well..I've been reluctant to write this review because the food is so stinkin good!!! I absolutely love the green pasta (I think its $13.95) and the portions are amazing. The burgers are perfect every time and I love the fries options... But the service... oh the service, IS SO UNBELIEVABLY AWFUL. I've gotten the same guy the last couple times I went in and he is just terrible. Tyler? Taylor? something like that. But he was more worried about his hair and scarf than he was about anything going on around him. The day I went with my parents, I had to ask 3 times for him to refill my mom's ice tea. Eventually, I grabbed another server for it. I took my boyfriend and a couple of his friends in for a birthday and he had to came back two or three times because he couldn't remember what we ordered, and that was just DRINKS! On top of it, his tone and smile are so sarcastic and fake, its insulting. Its unreal how many of us will never be back because of him.Not a huge fan... the service was ok, nothing special nothing bad. The building was ok, a little dirty. The pizza was a disappointment. 

The crust is good but really didn't have much flavor, the sauce.. oh wait what sauce. There was zero. I actually asked for a side of sauce. The cheese was just enough to cover the top and nothing more. The toppings were ok. meh... 

Prices were ok I guess.

Over hyped maybe? Bad day maybe?Weeeeeeeell that might be it for me at LLXAtwood. 
Just one too many things soured my dining experience today...
...not certain I can go back. 

I walked in (admittedly towards the end of the lunch rush) and was astonished that nearly every table was covered with dirty dishes. Now I've worked in restaurants, I understand when you're hit hard it can be challenging to keep up with tables that need to be bused. I've also eaten in a lot of restaurants, which makes me qualified to say things like tables covered with dirty dishes don't scream "welcome, sit yourself down, you're in for a treat!" The waitress gave me a warm welcome, encouraged me to sit anywhere I wanted, but given my choices (a clean table or a dirty one) there were two... two tables in the entire restaurant to choose from. 

Things got worse from there. 

My egg roll was undercooked, cold on the inside and doughy. Why doughy? No clue. But doughy. 

The wontons in the wonton soup were melt in your mouth, and not in a good way. Melt in your mouth because the dumplings were overcooked. No bite. No chew. 

And while their version of Pad Thai was tasty, at 3 stars, which ought to be moderate was so spicy I had to ask for several additional napkins. Waitress must have thought I said several more spices, because she brought two over. Ironic. Unfortunate.

Also unfortunate is the fact that this place is so drastically different than LLXWilly. It's bigger and the hours are better, but neither are enough to make me want to give them another go after today.They have reallllllly hot miso soup!

I know that because the last time I was here, our waitress poured half of my miso in my lap. With no apology. And no offers to comp the soup that probably has left my ovaries unable to function. 

But hey, she and the other staff are pretty so that's all that matters, right? Nobody cares about service or basic manners anymore, right?For breakfast, this buffet is a bit over-priced ($18.95) and not really that good. Runny scrambled eggs, a long omelet line, all types of non-breakfast items for those who can't distinguish between day and night, plus really weak coffee. I tried the Cafe in the Wynn and was much happier.

I'm afraid the House gets the best of you with this "sucker breakfast"After 1600+ reviews, what has been said has...probably already been said. Isn't there a theorem about that, or something? Whatever, I didn't get a Masters in Physics.

The wedding came and went, and we headed down to Los Angeles/Las Vegas to visit some family that weren't able to make it/vacation it up - NOTE: husband wants everyone and their mother to know that it wasn't a honeymoon because my dad came with us. Apparently a "chaperone" isn't an aphrodisiac.

We visited LV for a few days to see husband's (and now my) family. They threw us a wonderful reception and we got to catch up. One evening I suggested that we visit one of the famous buffets for breakfast. Husband thought that was a good idea, and dad wanted us to have some newlywed time to ourselves. After finding the "best" reviewed, we settled on the Wynn. I did my homework, too - we got their early as early could be, so that we wouldn't be waiting an hour and a half in line.

The price for the champagne brunch was $45/person - not cheap in the *slightest.* So, you'd think for a total of around $100, you'd want to be wowed and impressed so hard your heart stops, right? I'm looking over at the "Reviews for The Buffet at Wynn Las Vegas," of all my friends whom I trust wholeheartedly with food recommendations, giving The Buffet a fulfilling 5 stars. Every one of them! Keane L. even said that the 2 hour wait was totally worth it! The reviews are all at least 2 years old, but they range from '06 to '09 - surely if there is consistency between those years, then from '09 to '11 there would be as well?

Nope.

To be honest, I can't even remember anything standing out. I had amazing prime rib at Jerry's Nugget out in crack-ville for $10 - the cut on my plate at the Wynn was blegh. The desserts were just okay, and they didn't have ANY crab - highly disappointing. The selections were - for some odd reason, because it was 8am and we were the first ones in the door - old, as if they were just sitting under the hot plate the entire time. I tried to sample as much as I could, but this all looked like regular buffet food at some regular-ass buffet. I felt like I was paying for the brand more than the food itself.

Sorry, Wynn. No crab, no stars. Presentation is top, but I'd rather have it look like a pile of dung and taste like a dream than the other way around. How utterly disappointing! Next time, I'm heading to crack-ville for breakfast.Suckest Chinese food ever had. Nothing tastes right. A couple of boiled tofu with soy sauce cost 10 dollars. Will not ever return here.Here for happy hour, it's mediocre at best. The cocktails are way to sweet.  The shrimp tempura roll was cold and soggy.  The gyoza were okay but only luke warm.  The pacific roll was good and the service was friendly.Eureka, I've got it!!! "Ah (what a) Sin" to eat here! ;) 

Ok, ok...I'm being a bit harsh. It wasn't ALL that bad, but it was not by any means ALL that great either. It was our last sushi stop on our little tour of Vegas sushi houses, and I'm glad it was! I think if I would have eaten there before; it would have turned me off to trying any others. 

I mean, I guess you get what you pay for...we were doing our little touristy walking the strip, taking pictures thing, and stumbled upon a beautiful glossy sign that read "All you can eat sushi for $20" SCORE!!! Being that we were in Vegas, we took a gamble (see what I did there, Vegas - gambling?) ok moving on....the restaurant is pretty, the outdoor dining faces the fountains @ the Bellagio...which is always an amazing show to watch so it wasn't all that bad. The food however, left us a bit disappointed. We didn't say anything though, because our waiter was so nice and kept asking if we would like anymore. He looked quite shocked that we didn't order any rolls other then our allotted 3 at a time deal...especially since we left half of the food on our plates. The maître d' was also VERY helpful with telling us about some cool comedy shows to check out...he even went as far as to phone-a-friend to see if he could score us some tickets or discounts. 

So overall, the food will be forgotten...but the service will forever be embedded in my memory. (Or until the Alzheimer kicks in) C+It seems like even though The Rio has been around for quite some time the buffet here is still considered one of the best or most talked about buffet's in Vegas, I think there are better options on the strip.  Although my family never has to wait in line when we come here there are a bunch of people that do and for hours at a time! I personally don't like buffets so this may be a biased review, however, I've eaten at my fair share and can give a review compared to the others on the strip.  It seems like rio puts out your standard buffet fair with nothing that is captivating and pleasing to the eye rather just food for the masses.  The dessert is usually the best part of any buffet and while this one did have good gelato, however, it didn't have creme brulee!! What kind of vegas buffet doesn't have creme brulee?! I had to knock off one star just for that factor alone.  Usually I come back with several plates of mini desserts and have a bite from all and have an internal battle about which one to get because they all look so cute, but this one was lacking and I had to fight to pick at least 2 desserts to try.   

Overall ... i just don't like buffets =(This was our second visit and first time with our kiddos. It will be our last!  Definitely not up to par with other FRC eateries we've been to. 

Pizza took forever to arrive (nearly 30 minutes) with nothing but our drinks to hold us thru. Our kids were excited to order chicken noodle soup, which arrived after about 15 minutes but very disappointed with the quantity of vegetables and lack of noodles and chicken. They picked thru it, with their forks and fingers (first place I've been where soup arrived without a spoon) and they were not happy. 

The two star rating is being generous given the service we received during our $42 lunch tab. During our wait I noticed how slowly the tables were bussed and was amazed at how the wait staff was so disengaged, like they would all rather be somewhere else. We noticed the manager talked with several tables, it didn't look to be a good day for him. 

When our pizza did arrive it was delicious but we were not given any plates, napkins, etc so we grabbed some from another nearby table. Very odd. 

My husband asked one of the wait staff about the soup and the manager came over to tell us how delicious it was. Not to our kids! We asked for a kids order of mac and cheese, split onto two plates. He promised it would be right over. It never made it!

We quickly ate our pizza; our kids wanted nothing to do with that! For some reason mine had green pepper instead of artichokes but I wasn't about to send it back. The kids had ordered chocolate chip cookies which came eventually and that was pretty much their meal. Really sad!

We didn't stay and wait for the mac and cheese. My son spilled his drink and we tried to clean it up by ourselves with the scant napkins we had. There were no napkins available at the drink station and no staff wanting to help so we left. 

Total bust for my Mother's Day lunch. Never going back!!!!I had coupons for $5 off for this buffet so I dragged the bf here for brunch on sunday. The buffet was $20.99 but ended up being $15.99 each w/ the coupon. The food was meh. The asian food looked sooo gross and old. I am sure it has been sitting there at least for a week or so. The only thing I really ate was the prime rib which they had to cook it more once they sliced off a piece b/c it was sooo rare. I also had a create your own omelet, that was ok. The dessert selection was lacking a bit compared to rio. Yay the rest of the food was really unappetizing. I would not recommend anyone coming here even with that $5 off.Being a buffet, you gotta compare this to other vegas buffets, and I must say I was expecting better after reading some of the reviews.  First impression were the staff who work there to seat you, and none of them looked like they wanted to be there or help you - not a smile, thank you, nary a pleasantry from anyone.  The one drink waiter who did seem amiable was not very attentive in clearing our used plates and checking in on the drinks that we ordered.  But, being a buffet, you can get away with that if the food is special, and I must say, the only thing special here are the crepes. Yes- they are good, and if you've got a hankering, then this is probably the buffet for you. But the rest of the food was, at best, average, and at worst, cold and bland.  Soups were way over-salted, an admission made by the servers themselves! Salad selections were sparse, meats were mediocre. Desserts were tasty.  Maybe it was an off-day for the buffet, but all I can say overall is that I've definitely have had better buffets in Vegas.Air conditioning doesn't make it cold, there are vague stains on the comforter, and the guy next door coughing is keeping me awake. What a hell hole for sleep. Who cares if the Club Lounge food is ample if you're exhausted. Not good for business.We were hoping for a nice dinner worthy if the prices but was sorely disappointed.  The waiter was ok, but I expect more from a high priced restaurant.  My dish (Raviolini) was pretty good, but my husbands tasted like I could have thrown it together for my kids.  Overall, big let down.This place wasn't terrible, but the line looked short, but looks are deceiving.so many open tables but they never sat anyone.  Very bad if you are hungry.  Long wait after waiting in le village line.  Had eggs Benedict, ok, the potatoes had a unexpected cajun seasoning.Lackluster, flavorless breakfast. Do not go out of your way to come here. I was shocked at how many people were waiting to eat here. I ordered the poached eggs with toast and potatoes. They overcooked the eggs; a place with the word EGG in the title should be able to properly poach an egg. The potatoes were very basic and sad. The bacon my dad ordered was fatty and kinda undercooked. The big killer is that the prices were more expensive than a diner yet the quality of the food was the same.Went here on Saturday for dinner with a group of six of us. Service was so so and same with the food. Prices weren't bad and the interior is pretty 70s like?

No real complains but nothing to make me want to come back.I said medium, they gave me charred. Besides taking my order, attentiveness was no where to be found. I came because of the reviews, but was disappointed. I got the burger because it seemed like it was a specialty, but it seemed like they precook the meat, so they overcooked it and i had a dry burger. If you cant cook it right why bring it out. Overall I will give it another try, maybe they had an off day.A place is only good as its bathrooms are clean. That's what I always say. If bathrooms are filth, the place is not worth patronizing. 

Every time I have been here, I will my bladder into expanding itself so I can avoid the restrooms. Today, I could not. The bathroom needed serious attention, and I left the mall shortly thereafter because I felt a film forming on my skin just by being in the place. 

The stores themselves are fine. A lot of them have student discounts (I'm still a student of my 3-years-ago alma mater, don't tell nobody) so be sure to ask if you are a student or a cheater like me.Okay, so I've been to the Carnegie Deli in New York, and it is fantastic. I was staying that the mirage and remembered how awesome the New York location was and decided I had to take my girlfriend there. Wrong Decision. This place was awful in comparison to the New York location.

The food was okay, which is not saying much for Carnegie, because the New York location has FANTASTIC food. I'm also a little peeved because in NY, you can get the Blintzes with their fruit toppings, and we couldn't here. That was the first strike, since Blintzes at Carnegie are amazing. I had the Corned Beef Hash and my girlfriend had the Thick Cut Ham and 3 eggs with home fries. I was really expecting a lot out of the hash because they are known for their amazing Pastrami and Corned Beef. Wasn't impressed. It just didn't have a lot of flavor. It wasn't bad flavor, but there wasn't much there to taste. It seemed like the way they cooked it took the flavor out of the corned beef. Maybe I should have gone with the Pastrami Hash, but who knows? Anyways, my girlfriends meal was definitely better than mine, much more on par with the breakfast I expected at Carnegie. The ham was cooked and had a nice caramelization going on. The fried eggs over easy were cooked perfectly, but the home fries just weren't that great. The inside was a little dry and the outside was a little soggy without much flavor. That was probably the most disappointing part for me because I absolutely love good home fries.

Next, the service. The service here is bad, especially in comparison to NY. I hate to keep comparing it to NY, but if you are going to use their name, it's gonna happen. In NY, the employees seemed happy, lots of smiles, friendly, and it was like they enjoyed working their. Here, I didn't see a single smile and every employee looked like they wanted to punch someone in the face. Our server asked us what we wanted to eat like 3 times in the first 2 minutes we were there, but we needed a bit to decide, and they didn't return for 20 more minutes. I said a needed a couple minutes, not 20. The kicker, though, was at the end of the meal. In case you couldn't tell from other reviews, the portions are HUGE here. So, I obviously had some of my hash left over (about a third of it) and wanted a box. When I asked for a box, the server asked "Are you serious?" and looked at me like I was an idiot. No, I was joking! You caught me! (Sarcasm).

In conclusion, don't go to Carnegie unless you are in New York. Walk the extra 20 feet down the hallway and go to BLT Burger, where you will not be disappointed.I think Bernie Madoff owns this "Bank" because this is the biggest PONZI Scheme in Vegas. The second you make your deposit here,  you're never going to see the return of your investment. The club is small, not very happening and the security people are  power crazy.  

How do you boot someone from the club for dancing too 'lewd. The club is where you should be dancing lewdly! You don't want to be doing that at your parent's Holiday  Christmas Party.This was our second time here.  We were pretty disappointed again. My husband ordered the lamb and it was over cooked and very tough to cut through and when he did get a chunk of meat off the bone he almost choked on a tiny thin little bone about 2" long, so he ended up just sending his entire dinner back. I had the sea bass (which is one of my favorite meals I order every where we go) and it was pretty dry.

No complaints on the appetizers and the service was okay. I'm just not sure I would really recommend this restaurant.The view is decent, but I would say the food is subpar....I've had better at restaurants in Scottsdale. Went on a date night with my girlfriend to celebrate our anniversary and as a foodie the food was not as good as I thought it would be. Appetizer - veggie caprese was "meh" didn't feel like it excited my taste buds in the right way. I also ordered a beef stroganoff and although they said it was supposed to be "hand made" pasta, the texture of it felt weird because it was somewhat dried/fried on the outside and dough-y on the inside. 

Service was good though as the manager there offered to take off the beef stroganoff because it wasn't good. We went to another restaurant after spending a short time there.Food is pretty average. Service is spotty at best. 

There are 2 girls working the front counter. One blond who was really stand-offish and borderline rude when I approached the front...I was standing there for nearly 1 minute wondering how to get on the list, when the other one, the brunette came by and asked the blond to put my name on the list. All this time, the blond was just standing around, twirling her hair. The brunette was friendly and made sure my name was on the list. The rude blond really did not care...wonder how many potential customers she has driven away already.

 So, I wont visit again, just due to the rude way in which I was treated at the beginningThe short and sweet version for those who don't care for my long winded reviews- I'd give it three stars for the service, but unimpressive food and the price markup for atmosphere is a bucket full of meh.

Now for the more verbose version. I was staying at the LVH and decided to drop by here for dinner. The matzo ball soup was decent if not all that notable. I ordered the Thai chicken salad. Sadly, it was mostly lettuce flecked with cilantro and drowned in dressing. The chicken itself wasn't bad, but it wasn't sufficient to break up the monotony of the greens without a better mix of vegetables to support. It just feels like a really bad recipe and that can be incredibly difficult to salvage.

The next day, I meet up with a friend of mine. She suggests dropping by here for lunch. One mediocre meal is forgivable enough, so I go back with an open mind. This time, I tried the croissant trio. Tuna salad, chicken salad, shrimp salad. I start on the tuna salad and it is quite fine. Nothing out of this world, but tasty enough that I had no regrets. The chicken salad was next. It was acceptable, although not as good as the tuna salad. This is in part because I like tuna salad more and in part because the chicken salad used larger chunks of chicken that felt a bit off. I took one bite of the shrimp salad and promptly decided that my meal was finished. Didn't need any more. Didn't want any more. Please remove this shrimp salad croissant. It is not my friend. It does not want to hang out in my stomach. I felt just fine and knew that not eating that shrimp salad was probably the best thing I could do all day to continue feeling just fine.

The servers were really pretty nice. I was seated without delay, a refill came just as my glass hit empty, and I did enjoy the atmosphere of the place. Perhaps they could take out the kitchen and just have food catered from somewhere else. That's not really what you want to hear about a restaurant, but hey. I like to point out the bright side of things when I can.This place is okay, not worth the 2.50 per cupcake, especially when you get a cupcake that is so dry that it crumbles like a cookie.  I called the place after spending 15.00 on cupcakes and they didnt seem to care too much, all I was told was that they had other complaints like those and they will try to fix it. Oh well...We met family from out of town here to eat (since that's where they wanted to go). I've had better, it wasn't awful... but I'm not inclined to go back.

Best things I had:

1) mini carrot cake complete with cream cheese frosting, it was nicely spice and how carrot cake is supposed to be.

2) peel and eat cold shrimp and snow crab legs. The crab was sweet, the shrimp were nicely flavored. They both tasted fresh and not fishy.

3) fresh fruit the melon, strawberries and pineapple were all juicy and flavorful.

Mediocre things:
1) steamed veggies....they were a little on the soggy side.

2) tiramisu cup, there was hardly any lady finger in it :( that's the best part!

3) cappuccino mouse, very rich....but a lot of clear brownish fluid was in a pocket in it....not sure if it just wasn't mixed good or what?

4) black beans, they're kind of hard to screw up :)

Could have been okay but.....

1) Chili Relleno. The cheese filling was good, but there was wayyyyy too much breading on it which did nothing but retain too much grease....if there would have been less breading and not as greasy this would have fallen in the category above.

2)peanut butter cream puff. Dry, kind of defeats a "cream" puff.

Yuck:

1) crab salad....I don't know if it was imitation crab meat, or old crab... but this was fish and gross...the crab was also rubbery.

2) California roll, ewww gross. I actually spit this out into my napkin. It was so fishy it made me gag a little before I spit it out!

3) mac n cheese pretty bland and gooey....I think maybe they made it with generic velveta?

So, that's the run down of what I ate, about all I could fit in my tummy. So, in my opinion stick to the peel and eat shrimp and crab :) Not sure about the other meats because I don't eat it.....my hubby said they were okay, not the best, not the worst. He pretty much agrees with me on the "Meh. I've experienced better"We should have checked Yelp first... 

We went for breakfast, mainly out of the convenience of it being downstairs. I love buffets, but this one was SUPER underwhelming, and expensive to boot. Almost $20 for breakfast? We stayed at the Monte Carlo last year, and their buffet was better and less expensive!

There was a ton of food - I thought they had a good selection, but nothing was really that tasty. The bacon was all underdone and greasy, the salami/cheese/antipasto table seemed like it had been sitting out for FAR too long, and I grabbed an eggs benedict cup (made of a little sourdough bowl with the egg, etc inside of it) but didn't eat it because the egg looked so undercooked once I was back at the table. The omelet bar was really the shining star, but there was a consistent line of 10-12 people there at all times and we were on a time crunch, so I didn't get a chance to try it out. 

To be fair, I only had breakfast there, but based on the food I got for breakfast I wouldn't go back. Buffets in Vegas are a dime a dozen, and this one had absolutely nothing special to it.We were there for last three years for convention.  For $36 a dinner buffet is in a high end price but the food is not that great.
you can find a better buffet for that price.I am a lover, but I also have to be honest.  First off, I give restaurants a chance to make me a satisfied customer before I type up a negative missive.

That being said...I love sushi, I enjoy a fresh and inventive roll, know what good sushi grade meat tastes like, and will even spend extra on some good Toro.

I have been to this establishment twice because it is minutes away from home (and an extra incentive was the ubiquitous Restaurant.com certificate.)  A great piece of marketing for this little sushi place, but I don't feel that they have taken the feedback to heart.

Cons:  

Unfriendly staff.  I was almost afraid to tell the lady at the counter that the Dynamite Roll tasted like baked dog food.  Upon doing so, but with a more candid and diplomatic approach, my suspicions were confirmed that my feedback would not be welcomed.  I received no eye contact, a sneer, but an offer to let me order another roll.  No apologies, definitely no smiles, and certainly no questions to ascertain the root of the issue.  No one came to the table to follow up on our orders, to ask if we were enjoying the food, or to offer refills.  So what was the 18% gratuity for that was automatically added to the bill?  When we left the restaurant both staff members were nowhere to be seen, maybe they wanted to avoid thanking us for coming in.  Despite the certificate we had, we still spent over $60 there.

Every roll seems to have imitation crab meat, and the sushi grade is sub-par.  We sampled about six different rolls.  Quite frankly the best one was the passion fruit kiwi roll, which only had about four ingredients.  Even a baked shrimp and eel roll that was ordered had imitation crab meat.  Too much rice, not enough ingredients, and they definitely skimped on the sushi.  A $12 order of yellow tail sashimi was also disappointing, as the meat was a cut which none of us had ever seen before.  It certainly did not taste like what we were used to, and we spoke up about it.  The response was that this was just a different cut and it was all they had.  Really?!

Pros: 

Prices are reasonable, average roll is $8.

Cafe style so you order at the counter  and your meal is delivered to table.

***

There are so many wonderful sushi restaurants in the valley, dozens in that area, and I strongly believe that if you want to stay in business as a restaurant you have to offer something unique.  Whether it is the freshness and flavor of your food, or the incredible service that you offer.  Take "Sakana" for instance.  The moment you enter or leave their establishment, the entire staff greets you in Japanese.  You feel like an old friend stopping in for a visit.  Not to mention they have some of the best yellowtail sashimi, and they are generous with the portions.

Unfortunately we will never come back here.  The food is lacking in personality about as much as the staff's.The eff is going on? 
I said / thought that at least 7 times while here - while waiting in the long line, waiting for our order to be taken, seeing a couple (that was seated at the same time) get their food ten minutes before us,  while waiting another ten extra minutes for our check... 

Granted, it was pretty busy, but it was a Tuesday morning - I hate to think how it it during the weekend.  

As for the food - it was actually pretty good but  maybe that's because I was starving by the time I got it. 
I had the Bellagio waffle and added strawberries to it - definitely a good choice because I don't like it when my waffles don't have fruit. Syrup just isn't enough.  
http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=L7QmuervWX8nYzFYbZsD-A&select=YwgVHyrXUY_NmkvLWBZvgg
But I stick with the two-star rating because those waffles could be purchased at almost any other cafe for less money and with better (faster) service. Plus it kept me from going back to the tables one last time - I swear I was gonna win it all back.....Not great.  Not terrible.  We all presumed that a Chinese restaurant catering to what appeared on this night to be 95% Asian community would have hit all the right notes.

San Pan Tiger Prawns were very good.  Head, legs, and tail on.  Spiced just right.  Fried enough that legs crunched to powder and head held together and juicy.

Ma Po Tofu with Pork was edible.  Not good.  There were flavors missing.  The heat was right with Szechuan pepper.  Its just that no other flavors seemed present.  Lots of tofu not enough pork. Bland.

Noodles were completely tasteless.

Mo Shoo Pork was excellent.  No question.  It came as an appetizer.  Two large pre-filled rices pancakes.  At first bite i realized it needed Hoisin sauce. The next bite made me realize I needn't ask for it as it was already in there.  Wood ear mushrooms even.  Plenty of pork and veggies.

The price for all this was under $60.  Myself and two Partners-in-Dine would have been happier if the food tasted as good as those few dishes did.

When we were ready to pay our check there were no servers on the floor. We realized an entire table of six or seven eating dinner one table over from ours were the entirety of floor STAFF having dinner together.

We had to get up and pay at the register waiting in line behind several other diners waiting to pay their bills.  I think under normal circumstances we would have paid our server.  What happened tonight I am not sure.

I don't believe any of us were so in love or even like with our food that we would go out of our way to return.I don't think I will come back here ever again. We had a 2 for 1 coupon which we thought it shouldn't be that bad if we paid only $16 for two dinners. We were wrong. I rather spend that $16 for burgers and fries at a fast food.

They got two stars for good service, and only because of good service, not the food.Not sure if I had unexpectedly higher expectations from reading all the raving reviews of this newly renovated buffet at the Rio, but I thought it was overpriced ($41/person) for the selection of seafood and desserts.

The utensils were also dirty or have very heavy water stains, which were still nicely wrapped in a napkin.  If you want real lobsters, you will have to have a coupon or pay extra for it. The tiny lobster and shrimp dish was good, but overly salted.

The Chinese food, were not very good (dim sum station's steamed shrimp dumpling had really thick doughy skin; the food looks like it has been hot-held for hours or just overcooked). The Japanese sushi station had just the low end selection of tuna, salmon, California rolls, and shrimp tempura rolls and a few other, but definitely nothing fancy or higher end). The prime rib and tri-tip station is hit and miss, depending on if you got there when they have the left overs or new roasts.

The dessert station had a fair selection of sweet treats, but due to understaffing, the guests soon empty the dessert selections and it was a long wait to individually order desserts from the staff manning the pastry station.

I do like the decor and the spacious design of the dining area, although it is relatively small compared to the buffet at the Wynn or Bellagio.

In my opinion there are far better values at other Strip buffets. So it is cool to try once and check it off of your Vegas To-Do list, but I doubt I will vote to go here again in the future.

Oh yeah, they do have a full bar, but the drinks you order will cost extra.Being a seafood lover I tend to go here whenever I'm in Vegas. The last time I went with my wife and we both brought out appetites with us, because we knew that we were going to pay $45 each to eat here. They have almost every type of seafood dish you can expect. Don't be misled by the other reviewers, the crab legs are not king but snow crab, hence a lot of work cracking legs for small mince meat rewards. I like the Thai style mussels and desserts more than anything. That being said you can get alot more for your money ($90 in my case) at any other seafood restaurant and leave just as satisfied. Make sure you get there early around 4pm unless you don't mind waiting in line for a long time. Once you make it pass the masquerade ball room in the Rio casino you can't miss it. There will be a line formed outside of this place before they open for sure.Unbelievable variety of seafood. The one major problem is that almost all of it suffers from steam table overcooking. And I didn't think the quality was all that great. Oysters? Slimy..mushy and tasteless. Cooked shrimp? Small and shell on. At $45, I would expect a little bigger and peeled. Lobster? I really think they are langostinos. They are split and the meat is about the size of your thumb. Aside from that, they were mealy and overcooked. I only had the initial 2 and didn't go back. Fried shrimp/oysters/calimari/scallops. Sounds good, but all over breaded and over fried. Fried oysters should not be crunchy. All of the fish dishes suffered the same overcookedness. Love crawdads. Theirs were small about the size of a pencil eraser.

I was excited to see steamed clams. My favorite. Problem is that the steam trays are two rows deep, and there are heat lamps under the guards, so every time you try and reach something in the back row, it's blazing hot and hard to reach. I almost had to stick my head in and under the guard to get to them and only got a few. Too hot. They were absolutely tasteless. I didn't think that was possible. It was like eating little bits of erasers.

Looking back, I honestly can't think of a single item that was good. It was very busy, so I cant blame it on a slow night. Disappointed. Will not try again.I had such high hopes for this place, especially after reading all of these great reviews and I was thoroughly disappointed. 

First of all, they request that you do not make any changes to their menu items - which is just nuts to me. I couldn't request that a salad NOT have mushrooms thrown on top for some reason....apparently it's too much trouble? 

Second of all, the one or two things I did find on the menu without mushrooms were salads and one didn't even come with lettuce. So I defaulted to another salad and it came how it came - which was pretty bad. The dressing had no flavor whatsoever, and the salad as a whole was just boring. Iceberg lettuce, red pepper, and artichoke hearts...that's it! 

Now, my coworkers all loved their meals so I may give them another shot, but it's not likely. Any place that doesn't let you modify your order is just not a place I want to go.After passing on Beauty Bar, I decided to spend my money on some grub. Usually I would order their awesome oxtail soup, but when I was about to put my order in, I saw the waitress hand another customer the new york strip special. It looked really good...

Ok, by the time my order came through, the waitress was able to drop about 5 orders of oxtail to other table. Wow, I thought, they must be taking extra good care of my food...

When I received my meal, I first tried the green beans. I will say this again, nothing is worse than frozen green beans. When you reheat them, they might look like fresh green beans, but they tasted like chewing on a sock. Horrible.

Let me get to the steak. I don't know where these Vegas casinos are getting their NY steaks, whether it's the California, South Point, Station Casinos or whatever.. I know it's all coming from the same damn place. Tough, leathery, and extremely fatty (on the outside of the steak..)

I gave this place 2 stars because they didn't screw up the french fries.

Two words when you go to this place, Oxtail, and Soup. That's all you need to remember. If I would have ordered that I would have given this place the 5 stars it deserves.Wait staff is nice and atmosphere is great but the food was not as good as everyone raves about.  We went with very large party  of 14 people who all ordered something different.  No one was raving about their food.  Yes, they do serve large portions and if you split with someone they get you with a split charge and they don't even split the meal for you.  I had my 94 year old grandmother with me as well as 2 children and they would not give her a childs meal.  One of the kids ordered off of the adult menu too.  Breakfast is the cheapest meal to prepare but this place charges $12-$18 for breakfast.  I have to say I will not return to this place again.This is one of my "miss" food adventure. Too bad because it was a belated Father's Day brunch for my dad. We still enjoyed it in good spirit, as nothing is direly bad - like fly in the food or we came down with food poisoning - none of that.  What we did though, me and my dad, for a good part of the time spent waiting for our orders was discussing how the decor of the restaurant missed the theme by a ten foot pole. My dad is a professional interior consultant for large scale resorts and casinos with experience more than my age. Anyway, that's probably only for the picky eyes.  I mean, the restaurant is clean, well lighted, good circulation and definitely meet the standard for an "A" restaurant. 

The Food: I will summarize it in 3 letters abbreviation: T.M.E {Too Much of Everything!!!!!}.  If it is to feed a farm worker who tills the field, rolls the hays, stacks pavements stones and whatever hard-manual-calorie-burning labors a farm worker does, then yes the portion is sufficient. But for a paper pusher, computer staring, sitting on your butt all day, going everywhere with cars folks for whom a distance between 1 parking space closer to the storefront is like a matter of life and death, the portion is a little bit much. I'm being sarcastic. Honestly, the portion is waaaaaaaay too much! Hello, people??? Is the coffee they served not thick enough to wake you up that you can see the mound of food in front of you?? Literally the food was stacked up and jabbed through with a big knife. Cool to see, cringe to think that the plate is for one person... ... I can only roll my eyes as people shovel at least half of the plates into their mouths.  Hey, I like to eat and indulge here and there. Regardless of my size. But this is off the chart.

The taste: Double word: "so-so"  (is it considered one word?) Nothing special here, folks, Move along! To quote the description of the stars rating "Meh. I've experienced better." And I have. Plenty times different other places. Does it taste bad? To be fair, not really. Was it excellent? I really won't go that far! 

My suggestion if you want to eat here:
Treat this place like a family style dining, where you share the food. The more people you have in the party the better. 

For example: The specialty flapjacks can serve 4-6 easy. The hash can serve 2 if you don't order anything else, and 4 if you order the pancakes or waffles. 

We brought home the flapjack that morning, with the toasts, and we were full all the way until 7:30pm (that was a 10 hour filling breakfast!). Perhaps I should add 1 star for it's economical value? .. Nah :pService was good. Really expensive for breakfast. Didn't like my order much. It was something with salmon in a skillet. I like the the atmosphere though but wouldn't come again.The view and furnishings were great, but for lunch the lobster salad was served on stale croutons and the veal saltimbocca was overdone to the point of tastlessness. Multiple complaints got a tepid "sorry" and asked if I wanted a box to take my barely touched meal. Small brilliant red cherry tomatoes(?) produced iridescent red water in the toilet next day.I am very sad that I agreed to eat here.  The food was barely palatable and my drink came out COMPLETELY wrong twice.  Service was acceptable, but in the end we paid $40 for the pleasure of crappy food and a generally bad dining experience.  Blegh.Probably one of the most horrible places we've been to in Vegas. The only reason we came here was because we all drove 5 hours and were dying of starvation... literally!

First off, the service was horrible. The place was vacant and probably had 15-20 customers max, so I thought we were going to be tended to promptly. Nope we were wrong. We had to hail the waitress from across the room after we waited 10 minutes of getting seated. Did I mention we were dying of starvation?

The food finally came and it kept going down hill from there. Here's a few of the dishes we tried:

-Steak & Crab Legs: The Steak was so tough and gritty, it took my cousin almost 20 minutes to finish her steak. The Crab was still frozen. There were icicles still inside, inedible. 

-BBQ Ribs: Not bad, but not that great either. This was probably one of the mediocre dishes we had

-Salads: We ended up getting a few of the salads (Asian Salad?). They were all horrible and had no taste what so ever. 

-Turkey Sandwich: How can you go wrong with a sandwich, it wasn't bad.

Over all, this place deserves a 2 star rating entirely. We won't be back here again. I did like the fact that the manager did comp us some donuts , which were horrible also. BLAH!Food court in Paris. Good for a quick breakfast or late night drunk food. The croque messier is big enough to share. Ask them to toast it extra hot though.Open 24 hours 7 days a week! plus one star....

Chicken Chease Steak...with Cheese wiz.....yep Cheese wiz....$8.75   Ack! I do love late night food....even Mickeys hang over was closed....but please stop riping off Drunk people....Subway, quiznos and Blimpes Worse sandwiches where better than this....The bread left lots to Desire I didn't like the dry crusty bread....and could hardly cope with the bland chicken....the cheese wiz was the best part of the Sandwich...that should tell you lots....

oh great Late night Conversation with presumably Married Counter girl about Colorado...and some white "thugs" out side...about how "getto" and Hard core Texas is....(about the number of Caskets and how even the Cops don't go into the 15th ward! silly drunk white people....oh wait thats me!)

The Philiy Sandwich Company Sandwich is like the girls find on Van Buren, they may look tasty when drunk ...But stay away! they both leave you with a bad taste in your mouth......Went there the other day and found the cheesesteak to be so-so. The bread was way too dense and the quality of meat and cheese was good, but there was just not enough of it. They also have Utz potato chips and Tasty Kakes, so if you're a transplanted east coaster, you can get your fix. Also, there is no indoor seating, so it's not really good for lunch on hot days.The results of an informal poll of my dinning companions could best be described as a shrug. The pasta and sandwiches we had for dinner were passible, but I doubt we will be back.After four years of college and limited breakfast spots around, I finally got my butt over to essence bakery before 10 am for some grub. I won't lie to you, I expected a lot more. I got the big breakfast which wasn't big at all and was thrown off from their limited selection. Maybe next time I'll try lunch or some baked goods instead but trust me, NO NEED TO WAKE UP EARLY FOR THIS BREAKFAST SPOT. If you're really keen though, they serve breakfast all day on the weekends!It is interesting that this buffet is 'highly' rated, but we liked it the least out of the 4 that we tried.  WE were fortunate enough to have a free buffet each day, so we were able to compare this one with others.  The selection was minimal, the desserts were unappealing, and the taste was less than average, even for a buffet.  Don't get me wrong, you'll find enough food to fill you up and if you get it for free, even better, but I would never choose to actually PAY for this buffet.What happened to the Mirage Buffet that I remember from years ago?  We had dinner at Cravings because we were watching a show at the Mirage during our stay in Vegas.  There was no wait for the dinner buffet priced at $29 per person and we were shown to our table.  

The buffet has been remodeled since my last visit and it isn't good.  I felt like I was dining in a square shaped school cafeteria and the servers also looked liked they worked in a school cafeteria.....all they were missing was a hair net, lol.  

The buffet stations are located all along the four walls of the restaurant and the seating area was in the middle.  No ambiance at all...disappointing.  Our server, Mildred explained all of the buffet stations....seafood, Italian, American, Asian, Salad, and Dessert stations.   

My dinner buffet consisted of the following:
*  Cold Cracked Crab Legs - They were frozen and were defrosting in the buffet container.  
*  Shrimp Cocktail -  Nothing Special
*  Steamed Mussels - Again, nothing special
*  Sauteed Fish Fillet - Salty
*  Sauteed Broccolini - Fresh and delish!
*  Salad - Made to order and tasty.  There were also a couple of types of pre-made salads which were fresh.
*  Roast Beef - Dry and overcooked.
*  Desserts - Cafeteria looking desserts....enuff said.

My dinner buffet at Cravings was disappointing.  I only enjoyed my salad and some of the vege entrees for $29....plus, the setting was like a mess hall.  I wouldn't return for dinner again.  2 Stars.Wow this place was a dissapointment. 
Read the reviews before coming here and noticed majority of the low reviews were from breakfast. We went there for lunch so we thought it would be okay and wouldnt be so bad but man was it terrible!

The place is big but the food stations and choices are small and limited in my opinion. There weren't too much choices for lunch and everything i've tried tasted below average. I don't want to be so picky about buffet foods but nothing appealed to me and didn't take more than one bite, except the shrimp cocktail but how can you go wrong with that......

Save your twenty something dollars and go else where!!!!!!I have been in Vegas for about 7 yrs and while I love the town and the shows, I try to have dinner off the strip.  My GF and I have a very lengthy list of quality off the strip restaurant...just this weekend we took out her mom for dinner. Her mom's choice was Vintner Grill in Summerlin, definitely not a restaurant of our liking.
We made reservations for 7:30, when we got there the place was a quarter occupied.  That should have been our sign to walk out.  Here's the summary of our night:
* It took almost 15 mins for someone to finally come over our table and offer drink
* Typically restaurants will have off the menu specials when we asked the waiter was very short and rude
* Drinks took another 15 mins and while the waiter took our order he spilled half of my cocktail on the table.  Did he offer to move us to a difference table or change the table cloth??? NO WAY, instead he quickly said "sorry" and took off to the kitchen.  
* I thought he would return with a new drink, to my surprise he returned with the appetizers we had order. 
* Appetizers really sucked, my Italian wedding soup was very salty.  
* My GF got a burnt steak for dinner, her mom's raviolis were OK
* The Tiramisu basically had a giant thick hard/old brownie in the middle
Between drinks and food the bill was about $300, I was so pissed off that my tip to the waiter was "better service". 
On our way out we looked for the manager to let him know of the poor service, but saw that he was too busy chatting up the hostess in a corner.  Probably trying to line up his date/quickie for the night. 
TIP: don't come here.  I wish I had read the reviews.  We all agreed this place is permanently a NO GOThis place has the worst service. I have been here many times and every time it seems to get worse. 

The steaks are just average, nothing special. They have a Wagyu burger that they say is amazing. This was the driest burger I have ever tasted. We also ordered the seafood appetizer for 2. This was the biggest piece of crap and total waste of money. If you order for 2 people, there should be enough for 2.

This cold appetizer plate came out with 1 shrimp, 2 clams, 1 lobster tail and 1 crab leg. Please tell me how this is for 2 people? Where we supposed to share the shrimp? OMG- When we complained they looked at us like we were crazy. I don't think so people.

I will never return to this place again. Too many chances here and they have never redeemed themselves.I'm giving this only two stars because my review is somewhat relative to the price.
Some aspects of the service were slow but it seemed to be a problem at the bar. (too much employee chatter, not enough work)  Our waiter was fine.  I ordered one of the steak specials which at $52 for about 6 ounces of meat was fairly pricey.  It was delicious but with 2 drinks and a tip it was nearing $100.  It wasn't *that* good.   There are a few other places I can think of that are equally good for less and as my every experience at Red Rock is that they are "strip" and not "locals"... I guess inflated prices go with it.If your namesake is wings, they should be awesome. And at BWW, the wings are merely mediocre. They do offer a wide range of sauces but nothing stood has stood out so far in my experience. They offer all-you-can-eat wings on Thursdays during lunch but their idea is to wait the customer out - we were there for 75 minutes with a very light crowd and we only got to re-fill our baskets (4 wings at a time) three times. That's barely passable service.

In terms of their drinking selection, BWW is really missing the mark. They understandably are catering to the sports fan crowd but to make it synonymous with only mass produced beer is terrible. There are so many craft options they could incorporate, especially local in Phoenix, and they really could do better if they aspire to be a go-to bar.

There is nothing wrong with BWW, there are just so many other good options, especially for their price point.Our service was terrible here. It took a very long for our order to be taken and even longer for it to finally be served and it wasn't terribly busy. When we asked our server to split the bill she gave us attitude saying "well I don't know who had what". So she did not split it like we asked. 
The food was not bad but I couldn't look past the poor service.Ate in the bar area.

The music was too LOUD - I couldn't hear the person across from me.

Had the lobster egg roll - it was ok.  Nice and crunchy but the flavor was meh...

Had the meat that you cook on the hot rock..... Did it once, won't do it again. 

Had the spicy tuna roll - the rice was too wet

Had the hamachi negi roll - rice was too wet

Will only come here for the drinks next time.Service without a smile. That is the summary. It was felt by the entire group that had lunch at Table 34 today that the waitress felt she was getting an automatic tip so she did not have to do much. Service was very slow even with  most of the tables empty.

The food was ok but nothing to write home about or even to take home.My wife and I were here some months ago for pizza and salad apps.  Ordered beet salad with goat cheese and greens, which I had enjoyed before.  My wife ordered appetizer with tomato and basil.  My salad didn't have the goat cheese! Her's didn't have the basil! Waiter told me the goat cheese was mixed in the dressing and could not be seen, weak. We ordered pizza, one full hour later was told it had not been started yet!  We left. I think the poor service was due to the fact we did not order alcohol and we're taking a booth that could hold more people.  I guess if you want  good service and food made according to menu, drink up. Probably won't be back.I wasn't impressed. The bread is dense and the options leave a lot to be desired. I got a veggie sandwich and even though the ingredients looked great, they didn't sing when all together. The Sundevil was better (I have to give them credit for the spicy mustard, it is divine) but still not good enough for me to go back.All the buffets are pretty much the same.  Over here you pay $28 and you get to go in and out of this buffet without worrying being hungry.  The bad part is that they close at 10 p.m. so it wasn't worth the price that I paid for.  I only had breakfast the 1st time I paid and next morning.  $28 for two breakfast still cost a little too much for me.  

Another option is to pay each meal separately.  I don't remember the price.  I think either way won't help me save much.I don't get chain restaurants.  Can a chain restaurant really serve authentic ethnic food?  Or is there such a strict code of uniformity that authenticity must be sacrificed for the masses?
I will admit there are times when a chain place can be comforting and even welcomed.  But I know full well what to expect (or not expect) at those times.
I don't think this place is a chain but it sure does have that chain feel to it.
The food was good but there wasn't enough to be filling and not worth what we paid for.  The same story goes with the margaritas.  It was refreshing but lacked a punch.  We kept waiting for a slight buzz to hit after guzzling down a pitcher.  But nada.  You can image what we said when our waitress asked if we wanted another.
Overall, it's as good if not slightly better than Chevy's or El Torito. 
And until I yelp or find something better, I'm sticking with Roberto's Taco Shop.5 of us went to the Cork'n Cleaver on New Years Day. We had a reservation.

When we arrived we were seated promptly....at the very very back of the restaurant in a room where no other people were sitting. I'm not sure if it was because we are "young" (all in our 30's)... we were dressed dressy casual, all the guys had a button up or Polo on. Not sure what the seclusion was for. 

We were seated, a girl came by for our drink order. When our waiter finally came over he handed us a meat cleaver! The menu is actually on a huge "knife". That sucker was heavy. I told him that it was all of our first times being there. He just said ok. Really? No informing us of the place. No welcome. Nothing. I was less then impressed.

We all finally ordered, the cool thing is you get a side and a trip to the salad bar for the cost of your meal. Prices there ranged between about $29-45. Ruth's Chris prices but they included a side and salad so its a good deal. They brag about the large salad bar, and while yes it is large, and I thought the chilled metal plates where neat, the salad bar was not impressive. The cucumbers and carrots were in realllly thick slices, not one bite or manageable slices. They also had caviar and anchovies on the bar....along with gummy bears and some sort of ambrosia grandma looking concoction. Pretty random selection.

The dinners arrived, 3 people all ordered the prime rib and all ordered it medium and with a baked potato...hard to mess up right? Wrong, they brought out some rice to one of them? My friend and I both got the New York strip. I was less then impressed. For $39 I expected a lot better cut and the way it was cooked just wasn't great. I asked for medium well, There was no pink at all. 

Overall for the price you get a ton of food...but is that always best?

I don't see us going back. It wasn't terrible, but not impressive in the least. The services was very lacking.Top Chef: Tom Colicchio, Head Judge, Seasons 1-5

Here's my beef with chain restaurants started by people who are looking to capitalize on being well known (Take note Wolfgang)...your "big name" is a double edged sword.  On one hand, you're hoping to draw me in to your low-end restaurant because it's Tom Colicchio's place and I've had good experience in your high-end place.  With that, though, comes the expectation on my part that you won't serve food that isn't of an appropriate quality to be associated with your name.  

I was sorely disappointed by my visit to 'wichcraft.  I mean, I'm not expecting a sandwich place to be a complete gourmet dining experience, but I judge it as a sandwich place, so its possible to get 5 stars "as a sandwich place'.  'wichcraft left a lot to be desired.  The space, in a big Vegas "strip mall" known as the shops at the MGM or whatever, was not that inviting.  The sandwich, though was bad.  The idea (pork and cabbage) was good, but there was little filling inbetween two slices of very stale bread.  Tom, if this was your elimination challenge, I would have told you to pack your knives.Were my expectations high coming in here? Sure. But it's not like I was looking for Colicchio to get his shiny head all sweaty making me a sammy in the back. I simply thought they'd have an interesting menu of overpriced, but delicious 'wich's. Wrong. The menu is boring, the sammies are small and, as expected, the prices are high (peep the pic of my slow-roasted pork pressed 'wich). Bleh. I wouldn't be proud of that sammich if I made it in my own kitchen. 

Stumbling out of Wet Republic? You'll do just fine here. For everyone else, look elsewhere for good eats.The only thing that shined was the creamy hummus and the tzatziki.  The chicken and steak kabobs seemed dry and the greek lasagna too soggy.  however, the dolmades and spanokopita were great.

Conclusion:  Maybe I expected better because someone greek recommended over Market Grille Cafe, but it was not worth definitely not worth it for the price we paid.  The only other plus was that the service was pretty attentive.As big of a whole foods fan I am, this location was underwhelming. It seems that the charm of the company was lost on this location, as opposed to the east coast markets.

I felt like I might have well have been shopping at Wal-mart.WOW, this buffet has really gone downhill ever since the last time I was here, which was a couple of years ago. The first time I was here, everything was flawless. But now, a lot of the dishes were mostly bland and mediocre. The only thing good here were the desserts.Ambience & service are great~food is okay. I got the burger, which at $17, was the cheapest option. It was dry & flavorless. The fries were limp shoestrings seasoned w/ too much salt. The salad was a joke. Two pickles and coleslaw, yes coleslaw, on two pieces of romaine.It's a sad day when I have to give this place I was once adored, 2 (+1/2) stars. I used to dream of staying here.... I stayed one summer weekend a couple of years ago and was in complete bliss... But, times have changed for the RR... They need a facelift of staff and decor. I love the modern look. Seriously, I wish my house looked like the red rock inside. However, the upkeep must not be good because it's now dingy and icky. I started my stay on the wrong foot when we walked into the check in area, and there was no staff person in sight to check us in. There was a concierge standing at his post twiddling his thumbs, and saw us there, but didn't offer to call anyone to the front desk. After 10 min of waiting, I walked over to him and asked that he make a call to have someone appear... We arrived in our room to it being only half made up from the last person. There was no new soap to wash our hands, and the bathroom was... Gross. The spa was nice, as I remembered, but the grout around the wet areas like in the showers, steam room, and spa was mildewed and grimy... Not what you would expect from them. And may I suggest... Cranberry infused sparkling water and cucumber lemon water in the spa lounge? That's how I fell in love with the spa at the M resort. Just saying... But then again, they also had Moroccan Oil products in their showers, everything was spick and span, and the ladies who worked in their spa were sweet and attentive. Again, just saying. :)I was so psyched to do the mega-tour package which would've taken me down to the south rim via plane and a helicopter view of the rim.  Unfortunately weather had another idea as snow came down and they had to cancel the trip.  

The thing that gets me upset is that they could've called to let you know what happened before they make you wake up at 5AM and then take a bus ride all around Las Vegas to pick up other people....only to have a representative call each person up one-by-one to tell you your trip is cancelled. Then you have to wait for them to finish telling everyone and rescheduling people to have the shuttle bring you back to the hotel some 4 hours later.

We ended up rescheduling to try again the next day due to the weather and chose to drive ourselves this time.  The flight time was suppose to be 8AM and they like everyone to arrive by 7:15AM.  Before we left the hotel, I gave them a call to double-check to see if the tour was cancelled or not.  They chose to tell us that the tour was still on and have everyone gather there once again.  Again, they cancelled and tried to reschedule people....again, they did it one person at a time.  This time, we didn't have to wait for everyone as we drove ourselves and we took off after being told it was cancelled....again.

For such an expensive package and great reviews, I really expected the administrative/customer service to be a little better.  Rather than have people waste their time and sleep....it would be nice if they handled cancellations due to weather better.  There were multiple ways they could've saved time and streamlined the process even if they had to wait until the very last minute to cancel....and they didn't.

There wasn't suppose to be snow at the time I booked the reservation, but next time (if there is one), I'd make sure there's nothing but sunny skies for two weeks...just to be sure.Tables & the floor looked oily & dirty.
I walked out of the store without ordering.
I can't imagine they would bother to keep inside kitchen area clean.Zia never seems to have what I am looking for.
They do have a large selection of new and used, cassettes and videos and DVDs. But I am almost always disappointed when I go there, not being able to find what I went there for.
You can sell CDs and movies there, too. But there is such a large volume of used and so many people doing it that there is usually a long wait and the pretentious staff is pretty picky.
It is worth a look, though, browsing through the large amount of used CDs and movies, sometimes there is a deal too good to pass up.this was the first Japanese restaurant I've tried out in Arizona, and I was pretty disappointed with the quality. I'm from California where the sushi is really good. this place is expensive for sushi quality I would get out of Safeway deli. We were the only ones in the restaurant which should of been warning sign number one. The only really good tasting sashimi was the salmon. 
The location is decorated in a really strange way and definitely needs to be renovated. It's also very small. Overall, go somewhere else. Not worth it.This place use to be really good. Good food and good staff. Paid $10 for 4 chicken breast sliders that were not even real chicken, more like formed chicken with rib meat and chunks of fat. Slow service. Messy bar. Only comped one pint of beer after gambling $1 hands at blackjack over 2 hours. Definitely not what I remember coming too when I still lived on that side of town a year ago.This place is not worth your money, we were there for a bachelor's party and this was a joke. Only reason they got 2 stars instead of one is because service is decent and sides were good. 

As for the Steaks... 
The steaks were all in-consistent, a couple of filets were over salted, a couple of Rib Eyes bland one salty. I got the best part, I ordered a medium rare Ribeye and I got it med-well to well done, I asked for a replacement and got one raw in the middle with the outside tasting of gas. 

Quality of the meat, there is no way they are dry aging prime rib-eyes, the steak flavor was not there nor the moisture/fat in the meat. I would take a Choice cut from costco over coming here again. This was more in comparison to a select cut from a supermarket. 

Only saving grace was good sides, mushrooms and mac and cheese was good.My second visit was rather disappointing.  I thought he would make a few changes in the show but not so.  I went with a group and we all decided that Anthony Cools show is better.8 of us went to the Sunday Brunch to celebrate my father's  82nd birthday. They charged us a 18% gratuity--which is crazy for a buffet. The food was not very hot--unless you got a made to order omelet. The ham was dried up. Desert selection was poor and they only had a small tray of sweet rolls. We should have known to go elsewhere as they place was not crowded at 10:30am.  3 of us are locals and go to the Palms regularly to gamble but we will never go back to the buffet.I really wanted to like B and B. Unfortunately, I cannot give it a good review. Of all the dishes we ordered, I loved the grilled octopus. By husband got a seafood dish similar to Cioppino and my friend got the bolognese. We also had a salad. I can't remember what my friend's husband had. These were  all ok, but not exceptional. The worst thing we ordered was the Foie Gras Ravioli with a balsamic glaze. This was on the price fix menu, but our lovely waitress, Trina (I think) from Napa agreed to bring it to me for my entree.  What I got was I inedible. More like a balsamic soup. The balsamic overpowered everything!  Our waitress took  it off the bill, but the corking charge for our magnum of wine  was $75! I'm sorry, but that is ridiculous! Also, it was my friend's and my birthdays but nothing was done about that? Why ask if it's a special occasion if you don't plan to do anything about it?  I read that other reviewers said they were served some complimentary desserts, we got nothing. We dine at fine restaurants all the time, and I consider myself to be a bit of a foodie, but B and B Ristorante was very disappointing! I must say, I have eaten at Babbo in New York, and loved it.First of all, I wouldn't really consider this an "attraction" its more of a "curiosity".
 If you find yourself in the general area and you have 15 minutes to kill, stop by.  Otherwise you're going out of your way to see  a few lions sleeping. 
I admit, lions are not something you see every day and the opportunity to see even one (despite the fact that it's sleeping) is fairly awesome. But you arrive, wait patiently for a spot close to the glass to catch a glimpse of one, take a photo and then you just kind of stand there. And then after a minute of that you start think "Wow, these are seriously beautiful creatures. It sucks that they're stuck in this artificial environment getting gawked at all day."  I felt a little dirty afterwards. 
I will say the habitat itself is beautiful! 9 million dollars worth of beautiful.
There's also an informative recording that plays every 5-10 minutes. It tells you about the habitat, the lions and gives helpful factoids. One of which was: Lions sleep 18-20 hours a day. They are not dancing monkeys. 

To view the exhibit itself is free, but if you wanna shell out $25 bucks you and one other person can get your photo taken with a lion cub. 
I'm not gonna lie. They were reeeaaalllyyy f***ing cute!I have never had worse service in a hotel than this past weekend at Caesar's- we found the guest's before us underwear in our room, it took 6 hours for them to bring us an extra blanket and 24 for the extra pillows- our wake-up call never came- this is supposed to be a world class hotel- I don't think so- and when i told the staff about these instances- they just couldn't be bothered and the manager shrugged and said it's a holiday weekend- we don't have the staff- then hire more people- helloI booked a facial/massage here in the summer as well as a manicure for myself and a pedicure for my friend. I've been to several spas and I was very excited to come here since I love the hotel.

When I first arrived, I was greeted, given a locker, and changed into a robe. The robe wasn't fitting too well around my chest area (busty) so I asked one of the ladies if they had something else after I explained my issue and held my robe closed at the chest. I was asked to go and relax in the seating area while she got me a new robe. The new robe never arrived. 

The lady who was giving me a facial/massage came over and greeted me as I continued to hold my robe closed at the chest. She took me outside of the women's spa area and a bunch of men turned around to look at me. I wasn't too comfortable since my boobs were practically falling out. We went into a room where regular traffic of people passed through between the front desk and the spa store, I believe. As I laid there getting a facial I kept hearing people talk and laugh outside of the door. The facial was nice, but the massage felt like she was just rubbing my back in the same motion. The motions were relaxing anyhow.

One issue I had was the woman who did my facial never asked me if my skin was sensitive to anything. After the facial, my face got red and itchy. It became very dry. I wasn't sure what she used, but I could have asked myself ahead of time. I wish I had a  better experience because I wanted to love it.The food at Pita Jungle is really good but the service at the 2 locations I have been at is always the same, horrible!  I came into this location to have dinner with 3 other people and walked in and asked for a table and the hostess sat 4 people who came in after me before me.  When she walked back she said, "Oh, I forgot that you needed a table for 4 as well.  Something will clear up soon."  Then our waitress was a little less than thrilled to be helping us.  The food took forever to get to our table and we were never asked if we wanted more drinks, we had to ask another waiter for help.

I am all for supporting local establishments but Pita Jungle is hard to support when they seem so uninterested in their customers.We were here when they first opened up and decided to try it again to see if anything changed.  We were seated right away on hard chairs on a table for 4.  All the clutter in the middle with all the condiments is very disgusting and should be re-worked.  We put everything to the corner to get it out of our way.  Someone came right over to take our drink order and then they brought out the wrong tea, we ordered green tea, they brought us earl grey.  We ordered hot water with lemon and they forgot the lemon, we ordered Orange Juice and they forgot to bring it until we asked them more than 4x...Finally after the drink orders were straighten out and they brought us the correct stuff, our orders came out.  Avoid the hash browns, they have no flavor what so ever and the only thing in their HB are potatoes no salt or pepper, we sent them back and they bought out a very tiny bowl of fruit for us which had less than 10 small pieces of fruit.  Not real sure why they put powdered sugar on the pancakes, but they do and we did not know this so had to send our pancakes back, powdered sugar on cakes does not taste good, it is not a dessert but a breakfast item.

The gluten-free pancakes were dry, sweet and hard to eat without lots of fluid.  The make your own egg omelet with baby spinach an cheese was ok - light and airy.  Not real sure what all the fuss is about, but we were not impressed, the food is not a wow factor - everything is just either okay or not okay...nothing will wow your taste buds and there are other places in town which do this.  I wish someone someplace would make a great tasting gluten free pancake which is not dry.  We probably will not be back, not a favorite place of ours, we have had too many problems with their food or lack of good tasting food.I had buffalo wings and a side cesear salad.  The food was fine.  Nothing special.  Not too overpriced considering it is located on the strip.

I was told that they do not serve tap water (only bottled) so I was forced into purchasing a soda.

The service was horrible.  There were about 30 people dining and only one waitress.  The other waitresses were on break or hadn't started their shift.  I could see them sitting around texting on their phones while I got bad service.

They turned on the audio to some basketball game.  It was way too loud.  I had to scream to my friend sitting accross the table.

The food is 3 stars.  The service is 1 star.  Averages to 2 stars.Disappointing. While the Warhol exhibit is interesting, it is an extremely small display for the price. We'd heard about the Gallery for many years, and it didn't live up to the hype. 

I'd recommend the Mob Exhibit at the Tropicana; much better value and highly recommended.All I can say is, somewhere out there, Hugh Hefner is crying tears of sadness because of this club.
(Note- the word "club" is definitely a misnomer for this place. Read on.)

But 3.5 stars for a Vegas club? Maybe I went on a bad night...

--the music... was whatever. Granted, it was hip-hop, but it really wasn't anything memorable. It was definitely not like XS or Pure where 1) roofs are raised, 2) we went to the window and to 3) the wall, and 4) sweat did drip down some balls. 

--the club... was was whatever. Pretty, but what Vegas club isn't pretty? There's a dance floor in the middle, but there are SO many couches and lounge areas around the club that people seem to just like sitting around instead of dancing!! But hey, maybe that's because....

-the drinks were SO expensive!!! Do you think your customers are ballers? Please. Then they wouldn't be at the Playboy Club!

There were SOME good things about this place though: amazing decor and really good view.I went there today to check out the Hatch Chili Throw-down that was starting at 1:00pm. 

We got there and noticed that is location is just like the market on Power Rd. named Guadalupe Farmers Market Too. 
Then the light bulb goes off "ding"...wow talk about a blond moment. I guess the names give away the relation. Anyway.. 

The cook-off was no where to be seen, but they were roasting fresh Hatch chilies. I was not really impressed with the selection inside and the prices were a bit high. We ended up getting some delicious smelling chilies and fresh tortillas. (Food City has cheaper roasted Hatch chilies on the weekend). 
It was a nice trip but I'm not sure it is worth a second try.Walls are very thin.  Television next door had me up all night. Very disappointed.  Closet very small as well.  Barley enough room for 1 persons belongings.Thing is..this store cannot compete with Frye's..and the proof is that there is hardly anyone there.  Limited selection on items, (I mean really..No Baker's Choc??) and the Starbucks..while staffed with very good people...alway has a line out the door on Sunday with pajama-clad coffee drinkers (P.S..go to Tully's at Frye's..no line and great coffee).  But what I really dislike is the few times I do go to Basha's, mainly for a sale..I am in line forever...one checker is only opened..and I am usually behind WIC people who divide up orders between baby formula (paid for by WIC) and about 10 bottles' of 40s (paid for with crumpled dollar bills).  So clerks are nice, store is clean, just is not on the level of Frye's, and they are more expensive.The chile relleno--the standard by which all Mexican food restaurants should judged due to the difficulty in preparation--was soggy with a bland ranchero sauce and stuffed with cheese that quickly solidified into a chewy slug. Stick to the tasty mole sauce, which covered some dry chicken stuffed enchiladas.Traveled for work and we have a corporate agreement with them. I arrived at the hotel and was informed that they did not have my King bed available, I never get how you reserve a room and then they are out. I asked if I could get an upgrade, which they obliged and put me on the executive business floor. The floor smelled of cigarette smoke. The hotel needs some repairs overall, which they said they were going to remodel. Room was clean, some dirt behind the bed, yes I look everywhere and the little closet was in very rough shape. What I was really upset about is that these hotels and our agreement is supposed to have a Sleep Number bed. It's even advertised. Nope, not in the executive floor rooms. Makes sense right? My mattress was worn and not comfortable at all, prob the worst night sleep ever. Was not rested for the big meeting the next day. IAsk for the Sleep number!We have eaten at El Encanto Dos twice and we won't be returning.  The food is fairly gringo and I feel over priced for what you get.  The real rub for us is the service. We had ordered margaritas and 2 entrees (Jalepeno Rellenos and Green Chile Burro). The burrito was dry and tortillas thick and not warmed.  I would have asked to send it back but we didn't see our waitress except when we flagged her down for water. When we asked for more water it came about 10 minutes later with a grunt from the waitress as she dropped off the carafe. She actually slid it across our table as she passed by, never making eye contact not even breaking stride. As my husband poured our waters for us he looked at me and we said in unison, never again. Our waitress never checked in with us or asked if we needed anything. 

The restraunt is pretty and the patio looked nice.  It could use a good scrubbing, the windows were dirty, splatters on the wall next to our booth, the table and menus were sticky,the bathroom was dusty with grime on the stall doors.  Just not a good feeling at all and quite disappointing.  I think I could have tolerated the food but the service or the lack of, is what sent us over the edge and the point of no return.....Overpriced. Dry pork. 
Specials don't save much. 
Tea is good.
You want some great BBQ, ribs, etc? Go to Hap's BBQ on Washington st. and 52nd st. Next to samurai Sam's.The service was okay.  The food was terrible.  The cooks do not make the french fries to order.  They cook a large batch and place them in a metal container that sits at the pass.  After discussing this with the manager I was  told that there is a four minute turn around on the fries.  I did not see any fries added to that container for at least 20 mins.  Our dinner sat at the pass for at least eight minutes after our appetizer was served.  If you are going for the atmosphere that is fine.  If you are going for the food, I would suggest going somewhere else.I used to LOVE Freddy's.  We started going when we were in Texas on vacation and then the opened this location and WOW...we had a favorite.

We have been to this location several times and the location in Gilbert twice.  It used to be that EVERY time we went it was AMAZING!!  Now, it is hit or miss.  Last visit to this location the fries were WAY overcooked...quality control would tell you not to send out burnt fries, but no they sent them right out to us.  I think the little burger has shrunk and it was small before.  

Ouch, why is it that when you start to really love a place it goes downhill?  Well, at least In & Out burger stays consistant and since I now live in SoCal I guess we won't be missing Freddy's anymore.The reviews are pretty accurate in my opinion. We have received poor service from them. Their service is inconsistent. At times they are great and at other times, they were there for 5 minutes and left. They promise to provide all of these service with each cleaning and in our experience, they have not done so. I can't recall the last time I saw them brush the sides of our pool. They don't always empty every basket. And I've never seen them vacuum the pool floor. And we paid for their highest level of service. We've called to complain about their techs being not thorough and they were rather defensive and didn't apologize or see what they could do to improve service. Overall, this is the attitude they seem to embrace. Rather than put the customer first, they get defensive. There have been other problems. For example, they stopped providing service on two separate occasions. In my opinion, their front office is disorganized. On two different occasions, they stopped providing service due to problems with their front office. On one occassion, they lost our billing information and another, they forgot to put us on their schedule.I go here because it is close to my house, but it is usually a disappointing experience. First, the pricing practices by Kroger (and most other large grocery chains) are misleading at best. Surreptitiously down-sizing quantities, e.g. coffee, without lowering the price is one practice. The other is calling it a sale when they mark up an item then promote it as "buy one, get one free". Most consumers know it is bull@$#t, but their marketing geniuses really think they are pulling one off. This week Fry's advertised pork ribs, "buy one get two free". But their price for these ribs is $7.99/lb!! Gristly old pork ribs that normally sell for $1.99 - $2.99 per pound marked up to the price of a quality sirloin steak. I know the definition of a lie is pretty vague in business, but this type of pricing practice is about as close as it gets. They pretty much all do it so we have little choice in taking our business elsewhere, though this time I went to Sprouts and bought them for the honest price of $2.99 a pound. 
The second issue is service. In business you can always have one employee that is having a bad day or is just bad at customer relations, but most of their checkout employees here seem unhappy. Don't know why, but maybe their personnel policies have the same effect on employee morale as their pricing policies have on consumers.I'm going to keep it simple! 2 MEDIUM pizzas (Vortex and Hawaiian) = $45 freakin ridiculous! The pizza was good! I'll go back when I win the lottery!um...... no

I have been to this Blockbuster before with out any major issues but the incident that went down the other night provoked me into uncharted yelping territory. 
Now, I've had crappy experiences at establishments before (haven't we all) but only a couple of times in my life have I been made to feel criminal. (when I wasn't being a fucking criminal) 

I rode down to drop a couple of movies off and pick up a couple more. I don't have a rack or fancy dancy basket on my bike so when I go somewhere that I will need to transport items to or from I wear my backpack. ....can you see where this is going....

I walk in, drop of the movies I had and begin moseying around the store. The 17 yr. old employee comes up to me and asks if I would mind leaving my backpack up at the front. UM... YES KIDDO, I WOULD MIND. 
I begin getting disoriented and confused..... did I just step out of a fucking time machine as the 1991 "candy raver" version of myself?? Do I look like I'm about to rob your damn store for anything I can sell so I can buy more ecstasy?? Do I have a "binkie" hanging out of my mouth??
Ahem....... NO. I'm a 32 yr old "lady" that just dropped off 3 movies and can *gasp* afford to rent a couple more. I'm not giving your 17 year old ass my backpack, plain and simple. Why, so you can rob me? No thanks. One thing I will give him is that he didn't put up much of a fight. I said no and he moved on pretty quickly. Still confused, I'm not sure if that's good or bad. I just know I'm pretty sure I'm going to upgrade my Netflix account.

sheesh .... and to think I rode right past Movies On Central.   grrrrrI just tried this place based on the reviews on here but I was disappointed. No ambiance, though that's not always a bad thing. The staff was courteous but the food left lots to be desired. The spring rolls,  which I always look forward to at Vietnamese restaurants, were wimpy. The pho was ok,  nothing special. I had to ask for cilantro on the side. I'd come here again if I was really craving pho and didn't have time to go anywhere else.The search for decent Chinese food in the valley continues, as Jong Wah won't be our go-to place.

We started with the Popo Platter. Though we were one of just three tables there on a Saturday night around 7:30, it took nearly 30 minutes for our platter to come out. It was plated beautifully. Unfortunately, the fried shrimp had an odd texture I had to pass on, and the crab ragoon and ribs were barely lukewarm. The highlight was the egg rolls. These were clearly made in-house because the insides were crunchy. As in, not previously frozen and then defrosted mushiness. They were very good.

We ordered Kung Pao chicken and a beef and brocolli dish, plus house fried rice. The two dishes were well spiced. Often spicy dishes are just ungodly spicy where you can't taste anything else, but these actually had some flavor. It's just too bad the quality of beef was so poor you wouldn't want to eat it by itself.

The house fried rice was outstanding, with huge shrimp. We'd highly recommend the rice and eggrolls.

We also had a coupon, and our bill, with one soda, was $40. Ouch. We couldn't make heads or tails of our itemized, handwritten bill.

They do have an outdoor patio.Yummy food and excellent service, as always. However Beau and I have been scrupulous when evaluating restaurants' hygiene; it was unsettling to see them sweep the floor with raw food, clean plates and prep bowls so very low to the floor. Most servers had their hair pulled back tightly, or very short, with one exception - and her long loose hair stood out. It was disappointing that they charged extra for a broccoli substitute for pasta.It's like the star rating, "Meh, I've experienced much better."  I only liked their nice little patio, it looked very cozy. We came here for lunch, but then decided to order takeouts.

Nobody came to greet us when we walked in; it's not even that busy. We actually had to walk to the sushi bar and ask for a memu. I ordered a shrimp tempura roll with a side of edamame, my friend ordered their specialty Vegas roll. It took about 15 mins to get the two rolls ready when the place was pretty empty.

The taste was just average, sushi rice was VERY sticky! And when we opened our box, my shrimp tempura roll was all by itself with some wasabi, no soy sauce packages; and my friend's Vegas roll was with some eel sauce, no soy sauce nor wasabi. How are we supposed to eat??? And the menu described warm soy beans,,,my edamame was really cold and had water dripping....Ok, so we all know moving sucks.  Especially moving ones self...even if it is acoss town.

Anyways, I had to get a 10 foot uhaul for my move from Chandler to Mesa.  I was moving a whopping 12 miles, but I just needed a 10 foot truck to do one trip with to get my mattress, bedroom furniture, couch, and other random stuff to the new apartment.  Fine.

So, I go in the night before I needed it and made a reservation for the truck.  Fine.  I go back the next morning, to get the truck, and this is where I get upset.  I'm already stressed out from moving, its hot as heck outside, and I want to get this overwith.  Im the only person in the store and its 8 AM.

So, I go to the counter.  A guy helps me, who's name I will not list in this review, even though I remember it.  He's filling out the stuff in the computer, and asks me for a secondary phone #.  I told him I did not have one, and the only one I have is my cell number. Well, I guess that was a huge problem to him, and he basically snapped at me and said "look, I need a second phone number for you.  I'm just trying to fill out the paperwork!  Just give me your work number, okay?"  

Crap. Now I've been scolded by the uhaul man for not having a second phone #, and clearly this is really screwing up his day, really bad.   Now, I'm the bad guy.  So, what did I do?  I gave him a fax number.  Yea, call THAT and reach me.

So, then, they go to get me my truck.  Well, guess what?  It has no gas, because someone siphoned it out overnight! So the guy says to me "did you want to wait for 15 minutes for me to gas the truck, or did you just want to take it empty?"  Why would I want to drive a uhaul that has zero gas in it???  So I can be stranded a mile down the road, and make this day longer?????  So, I waited for him to gas it.

Now, while I was waiting, and cranky counter man was gassing the truck up, two other employees waltz in.  I asked if they worked here, and they said that they are uhaul employees, but they are finance from corporate.  nice.  

See, I normally dont get mad, but I was so stressed from moving, and after getting scolded, I had to complain to someone.  So, I tell finance that counter boy is very cranky this morning and scolded me for not having a secondary phone number, and I dont appriciate it.  They were like "uh, ok thanks."

Anyways, cranky counterboy comes back with the truck, which was nice by the way.  Clean, fast, and most importantly, with gas!  I take the truck, move my stuff, and return it.  I think he got told that I complained becuase I got a few bucks off the dolly rental that I had....plus, he was in a MUCH better mood this time.

I gave this place only 2 stars for the cranky counter boy.  But, the trucks were clean and neat.I don't know what to think of this place. Had a windshield replaced. The rear view mirror fell off- no problem. They reapply the gule and metal piece used to anchor the rear view mirror- no problem. They tell me to wait til the next day to put the mirror back on- no problem. I wait til the next afternoon and it falls off again- no problem. I take it back in and they tell me I NEED TO FIX IT MYSELF- they tell me to go buy some windshield apoxy and do it myself- I was stunned.
They were all so professional and helpful up to this point. Fix it myself... really?
That's your customer service- go fix it yourself.The other half and I settled on this place the other nite b/c we couldn't find the other Chinese buffet we were searching for.  After about an hour's drive, we looped back toward CenPho and pulled in here instead.  I had a bit of trepidation but you know I love me some ghetto Chinese buffet.  We'll, that's exactly what I got.

The selection was pretty good but there were only about 10 things I ventured to try. The fried rice was skank; bland, tasteless and mealy. The "lo mein" was actually the best thing on the buffet.  The chicken dishes were ok.  The pork spareribs were disgusting; mushy candy-red chunks of bone with hardly any meat, swimming in a gelatinous sea of sauce that tasted of only 1 thing I can compare the flavor to -- pink urinal cakes.  There was some nasty looking fried fish remains left dying on the buffet (the skin had been crackling under the lights for hours) and some assorted old food.  No egg rolls. Nasty dried out rangoon. The tables were sticky (which grosses me out completely) and the bathrooms were actually better than I expected given the rest of the place.

I think if we'd come earlier the offerings may have been more appealing.  We hit the place around 8:30 on a Saturday nite and they closed at 10, so they weren't refilling the tables much. Such is life in buffettown.

On a positive note, the fountain Coke was the best I've tasted in years -- perfect balance of sweet Cokey syrup and enough carbonation to not seem flat.

I doubt I'd go in again, although the register receipt did crack us up.  At the top it reads, "Great Dragon Buffet presents the THANK YOU". 

Well, thank you GDB!I go to red Robin a few times a year with the kids at their request, and usually have decent experience with the food and service. This particular burger treck was done as a result of a free burger offer for my son's 15th birthday.

After the experince of my husband's meal and my own...I have decided that burger's are the ONLY choice here for me personally.

The husband ordered the salmon fish and chips and was pealing off the mushy and greasy batter after the second bite. After doing this we almost could not tell if this was salmon or some breed of white fish...it was so pale and lethargic we were not even sure it was salmon...however we were assured by our server it was legit. I tried a bite it was not good at all.

I ordered their "steak" sliders. Upon taking mu first bite I almost ripped out my 2 front teeth. Not only was the meat full of grissle, bit the taste and texture of the meat made me gag. These were not edible and I asked our server for a replacement (which he did gladly) and was told by the server that this happens a lot with sliders ( the grissle). My alternate was a cheeseburger with bleu cheese ( this was fine). 

This was not a horrible experience, I just will stick to their burger menu in the future.

P.S. The visit was also made more exciting by a female employee sitting at their of the restaurant crying hysterically for about 10 minutes and then proceeded to curse out someone on her cell phone !!It was easy to get a seat, considering it was on a weekday night and the place was virtually empty. The atmosphere is inviting and cultural, with a comfortable vibe and color everywhere. The booth we were at even had its own little television to watch! I really like the decoration of the place, it definitely invites you into the experience.

Unfortunately, the food was bland at best. The bean dip with chips was okay, but the two other sides of what I thought was salsa and spicy salsa were too watered down and bland. Even the chips themselves didn't have any real kick or substance to them. I ordered the plan bean burrito, in which the rice was very bland and a little mushy. The burrito itself was nothing exciting, and I only ended up finishing half of my meal (and not taking the rest of it home with me).

My boyfriend ended up finding a long, thick black hair in his food. We immediately told the bus boy, and while it took the manager a good minute to head over to our table, she was nice enough on removing the item from the bill. Our server also gave us a free margarita in place of it. While having a taste of the margarita (and minding they made that margarita kick!), their server either forgot to card him or felt obligated to get him his drink for free. Either way, there is absolutely no reason why he shouldn't have asked for ID in a town like this. That automatically wanted me to drop this review down to a one star.

My conclusion is this place draws you in with the decor and beauty of the atmosphere, but it doesn't make up for the food. Ricardo's has a lot of potential if they offered new menu items if they decided to revamp what they already have with more flavor. Otherwise, I'd pass on this place.I give it two stars cause the food was tasty but the service and the price trickery, the servers and attitude sux.
Has great potential.I wasn't very impressed with my service when I was there. I didn't wait long to get in but I didn't feel the nurse did a through check when I went in for my yearly. To get a doctor I would have had to wait over a month so I took the first available. She wasn't a doctor so I am not sure if that makes a difference but I didn't find her friendly or helpful and she took less than 3 min in total with me. I felt she was rushed and I have had much better experiences with other Obgyn's in the valley.  I wouldn't recommend this facility.A few posh friends of mine came down to visit and for some strange reason they wanted to see the Fremont Street Experience. I only say strange because these are the kinds of friends who feel at home in places like the Bellagio, Wynn, or Venetian. Apparently, they saw a Vegas special on the Travel Channel and thought the Fremont Street Experience would be a "delightful" place to visit. 

I tried my best to convey to them that the Fremont Street Experience and Downtown area aren't exactly the nicest of areas. The majority of the people there aren't the same people who are staying at the Bellagio... Or at a nicer property on the Strip. I told them them they shouldn't expect to see any of their fellow Baccarat players there. Against their better judgement, they were insistent on seeing the place... and really who am 
I to stop them. Onward...

About a 8-10 minute drive from the Strip, we head into the Downtown area. I always park at the California Hotel and they validate, up to four hours, if you stamp your parking ticket near the casino cage. Otherwise its about $1 an hour or something. We head out the door and start walking that one block to Fremont Street.

Right outside the door is a homeless guy begging for some change. My friends seem a little unfazed since there are tons of homeless people begging for change in San Francisco. About half a block down, we see another vagrant asking to borrow a dollar. A friend cheerfully tells them that he just lost all his money to the casino and wanted to know if he could borrow a dollar so he can win it all back. A little classless but hilarious since we were somewhat tipsy.

We get to the Fremont Street unscathed and started walking towards the Plaza. If you've never been to the Fremont Street Experience, its a large covered canopy that links several smaller hotel/casinos together along several blocks. On the ceiling plays a light show every hour. Sometimes there are people performing or street vendors selling goods.

Tonight we got to see the Globe of Death, in which up to three motorcyclists drive around inside the steel globe in a uniform fashion without crashing. We continue to walk towards the Golden Gate Casino when this happens...

"Oh no, I dropped my sweater.", says the female friend.

We turn around and retrace about 20 steps before we see it. And when I say "it" I don't just mean the sweater, but the strange scene in front of us. We see a burly African American man, who's probably homeless, pick up the white small sweater/cardigan and shoves it under one arm. He then proceeds to take off his ratty t-shirt, lays it on the ground, and then starts to fold the shirt like as if he was working at the Gap. He ever so gently places the t-shirt in his sack and then starts to put on the sweater/cardigan. Did I mention he was a big burly man, (180+ lbs) putting on a SMALL sweater? He totally stretches it out while trying to squeeze into it. He gets it on and now starts to zip it up. He gets about 1/4 way up and cant seem to zip it up any further. He looks down, happily satisfied, picks up his stuff and walks away.

The bunch of us stood there speechless for about 2-3 minutes trying to process what just had happened. Questions raced in our minds asking ourselves if we really did see what really just happened. A friend broke the silence with, "So do you want me to ask him for your sweater back? He looks like a nice guy." The female friend just shook her head in disbelief and we just started walking again.

We visited Binions, Golden Nugget, The Fremont, and the Four Queens. We got to the point where the Fremont Street Experience ended and the Fremont East area begins. Now the Fremont East area isn't as nice as the Fremont Street Experience. Instead of being in the middle, you are now on the regular sidewalks. The atmosphere goes from bright touristy to a little shadier. 

I ask if they want to continue down this road on towards the El Cortez and whatever else was down there. "I guess it doesnt hurt to check it out.", someone answered. Ooooooookay. We get about 40 steps in and like a scene straight out of COPS, a police cruiser pulls over a vehicle and two more cop cars come blaring in from the other side as to surround the suspect car. Needless to say, my posh friends did an immediate 180 and started walking really fast back to safer FSE. I was walking behind them trying to hold my laughter and the best way to describe my feeling is that jingle bells line that goes "LAUGHING ALL THE WAY HA HA HA."

Afterwards, we headed back to our car and the evening was nearly over. My friends were eager to get back to their hotel suite to shower away the grimy feeling they felt. I think one of my friends summed up the whole night best when he said, "The Travel Channel lied to us."Not a bad place to grab a drink if price is your concern. Food menu is slim and nothing was that good. We ordered:
sweet potato fries - good flavor, a bit limp, nice honey dip
onion rings - crispy, fried part fell off of the onions
spinach artichoke dip - liked the taste of it but there were HUGE artichoke chunks that were too big to eat

Popular place for karaoke, or at least it sounded like it.This is the 2nd time we visited Shish Kabob House. The first time, the service was really slow. We thought it might be different, so we came back a second time and the service was worse.

We had reservations at 6:30pm and we were seated right away, but we sat there for 20 minutes before anyone came to our table to take our order. We finally ordered 3 hummus & pita, 2 Greek salads, and two Kabob Platters (beef kabob, chicken kabob, chicken lula kabob, beef lula kabob, rice , French fries.) They ran out of pork kabob. 

We finally got our water, hummus and pitas, and the Greek Salads, but we couldn't eat our salad because we didn't have any plates or utensils. We had to wait another 10 minutes to get our plates and utensils.

The food is pretty good, but I don't recommend going to this restaurant if you value good customer service. Unfortunately, we don't plan on coming back.Ok... so up front.. this is for the Cox Pavillion...   I know I could go and get a point for a new place.. .but they are right next to each other.. probably have the same street address, and frankly don't care all that much..

this place was ok... granted the arena next store had a basketball game in it that might have been drawing all the man-power, but this was just ok...  I was here for a volleyball match... the team I was there for won(sorry UNLV)

I was sitting and smelled nachos... looked around and saw a guy with them... but he was squeezing the rest of the nacho cheese out of a package!!!!  I'll pass.Egg works did not "Work-out" too well for me ;-/ Which Is a shame because I love LOVEEEEE breakfast....I can have It for lunch, dinner you name It. I Imagined this place to be near "Mind-Blowing" because I had heard many great things about It but to my disappointment It was not up to par. I ordered the Corned Beef Hash meal to go, service was speedy so I do have to give them that but the staff did seem to be  too busy talking amongst themselves to greet properly, The one girl who took my order was a bit snooty. 

My hash was not good, It had a really strong beef taste like they had just taken It off the cattle and the eggs had a rubbery texture to It., Not at all what I expected :-(The room itself was very big and spacious. It is easy to see why many families would choose to come here for vacation. The lazy river was awesome on a hot day and the big pool is relaxed and heated, so it is not freezing cold when you go out in spring. My only major issue with this resort was the service. Every night there were too many people for how many buses. And the bus drivers, particularly the asian man who drove nights was rude. And he would show up to the stops 5-10 minutes before the pick up times and he would stay the entire time even if the bus was completely full and there were 10-15 people standing outside of the bus... This happened every night that I went out. And on last pick up time there was ALWAYS people left at New York New York and the mirage. One night my boyfriend and I had to take a taxi because there was no room for us on the bus and one night we were picked up at the mirage and there was only 3 seats open for passengers one man told me he had walked to the mirage from New York New York because the bus before was also full. another night we saw a party of 7: 3adults and 4 children  were left at New York New York, many of the children very young and already falling asleep. The excuse that was given was always that this is a free service. Even though this is a free service, it is unfair that large families have to spend so much more money just to get a taxi back to the hotel where they have most likely already paid for a few rooms. 

Another issue I had with service was that I like to be warm when I sleep so I called the first night I stayed to get a blanket sent to my room. No one ever came. It is a good thing I had brought a sleeping bag. The following night I called the front desk again and then no one sent me a blanket so I walked to the front desk and asked if I could get a blanket they told me that they would have one sent to my room because they do not have any at the front desk. I went to my room and an hour later I still hadn't had received a blanket so I called another time and finally half an hour later I received a blanket.After seriously giving up on the Rancho location (which is only a mile away from work), thought I would try this location (2 miles away). 

Ok, I don't know what's with Wells Fargo, but they don't seem to get customer service. No matter what branch I go to, they are ALWAYS short in tellers. There always seems to be an issue when I come here. The systems are down, not enough tellers, the really slow teller I seem to always end up with, the business line takes just as long, they don't have change. Never ending list. There are however, 2 tellers that I have become acquainted with who are fast and friendly, Pariese and Carlos. Thank you guys for making my trips bearable. Kudos to you guys, but seriously Wells Fargo, when will you step up?I would like to thank the smog tech for farting in my car before he got out and rolled the windows up. Other than this I'd say they have quite fast, can't say friendly service because everyone looked miserable and only said the things they had to, but then again how long does it really take to get a smog? Would have had 5 stars but my car smelt miserable after I got it back, staff don't greet you like a normal business should, you just get the "hey, what you need?" I paid, the tech have me my receipt then called the next person. No thank you, have a nice day, see you next time, thanks for coming, we appreciate your business. I assume jiffy lube corporate reads these so take those example phrases and utilize it in some training. Second, maybe you should pay your staff more they really look miserable at this location......Thanks for the gift (fart)!!I'm sad to say that I'm looking for another Dr.s Office.  I wanted to love this place because it's close to the freeway and it's a primary care and urgent care all in one and the wait times are typically reasonable.  Unfortunately, my husband had several bad visits and I had a few not so stellar and so we are looking elsewhere.

I don't want to name Dr.'s by name, but our PCP Dr spends very very little time with you and has a terrible bedside manner.  The wait to see him usually isn't too bad, but once he gets in the room, he is in and out in 2 minutes or less and you feel like you just paid a copay to get free samples (with no instruction how to use them) or the referal or blood work orders or wherever he's sending you off too.  Neither my husband or I are complicated cases, but I think at least 5 minutes and a little conversation about your health should be given by a PCP. 

The process of getting a referal takes way longer than it should and the office ladies seem overworked and stressed and the phone often rings a while before being answered.  I also don't like that the nurse or the MA's take a pulse ox every time you visit.  Even when you're not ill.  That is unnecessary billing of the insurance when you aren't sick and just had it done a month prior.  Also, a man under 30 should not have a BP of 140/90 and he was told BP was good.  

The final straw was when we had to visit the urgent care side of this office on a Saturday.  The doctor was pretty advanced in age and hardly listened to my husbands current complaints and spent time looking into an old injury that was completely unrelated to the visit.  He gave him meds for his terrible sore throat that do no work at all.  He gave essentially water jelly for the terrible pain.  Wasn't even asking for pain pills, just a stronger anti-inflammatory than Advil.  Not impressed.  Next day, the pain was way worse and there's no way we are going back to this urgent care.Not good... Bad service, the food is not gpod, my pasta was so sweet... Anyways I vote that this restaurant gets into kitchen nightmare series by Gordon Ramsey!!!! Enough said, skip this placeOK so I stop in. I need 2ea Falken 452 DT = Discount Tire we have them will order. Paid in FULL layaway. Tires should be here by Thursday. Ring ring Monday AM from DT sorry those tires are discontinued. OK what's the plan? I can get you the newer Falken 453 OK. Same Price! They will arrive Thursday or Friday FEDEX!  OK. Ring ring 1pm Thursday me calling DT just checking to see if my layaway tires arrived.  Not yet. OK.. Friday me calling again 1pm - Not yet.  Maybe Monday.  OH!  Can't wait need tires for trip. OK so we have another brand we can provide OK. Arrival on Saturday well the tires we had arent here. However we do have these tires for the same price. But wait we don't have those tires either. OK so we have other tires we can install Saturday.. WOW its almost over... We'll need an extra $23.00 to add to your drama. OMG!  Get me out of here... OK so I have the other other other tires on the car Saturday afternoon.  Monday 9AM ring ring its Discount Tire - We have your tires Falken 453.  Aaaah guys you installed the YOKO's remember. Returned the YOKO's today as they didn't have a matching pair for the rear FULL Refund.  Its finally over. Good times at DT.Seriously!  I went out of my way to eat here?  My husband and I stayed in Las Vegas for 3 nights when he had a work conference.  We ate at lots of well rated restaurants-  Mon Ami Gabi, Red Square, Nine Fine Irishmen, Fleur, Verandah, and Ri Ra to name some.  Of all the restaurants this one was over the top pretentious FOR NO REASON.

During our mid week October stay we had reservations at several of the above mentioned restaurants.  It was unnecessary as there weren't many people in Las Vegas.  When we arrived at Mix without a reservation we were told they don't accept walk ins.  (Very rudely).  Then we went back to our hotel room in Mandalay Bay and called.  My husband was told that they were booked for the entire night.  I logged onto yelp and booked a table through Opentable.com that was 7 minutes later.  We walked right back.  The same hostess seated us.  Silly!!!!

The waiter was overly chatty and not very attentive to our needs (vegetarian, gluten free).  Even to the point not to tell me there was HAM in one of the breads they bring to the table.  My husband had a steak and asparagus.  I had the gnocchi.  Neither was anything special at all.

The best part of the experience was standing on the bar balcony after dinner.  We would not go back!It's just "OK".

We were seated very quickly which was Great.
We ordered and got our waters quickly but that's about as good as the service got....

The waiter forgot our order of Chips and Salsa.  Really?  How hard is chips and salsa... especially when they charge you for them?  And it's not like he was busy... he had 2 tables... ours and one other.  It seemed like he was zoned out on something.

Thankfully, he got our orders into the system and the kitchen got our orders out fairly quickly.

Food was ok... a little salty for my taste.... but I was so hungry I chowed down.  

Had the Enchilada Suiza which was good... lots of chunks of chicken and not just cheese so I was happy with that.  The beans were good but the rice was dry so I mixed it with the beans.

I probably will NOT go back to this La Salsa.  It's a chain so I'll find a different one.Why do I have to constantly ask for bread? It's complimentary, and I always see everyone else eating it around me. Is it just me? Service here is hit and miss, and mostly miss. I've had very rude waiters who deserved no tip from being extremely hostile and snotty. There's no reason to freak out on people over how they order- if you can't handle that, find a different job.
Their food is NOT New Orleans style or themed- yet the place is crawling with Mardi Gras decor. 
The food is overpriced for what you get- and it isn't that great. The best thing they have, for me, is their grilled cheese sandwich. What makes it good is that they grill Parmesan cheese on the outside, giving it a nice crunch. But I can make that at home, and make it less greasy too. 
My poor boyfriend had the luck of getting screwed over by a waiter (the last time we ever went to Mimi's). He had a coupon, and gave it to her- she never applied it. So it is useless to sign up for their e-club, since they never really send you good deals (just junk mail) and don't apply it.Don't leave anything in your car when you drop it off.  You will not get it back.  I rented a car from Hertz for a road trip.  The pick up was smooth and the car was great, albeit dirty.  One the way to drop the car off, I stopped and picked up 2 six packs of beer.  I dropped the car off and before I could get into the car with my ride, realized I had left the beer in the back seat of the rental.  I went back to where I dropped the car off and they brought the car around.  No beer. At this point, it had only been 10 minutes since I dropped the car off.   I went to talk to Randy, the most unhelpful manager in the history of the world.   Randy assured me he would take care of it and kept me waiting for 15 minutes.  When he came back he said that either no one had seen it, or it had been thrown away.  He said this over and over again.   Well, what was it Randy? Did it get thrown away or had no one seen it?   Regardless someone at Hertz was drinking good that night and Randy was full of it.Went here on 12/28/13. Had a Thai Ice Tea. Didn't taste right. Would never go back here for the Thai Ice Tea. Not sure about the food though.I want to start by saying that I get chain pizza isn't exactly gourmet... It's mass produced and missing that extra love that most mom and pop places provide.  But, chain pizza serves a purpose.  It's nearby, offers coupons, and if you're lucky it can taste good too....  So for reviewing Papa John's, please keep in mind that I'm not comparing it to a regular pizza joint.

That being said, I've had Papa Johns for years - from my old home of Pittsburgh to my new home of Las Vegas.  I always found it pretty consistent and liked the garlic sauce to dunk my crust in.

Flash forward to the last couple times I have ordered from them: really thick doughy dough (is that possible?), too much cheese, and on one really bad occasion we got canned tomatoes as a topping.  Worst of all, there's been meat lurking under the cheese like paparazzi trying to get a picture of Suri Cruise.

Ok ok, I get it.  Most people eat meat.  Eating out is a risk anyone that has dietary restrictions takes.  Ok!  Seriously, I said I get it!  Geeze.

Anyway, this has happened to us the last three times we've ordered Papa John's (this location in particular, the only one we order from).  It's always multiple pieces of meat, different varieties, and under the cheese.  So even after thorough inspection of the pie, you will bite into it.  Maybe someone doesn't like vegetarians?  Hmmmm.

I know most people won't understand, but it's seriously gross to me.  I don't think it should be that hard to keep meat off a veggie pizza.  Places like Chipotle and Zaba's do it without any problems.  Other pizza places don't have this problem.

I'll give the place two stars to try to be fair considering I used to eat Papa Johns occasionally before these shenanigans started happening.  But the quality and customer service has really gone downhill and leaves this girl with a big frowny face.I''ve been to this store twice and have been unable to get what I wanted.  It was difficult trying to find staff to ask a question.  

There are so many other places that are stocked with many more things.  There's also the little thing called the internet.  There's really no reason to waste my time here anymore!\

And this is a Sears Grand?  That's surely misnamed!I purposely mentioned when making my reservation that it was our anniversary and we would like a booth. The hostess walked us to a table way in the back, and when i mentioned that i had requested a booth, she got an attitude. I asked if we could wait for one to be made up, and she stated "i have one all the way up front by the door" and had some snarky remark yet again. Fine dining and hospitality? The food was outback quality at best. The filet literally tasted like a BK burger, and no one checked on us until we were half way through. Also, the table next to us was asked if they were celebrating anything. We were not, even though I mentioned it upon making the reservation.  So if you're celebrating something, hit the strip.The food is undoubtedly good for fast food Chinese, but they do this thing that gets me every time.  They have the menu designed in such a way that it LOOKS like your drink is included as part of it (1. Get Side 2. Pick two entrees 3. Get Drink) but they charge you extra for the drink, and Egg Roll is NOT a side, so they charge you extra for that.

Its better knowing all this, but it keeps me from raving about it.  I'm sure the prices here are more expensive because its in the Venetian too. 

All in all, pretty decent, but there are a lot of choices near by that I probably enjoy better.Pros convenient location, free shuttle to Manday, free internet , free breakfast, in room coffee.

Cons. Small room, thin walls( could hear the neighbors every word  on their phone, and they weren't yelling) rubbery eggs at breakfast, noisy room air conditioner .

You have to chose what's important to you. I'll pass on this property next time.Meaty wings, bland sauces. I don't like a whole lot of spice on my wings, so ordered the mild and the garlic parm, but still expected SOME flavor...not so much. I made my own sauce and tossed the wings in them- much better. Good quality chicken. Avoid the fries.Typical dive. My husband and I had an issue at the bar because some drunk shouted at my husband and when I responded, the bartender tried to rip my coffee out of my hand, essentially assuming I would be throwing it at him, which was NOT the case. I got the overwhelming feeling that they side with the drunken loser regulars instead of normal, responsible people who stop by. Every person affiliated with the ownership is a lush.Anyone who is losing their hearing but refuses to use a hearing aid will assume everyone else is deaf and speak at about 200 decibels.  And, of course, 300 decibels is required when talking on a cell phone which is perfectly acceptable in public.  Coco's, I would like you to meet my stepfather.  He will be dining with you whenever I'm involved.  Feel free to provide consistently crappy service.  Judging by my last two visits, that shouldn't be a problem.

I would say the food at this location is generally decent.  And I would say the servers are generally friendly and pleasant.  Unfortunately, it will take repeated attempts to get your order right.

I asked a server once if he thought he should write our order down.  He jokingly said no, then came back 5 minutes later to say he forgot what someone at our table ordered.  He did a nice sales pitch on the sweet potato fries, then brought regular fries anyway.  But, he was so personable I didn't hold it against him.  On my visit last week, four tries to get the breakfast order right.  Supposedly caused by a manager insisting on helping the wait staff by bringing out orders.  Seems more like an attempt to turn tables quicker.  I guess it backfired.

End result...not  a bad place if you're willing to wait or eat what they bring you, rather than what you ordered.This place has definitely gone downhill since my usual visits years ago. Their menu is constantly changing and it's so big you'll spend at least 10 minutes just looking over what you want. The food is sub-par compared to other places that serve the same type of food. Heck, P.F. Chang's just across the way is much better and you pay only a few dollars more, but the statement is true "you get what you pay for" and this location definitely proves that everytime.does Vegas have the worst cusotmer service or what, when it comes to hotels. We requested 2 rooms to be joined together 3-4 months in advance. We get there and they are not even close to each other. We complain and it doenst get us anywhere, they just didnt care. While we where complaing at the counter the guy next to us is yelling at the other lady because he had reserved a room and they said they didnt show it and he said he isnt going anywhere until they get him a room, WTF. I really like the rooms, its bad that service is so bad. When we goto hotels we always put the DND sign on the door because we dont want people in our room when we are not there, well there wasnt a sign and we requested that they bring us one and to just put in in the door. We get back and our room is cleaned up etc and no sign on the door. horrible.Room : I booked PH for a girls trip with three friends. Booked the hotel in Feb for the mountain view room. When our check in finally came PH did not have my room available. We needed to have two queens non smoking and told our options were limited. We ended up getting the resort room over looking the pool on the 10th floor. 
Not a bad room and it was pretty big. To compensate us at check in they gave us spa discounts and peep show 10.00 off (which BTW were worthless)

Pool: The pool at PH is BADDD I mean for here in Maryland the pool would have sufficed but this is Vegas... The only good chairs you had to pay 25-50. When we tried to lay out in the crappy free ones we were treated like second class citizens. Went over to the Hard Rock pool and they treated us much better and we were not even staying there. 

Maid Service: We never got any for FIVE days. I complained and they still never showed up 

Location: The reason I gave two stars. GREAT location on the strip. 

All in all it is a fun hotel the casino rocks and it is happening with a good crowd on Friday and sat night. But the hotel is not good. They really need to make changes if anyone is going to stay and come back. I sure won't......I drove by this location and almost kept going. However once again I was in the mood for Mexican food and decided to give this place a try. The restaurant itself is rather outdated, trip hazards everywhere as you walk from one level to another to another. A pretty dated restaurant.

I ordered what else, a burrito. Again what is it with all meat inside and nothing else...after a while you really want more favorable tastes. Oh well, another restaurant bites the dust when it comes to burritos. Maybe try something different if I am in the neighborhood.Kinda ghettoI went here based on the good reviews and I was so dissapointed! Being an ex Nyer I was dying to find a good deli .This is not it. Now, it is pretty inside with cool, faux, brick walls and an archway that reminds me of a cheesy Italian place back east so my heart went pitter patter when I saw it. I did not have an artisan sandwich nor did I see one on the menu. This place is under new ownership  so perhaps they changed the menu.I kept hearing about how big the sandwiches were but mine was not( 6inch hero roll more or less) . I ordered a chicken salad sandwich and it  was not good at all. I ordered a side of potato salad and it tasted like a cheap grocery store brand. No way could it have been homemade. Oh well the search continues. ( Just wish Cassellas was closer to me) Perhaps I didn't order one of their speciality items. Help me out here and recommend a good sandwich here and I will go back and try it. No tuna please, yuk! This is the second time I have eaten here and both times the meal was not good.No thanks.

Deduct one star for the cheesey Hawaiian shirts.

Deduct one star for the salty deli meat on the club sandwich.

Deduct one star for the burger patty that was clearly frozen and not made fresh.

Deduct one star for the lack of appetizers (don't know why this bothered me since I didn't want one anyway).

Granted, we didn't come for breakfast, so I'll give them a star back.this is a tough one.  i am not a sweets person.  but i did go in because its sprinkles and people made such a big deal about it.  my first question to the employee behind the counter was "  what makes your cupcakes so special? "  she had no answer.  after a few grunts and huffs and puffs she said they were made daily.  to me that does not justify a 5 dollar cupcake.  had she said organic ingredients or any answer with some confidence i might have a different feeling.  i guess with the building rent you have to raise the price.  so yea the food.  it was mediocre at best.  its just a cupcake people.I don't know what disappointed us more here: the service or the food?! Perhaps the poor service wins this battle, since the initial interaction with our server set the mood. I imagine we're not the first people to stay at Excalibur who decide to use the $20 credit here, since it's not valid at their buffet. We weren't going to waste the credit at a bar, where drinks are free if you're gambling. My husband and I stopped in here a little less than two hours before the Jersey Boys show, playing down the Strip at Paris. Doors to the show open half an hour early and we were going to walk there, so we knew we'd only have time for appetizers which was fine with us.

We presented our $20 credit upon ordering, as required, and told the servers we had a show to get to. He then asked when it was, and when we told him insisted we had time for entrees and rolled his eyes at us when we declined. I get in big trouble with hubby when I do this, and he was most unhappy at the unprofessional gesture from our server. 

Bread was brought to the table as we waited for sliders for my husband, a Caesar salad for me, and seasoned fries to share. Although my husband ordered the sliders rare, and we are really comfortable with steaks cooked less-than-rare, the ground beef was cold and uncooked in the center of his sliders, and his caramelized onions were uncooked as well. The seasoned fries were unseasoned and a thick cut fry without much flavor. My Caesar salad was server without fresh pepper offered for it, and the croutons seemed like they were found in an old box, rather than house-made. 

Overall, the food disappointed but the service was the worst. We have no plans to stay at the Excalibur again, and without the free $20 credit for guests of the hotel, we won't be returning here either. They only get two stars because the hostess at the front was the only friendly face we encountered (she was super), and when we told her about the subpar experience as we left, she honestly wanted to make it right, but we assured her our decision to never return was everyone's fault but hers.We are regulars here. The San Francisco fire is amazing! All the rolls are amazing. The downside is their policies are rigid and tend to make the experience not so great. It's next to a sbux and you CANNOT bring in coffee, but they also don't offer coffee. Their iced tea is low quality and not good. The apple saki is amazing though! They are sticklers for the late night special. Everyone MUST buy a drink, even if 3 out of 4 are drinking alcohol, they will penny pinch you (we are talking the difference of a dollar!). We in fact love this place but management definitely needs to change their policies.Pros:
Inexpensive.
Nice decor.
LOTS of Shrimp.
Better than the majority of the ungodly terrible buffets of Fremont St.
There's never much of a line.

Cons:
The room is weird, why are the buffet and cafe attached?
There really isn't ever a whole lot going on. Very average, traditional American food. I would have at least expected some Hawaiian offerings seeing how popular the place is with Hawaiians.

I would only recommend this buffet if you had an insatiable taste for something overwhelmingly average. If not, you can do much better.I like this place cause I used to go here as a kid with my family. I remember liking the Crab Leg night, but I went back recently on a regular night and it felt kind of sad. The sushi was terrible. I liked the mashed potatoes and the cream sauce chicken, that's about it. The waiters are terribly slow, too!A very below mediocre cafe that people probably go because they are too hung over or there is absolutely nothing else to eat.  Came here with a huge party right before they closed at 2pm.  The service is really slow here and  you'll have to ask for everything twice, that is if you can flag down a waitress and get their attention, but they were nice, just not very attentive. 

The food is not impressive at all.  My pancakes were were dry and I asked for soft scrambled eggs, which still came out looking like regular scramble.  I also ordered a plate of steamed vegetables, you know, so I can eat my veggies for the day.  Little did I know that the whole plate of veggies are completely doused in butter that glistens so much that I can see my own face.

Unless you really have to, there so much good food in Vegas, I'd go elsewhere.Liked the ambience. Pretty typical college town pub with enough TVs to catch a game from most tables.Plenty of room and not overly crowded on a Saturday afternoon. Good beer selection, but no listing of brews on tap and too many for our waitress to remember. She recommended a seasonal brew that sounded good, and was, but 10% ABV! Print out a beer list that at least shows alcohol content, brewery, and style of beer! Ordered a pizza. Ugh mistake, $17 for a 12 inch with doughy crust and what looked and tasted like a cut up hot dog as sausage. The happy hour burger deal was excellent however and the burgers were quite good. Just having a listing of their beers would get them another star.I REALLY wanted to like this place!  Good location, good sports decor, large cheap pitchers, and bar sports (pool, darts, foosball, scuffle board), but alas, I did not.

I have to agree with some (most) of the other Yelpers when I say the service was subpar.  Usually I can handle poor service if the food is decent (I know, I know, it's bar food) but even for bar food, it wasn't very enjoyable.  I mean, HOW on EARTH do you mess up a cheese crisp and chicken tenders?!?    

We may go back for a late night foosball game and a health dose of beer, but as far as dinner, drinks and sports.... I sadly say, head across the street to Zipps.You're better off walking a couple blocks East and going to Jordan's.  Way better sports bar atmosphere, better deals, more bar games and waaaaaay better food.  Lucky's is a sad shell of the former Oakcrest, which was always a favorite in the neighborhood.  There is the occasional good drink special and the food can be hit or miss.  All the stadium area bars have their niche, but I can't name one thing that Lucky's does really well.  Yet, even though I don't have anything good to say I can't really badmouth it too much either. It is just kinda bland, boring and wholly mediocre.I am really very forlorn at having to give Chompie's a 2 star-er. This place has been my go to weekend breakfast spot for years. Hello, day drinking begining at 7am on game days?? You know me...sign me up. I am eternally in love with the home fries, and have been known to stop by just for a side of them "to go" 

But I went last Thursday with my 7 year old niece Isabella who was home sick from school (whole other story starting at about 5am which started with my sister calling..."Please Nesto watch her for me or I'll lose my job") As a bachelor who eats out a lot, not a ton in the fridge for a kid....so....breakfast? Get in the car.

Seated right away, as always. That's where the service stalled. Birds chirping as my niece looks at me with big sick-y eyes. No water, no server, busser or hostess to flag down. 

Finally blondie comes up and looks a bit irritated to se us. "Do you know what you want ('yet'? seems to be the unspoken word she wants to throw out to finish the question) as if we have been wasting her time in the 10  minutes we haven't seen her. Yes we do. Pancake and OJ for Bell, Coffee two eggs over med, home fries and dry rye for me. 

She turns, grabs a tray of complimentary pickles off a side bar and slides them onto the table. The bright green are great. Garlicky and crisp. 

5 min, she brings the drinks. kids cup for Bell. No straw. I don't notice it immediately but blondie is right across the isle helping a guy in a tie so when she turns I get her attention. Again she seems pissed that I asked for a straw and drops 4 on the table. WTH?
 15 more minutes for food. I am a little interested and not pleased with the fact that the butter and syrup are in disposable pre-packaged containers. Has this always been the case? I am not a pancake eater, so I don't really know, but the place is a BAKERY. Surely they can dole out some butter and have syrup on hand. That was kinda weird. 

I was so distracted by that, that I realized after blondie left. NO friggin silverware. OK, now I am starting to get miffed. Flag her down again.

Potatoes, cold. Final straw. The rye was delish. Love that stuff chewy and flavorful. But largely, we left two almost untouched plates as we left the place. 

Maybe it was just a bad day for blondie. But that was not a great experience at one of my favorite places. I even forgot to buy a loaf of rye dammit.I've only been here a couple of times. I went on a Thursday night where its supposed to be industry night. If you get on the guest list you and your guest receive a pass and a wrist band that allows you to receive free champagne from 10pm-12am... not bad. If you're a big fan of techno, then this is where you wanna be on a Thursday night. Only thing is, THERES NO DANCE FLOOR, I would not call this place a Nightclub but more of lounge with no where to sit unless you have a reserved table or you go outside in the patio. What I saw that night was a bunch of people standing around talking and a few drunk ones "dancing" to bad music. I would suggest going somewhere else or perhaps come around 1am when they start playing the top 100's. 

**I heard they have Latin nights on Sundays** but I have yet to experience that night.Okay, this review is service related and is not a reflection on the beer they brew at the Ale Asylum.  I actually love the beer.  

The service at the Ale Asylum is some of the worst I have ever experienced...any where.  Out of five servers working on a busy Saturday evening, three acted like customers were annoying them to order anything.  Even after the rush died down, one bartender in particular would stand at the spickets across the room and flail his arms at the few customers remaining as if to say, "hurry up and order already!"  This experience was not limited to me, there were others in my group that had the same impression.  One female server was actually mocking various people as she walked behind them, in plain view of other customers!  This was all before 8:00 p.m.  

The bar is basically located in warehouse next to an airport and has a terrible internal traffic flow when crowded.  If you are over 25, save yourself the aggrivation of being treated as if you are blessed to be served and buy their beer in a local store.The service today really was disappointing and slow.  They only had one person that worked the cash register in the whole place and she was also restocking which took away from her register duties.  It took several mins just to get an acknowledgement and several more to place an order.  Funny thing I was the only person in line.  Normally, we never have any issues with this location.My wife and I went here a while back and wont go again! She had a burger that was OK. I was the one that had all the problem! I ordered the fish with the side of mac. and the oyster sampler. The oysters were good but way over priced for the 8. My food got there at last and the fish was around a 3 oz portion which the waitress pointed out that I had a bigger portion coming! Why the hell would they even send it out if it wasn't right? I at my two bites of fish and while I was waiting for the rest of my missing fish I try ed the mac. I was old and dried out. I sent it and they brought me another portion that was nearly as bad. By this time my wife was finished with her food and I still waited.I finely got the attention of one of the wait staff (I hadn't seen my waitress for a while) and asked when the rest of my fish was coming? No one knew what I was yalking about. They hunted down my waitress, the girl who brought me the skimpy order and the manager. By the time it was all straightened out we were ready to leave. They comped the fish but for the burger and the oysters and a couple of beers the bill was still over fifty! I wont be back! 

I have to now give praise to the Fish House! I first posted my thoughts on a food blog and never had a response. Once I posted on Yelp I received several e-mails all from different individuals voicing their concern about my experience at Kings! I have to say that my opinion has changed drastically about this establishment! If I get a response of concern like this from just my complaint I feel that they really do care about everything related to their establishment and have to give them cu dos and high marks! I will continue.....I find myself here nearly every other week because of the Target/PetSmart combo conveniently located by my job. I really loathe it. Overdone design, creepy constant music, the fact that the mall's outdoors, terrible parking lot planning....

Oh. And it shoots lasers.

Seriously.

Lasers! Are you freaking kidding?!? I guess this falls under "overdone design."

I have had surprisingly good experiences at the movie theater here, though. There are a lot of teens, but for some reason they seem to misbehave less at Tempe Marketplace than at Chandler Fashion Square. Maybe I've just been lucky.The staff was friendly.  The food was okay.  Salsa was acceptable.  We sat in the dining room across the courtyard, which is what really ruined the meal.   It was difficult to enjoy anything in a room with such an over powering smell of mildew.The 'burlesque' in the show was pretty limited. I was actually disappointed. The girls were attractive and talented dancers, but I really was anticipating at least a taste of Burlesque as the name implies.What. The. Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck?????!!

I was stone-cold sober last night, I SWEAR. I went to see George Wallace, expecting a middle-of-the-road Vegas standup show. Some laffs, some audience participation, whatever. What do you expect for free tickets, ya know?

What I got was about 60 minutes of a cherubic relic in a pimp suit mumbling, slurring and stumbling through a bunch of dusty one-liners 
(sometimes his delivery was so bad, I couldn't understand what he was saying). There were a few jokes in really bad taste, though, about which he was totally unapologetic...so I did laugh at those.

But then, the show got WEIRD AS FUCK!

As one of the other reviewers mentioned, the audience is mostly middle-aged black people. Now, I've seen Madea and Coming to America and all those movies that end with church scenes featuring gospel singers clapping and throwing up their hands and singing "O Happy Day" and shit like that -- I thought it was some bullshit racist Hollywood stereotype.

But I'm here to tell you: at end of his show, on a Wednesday night in Vegas, George Wallace asked all the ministers in the house to stand up -- astonishingly, there were 7 or 8 of them in there that night, so they all got up and passed the mic around, saying their names, where they were from, and what church they preached at:"The First African Episcopalian Tabernacle Church of God in Christ," stuff like that.  WTF!!! 

Now George Wallace cued some 80s gospel music, and handed the mic around again. This one guy down front started belting away in a majestic baritone, somehow knowing all the words without a problem. Was he a plant? Or do all ministers just know these songs, and happen to frequent the George Wallace show (other reviewers here describe this same thing going down)? 

Next, he invited another one of the ministers, this big spiky-haired woman, onstage. He told her if she could sing this next track, and really kill it, he would match all the money people in the audience threw at her. WTF?! He didn't say anything about it going to her church -- I guess she just got to keep the cash.
 
So he cued up another obscure gospel track, and she took the mic -- and started DOMINATING that song!! I thought for sure she must be a plant -- she'd been sitting in a booth with a bunch of much younger guys who had raised their hands earlier when Wallace asked if anyone was from Detroit, but she said she was from Henderson...plus, they didn't react like friends would when she was pulled up onstage. Definitely seemed plant-y.

But if that's the case, then what a scam!!! Because after she belted a verse or two, people in the audience started getting up and throwing cash at her!!! They came from all over the theater -- the back, sides, front -- and even my friend went up and gave her $5, so I know the money wasn't all fake. People were standing up in the aisles, waving their hands in the air like on those creepy megachurch broadcasts, singing along and praising Jesus. Did I mention this was a Wednesday night in Vegas, and most of them were drinking Mai Tais and shit!!!!! WTF!!!

If this lady was really a plant, she has a pretty sweet gig going there -- she probably made about $100 for her "impromptu" performance, which I assume she repeated the following night...and the following night. George Wallace said he would match the money after the show -- he said, "Come see me, and I'll give you $100." Hmmm. 

Now that I think about it...the theater was only about a third full, and as mentioned my friends and I had gotten free tickets, so who knows how many other comps were in there. He's probably not making much money, since he spent a good portion of the show hawking his merch -- he told people over and over to be sure and buy one of his signature "I Be Thinkin'" hats after the show, which were normally $30 but this night only, just for us, he was marking them down to $20. He also pimped his $100 package, which included 2 CDs, 2 DVDs, 2 t-shirts and 2 keychains. 

It came off as kinda swap-meetish, and pretty desperate...so that makes me wonder: is he splitting the take with this planted gospel singer???

Either way, even if she was for real -- that's pretty fucking weird, too! I mean, these people were throwing money at her like it was the Spearmint Rhino!! 

WEIRD show. I would recommend scoring free tix somewhere, then eating mushrooms 30min before it starts.

And if you do -- be sure to let me know if the same lady gets up and sings! She looked like a fat Fantasia Barrino, with short spiky hair and a toothy smile.While I was in Vegas for a long weekend, I decided to try the Tacone Flavor Grill. I had read the Yelp reviews and the place averaged 4 stars. I also found a certificate for this eatery on Restaurant.com. We were excited to try the place!

First of all, we weren't expecting a fast food place in a Mall. I'm not sure how I missed this when reading the Yelp reviews. Mind you, I don't mind eating in fast food places or in the Mall, if the food is decent.

My friend ordered the chicken quesadilla and french fries and I ordered a burrito with chicken. Both of us found it difficult to finish what we ordered. The french fries had a distinct odor of curry and the rice in my burrito tasted like it had saffron in it. This was like no Mexican food we ever tasted!

The food was inexpensive and with the Restaurant.com certificate, it was pretty cheap. I guess in this situation, we got what we paid for. :-(

Next time we go to Vegas, I won't be going back to the Tacone Flavor Grill.Didn't know how to use the yelp coupon offer. Chips were old and cold. "A" team is not working tonight. Ill give it another try some other time.I am spanish and was looking for a good tapas bar to remember the taste of home. Unfortunately, I found the icon a bit underwhelming. I was not expecting to walk right into a restaurant in the middle of Madrid and fully understand that some ingredients are hard/impossible to get, however, I was expecting more from this place. 
I like the style but found it to be quite uncomfortable for a party larger than two. 
Will probably give it another try at some point.I have no idea what the big hooha is about this place.
It's bland.. yes the portions are huge but what good does that do if it taste like...blah.?

The reason for the 2 stars.. the decor and service. Being in this restaurant reminds me of being in a hotel in Vegas. it was very grandeur and venetian like.  

I was here on a business trip and managed to spend my per diem of $55 easily. I had 2 martinis which I think was the best part of my meal.

I had ordered calamari to start and tuna tar tar. The calamari was soooo bland that my salt and pepper sprinkling did not help.. my co worker actually sent it back to the kitchen.. that's how bad it was. apparently it was old oil (as the manager came out and apologized as he then tasted our dish and agreed.. or so he says.)  
The braised ribs were delicious, tender and the meat completely fell apart in your mouth, unfortunately this is what my coworker had ordered. I, for some reason went with ....hmmm. it was that bad I don't even remember. I remember not finishing it. 
dessert was apple pie (idk what their fancy name for it was.. but all it is is baked apple pie) with a scoop of ice cream on it. big whoop

a disappointment for the price and what I thought I was gettingMy buddy and I went here for a quick lunch because we had a buy one get one coupon. Actually we had two of them. One came from the Entertainment Book and another I found on the website. We walk in and its lunch hour. It's busy. It's noisy. It's chaotic. The guy at the counter is getting stressed so someone I assumed to be a manager relieved him and started taking orders. 

It comes to our turn and we order according to our buy one Teriyaki bowl get one free coupon. We were told that we couldn't use the coupon there. So I said well do you take other coupons. The guy at the register tells me, "If they are for our store then maybe." Well, I'm not trying to pass off a grocery coupon here guy.... so we try another Samurai Sam's coupon. He looks at it for a minute and points out the small print. 

"See? At participating locations only." 
"So I take it you are not a participating location?"
He just shakes his head no. 

Now, I dunno... I'm no big business person. But This just got us off on the wrong foot. This and a few other reasons is why I won't go back to Samurai Sam's. I live about a mile from the place too. It is highly likely that if the food was good and there were no hassles with the coupons when ordering. I would have come back many times - without a coupon even! So wouldn't it be worth the say... $5 Teriyaki bowl to retain someone that is going to return and spend far beyond the cost of the bowl you gave away with the coupon I was trying to use? 

It just doesn't make sense to me but oh well. 

We were already there so we order anyway. Now keep in mind I'm irked about the coupon situation so my outlook on the Samurai Sam experience could be a bit tainted. 

We get our food and my rice was really dry. It didn't seem done. The veggies were ok. Just blech. Not much flavor. The chicken was decent and fortunately the whole thing was coved in Teriyaki sauce which made it edible. 

My friend said his thing was ok but neither of us were really thrilled from the minute we walked in.So. I just got back from Vegas, and stayed at, of course.. The Palazzo.  Well, I must say.. couple months really did some damage to the casino.  Can't believe I'm going to give this place 2 stars but whatever has got to be done.

(1) Service just got horrible.  It went from a solid A to a very average C.  And trust me, average is not acceptable in Vegas. With all the competition they have, it was very disappointing experience this time around.  From the front desk to the casino credit, it was very just average.  Maybe even a little below for the price they charge you for room.

(2) Room was still big and comfortable as I remember. But can the cleaning service be upgraded?! If the room wasn't comped, I would've been even more mad... but because it was free, I can't complain that much right? But at $350/night regularly, it was quite annoying that the cleaning lady could not distinguish lotion between conditioner.  I was in the shower, shampooed my hair, great.  Time to condition my hair... but wait, what is this, the lotion? Since when did people lotion their body in the shower? Very irritating when it took me almost an hour brushing my hair just because someone can't distinguish between lotion & conditioner.  Also, I was looking for my glasses that I left on the nightstand for about an hour, only to realize that the cleaning lady decided to tuck it into the bottom drawer. (Even though I specifically told them not to clean anything BUT the bathroom). Ugh.

(3)  Gaming wise... wow. Must say, pit boss's and dealers got super unfriendly.  Maybe they've been running into some not-so-great players, but honestly, what's up with the service?  Here we go again on the service.  Unacceptable, especially when the Wynn & Encore is just a bridge away.

(4)  They charge you for an extra fridge and late-check out now. What? I know they're going bankrupt and all, but c'mon now. Are you really going to scare away your loyal customers so you can get a few bucks here and there?  I have never been charged for an extra fridge nor the late check out.  But this trip made me realize... The Palazzo really must be DESPERATE!

(5) They don't comp cigarettes anymore. Wow. What else are you going to take, free alcohol? The Pit boss told me that it was because of health issues and regulations.  I assumed that this was all of Las Vegas's new rule and thought it was quite dumb but still let it slide.  Next day, I went to the Wynn/Encore to play, and the pit-boss comped cigarettes like nothing.  I was confused.  I then told the pit-boss what the Venetian/Palazzo told us about the cigarettes and all he said was, "The Palazzo is still around" and laughed.  Seriously.  They're still around? They need to honestly up their game.

My loyalty has really gone down in the drains with this trip.  On the up side, theres always Wynn/Encore.King's Fish House is in a nice location at The District at Green Valley Ranch.  The design of the restaurant is nice, and it is a comfortable place.  

I have found the service here to be reasonably good.  However, I am not a big fan of the food - it is serviceable, but nothing remarkable.  Sushi is not worth ordering here as it doesn't compare well to sushi restaurants that focus on this type of cuisine.

Other dishes, including the fresh fish and sides, are ok, but, again, nothing remarkable.

I do like many restaurants at The District (Lucille's, Kennedy, Settlebello), but this one just doesn't offer anything of great interest of exceptional quality in my experience.I would have given it 3 stars. While their selection isn't huge, its offerings were enough since I was starving and would have eaten anything. The sushi was surprisingly fresh and decent. The stir fry veggies and noddles were tasty.

Their American bbq section...the tri-tip= not so great, okay mac&cheese, weak greens and decent yams. 

Yummy salad bar, but they prepare it for you. 

And the dessert bar? My favorite part of the meal. They had a great selection of mini desserts. The creme brulee, fruit tart, chocolate covered strawberries and banana donuts were all yummy.

Although some of my food didn't taste that great- it wasn't horrible, I was fine there leaving with a full stomach. But not even a couple hours laters, my tummy started hurting and I was hoping it'd go away as we had got to our seats for the Love show. Sadly, my stomach got worse and I had no other choice than to go poop in a public bathroom. I NEVER go #2 in a public bano! That's just not cool. But my stomach was killing me and thankfully, I was able to relieve myself with plenty of time before the show started. 

Because of my bad tummy ache, and not being able to pinpoint what brought it on, I will say that visiting The Buffet at TI in the future will not be on my list. :(As much as I adore TI as a hotel, the buffet doesn't leave much of an impression on me. Maybe because I've waited too long to finally review the place, but I digress. The sushi selection was okay, but the rolls themselves were a bit dry. Their eggs benedict was average. I could actually whip out a better batch in my own home. I guess I'm spoiled, seeing as I've dined at the likes of Wynn and M Resort. Their buffets have no contest with TI's.Great atmosphere. This is a good place to go for a drink, but I'll never go back for sushi again. The sashimi was not especially fresh, the rolls were not memorable, and everything is overpriced. Even the happy hour menu was no good.I go to this theater a lot since it's close by but it is far from one of the nicer theaters in the Vegas valley. Although they'd recently remodeled and added a couple of giant screen, leather seat XD Cinemas, the regular auditoriums are very dated. Yes, they are stadium seating but the seats are old and very uncomfortable. Want to see a movie in one of the nice new auditoriums? Yep, that'll cost you some extra cash. 

The clientele at this theater is usually a bit "lower quality" than at other movie theaters in town. Expect loads of screaming babies in R-rated films and lots of talking obnoxious teenagers and folks being of the type where you wouldn't want to even LOOK at them cross-eyed answering their cell phones during the movie. I have never had a pleasant experience here. There's even a big ad that runs before the movie saying that if you text on your phone or talk during the movie that they'll kick you out. That's a big lie. I have had to get up several times during movies to go alert an employee and while they will come in the theater and stand around for a few minutes, I have NEVER ONCE seen them ask anybody leave -- even when the offenders were talking right in front of them. 

The absolute worst thing I have ever experienced was a few months ago when I went to see an animated movie. There was a (loud, talking) family behind me in the theater. During the movie, their baby started crying (of course) and they didn't take him out, they just sat in the movie while their kid wailed and wailed. Suddenly, I started to smell poop. It got stronger. Thankfully the movie was almost over. As soon as it ended, they walked out and I STILL smelled poop. I turned around to look and the mom had CHANGED HER BABY'S DIAPER DURING THE MOVIE and had LEFT THE POOP FILLED DIAPER STUFFED INTO THE ARMREST ON THE MOVIE SEAT. This will tell you the "quality" of the customers at this place. 

I try not to go to this theater unless I have to because management doesn't seem to care about the rude behavior of their audiences.I have an update, because as my lease is ending, I really need to say some things about this place.

I've officially been living her for a year. The grounds keepers/maintenance crew are the best, most humble people you will ever know. Regarding the office staff, seems like they want to turn a blind eye towards all the problems the good residents are complaining about, in order to keep the rioting college kids, who bring their friends every weekend. Besides the fact that there is construction going on in a warehouse behind the apt., they work 24/7, noises all the time...
I'll list the problems, that not only I've had, but that others have too.

1- We're trying to buy a house, instead of just letting us know that 'hey, your lease is almost up, you haven't been a problem resident, you don't have to pay extra to break your lease'; We were told that if we break our lease, we have to pay the months rent that we are living here, $1660.00 to break the lease, PLUS pay back the incentive we received when we moved here. What kind of B.S is that!? Needless to say, we're buying, moving and still paying rent here...and I will CONTINUE to use all their amenities (pool, movie theater, etc until my lease is up).

2- My hubby and I rent a garage, monthly, because there aren't enough parking spots for all the residents, because there are so many freakin' college kids/friends over, that residents have to look/scrounge for spots. Anyway, we rent a garage, expensive I might add, my husband likes working on cars, is knowledgeable, blah, blah.  I had the courtesy to ask the office, if he could work on my car, as it needed a new clutch, among other things. We were told NO. Ok, so I went ahead and paid almost $3000 to get my car worked on. Lately I've been seen residents change their oil, work on their cars and motorcycles (both in the garages AND in carports). So again I complained and I wrote the manager a LONG email about why its unfair, that they ignore these residents, but yet don't take into consideration that I asked, etc. They response was that they haven't seen anyone, so they cant say anything. B.S! I've even given them the license plates of the people working on their cars, no EXCUSES! Grrrrr!

3- Dog poop: this has been on going and on going. People here pay extra to have their dogs. Fine, I'm a dog person, love dogs, cant wait to get one. But if I did have one here, whenever my dog went out for a poop, I'd clean it up (the apt even provides the baggies). No, there's dog poop EVERYWHERE! Be careful if you are drunk, cant see well at night, etc because you will step on dog poop. You know who cleans it up, maintenance/grounds keepers, they aren't even the owners of the dogs!!! They keep a tally on who the owners are, the office has pics of the dogs that live in the complex, etc. and NOTHING is being done. These sick a$$ owners want a dog, but don't clean up after them... I can only imagine how disgusting their apts must be!

4- (And I swear this will be my last rant)- Drunken people: If you're going to live here, please be aware that you will feel like you're living in a dorm. I'm no longer at the point of my life where I want to be woken up by some drunk girl, crying because her boyfriend looked at another girl at the club, SHUT UP! The pool has hours from 7a-12a, people bring their friends over, drunk off their a$$es and those that live around the pool area, have to listen to all this, they complain to management and NOTHING is done about it. We even have a security guard, where is he? Sleeping in the office or his car? Management knows EXACTLY who these people are, because its always the SAME people!!!!!!! and do nothing about it. 

Ok, like I said last rant, I'm so over this place, too expensive, there are no more community events, as the budget was cut, now they want residents to pay for some guy to come and cook, it's like living in a dorm, and for every ignorant resident they have, they'll be loosing 3. Can't wait to leave!

(Sorry it was so long and the actual rating I want to give is 2.5 stars)Overpriced. Only went because we had a coupon.  Service was OK but not overly friendly either.  Definitely don't need to go back...Menu and management have changed so many times, it's hard to keep up.
Food has been awful, good, and back to disgusting currently. Not sure why the new manager changed the menu and mage it worse!
They get great bands but a lousy set up for live music, so caustics is always off and it's impossible to hear anyone talk unless you scream.
Staff is okay. It has not been the same since Amy left.
They crown can be seedy.The place has nothing to boast, other than being in a cute old house, that's it.

The beers are very expensive and the food sucks BOTH times we have gone there.

I will go back one more time as I have a 25% off coupon that includes beer, so we'll just have beer even though they have IPA only in the bottles and its about $1.50 more than most places.

I'd rather go to the George and Dragon honestly.They only have a few good instructors left at this gym, since most have left for better paying gyms. It has gone down the tubes in my opinion. The whole place needs a facelift and the management could care less. The only reason I keep my membership is because of the few teachers left that I love, it is über cheap, and I can use it when I travel. Clean it up...it looks like it came out of the Miami Vice days.I hate this place. The bartender who helped us with a total assuming jerk!

Spanish Steps may have a nice location on the strip, but I've been treated better.

I decided to stop here with my father, so we both could have a Diet Coke, which would be followed shortly by at least one beer for myself. It was a hot Tuesday afternoon this past May, the bar was uncrowded, and there were plenty of seats.

We both sit down at the bar, order the two soft drinks, and immediately the bartender proceeds to make the drinks in to-go cups. I didn't ask for the drinks to-go, nor did you ask if I wanted them to-go. My intention was to sit there out of the sun, enjoy the drink and after a couple of sips I would order a beer to accompany the soft drink, but nope, we apparently were unwelcome if we order only soft drinks.

The bartender hands us our to-go drinks, which basically is like saying "here you go, now leave" and tells us it will be $8.00.

WTF? I'm floored! $4.00 for a 16 ounce soft drink is outrageous!

Would I be complaining if we had been served correctly, been given refills on the soft drink and felt welcomed so I would've gotten my beer- absolutely not.

So we paid the tab, didn't tip the bartender a cent since clearly his level of service was on par with a fast food restaurant and walked on to another bar where I was treated right. Just a side note, but at the next bar I got another Diet Coke, but also drank three beers and on top of the 20% tip I gave on that bill I also handed the bartender the tip the idiot at Spanish Steps should've received for the $8.00 tab!

So basically, Spanish Steps you can shove it!I'm afraid I can't give this place more than two stars.  The service was attentive.  That's the one positive.  We came here because some friends of ours stayed at the Resort and had two entrees for the price of one coupons.  Thought, how can you go wrong.  I had the lobster bisque, tenderloin, and bananas foster.  The tenderloin came as just two slices of tenderloin over some average mashed potatoes and some side vegetable.  Others around the table also had the tenderloin.  One person had duck and another halibut.  We all came away with the same impression - highly amazingly overpriced for what you get.  Nothing special on the food.  I have had better steaks at lower prices in many locations.  Bill for my daugther and me (two appetizers, entrees, wine and a dessert) came to $170 and that was after the one entree free coupon!  There are so many interesting food choices in the Scottsdale area, I won't be back to this.I wish I could give this place more stars but- like everyone says its over price, slow service and the food is only ok. You are better off going to the Starbucks in the hotel and getting a muffin.Seemed good-- but no! I ordered a taco salad, and it wasn't very-- hmmm... "mexican-ny." Pretty pricey, but what am I saying, it's Vegas. However, I thought it was bland and had less flavor than a jose ole frozen burrito! I'm from southern California, so maybe I expect a little more from mexican food-- but this was supposed to be authentic. With all the money they make in this city, would it kill them to have a professional-cultural-cook advisor?Eh.  It's entertaining.  You are paying for the entertainment with higher food prices for food that really isn't all that impressive.  

Not sure what's changed for me.  Maybe my taste buds have gotten wiser over the last 3 years.too loud!!!Went there for happy hour one time and have not been back since. 

Pretty medicore service. When it FINALLY arrived, some of our food was cold. Our server seemed like she had MUCH better things to do...god forbid I ask for a refill! Speaking of drinks, they were a bit overpriced considering how weak they were..although, maybe I'm a bit biased there.

I mean, they had just opened 2 months before but still....cold miso soup? Yuck.  Attitude? Yuck.

If you want a great sushi place, try Sapporo or Sushi Brokers.As a piano bar in Vegas, there are definitely better ones (Harrahs and New York New York). Stopped by twice and the singers/players each time were mediocre. No one was requesting and when we actually did give a request with money, they didn't play it for 45 minutes. I know what they were doing - they had our money so they wanted to keep us around. Boo hiss! 

Cocktail service was very good. It's the same bar menu as the rest of the Venetian and Palazzo.   Also serves the wasabi peanuts and kalmata olives at the table.

More of an older crowd in their 40s+. Bar closes at 1 am.Staff good! Decor is awesome! Food is gross & greasy! Salsa is the only good thing! I wouldnt go back!Every time I've gone to Red Mango, I have had a bad experience. Their mochi is always hard and the fruit is never really fresh. The flavor of the yogurt is also mediocre. 

I highly recommend Cefiore. You can taste quality in their frozen yogurt, and I'm all about quality! The prices are also very reasonable as well.Smelled horrible in this place.
There was a cook or waiter sleeping on one of the booths.
Food was solid but nothing special.I'm a fan of the embassy suites chain. Big rooms, nice buildings with large open atriums, free drinks at manager's reception and free cooked to order breakfast. 

I know embassy suites, I've stayed at embassy suites....embassy suites tempe, you are NO embassy suites.

Here are my gripes in order of priority:

1. Heating was broken and a call to the front desk resulted in a promise to "fix it right away" but no follow up action. My dad who stayed with us froze his tail off at night and felt sick all weekend. Shame on you embassy suites for failing to care for the elderly. (Yes it does get cold in AZ in the winter!)

2. The Garcia's in the lobby makes the entire lobby reek of oily food smell. Great way to introduce the hotel to new guests. Walk in and smell the tex mex. 

3. The service is ok at the front desk, but you are left feeling "on your own", much like a no frills hotel. I did not see "Embassy Suites Express" on the signage. The complex is huge, maze-like, and difficult to navigate. The front desk did not really help much with their directions to the room. My family was left wandering around far longer than they should have. This place is not like your traditional embassy suites with huge open air atrium. It looks more like a converted apartment complex.

4. The breakfast and happy hour area is just too small and cramped. I wasn't very happy when i can't even find a seat during happy hour.

5. The mini fridge did not work very well. It was barely cold enough to keep a drink lukewarm.

On the positive note, they did respond quickly to requests for extra towels and blankets. The furniture was new and clean. The bathroom and mini bar had granite tops. The gym was quite good with brand new equipment and TVs integrated into the elliptical and treadmills.

So there you have it. Stay there if you must, and try to hang out in the gym as much as possible.Meh...I went here for the Lakers game today.  They have appetizers, burgers, sandwiches, ribs, and salads.  The O'Connell burger that I ordered, which had bacon was just so-so.  The fries were decent.  The Coors Light was a little flat.  Overall, just an average sports bar.  The crowd here seemed a little older.Okay, maybe I'm being a little harsh but Kabuki hit the big fail button! Maybe my darling co-worker as well for not checking the order before bringing it back. A co-worker and I wanted to try it out for lunch and since it's in close proximity of our workplace, we said let's go. We called in our order, I had ordered the Bar-B-Que rib and tempura combo and she ordred the Gold Rush Roll and Vegetable Roll. When she came back, hers looked amazing and mine, well, wasn't what I expected. It was SALMON! How the hell do you get salmon and bar-b-que rib mixed up. And also there wasn't any tempura sauce in the bag. Being pressed for time, I sat there and gagged down the dry salmon (teriyaki sauce did nothing for me) and tempura. If there was a survey tip in the "Good for" that said nothing, I would put my check mark there.It has a cozy dining area that was easily able to seat our party of five. I'm no Thai expert, and the food was decent, but it was unremarkable. I had the beef pad thai (it was a toss-up between that and the green curry) which was greasier than I had anticipated. The service was friendly enough, but not very proactive on the beverage front.Had the Cuban sandwich. Not what I expected for a Cuban. I will need to try something else.FORGOTTEN...  Nothing too memorable about the setting, music, or people there.  I went for the first time on a sat night with some friends.  It was pretty empty given the large space.

As for the actual bar it had a Hip Hop section with tables and an open bar, a "techno/dance" room (void of any actual people), and an outdoor patio which was small and a bit crowded but housed all of the smokers for efficient second hand smoke intake.Food was average, service was bad overall with the exception of one server; Robert.  While I love Mario Batali, I think he needs to re-evaluate his staff.  We received attitude from two out of the three servers waiting on us.

One example, we asked for our salad to be split, and they brought the salad on one plate.  I asked again to have the salad split onto two plates, and the waiter looks at the other waiter and shrugs his shoulders up and down and says, "Ok, why not!"  That was such a rude response, and they acted as if we were asking for a custom meal and they were doing us a huge favor.

There's nothing worse than when you're paying a premium price for dinner, and the food is average and the service is bad.

Unfortunately, we will not be back.  Sorry Mario, I know if you would have seen the way we were treated, you would not tolerate that behavior from your staff.The location is the best thing about this place.  I know it is a chain but I expected much more.  The customer service from the hostess was good very pleasant and smiled the whole time.  the customer service from the waitress on the other hand was not up to par.  she seemed to be having a bad day.  My drink order was wrong that's an easy fix but then my meal was wrong too.  I ordered the Hawaiian pizza and got the thai chicken pizza instead.  I brought it to her attention but ate it anyway cause at this point I just wanted to get the hell out of there.  Now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty.  I think I would give this place one more chance and update my review.As of recent I have been going to Einstein Bros Bagels rather than Brooklyn Bagel that's literally across the street from my place for their Salmon Lox on Asiago. Which at any other time, I would be pleased with the speedy service and toasted Lox. 

This time, I came for breakfast had a white chocolate mocha coffee, and bacon egg cheddar on of course my fave, Asiago bagel. White chocolate mocha coffee honestly tasted better than the Starbucks version. It wasn't too sweet and didn't make me stomach feel funny like how some Starbucks drinks make me feel. I took my order to go, so that I can make it back in time for a 12 hour overnight shift and of course there service was speedy like any other visit. But once I got to my shift, I was sadden that their service was tooo speedy they forgot my bacon and added cream cheese! Oh shucks. The bagel tasted soggy from the loads of cream cheese. It tasted like cheese overload.. Asiago bagel, a zillion layers of cream cheese and a slice of cheddar cheese -____- omg. When I make my own bagel sandwich at home.. I'm perfectly fine with ONE layer of cream cheese.This place used to be really great, like 5-6 years ago, when it first opened. It was the spot. My friends and I would be here every night we wanted to go out (if we weren't at the nightclubs on The Strip). Especially since they offered Hospitality cards - if you work in the "Industry," you present this card, outside of Happy Hour, and you receive a wristband that provides you with an instant 50% discount on drinks and food. Fabulous. The martinis are fun and, for the most part, delicious. The food isn't bad either. Most nights, the music was decent and dancing in the area near the stage was fun. Now, the crowd has certainly changed (or maybe my friends and I have changed?) and it's just not our scene anymore. The problem is that I don't think it's much of anyone's "scene" either. 

The service has been spotty as well. One stand-out experience that halted my visits for a long time, occurred on St. Patrick's Day in 2009. A particular bartender was unnecessarily rude and implied that I was going to leave the lounge without paying my bill by coming out from behing the bar and standing next to me the whole time we were paying. My friends and I were at the SAME table next to the bar for a couple hours and we didn't say or do anything that would have indicated anything! I have never been treated with such disrespect at any establishment as that day. I've been just a few times since then and it's been just okay. I'm not sure what makes all the employees think they're too good for their jobs and better than all their patrons, but it is beyond me.I SOOOO wanted to love this place.  We used to have this great Jamaican place around the corner in Chicago, and were really looking forward to those flavors.  They were very attentive when we arrived, and I thought, this will be swell.....  

Then we met our server.  This place is not very big and our server, who didn't seem to know what he was talking about (how's the fish, it's yummy.  how's the short ribs, so good.  not helpful), was LOUD.  He seemed really overworked which I cannot understand because there are only like 10 tables in the whole place and there were others working...

Starter - we had the Prawns and Roti.  They were amazingly good.  One criticism - when they say prawn, they just mean bigger than average shrimp. I understand this is common in certain areas of the US and the rest of the world, but the starter was slightly different than we expected.  Nonetheless, it tasted amazing.

We had the rum punch of the day to drink - VERY tasty.  I would go back just to have the "prawns" and rum punch.

Dinner - I ordered the short rib stew - their take on a beef stew, essentially.  It was VERY tasty.  Really, I could've eaten more.  No really.  I wish they had given me more.  The portion was smaller than I expected for the price.  The flavor was nice - and spicy - and amazing - but I still hadn't tasted anything that reminded me of the Jamaican food I had back in Chicago.  I know that doesn't necessarily mean anything, but...

Todd had the Mussels.  These should really be on the starter menu.  I'm not sure how someone can make a meal out of 10-15 mussels.  There's no side and two small pieces of bread.  Again, for the price, it seemed strange.  Also - while the mussels were tasty and wonderful, they were larger than normal, and neither of us cares for the larger mussels.

We were not thrilled, and for a birthday celebration, it was underwhelming, but we had a nice time (because the company was good).  I'm just not sure our experience was worth the money we spent.I love this food but the service is really lacking..  we come here at least once a month but the service is rarely good much less great..  Hey owners do you not read what your customers say??  Help us love this place by stepping up the service...  dont you want to keep loyal customers??  Help us help you..  READ what the customers say and make a difference!!!Lunch on December 26, 2011.  I had the shrimp po boy.  It was not bad, the portions were fine and there were steak cut fries that went with it.  The price was $16.  I was OK, but nothing to write home about.  I would not go out of my way to come here, but if you are hungry and want to get something on that side of the shopping area, it is ok to try.  You can at least say you tried one of Emeril's places.Table 10 did not meet my requirements for bomb Louisiana/Mississippi Delta food 

We went because its a Creole and Cajun place and I like that kind of food.  I stuck with the basic at a place like this: shrimp po boy.  A shrimp po boy is the cornerstone oof any legitimate Cajun spot.  Its not the the po boy was horrible just wasnt great. Too basic nothing stood out.  Not enpugh flavor for me.

We ordered the truffle mac since its a favorite of many people who come here.  Unfortunately, I had to compare this one to Boteros and there was no comparison.

On a positive note, Table 10 is not a 1 star, I just did not like the food and the service is a little slow.  I did like the decor, the wine cellar, the bar, so maybe I would have had a better experience If I was here for a drink, but I was here for lunch and it was a duece.I used to LOVE this place but in the last year, it's really gone downhill. I don't know if it's under new ownership but there's been a tremendous change with this business.. They are super pushy about trying to upsell you to the $40 'Happy Feet' pedicure and their waxing services. For a $40 pedicure, it's SO not worth it. It used to be when you would really get pampered with a long massage and hot rock treatment. Now if you get lightly rubbed for a few minutes, you can consider yourself lucky. If they can't sell you on 'Happy Feet' expect to be pushed and pushed on the individual services that comprise 'Happy Feet' like $5 callous removal, $5 big toe design, $5 massage, etc. and then pushed more for waxing services.The last few times my friends and I have been, our manicures smudged badly even after a good 15 minutes sitting under the blue light. I believe this is happening because they are adding nail polish remover to their nail polish to thin it out and make it last longer as I've seen them do on a few occassions. Another friend of mine stopped going to them after 3 of her tips peeled up within the week.The last time I went there (which will be my last time), the nail tech pushed and pushed to get me to do my eyebrows. Stupidly, I let myself be badgered into it and then she took off almost my entire eyebrow leaving me a tiny line!! This in spite of the fact that I told her repeatedly that I only wanted the middle and the strays on the bottom taken care of because I don't have much in the way of eyebrows in the first place! I had little 'Sharpie' style eyebrows for 3 months and they still haven't grown totally back.

For those of you who don't know, the Azul Day Spa across the parking lot is owned by the same people as Nails by Tina and the staff goes back and forth between the locations. Expect the same issues there but they charge more for their services at that location because it's a day spa.This is a standard coffee shop.  We had a long line and a bit of a wait. Cinnamon roll french toast was good. Salmon cream cheese spinach omelet  had  lots of good salmon. The cream cheese was a bit odd - it was in chunks. Service was good.Cafe Pino is the sort of place I am totally mixed on. I wanted to love it - cute, conveniently near the movie theater, serves late, broad, well priced wine list. But, my experience here was odd at best. 

Went with one of my friends, Meredith G., after a movie. We were never told whether to order at the counter or if we would be waited on, and we basically stood around for a while. Once we ordered, it took a while for the food to be delivered, which was odd b/c we were about the only people there. Also, the owner kept staring at us and coming by every two seconds to ask if we were "ok." This quickly went from friendly to down right annoying.

The pizza and salad we shared was tasty, but the service was a hassle overall.The good thing about this place is everything but the steaks and waiter. The salad, bread, and dessert, and side dishes were superb. The steak tasted like a $15 steak. I guess it's the way they cook it-- which was meeh for me. Once I got my steak, my mouth dropped. The outside of the steak was BLACK. It was burnt! I was so disappointed. I told the waiter and instead of apologizing, he was defending himself and saying how that's the way the steak is supposed to be. WHAT AN ASS. I'm paying a lot for my steak and I should at least have an opportunity to enjoy it! The worst waiter ever. Although everything but the steak was good, I give it 2 stars due to the fact that this steakhouse can't even perfect a steak (well, it is a steakhouse after all!) and the waiter was a douche bag.SERVICE
Stumbled upon this place while shopping in Tempe Marketplace.  We went to dinner around 5 on a Saturday so it was not crowded at all.  That being said, to echo others, the service was pretty bad when there was really no reason for it to be so.  Ordered a salad and was not asked what dressing I wanted so I assumed it was already dressed.  Salad was served with no dressing and could not flag down a server to get dressing for about 10 minutes.  I sat there and made my companions all feel to awkward to eat because I couldn't eat the salad without dressing (literally, dry as a bone).   It was generally hard to get our server to our table and when we managed, he seemed irritated.  

MENU
Largely overpriced.  It's bar food with a little extra but at dinner prices.  My companion had the Sliders which were unremarkable but the beef was of relatively good quality.  
I ordered the Chop Shop cobb which was again, overpriced (aprox $12 for something a bit larger than a dinner salad) which was fresh and had some good produce (although my avocado was not ripe) but again, not dressed and sort of boring in the end.  
Diversity was lacking- a small selection of pretty generic offerings.  

CLEANLINESS/OVERALL QUALITY
This is going to gross some people out but I was given a straw without a wrapper on it and when I put it in my mouth, it was salty... as though someone had stuck a sweaty/dirty hand into a bin of straws.  My dinner companion had the exact same experience.  We were both really unnerved and grossed out.  

ATMOSPHERE
It's brand new so the facilities are generally clean and well kept but the atmosphere is ridiculous.  It's sort of Texas Roadhouse meets Coyote Ugly and neither work very well.  There's just something awkward about trying to eat dinner with a mechanical bull beside you.I didn't really expect to eat good Mexican Food in a sketchy hotel off the strip in Vegas. My assumptions were not wrong.  The food was average.  Nothing to celebrate or recommend but a decent meal in a hotel where the other option is a buffet or Jonny Rockets to go.

The staff was extremely slow and didn't think about the next step at any time.  We were constantly asking for my water, chips and for them to take our order.  I don't enjoy restuarants where I have to do more work to get them to do their job. 

Granted, this place was a nice escape from the outside environment of a gross off the strip hotel. But please, don't expect muchI want to preface this review by stating that I have over 25 years experience in retail management and customer service so I understand fully the rigors of large big box store and interfacing with customers on a daily basis. 

I was pretty appalled at my recent shopping experience there and because of what occurred I won't shop there again. Prior to this I liked this store a lot and shopped there often. Its clean and well organized. Generally the staff is helpful and not pushy and they have great discounts on plants in the garden department. 

I went in to buy 4 eye screws for a shelf I had at home. My sale totaled a little over 5 bucks for the 4 screws. I paid for them inside the store and specifically asked the cashier to put the receipt in the bag where it would be visible as I next was going to the garden department to check out some plants on my way out. it was a small bag and the receipt was hanging out of it not to mention the bags they use at Lowe's are translucent and you can see through them fairly well. 

I picked out 3 plants in the garden department and went to the counter to pay. I placed the bag of the screws on the counter as I went to get cash out of my purse. The receipt was hanging out on the top of the bag and you could also see it through the side of the bag. I was really taken aback when the cashier asked to see my receipt for the stuff in the bag. I cancelled my purchase and went to the front to ask for a manager. 

He explained that it was store policy for the cashiers in the garden department to ask for receipts for items not purchased in the garden department. I've made 25 or more purchases the same way... first in the store then out to the garden department to get some plants.. and NOT ONCE has anyone EVER asked to see my receipts. My own experience in managing a big box store that's owned by the same company as Lowe's tells me that this is NOT their policy and the policy is to ask for a receipt for a large un-bagged item that is hand carried by the customer such as a garden hose or a carpet or lumber etc. The fact that the bag was on the counter with the receipt hanging out of it and clearly visible should have been more than enough for this cashier. I can only venture to guess that she had a desire to exert petty authority and this is how she did it. I've seen this before and had the unhappy experience of managing the same type of employees and had to counsel and re train them.  Nobody wants their shopping experience to include a shake down and I certainly felt it was way out of line. 

I got a call from one of the store managers the following day after complaining to the corporate office and I felt his response was lack luster. While he valued my input as a consumer he sure didn't do anything to win me back as a customer. If this had come across my desk as a manager I would have asked that customer to come into the store and offer them a $10 gift card to show how much I wanted them back. I'm not looking for handouts but I spend money at Lowe's every month. In protecting those 5 dollars worth of eye screws they lost hundreds in future sales. A 10 buck gift card could have won that back. its simple math. 

I'm back to shopping at Home Depot now and that is where I'll stay. The prices are lower overall and they seem to value the customer a great deal more.This place was a real let down.

 I was really looking forward to trying Stacy's and am completely disappointed. I ordered the rib tips and string beans and my boyfriend ordered the hotlinks, coleslaw, and sweet tea. We shared an order of fried pickles. The sweet tea was old and had that weird old sweet tea aftertaste. We didn't let it phase us and were still looking forward to the meal. The fried pickles came out with no sauce, we asked for and were given 2 ramekins of ranch. The waitress came back to the table and told us the charge was 50 cents. My teeth are still aching from the rib tips- they were practically inedible. Instead of the juicy hotlinks that I'd imagined, we got burnt, dry links that were absolutely SWIMMING in sauce. And they didn't give us any bread! I did enjoy my string beans and my boyfriend's coleslaw was tasty as well. 

First and last time at Stacy's.The Fall From Sushi Grace!! 
Kampai used to be my favorite sushi restraunt, there fish was very high quality and purchased fresh everyday. Now Kampai is simply meteocre, the new owners have completely changed the menu, sushi chefs, and the quality of fish has gone down drastically. Honestly I would not go back to Kampai now based on price alone, they are just to expensive for the low quality food that is served now. Less is definitely more as far as the old Kampai goes, their menu was simple and so were the ingrediants in the rolls. If you do choose to try out the downgraded Kampai I suggest the spicy tuna roll and the vegas roll, both are decent tasting. This sushi restraunt has nothing special to offer its consumers anymore. If you have been loyal to Kampai you will see how badly a mistake the original owners made when they decided to sell. Also Kampai is now open all the time so you can eat their crappy food almost anytime of the day now.Food is usually good. It is loud, get a booth if you can so you can hear the person you are with. Don't depend on much service and you will be happy. It is a bar like atmosphere, lots of TVs, the games are on, people are yelling, kids are yelling, don't plan on going there to chill out and all is good. Tried this place for a second time on Saturday again got a table next to a screaming kid. When they cleared the table the they flung food at us.  I am not sure if they just employ young people that just don't care or if the noise is so loud it makes them all crazy. I was so stressed out from the noise I put on my headset and listened to music....Never again!!Well I hate to disagree with the reviews on here about this place but I thought the food was sub par. I am not sure if I went on an off night but I was not impressed at all. I had monkey balls and ninja jalapenos to start and they were terribly breaded and flavorless. Next came locally named rolls that were all covered in eel sauce and were not made with quality ingredients.Nice place, nice decor, roomy/huge (empty) patio (with no service on a Friday night - we had to schlep our own drinks!!!) but...

Big large room - rather cavernous...with a small band playing in the main room, diners chatting, etc. it was way too hard to have a decent dinner conversation.

Wait and bar staff were friendly.  Host was kind of a cold fish.

We waited about 25 minutes on a Friday night and the place was certainly not jammed.

Food was average at best - small portions for the money.  No one in our party of 6 raved about any of their dishes.  Salsa containers (for hot salsa) are so ridiculously small you can barely get a chip in there to dip!!!  What's up with that?  The salsa was not that good either.

Good margs - especially the sangria marg but that's about it.

Nice place too bad the food does not live up the decor/vibe.  I get the feeling they could be killing a good concept unless they improve the food.

I may try again for lunch to see if it improves over time...but only if I'm in the area.  They did have nice clean restrooms which is always one of my barometers for how they operate...nothing worse than a dirty/disgusting restroom in a restaurant.Two stars for being the worst of the three that I've been to.

The usual SS staples are there, and the food isn't bad, but they ditched the Calimari that is on the Chicago menu!  Unbelieveable.  That was the most delicious thing I had ever had!

Mostly, my beef with this place is the location, in a mall, and the ambience of the place.  The ironic part is that when you are dining at the Chicago or Miami locations, it feels like you are in Vegas: swanky, cool, fun.  But dining in the Vegas one feels like you are at a Legal Seafoods in suburbia.

Just misses something.  If you're in Vegas, go someplace else.Was in vegas for the super bowl and made reservation at Sushi Samba Saturday night.  The menu looked interesting and I love sushi.  The decor is pretty cool, and as other people have posted it is loud, but that didn't bother me.  Our waitress was asian and very hard to understand.  Is it too much to ask that I understand our server?  We asked for help on the menu, but she was useless.  We ordered some sushi and grilled beef.  The sushi was totally average which was a major disappointment.  They messed up our order and brought us grilled chicken.  Took forever to get our beef.  The drinks were good, but again took forever.  It wasn't even that busy.  Couldn't wait to get out of there....I don't understand all the hoopla about this place.  The last time I ate here was probably 2005.  The burger and fries were average but I wouldn't say spectacular.  The prices are reasonable and the staff are nice but when I want to enjoy a great, fresh and non-microwave hamburger I always hit up Whataburger.

To each there own I guess :-)We have been a few times. Usually they were fun. Our most recent time I spent 50 minutes in line waiting to place our order then 20 minutes for our food. Once we ate our toddler was ready to go,  I spent all my time in line and waiting, it was a disappointing family outing. Perhaps they can figure out a way to expedite the service.This store is on my way to work and it is the only one so I am forced to stop here to get my favorite coffee. Their employees are very rude. I am moving on Saturday and I cannot wait to not have to come back to this location. 
My experience today was the last straw. 
No one was in line to order in the drive thru so I went right up to the menu and waited a good minute before anyone said anything. I order, and a man repeats the order back to me completely wrong. So I go to correct him and a girl cuts him off over the speaker "yeah. okay. we got It. pull forward"

Okay....rude. 

I get to the window and a man rang me up. In the process of doing this a girl comes up to him and asked him "since you're doing that, can I clock out now"
I've never had a good experience here as far as the customer service. I go there everyday and not one person has ever asked me my name. 
I worked at Starbucks before and that's why I'm being so critical. 

Today was my last day going to this location.

The stars are for the coffee. It's great!We ordered two sandwiches - one large, one regular and we could not tell a difference in size when they arrived at our table.  If I wanted cooked with with BBQ sauce thrown on top, I would have ate at home.  Whatever happened to cooking the meat IN THE SAUCE??  The smoked flavor of the meat was so overwhelming, I could not taste the sauce.Miserable spot in a depressing corner of the airport. It's overcrowded, dirty and dated. Service was slow but it wasn't their fault. When I flagged her down, my waitress, though obviously harried and overworked, was surprisingly pleasant, earning FSG an extra star. 

It was a slow night in the world of sports, and a terrified-looking family in a corner had to ask the staff to change the channel away from a grizzly UFC-type thing set in the jungle. The manager couldn't work the remote and succeeded only in alienating the segment of the restaurant half-watching a listless game of third-tier baseball. 

A drunk followed up by dropping a glass on the floor, which made an already grim atmosphere feel somehow worse. The whole thing felt like a bad carnival experience.  

I left feeling unsatisfied and vaguely anxious, exactly the opposite of what you want before boarding a plane.What sounded like a promising and even delicious burger, the Buffalo Ranch, arrived at my table as a total disappointment. To start with, the "seasoned" burger resembled a thick piece of cardboard in both taste and texture. This was topped with soggy shredded lettuce, a flaccid slice of tomato, and a barely detectable dab of buffalo sauce. The creamy ranch dressing and shaved red onion? Non-existent.  Supposedly coupling this culinary disaster were "seasoned" fries (when I asked what they were seasoned with, the response was salt and pepper), and a pickle spear (also forgotten).  At least the server Brandon was a nice guy and he offered to remove the burger from my check. For this, and the fact that the place serves beer and has sports on tv, Fox gets two stars.First off the bat there.  the lady that took our order was not really paying attention to our orders.  Hence is why im eating burgers with my friend right now that we did not order and got it wrong.  My friend ordered a modernest.  But she got a way different burger with jalapenos in it.  Way to spicy for her and for her one year old daughter.  
I ordered the midevil burger with the biggest size of patty.  Yet i got a burger the size of a mcdonalds happy meal burger.   The fries where limp and soggy.  The only positive part of this meal was the sweet potato fries.
Also word of advice for the workers there, pay attention to your customers orders and pull up your pants. If i wanted to go see some thong and ass id go to a strip club.I came here for a scale. They had none in stock.

The store itself was relatively tidy, though a bit strangely organized.

Took me a while to find someone to help me, and then took them even longer to tell me they had nothing in stock, even though I started off the conversation with "there are none on the shelf".

The employees were friendly enough, but the overall experience was meh, even for a Best Buy.This is average food with a hip atmosphere.my gf and i are avid bww patrons, i'd say every weekend we partake, however lately we've been experiencing a lot of problems with their pick-up / carry-out service which we often place orders through.

fairly recently we've been having issues with them getting the order right.  typically they forget utensils, missing orders of celery and / or ranch, give us the wrong flavor, etc - but the line was drawn for us when we placed a 24pc wing order only to see that there were 12 wings in a 24pc box and the other half of the order was not included after coming home, relaxing in front of the tv and getting ready to eat.

never had we really experienced a problem with dining in (with the exception of the occasional lag of service when it's a little crowded) but all of these mistakes with carry-out has started to rub us the wrong way.

when picking up an order, always always ALWAYS double-check right in front of them.I will give this place two stars because the service was pretty good. The food was another story. 
Our waiter was very attentive and offered some great suggestions to start. One of which was the "drunken chicken nachos". We ordered a couple of them for our group and when it was brought over, one of the first comments was - " wtf is that smell?"
I really am not sure what was added to those nachos, but it looked like a pile of crap. It didnt taste any better. So for entrees I think the majority of us either ordered the short ribs or the filet mignon. I guess since this was a Mexican place I should've ordered something else, so maybe this was my fault. But the waiter who took our order described the steak to be comparable to some NYC quaility steakhouse cuts. Steak looked nice and plated well but it was lacking some seasoning. Overall I would not recommend this place or ever go again. Afterwards I began to understand the name YOLO, I felt pretty sick and thought I was going to die. You definitely only live once after eating here.Sat at the bar. The bartender sucked, lame attitude, no silverware, never asked about food or needing another beer and basically not very friendly.
The chips & salsa were pretty good, not great. The chicken fajitas were ok but typical, nothing to brag about. They need to make the beer colder and the staff warmer.My experience was seemingly better than most of the reviews I've read on here. That being said I still have to give it a 2 star experience as far as the service was concerned. I booked my car a week in advance: 3 days for a grand total of $51
Not bad considering other companies were close to twice that. The taxes here are insane.

When I arrived there was nobody in line, so I was served immediately. I gave the lady my name and ID, she found my reservation and that's where the fun began.
It went more or less like this:


"Sir, are you going out of state with this car?" 

"Uh, no, wasn't planning on it"

"Oh, because if you were you can get a Sonata Hybrid for $12 per day more!"

"Not bad, but no, I won't need it."

"Are you sure? It's a nice car!"

"No, that's OK, thanks."

"Ok, no problem. Will you be adding insurance for only $26 dollars a day?"

"No, I've got my own"

"Are you sure? This is Las Vegas! We have the highest insurance rates in the country because of the accidents and theft!"

"No, I'm from Miami, I'm familiar with the problem"

"I don't think it's a good idea, I had a renter just last week had their car stolen out of the Valet lot at the Mirage, and people break into the cars all the time! You'd be stupid not to take the insurance because your insurance won't cover the cost of downtime and other expenses!"

"Wow. Sounds like that's the Valet's problem really. No thank you. I'll be fine"

"You're getting an unheard of rate of $8 a day, you mean to tell me you won't protect yourself for only $78 dollars more?!"

"Yes, I'm sure."

"Ok then, the total will be $66"

"I was told it was $51 when I booked online. Taxes and fees included... why is it more??"

"We automatically add roadside assistance for $15 when you book. If you have any problems the hookup to the tow truck alone will cost you $75!"

I was tired of fighting.. "Whatever, fine."

The next day I called in and complained, they took off the extra $15 because I KNEW I wasn't going to need it. Most of my driving consisted of driving from one parking lot to the other and the occasional trip off strip.

My entire trip I was paranoid that something horrible was going to happen, like I'd come back to find my wheels were missing or I'd find my car days later in the bottom of the Grand Canyon stripped clean by the buzzards.

Yes, a very 2 star experience.Populated by a surly staff who, due to the neighborhood, start from the assumption that everyone in the store is a criminal, it at least has a larger selection than the one on Trop @ Pecos.I have a friend who I may not trust with my life, but I do trust with dining and nightlife recommendations. Basically, wherever he tells me to go, I go.

This was the first time my trust in him was shaken. 

My companion got meatloaf that was terrible; my steak was tough and flavorless. Our bread basket was good, though. 

Service was friendly but inept.

The place was empty.

The herb garden in the back room is beautiful. Actually, the whole restaurant is beautiful, especially with the pool area lit all beautifully.

The giant cotton candy ball was the highlight of the evening. What does it mean when $.10 of sugar ends up being the best part of your dining experience?

Oh well, you win some, you lose some.I was not impressed by Bradbury's. The atmosphere was cool, but the seating situation was not ideal. Considering how long it took me to get my meal (which was just tea and a crepe), the lack of chairs without back support was kind of a bummer. I agree with earlier reviewers that the staff was pretty stand-offish; they seemed awfully tense for people who get to make crepes for a living. As far as the crepes themselves go: they were crepes. Standard, middle-of-the-line crepes. I ordered a sweet rhubarb crepe and tried some of my friend's trout crepe, and both of them were pretty average. They were good, but hardly worth the prices that were charged for them. 

Bradbury's: All I'm saying is you can get comparable crepes elsewhere without the uncomfortable seats and snobby staff.Just got back from eating at Kabuki, which I was treated to by a friend.

I ordered the soft shell crab appetizer; I love soft shell crab.  Their soft shell crab tasted like the smell of a wet dog, and I had to force myself to finish it.

I ordered the dragon roll sushi, and it was a tasteless mush.  Oh, it looked cute, done in a little dragon form, but I can't ever remember being that underwhelmed by unagi before.

I ordered the apple tart dessert, and again, it was a tasteless mush.  I could barely tell what I was eating.

I was dining with others, and I tried some of their baked salmon and salmon sushi, and it was all just blah.  I can't ever recall eating sushi and Japanese cuisine that bland before.I love Indian Food. 

I'm constantly driving through this intersection and have always wanted to try it.  I finally got the chance and on top of that it was lunchtime and their sign said, "LUNCH SPECIALS".  

I arrived around 11 am and the place is empty.  I ordered the "dinner" portion as I was sharing with my child.  $13 for Chicken Curry & Chicken Tikka Masala.  I also ordered a side of plain Naan.  

The entree came with a "row" of rice that separated the two choices I made.  The rice tasted like something that came from Uncle Bens--no flavor and every time I scooped up rice there was a lot of water-soaked rice underneath.  The chicken curry and chicken masala tasted the same, one was red the other wasn't.  Again, very little flavor.  

How can Indian food lack so much flavor???  The naan was just a flat bread, nothing important about it... but it vaguely reminded me of the frozen Naan they sell at Trader Joe's... and when I started thinking about it, so did the Curry & Masala.  I ended up spending over $20 dollars for my meal that I shared with my young child.  I felt like I could have gotten the same thing at Trader Joe's sans the watery rice for about $10. 

I gave this place two stars... just based on the great service the waitress gave and another for it trying to be a healthy Indian restaurant.  Trust... go to the Indian Buffet in the airpark, although it's the real deal, it's worth the money and calories!Dirty, crowded, loud, unwelcoming. That about sums up what I think of this 99 Ranch Market. I definitely agree with Tony T. that the 99 Ranch Markets in Southern California offer a completely different shopping experience. This location has very poor customer service. It seems like they have a lot of employees, but not a single one ever talks to me or tries to help out at all. On a couple different occasions, I've had to carry down a large bag of rice by myself because no one would help me. On top of that, the prices aren't the cheapest, but I think many people don't know about other Asian groceries in town, so they just rely on this one. The place isn't necessarily a mess, but it's definitely dirty and I never see anyone cleaning the floors or anything. I'd like to say I'll never come here again, but I know I probably will.the broth was too sweet for me. perhaps just personal taste though.We were a party of 10, on 3 different tables. Our table was a disaster. My 'American Kobe Beef''' burger, was cooked medium well, when I asked for medium. My wifes was medium when it was supposed to be medium. I could not taste any Kobe distinguished flavour in my burger, to be sure. 
Another one of our tables waited well past after were were finished before they were served, and again, their burgers were all cooked incorrectly. Table 3 of ours enjoyed their burgers alot and they got served in decent time.
The place has great ambience, the shakes are to die for, but the manager has to get ahold of his kitchen/grill staff and kick some ass. Cause they are sorta out of control at least as of July 29, 2008.I could give you a rundown of this whole menu item by item and tell you where to get a better version of it somewhere else in Vegas AND at a better price.  LBS at Red Rock blows this place away in every way possible.  $5 for fries??  Give me a break.We have given this place several try's. I have really wanted to like it, it's 
close to my house and took over a cute old diner. The service here is just 
bad and saying that about a pho spot is kind of redundant. However that only fly's when you are in Chinatown. We actually waited 20 min for our food after we ordered?!? For a bowl of Pho?? Usually it's on the table 30 seconds after you order it. There may have been six pieces of meat in my small bowl. Which besides the ammount of broth was the same as the large bowl. Then they come around to vacuume by our table at 9:00? They close at 10 and are telling people at 9:45 they will have to get the food to go(they went somewhere else....go figure). As far as the food it's just OK. I have eaten in Pho places all over and some are a little better than others but they are all pretty much the same. Just give me a large portion with pleanty of vegg on the side and I'll be happy. Pho 8 opening across the street is gonna put a serious crimp in thier numbers. Or maybe it already has they were basicly empty when we were there?!?The service was good and the decor is fun, but I'm not sure that makes up for where The Mad Greek falls short. 

I went early in the afternoon on a weekday and although I was one of maybe six other patrons in the restaurant at the time, the place smelled strongly of cigarette smoke. I may not have even noticed this if it was in the evening as cigarette smoke is not uncommon in Las Vegas, however I found it odd that the restaurant was so large and empty yet the smoke was so strong. 

The menu HUGE but it's very cluttered and thereby overwhelming. Most of the foods on the menu either lack a description or the description is very vague, so if you've never had Greek food before, this may not be the place to start. 

I ordered my food to-go and the hostess (who was very sweet) even offered me a drink while I looked at the menu. The food didn't take long to come out and it was all packed in a plastic bag. 

When I got home with my food, I noticed the bag was wet. I opened it and saw that the tzatziki sauce I ordered was extremely watery (the consistency was somewhere in betwen Italian salad dressing and ranch salad dressing) and was spilling out of a styrofoam to-go box. I found this to be very odd that they would pack a sauce/dip in a standard to-go box. It seems like common sense that it would spill out of it and should probably be packaged in some sort of plastic container with a lid.

Overall, I'd say the food was decent. If I lived closer to it, I might stop in once a while to satisfy a craving for Greek food. But anything more than that is a stretch.Overpriced, overrated. Their pad Thai is different alright--chow mein noodles?Everybody knows what Swiss Chalet is like so I won't bother talking about the food, Its consistently above average.  However, recently I tried to order online and had a terrible experience.  

At first i called and had to sit through 5 minutes of pre-recorded message before i was worthy of speaking with a human.  At which point I had a flier with a "2 can Dine for 14.99" coupon of which said nothing about its validity for a delivery order.  I was however denied the use of the coupon.  The gentleman on the phone was from a call center in India even though i called the Waterloo number from the flier.  After attempting to place my order I was transferred to a different gentleman. Who was presumably from the Waterloo restaurant.  He proceeded to ask the same questions i had already answered.  It was at this point i hung up and ordered from a different restaurant.This place was PACKED at lunch, so they must be doing something right.  But it's definitely not the Pad Thai.  They sat me immediately, and took my order fairly quickly, but then it was over a half hour before I got my entree.  The Pad Thai was edible, but seriously lacking in flavor.  I asked for it medium spicy, but there was no heat whatsoever.  Just a bland, almost maple-syrup flavor.  I would have asked for some hot sauce, but between delivery of the food and the bill, nobody checked on me.  Guess I can't complain too much, however, as it was relatively cheap.  (But isn't most Thai food?).I love bebe so I would've thought 2b bebe is pretty similar right? I know it's not the exact same quality since the price ranges between those two stores are night and day. 

I went in on a WEEKDAY NIGHT. Probably 2 hours prior to store closing. Customer service wasn't very good. I only had one associate greet me the entire time while I was there but I think she only asked if I needed any assistance because I was shopping at the section she was folding clothes at.

Their layout of their merchandise isn't all that shopper friendly. Most of their clothes are hung on top bars and bottom bars. I'm a short girl (5ft 1in)....good luck to the other short girls trying to reach for items at the top bars. It just doesn't make a good shopping experience while trying to browse/reach for items up top all while having a bunch of other items on my arms at the same time.

I made my way towards the fitting rooms and nobody was there to assist me. Or so I thought. A few moments later, an associate emerged from outta nowhere. Watcha doin hiding in the fitting room girl?!?! I know you had to straighten out the go-backs and such but the go-back racks are located in the front of the fitting room anyways. 

Accessories rack wasn't very appealing either. Bracelets were just thrown in baskets while earrings and necklaces were hung on racks in a messy way. Necklaces were all tangled.

All in all, I wouldn't go out of my way JUST to come to this store. If I'm in the area, fine...I'll stop by. But this is definitely a "meh. I've experienced better" kind of store. I was only here because all their tops were 30% off.Ewww... another label bites the dust. They have low quality cheap clothing made specially for their outlet stores... Occasionally you might find a hand me down that didn't get sold from their regular Guess store but the majority of the stuff here is a step down from their normal stuff. Not worth your time. But if it is hot enough, definitely worth your time in the store... they REALLY blast the AC.Ok good
Nothing special
Very loud. Music is not conducive to having since, quiet mealQuick shitty pizza found in malls and airports.. though big slices and decent prices.Very disappointed in the turn this buffet has taken.  I've eaten there probably 50+ times (four times in the last two weeks) and in the last few months it has just become OK as opposed to a place I'd want to eat.  

My biggest disappointment is that they have removed the beef brisket from the line up.  It was always my favorite and one of the most flavorful tender briskets I've had.  That was the main draw for me, as with many of my friends.  

Now I've been told by Silverton that they have brisket every day.  I'm not sure what they think brisket is, but what they are serving is roast beef.  I'm from the South and I know my brisket.  What they are trying to pass off as brisket is actually a cut of meat from hind quarters of the cow as opposed to a flat cut from the breast section.  Brisket can be flaked apart with a fork, as opposed to having to be cut with a knife the way the roast beef they are serving has to be.  

Also, it used to be a much wider variety of food on various days, now it is the same thing every day!  The only thing that seems to change up is the Asian section.  

I asked to talk to a manager tonight, right after we arrived.  I explained how much I loved their brisket and asked when and if if would ever be back.  She said she would talk to the Chef and let me know what she found out.  She never came back.  

I was recently traveling for 10 weeks, so I wasn't in during that time, but if I recall correctly, things started changing before I left.  I was told that they had a new chef, and I'm not sure I'm pleased with some of the changes.  It was perfect before, why change what isn't broken.

I sure hope I don't have to take Seasons Buffet off my recommended list.Trys to be high class but does not deliver 

First off the fried artichoke hearts were pointless. Flavorless, mostly uneatable husk and overpriced. The steak was average but it did not make up for the flat cole slaw. The chicken salad was good but everything seemed pricey for the quality. Most of all the location tried to be high class but it stopped short and the service and menus, table settings, ect were more like a diner. 

We do not think we will be returning.This is a much more manageable version of Forever 21, where you don't feel overwhelmed by the variety and super long lines... but the quality is pretty much on par and a little more expensive.

I like the cute gift and odd/ends items, good for misc bday stuffers.Breakfast review only.. 
It's a bad sign when the waiter warns the table the kitchen is very slow, so the buffet is a better bet if you don't want to be there for a while. 
What's worse is that I considered this warning an improvement over past experiences - waiting forever to be served, and having only minutes to slam down a meal before heading to the next meeting. 

I've had a number of business meeting breakfasts here, but ONLY because the people I meet stay at the hotel. The food is average. I cannot think of anything better to say about it. No standouts, no pitfalls - well, maybe the yogurt parfait because it is so small. I waited how long for this??? At least the waiter was gracious enough to give us warning...Where do I start?
The instructors are great, but go a bit too easy on the kids, especially with regards to earning their belts...
Otherwise, my main objection to this place is the cost. The first 6 months are $100/mo for each child (no discount for the 2nd; but the rest of the family is free after that) and every 8 weeks your child graduates (whether you think they really deserve it or not--let's face it, you can't "hold them back" if the rest of the class, including their brother, is moving on) and each graduation carries a $50 - $80 fee (for each child). Oh, and then there is the gear that is required: $40 for gloves; $40 for foot gear; $50 for a foam bat that can be made for $5 (but are not ATA approved, so you can't use them in class). All of this times 2 for my two boys.
Then, on top of that, they are strongly encouraged to switch from the "basic" $100/month class to the "weapons" training $150/month class with even more weapons and gear to buy and tournaments to enter (don't forget those belt ceremonies every 8 weeks!)

Unbelievable that anyone could truly afford this. I'd rather put that $400-$450/month into their college funds. It will do them a whole lot more good in the long run.

Until then, we'll keep hiking and biking and swimming. Total cost: $0/month.I have to agree with a number of other Yelpers who have commented that the food is rather lackluster at Two Hippies.

The restaurant itself is very cool...stepping inside to order and waiting on the side porch and or back porch for your food is for a moment like being transported to Venice Beach or Mission Beach in Cali.

But alas visions of California soon recede (and you snap back to the the fact that...damn...I am still in Phoenix) once you eat the food here. The portions for the taco's and burros are large but oh so bland.

I had to drench a vegetarian burro I ordered with green sauce to get any flavor and even then it was still a bland meal.

There are much better taco and burrito shops in downtown Phoenix  (La Condesa Taco Shop is best I have been at in Phoenix so far...have to do a review soon) so look around and don't get sucked into Two Hippies just for the scenery.I thought I had written a review from my visit in March but I guess not lol. My brother and his wife live in Arizona, so this is where we went right after I landed and our waiter was fabulous etc etc. I give it two stars for my first night experience, plus I love the company establishment etc. I would give it a one star or even none if I could for my second experience here. This rating is solely based upon my experience and not the establishment itself, because I am a fan of the Yard House. I had a horrible snobb stick up his a** waiter! He seemed like life was miserable. I mean everyone else, including the manager was amazing so I am sorry to give such a low rating, but like I said, it is solely based on my experience with this one waiter. I only wish I got his name, so I could warn everyone not to get served by him! lol. He seemed as if he was so miserable and he was taking it out on us. Let's see, i'll describe him. Black or dark brown spiky hair...caucasian, light skin, and snooty!Eh...  

Maybe this place is just too sophisticated for my palate.

Hubby and I came here for lunch last Monday.  I ordered the Shabu style Hot and Sour soup with tofu, and hubby ordered the sugar cane pork spare ribs and chili lime beef.

The soup was alright, but not very substantial.  It came with a variety of vegetables, some japanese vegetable I cannot even begin to spell, mushrooms, baby corn, and tomatoes.  I must admit, the hot house tomatoes sort of threw me off.  Because it said Shabu style, i had envisioned something more, more noodles and tofu for dipping perhaps?  Anyway, I definitely would not order that dish again.

The chili lime beef was actually a beef carpaccio, more lime than chili.  Not that I have anything against carpaccio, but there was nothing on the menu to indicate it would be carpaccio style, and I feel like that is something you should disclose.  

The sugar cane pork definitely stole the show.  They were tangy and sweet, and extremely tasty.  However one winner out of three just isn't enough to make me want to come back.So, this was my second time entering this establishment. The first was to buy a gift card for my daughters teacher & the bartender (the ONLY man in the place who can sell you a gift card apparently~ young guy...fohawk?) ignored my desperate glances for all of 20 minutes before he finally granted me (the sale of) 1 gift card.  So, round two, today.....was told upon arrival (12pm) that it will be 15-25 minutes for the 1st available table, wait 40 minutes before the pager buzzes only to notice she called 8 parties that arrived AFTER us. She couldn't bear to apologize for the loss of our lunch hour~ didn't care or acknowledge that we were standing 10 feet from her while she was piling other guests in front of us.  We spent 45$ (plus tip) on 2 meals that we had to leave behind, because there wasn't time to wait for our food (had to go pick up kids from school).  The waiter was nice, but I don't have a clue where they get all their customers, the pinto beans were yummy, but their fish tacos have nothing on Otro.  Never again, not for me.Grim.  Ageing and tired.  There are a few absolutely dreadful basement rooms with no view, no wifi, no 3G signal and no hope.  The other rooms are only just better, with furniture that looks as if it's about to fall to bits any second.
Also... if you're in one of the ground floor or basement rooms at the back, do make sure your windows are secured: a colleague of mine suffered a break-in here.
If you can, try to get in the "club" rooms across the road, which are generally slightly larger and nicer in my opinion (but don't get your hopes up too high).
However: one good point is that the breakfast is not bad at all.  Porridge is included, which is not the case in all hotels.
On the whole, though, avoid if you possibly can.I haven't eaten in this bar so I can't review the food, but as a bar I'm not keen on it. Whenever I go out socially with my exercise group we always end up going here for some reason and I never enjoy it. It's a weird layout for a bar, but maybe that's because of the restaurant as well which divides it up. It makes it hard to find somewhere to stand and we always seem to be in the way of people passing to the toilet which you have to go down a flight of stairs to get to. The toilets are shared with Bar Napoli. 

I personally don't think there's a great atmosphere in the bar and with all the great bars in Edinburgh to choose from I would never choose to come here.This is an GroupOn voucher experience. 
Would I have entered this bar from the street? Probably not. 
The front is small and elongated, it looks crammed from the outside and indeed it is.
The back room is spacious and there was a private party or something going on. So we were advised that meals are served in the front area. 

 We did nearly sit on others people's laps getting to our table. For pub, drinking purposes that is possibly fine and acceptable, but we were here to eat a meal. 

We booked for 19:15 and we arrived prompt on time. Our table was backed against another punter who had her coat hanging over her chair which was now part of our 'wall' where the table was parked against. 

We presented our voucher and asked which wine we wanted: 'Red' or 'White' - we choose red. When it arrived I got to Reading the wine list containing 3 red wines and this wine wasn't on that list. It was a Spanish table wine and a little cheap tasting, in my student days I may have even kept this sort of wine in a cupboard..as a backup.

The menu was especially for GroupOn - 2 courses + wine menu - it was a mixture of their existing full menu.

A choice of 3 starters, main & desserts. We both opted for an Steak & Haggis Pie (supplement £1.50) with new potatoes and a cranachan for afters. 

We waited for our main to arrive a long while. Just after 8pm (after being sat at our table for 45 min) it finally arrived. Now we were hoping that the long cooking time was to improve our meal or even the pastry crust - I was making plausible explanations, but none was supplied by the staff. 
I did ask for salt & pepper - I needn't bothered. The gravy was a little too salty for my taste - and I add salt to nearly everything. Anita couldn't eat it. 
Positive note: the pastry crust was perfect. 

It took a while before they cleaned the table - and they did not ask if the main was to our satisfaction. 
The cranachan was good - well better than the main, nice & sweet and we finished that. 
After that we went to pay and even though the bar staff didn't ask if we liked it, Anita A. mentioned our dissatisfaction, they were not too apologetic, but waved the supplement from our bill. 

My experience here for a meal was an uncomfortable one and not to be repeated. The bar has a nice feel when you just there for a drink with a few friends, but for a meal this is not a nice experience. 

Not one to go back to in a hurry.We had a very disappointing visit to the Mussel Inn. The soup that I had to start was extremely poor. The mussels were better, but it made us "kind of sad that I can no longer keep it in my mind as the holy grail of mussel places." 

Overall, we said: "It's an extremely popular place, as was evidenced by the lively and diverse crowd packed in for a busy lunchtime service, but I was pretty underwhelmed by the quality, particularly of the soup."I've been here a few times, each time forgetting the slow service and rather bland Thai cuisine on offer here at not particularly impressive prices. Conveniently located close to Haymarket Station, but I'd wander further afield if you want some above average Thai cuisine at the same price level.In the day, before I had any incline of indie coffee chains(pre Yelp) and when my favourite place to chill out after work was Waterstones, the coffee supplied by its previous occupiers, was more than just well coffee...I mostly went there for the banter, from the baristas.

So tell me Edinburgh what's happened to this bookywooky shop? Really do nice cakes make up for the gapping chasm of friendliness and passion that used to lure me back week upon week; I think not! Somehow it has left me less warm to the chain since the renovation, just like a random wifi connection.

Yep the black/cream walls could do with a good lick of paint, the toilets could be more welcoming, the dwindling book stock could be more...stocky! New coffee team, different position of the coffee shop(why change it if it ain't broken) this place is in real danger of of going either one of two ways. Either turning into an abode that resembles Black Books or a massive Kindle shop? I know which one  I'd prefer?

God help me if one day I go in and Bernard Manny and Fran are sitting drinking red wine in the corner, swatting strange unseen creatures, while they discuss the reasons not to throw a kindle in the bin, or end the suffering of book lovers and give this place back the dignity and charm it deserves or put it out to pastures new.

I did like coming here, but now as I know it's lost a few regular customers, dropped a few more books since I started writing this email and not really made many inspirational changes to keep me from going elsewhere then apologies to them.

But if your gonna subtract something then if you add something else you really should multiply to get better results. With great power comes greater responsibility so please Waterstones be even greater and more responsible!Not being a regular shopper at this store I am generally shocked and disappointed when I come in to buy occasional last minute birthday/Christmas presents. Everything seems to be incredibly expensive; I do usually buy things online and i know they can't compete with those prices, but still, over £10 for a DVD seems incredibly steep to me. I find the selection of stock on display generally uninspiring and I can never be bothered trawling through the alphabetised CDs and films: if I knew what I wanted to buy, I'd get it on the internet for half the price. All in all, not a great place to shop.Ahhh... sooo much opportunity... the only Indian food in Henderson area!  They could make a killing!  We've waited so long!  So disappointed!

I stopped by earlier in the day to review the menu since I was in the area, and happily found they had pani poori and chaat and other non-standard fare - pretty much the only nice, sit-down restaurant in all of Las Vegas that serves Pani Poori AFAIK.. but I digress.  

Well I convinced my SO to go down there and give them a shot.  We get seated and order some chaat - which was OK but not as good as I remember it.   Fine.  We tried to order the Samosas too (like the first review) but they were still out... after 3 days?  Indian restaurant with no samosas?  Its like peanut butter and no jelly!   Turner and no Hooch! 

Ahh... let's move on.  We also ordered a full dish of Tandoori Chicken and Chicken Tikka Masala curry.   The food comes out relatively fast - but we had the same problem as the first reviewer - the curry had no curry!  Normally the complaint is too much sauce, no meat.  This was all meat, onions and peppers, and a tiny bit of curry.  That would have been OK, but the meat was... tough?  

Tough, over cooked meat?  I can't even remember the last time I ever had overcooked chicken in a restaurant.  Maybe at some backyard BBQ when they forgot to check on it after 30 minutes, but not in a restaurant!  Not for a $15 dish!!  Dry, tough chicken, yuck.

The full dish of Tandoori Chicken for $15 is big.  SO BIG, it barely fits on the serving plate.  That's cool and all, but I'm making a mess just trying to get food off the plate.  Plus, the Tandoori is DRY TOO!  WTF!!  It's supposed to be succulent and appetizing and yummy.  Instead we're both depressed and barely touch either dish.  We get it to go for lunch tomorrow.  

I wake up the next day and what do I find my SO doing?  Cooking lunch.  She wont even take this stuff to work.  She'd rather spend 2 hours cooking something than eat that meal.  *sigh*.  Such high hopes!

Sorry Taza.  Please, learn how to cook the chicken?  Is that too much to ask?I'd heard some positive buzz, but was rather unimpressed. We hit Hanny's on a Friday night and it struck me as one of those places that try to do too much and end up not doing much very well. My salad was okay but nothing I'd make a special trip for, my friend who ordered the Shrimp Pancetta appetizer said it was yummy, but the third in our party had the Pork Calabrese sandwich and it was so greasy I my skin almost broke out just sitting next to it. The too-loud (and "too cool") DJ and overpriced drinks didn't help the situation. It is a cool space and perhaps I just wanted too much, but I was simply disappointed.

I would give it another try, but only if other people were going and it was an "I'll meet up with you there" kind of thing. It definitely wouldn't be my pick. I hear the pizzas are a tasty option and I would give them a try if I find myself back there. Maybe they will win me over then.Okay been here a couple more times and think I need to update. Of all the places to go this is now maybe my fourth choice. If you are meeting someone, go early to get parking otherwise you'll be later than you expect. The menu has changed and it doesn't rank as high as before - just okay, breakfast is poor and lunch depends on the day. The staff on the floor are hard working and keep it clean, the staff behind the counter is mixed. Some are cordial and others act as if waiting on you is a bother. It might be a networking place to be seen, and it seems to host cliques as if holding court...but it has lost the luster for me.Took 45 minutes to get our food. The kids ordered Mac and Cheese, wife ordered salmon and I ordered the spicy tuna roll. Why the delay? No explanation, just an apology and they comped the Mac and Cheese. Unfortunately we won't be back. Service here in the past has been brutal... Too bad.I really want to like this place.  I do.  The decor has got the hip modern "restaurant in a house" thing like The Main Ingredient, only it's more open and had no trouble accommodating our group of eleven (we had made a reservation.)  They have cucumber water, which is awesome and for the most part, everyone's dishes looked good from where I sat.
My disappointment came when it was my turn to order.  I was informed that they "don't really modify dishes because they are going for a specific style and flavor."  I worked in restaurants for 15 years.  Trust me, I get it.  You don't want me to modify the heck out of something then say I don't like it.  But unfortunately, I have some medical issues that make it difficult for me to digest more than trivial amounts of fats.  I was informed by our server, South, that I couldn't even get the dressing on the side for a salad.  They don't even have a regular grilled chicken breast.  I asked for his recommendations and the only thing that sounded remotely healthy was the vegetarian gnocchi (the regular has sausage) and I asked for it with very, very little oil in the pan.  
So, our food arrived and everything looked great.  My boyfriend ordered the Mac and Cheese and said it was good.  Then the gnocchi arrived.  With a puddle of oil in the bottom.  Then my friend's dish arrived to my left.  Lo and behold, there were grilled vegetables on the plate (with what looked like oil on them, but even that would have been better.)  Why not just offer a side of grilled vegetables?  How hard is it to do things a la carte? 
Not being one to complain or send things back, I ate what I could of the gnocchi, pulling pieces off of the main dish and putting them on one of their share plates so I could pat the oil off of them before eating them.  About a half an hour later, I began to feel ill.
I know I could have been a jerk, made a big stink, asked for the manager, etc but why ruin everyone else's good time?  I've been a restaurant manager, I hated getting yelled at because one of my servers was pretentious and entitled and was too lazy to see what the kitchen could do.  
So, if you don't have any special dietary needs and you like to be treated like you don't know what you're talking about, go to Tuck Shop.  Otherwise, I'll stick with The Main Ingredient and ask for a slice of cucumber in my water.  At least they put dressing on the side.If you are visitor to Vegas, without the car, this is not a good place to go. It's too far, Your meal is cost as much as the same your cab. it's really hard to get a cab to pickup after you want to return.  When we were there at that time, the waiter will go around us with the meat selection we really waiting for. We end up only taste about 7-8 kinds.  I had almost everything at other brasil steakhouse.I had been tossing it around in my mind whether or not I wanted to review this place.  So, I'm just going to do it.

I had the take-out beef ribs, collard greens, black eyed peas, sweet potatoes, and the hush puppies.  I am really picky about ribs, and you could tell that these were not slow-cooked.  They were sort of tough, and not at all how I like them.  I didn't care for the sauce much either.  The sweet potatoes were good, and so were the greens.  Someone stole the black eyed peas from me, so I didn't taste them.  The hush puppies were fabulous though.

I dunno.  I really like ribs, but I would never have them from here again.  I don't know if it's worth it to me to go back and try something else.Blanco is not the place to find authentic Mexican food.  The atmosphere is really unique--super trendy and quite dim inside after sundown. The margarita was ok and the food was good, but nothing to write home about. They fill you up on chips and generic salsa to compensate for the smaller portions. 

I ordered the vegetable tacos with grilled chicken and black beans. The accompanying carrots and risotto-like rice were very out of place. 

The service was impersonal and we hardly received any attention from our server--not even a single refill on water!  I'll go elsewhere next time I'm craving Mexican fare.The places looks good, there's a line out the door, but they are cheap on bacon for the BLT sandwich. It had two pieces total for the entire sandwich. When I ordered extra bacon it cost $3.54, for three pieces of bacon. Not happy that a BLT now cost me $13.53. To the manager, please Don't be cheap with the bacon, it makes your nice restaurant low end. 

On the positive side I had the burger and it was very tasty. My wife did like her BLT, but  won't order it again. I would have given this place 4 stars if not for the bacon.pricey for a breakfast spot, and food was not spectacular.OK, we stayed a week here. It was OK, and I agree with the other reviewers, but, we didn't have bugs like some of the other guests. I agree also, that the place needs updating, but, overall, the location and price can't be beat in that upscale area. The other hotels cost twice as much!
We plan on returning next year, and we'll brace ourselves for a new adventure. I also sent a message to the hotel management, asking if they've read their online reviews, and why don't they get a loan to update, and hire more help. We'll see what they say!!As a Louisiana native, I was not impressed.This place is now US Egg's.  Food wasn't bad, just not a lot of flavor and im a guy that likes a lot of spice.  Service was adequate as well.food was okay. prices were crazy high though.For our final evening in Vegas, my friend and I were interested in trying something low-key and decently affordable.  We had been walking the Strip all day and were finishing up at the Wynn, so a convenient stopoff seemed like the best option before heading back early to our hotel room.  Both my friend and I tend to favor Asian-style cuisine, so the beautiful Wazuzu seemed perfect.

The restaurant was only about one-third full when walked in around 7 pm on a Sunday evening.  The decor was quite shocking with the brightly painted red walls and massive glass dragon hanging along the back wall.  The environment seemed to be more of a Chinese influence than Japanese.  We were immediately seated and debated over trying the sushi or the hot meals.  When it comes to modernized Japanese places, I find that it is always a struggle to know which type of food they are known for (if any). 

My friend ordered some sushi rolls, which she enjoyed well enough.  However, my Salmon Terriyaki Bowl was terrible.  The large bowl was almost three-fourths full of brown rice.  A very small helping of  sauteed peppers and onions was thrown in as well.  The salmon was dry, fishy, and bland.  It tasted like something you would get at a low-budget diner.  The sauce was flavorful, and obviously I had more than enough rice to soak it up with.  However, the fish was a disappointment and more vegetables would have been appreciated.

Wazuzu was a marginal experience, but not a place I would return to.  If you are looking for something similar, I would recommend Sushi Roku in Caesar's WAY before this place.My first visit to Sinatra earlier this year was great and merited 4 stars. Unfortunately, my last visit was not as good.

The food was actually the same: great but not the best I've ever had. 

What changed was the service. On my last visit it was reasonably attentive, despite the fact that I was dining in a large group. When I returned, everything seemed fine until we placed our order. The waiter brought my wine, and then disappeared. We literally did not see, speak to or hear from him again for the rest of our visit.

That meant that when my glass needed refilling, busboys had to be flagged down. When our dishes came and no parmesan cheese was offered, busboys had to be flagged down again. No one came by to ask us how our dishes were and if we needed anything else. When we wanted dessert and the check? A manager came and apologized to us, gave us our check (no comps offered, if you're wondering), then went on her merry way.

Yep - even after we complained about being totally and completely ignored, the waiter never returned to apologize or explain. 

Guess it's Spago for my next Vegas outing instead.Nothing against this applebees particularly. The company as a whole has gone to hell. They've gotten rid of all their good beers, appetizers and entres. The boneless wings kept going up in price, the beer went up with less selection, thai chicken pizza GONE, jalapeno poppers GONE, onion peels GONE. It's like the people running the company are completely backwards. As a result I have not been back in over a year. Other places have more beer, better prices, and better food. No reason to go back to applebees.Usually I love Paradise Café. However, I have given this one four or five different tries. Unfortunately this one does not make the cut is not make the cut.  I don't know how you can mess up the salad but they manage to do it each and every time.  Ordered one half of a sandwich and after one by the bread was crumbling apart.  I specifically asked to make sure the bread was fresh because I've had this problem time and time again.  I guess they can't tell the difference between stale dry and fresh bread.  

And last but not least is the Joker that works the cash register.  If he would just do his job and quit trying to entertain it might be a nice experience.

Won't be coming back here, maybe another paradise café but not this oneThe decor of Beijing Noodle No. 9 is awesome but like most Vegas' places that's all there is to it for what they charge... eh-hem overpriced meals. I came here for a work lunch as everywhere else had a 30 minute wait. Ordered an ice tea, not bad, and then the beef chow fun. The beef chow fun was not bad, kind of greasy and the beef was overcooked. Noodles are made fresh in house so thumbs up. Service left little to be desired and even though I did not pay for the meal I wouldn't come back.Came for a quick lunch. It was not busy but the hostess was not at her post. I had to wait around, wondering where she was. Finally she came to get me and seated me next to a very rowdy Chinese family. 

I received a glass of water and I placed my order. I ordered the chicken and seasonal vegetables. She brought me over a fork and set it down without a word. I tend to get a little irritated at that, because I'm a white person, I'm an ignorant who can't use chopsticks? 

The food came out ridiculously fast but I was a bit leery the chicken was undercooked. It tasted okay and I never got sick but it didn't seem particularly well done. Similarly, the vegetables were cut a bit haphazardly. Typically, vegetables are cut small enough to easily pick them up with chopsticks. These vegetables were left in unmanageable chunks. On top of that, I never actually got a plate. I just ate off the serving dish because no one bothered to give me one or check on me.Stay here yearly over Spring Break. They always suggest calling in with special requests (location, floor, etc). The problem is that they don't accommodate those requests. WE got in late because of airplane problems and the person in front of us in the registration line was complaining about calling in several times on his request and having them ignored. We followed. We had indicated a preferred building with close parking due to my inability to walk long distances comfortably. Instead they put us in a building with no handicapped parking in front of it and in the farthest room from the parking lot. And of course at the time we arrived there were no other rooms available to switch too. For the money we spent to buy the time shares you would think they'd try a bit harder to make their customers happy. But apparently they don't care.I have eaten lunch here (sandwich, chips, obligatory pickle), but I am specifically Yelping about the bakery.  I purchased a "Holly Go-Lightly" cake for my Mother to celebrate Mother's Day, and was really disappointed.  The price is steep (over $30 for an 8 inch cake...maybe it was even a 6 inch cake...) but I have always been willing to pay for those extra special touches.  But there was nothing special about this cake.  I admit, I was taken in by the glittered frosting, however, the frosting was not as good as most buttercream frosting on your average wedding cake.  And the [yellow] cake itself was dry.  My Mother said that maybe we did not serve it appropriately (meaning, that cake is ideally served at room temperature as opposed to directly from the refrigerator) but come on, we know good cake when we taste it, cold or warm.  So, after the "ooh" and "ahh" I received upon opening the box, that was the last of the compliments.I love Anthropologie but this store sucks. I travel a lot and I always check out the local Anthro store. Love their products and unique stores. This one has the worst display on the planet. The saleswomen are friendly if you're well dressed. Otherwise they follow you around if you have merchandise in your hand like you're going to steal. Seriously guys get cameras or get a life! Not sure if its racist or judgmental but I couldn't help noticing how unfriendly it was for people who weren't impeccably dressed white people.  Anthros from other cities, I love you. Great sense of style, design and display. The quality of products is not great all the time but 60% of my home is Anthro :)  I pick and choose the best they have to offer.Tubing for a drip system in my garden is not in gardening; it's in plumbing.  I guess that makes sense as I'm putting a plumbing system in my garden, or at least my wife is.  Light bulbs are not in lighting; they are in a separate light bulb section.  Not sure how to rationalize that one, but changing light bulbs is all me, in case you were wondering.  And so it goes in the aisles of Lowes that feel more like a maze with dead ends, trick turns, and no end in sight.  I would end up blaming myself if customer service weren't lacking.  It seems to be hit or miss with few hits.  The best thing Lowes has going is a convenient location.We used to eat here once a week because it was that good. The last take out a couple days ago was so disappointing, and we ordered our usual favorites: Panang Curry and Pad Woon Sen with Shrimp. Panang's taste had changed and the Pad Sen had a chewy piece of meat in it  (i ordered shrimp) and some sharp small bone-like things that almost made me puke when I spit them out. 

I used to think this place was 5 star also, but you only get 2 when you mess with people's food. *sigh* I'll give it a shot one more time, but the once a week visits are over. It'll be a few months before you see me again.

So long Sakun ThaiOn a positive note The rooms are spacious and quiet. Diamond Members please note: in room coffee is the worse, not even drinkable!
no business center, computers are .25 per minute!  A small cafe with limited offerings and Starbucks opens at 7:00AM. Huge construction project going on. Not set up for a business traveler.Et tu, Aria?

Seems like this hotel has joined the long list of other resorts that have thrown away customer service, simple common sense AND appreciation for their paying customers customers. I was there for EDC Weekend (June 8-11) and, I have to agree with my fellow yelpers there, that the check-in fiasco has left a bitter taste even a week after the trip. The first thing you expect to do when arriving at your vacation destination is check-in, drop off your luggage, and relax! All of this could not be done because our arrival was met with a 2.5 hour long line of disgruntled travelers standing static and clueless to a computer system failure. I understand that technical issues happen and they can be beyond the control of any employees. But I ask, where was the foresight in attempting a massive computer system overhaul prior to one of the busiest weekend of the season?? Being an EDC sponsored hotel with and incoming of +300,000 guests to Vegas, a Manny Pacquiao Fight, Stanley Cup Finals, and NBA Playoffs? Aria did little, and by little I mean nothing, to compensate for the wait, computer meltdown, and inconvenience other than putting out some stanchions  to make it feel like a ride and handing out bottles of water. We aren't thirsty we are tired from a 4 hour drive or a plane trip. We got things to do and nowhere on a person's weekend plans should it include standing in line for hours with little information on the status of the situation.

We were 10 minutes away from booking a room at the Paris down the way that boasted no lines and a rapid check-in as we were on a tight schedule when FINALLY they opened the check-in counters and started the process. We were near the front luckily and got through surprisingly fast from that point on. I'll give the hotel that, their staff handled it like an all-hands-on-deck black friday sale. By the end of the trip our promises of compensation seemed to be unfamiliar to the front desk upon check out. After ten minutes back and forth we got the resort fees removed from our room and oddly enough our total still came out higher than what we allegedly booked for through ARIA and EDC's "Great Deal". At the end of the day this was Aria's second chance to impress me. It was my return visit there. And even the first time, on a friday night, mid January, with no line at all, it took us a 45 minutes to check-in after the front desk couldn't find our reservation...

This hotel looks great, something straight out of the future and it's a real testament to modern architecture. It's luxurious to the pinnacle of definition all the way down to the perfume adorned air to the auto curtains that slide open upon entering your room. But aside from all the aesthetic oooh's and aaah's this place soils itself when it comes down to the brass tax and the fundamental functions of any good business, that is of course, customer service. For the amount of money you spend here, it would behoove you to spend it at some place just as nice and with service that far surpasses this place. Cosmo, Venitian, or Encore are fine choices.This is a really nice place but housekeeping needs to take better care of the rooms. The first two nights the room was not as clean as it should have been and the cleaning person on the third night did a really good job. Other than that, staff was great and resort is beautiful. Plus it doesn't charge for parking.I chose this resort because it was listed as a 5-star resort in my B of A credit card's rewards section. I had thousands of B of A rewards points saved up, so I figured it was high time I took advantage of them... and happened to have a 4-day trip to Scottsdale coming up.

Where I went wrong was by not doing further research. If I had reviewed other sites, such as this one, I would've avoided it and gladly paid more to stay somewhere else.

Tonight is my last night here--I check out tomorrow morning--and I can't wait to leave. As I set here, I'm sleep-deprived and covered in mysterious bug bites.

THE GOOD

- The staff is friendly and helpful. The young lady who checked me in was pleasant and courteous. The front desk sent housekeeping to remove the pink silly-string from my ceiling (she joked with me that they had found this in other units as well). However, these are baseline customer service requirements. I consider this is "the bar"--the minimum level I would expect from any reputable establishment that isn't a dive.

- Location. Close proximity to everything you could want... food, fun, etc.

- Price isn't bad at all, but you get what you pay for.

THE BAD:

- Bugs in, on, and around the beds. Possibly bed bugs? At first, I ignored them--thinking that 1 or 2 bugs was no big deal. But by my 3rd night (tonight), I've realized it's more of an infestation. Watch long enough, and you'll see the little guys scurrying across the white comforters. When I pulled out my night stand, I saw 3-4 scurry away from the light. I've realized they're all throughout the beds... behind headboards, in the mattresses, etc. I now have an explanation for the half-dozen or so itchy bites on my body. I have to go to sleep here in the next hour, and I'm dreading it. I can't wait to be done with this nightmare.

- This place is obviously "older," and this shows in many ways. Additionally, it doesn't appear that any attempts have been made to renovate or update.

- The furniture in my unit is old, stained, and the cushions are compressed and sagging.

- The carpet is old, stained, and torn at the edges.

- My 2nd day (Saturday), I had my "DnD" sign out all day, because I didn't need room service and wanted to take a nap. So, room service actually CALLS ME and wakes me up... basically asking "Do you REALLY mean you don't want to be disturbed, or would you mind if we come clean anyway?" Are you serious!? So much for my nap.

This was a mistake--the most unpleasant aspect of my visit to Scottsdale. My trip would've been perfect if I'd just stayed somewhere else. I can not and would not recommend this "resort" to anyone.This place has gone down hill, this was my 3rd visit and my last.  I have nicer towels for my car and a little bleach wouldn't hurt.  The receptionist Heather was the least helpful person I've come across.  The saving grace was Bryce, nice guy, super helpful.Should've read yelp reviews before venturing here. Like one yelper mentioned the place smells funny. Was thinking of walking out but we didn't. My friend ordered the burrito. There was nothing special about it. It was pretty big though. I ordered the carne verde too much verde sauce ~ my pork was swimming in it. It tasted like the bottled verde sauce. Accompanied with Spanish rice and refried beans. Nothing really stood out. I wasn't looking for fine dining. Place is dingy and dirty. Our food came out about 5 seconds after ordering it, ok, I'm exaggerating it was more like 5 mins which made me believe their food was pre-made and probably nuked. Really not worth it and a waste of stomach space.I have been to this place over 10 times...  I am sad to say the food is getting worst and worst...  What gives?  Each time we go, I hope it gets better.  Nope...  The service has gotten worst too.  Hum, I might not return again...  But my husband loves the place...So dissappointing.   Moved to LV a little over a year ago.  Asked around for best buffet, and was told repeatedly that it was the M.  Went there for Seafood Brunch - Fantastic!  Have gone back several times with out of town visitors.   But, something has changed.  Now, not only would I not go again (after two bad outings), I won't be taking anyone there.   

Sunday, went for the breakfast buffet- $10.  Awful.  Most pans were either empty, or in need of a refill.  I finally got a serving of Eggs Benedict (my favorite) - muffin wasn't even cooked, let alone warm.  Egg: over done.  Didn't finish it).   Line for "cooked to order eggs" was ridiculously out of hand - they had the line following the buffet, making easily 1/3 of it next to impossible to access (Management, Really?  Don't you see how this is ineffective?  I would have had that line re-routed within 5 minutes, and I don't even work in F&B industry).  

Today, I played at the M so I earned a 'free' lunch buffet.  Line wasn't long, so I went on in.  After I paid, I still had to wait 15 minutes to be seated.  Once I was allowed entry, I was escorted to  my table, passing by many empty tables and many tables that needed to be cleared.  Food was just 'meh'.  

True that the desserts are plentiful and tasty - but the same every time I've been there.  No variety.  Not worth it.

Sorry Studio B - whatever changes have happened, you've lost 2 customers in my husband & me.Old location was great and had character. Now it's overpriced, average food and ambiance is lackluster.You know I simply don't understand why so many mediocre restaurants get such high ratings here in Phoenix.  Is it because many of the patrons have not been to true 4 and 5 star restaurants?  Postino's on Central falls into the mediocre category for me and my guy.  The décor is quite nice and inviting but the wine list is uninteresting and limited.  I was under the impression that a wine bar features many types of wines that range from the modest to the spectacular?

The meal that I had was over the top with the sweetness that simply overpowered my pallet.  I had the Italian Picnic salad with the Prosciutto w/ Brie, which was a hot greasy mess.  I think I got the Panini from the reject basket, it looked not so hot, was difficult to eat and again with the too sweet fig jam, overkill for sure.  

I tried 3 different wines, which were decent but uninteresting and waaay overpriced.  I guess I was expecting more diversity and higher quality, which was not the case.

As for the staff, ladies please lose the attitude; you are not that pretty or cool.  The hostess was very unwelcoming and quite unpleasant.  The male wait staff seemed to have less attitude and at least made us feel that we weren't putting them out.  

If this Postino's lost the hipster, too cool attitude and actually got some great wines on their menu and tasted the food before it went out, it actually might be a 4  1/2 star wine bar.  But I can see from the reviews that I am in the minority so I'm sure nothing will change.   Too bad because we live in the neighborhood."Much smaller place than expected. " That was my first thought when I saw the place. But oh well. Met with some friends here and they already chose the items to order for dinner because we had a comp. Ended up getting lobster (so not worth the money!), sea bass clay pot (yum!), oysters on sizzling plate (so not worth it! It was chewy and barely any oysters anyways) and also peking duck... which I guess was decent. They didn't even give us any plum sauce for the duck, just the hoisin for the skin in the buns.

Service sucked. Had to ask for water a couple times and they couldn't even just bring one per person and had to ask how many glasses. And same with rice. Which chinese food doesn't give you rice with dinner?!? So for that they asked how many bowls also.

Most chinese restaurants bring you a dessert after the meal (not additional cost or anything.) but they did not do that here. It was near impossible to even get the check! In such a small restaurant that seems to be fully staffed on a not very busy day, service really sucked!

Food was average... and I don't even know the prices since it was comped. I would not recommend this place for Chinese.I expected so much more. The food here was eatable, there wasn't much variety. The "sushi" was rice and veggie rolls. I'm not coming back.We came over an hour before closing and were told they were no longer seating anyone.  The restaurant was about half full.  We found out we could sit at the bar, so of course we did.  First off, peanut butter frozen hot chocolate...amazing. (and seems simple to make at home)  now the fun stuff, the bartender was arrogant and a jackass.  We also had the nachos...awful.  They tasted like they were made with roasted plastic, the chips were oily and overall a bad choice.  I should have gotten the steak sandwich or the pizza like my neighbors, looked great. I say go, but don't look beyond the desserts.So my friend and I checked this place out from here great reviews from friends and family as they said the deserts were good.  But after reading other comments on Yelp, I was pretty skeptic (like all other reviews) because it's all relevant as what's good for you or not as everyone has different taste.  

But when the hostess and server doesn't really seem like they have any interest in serving you in anyway, I just want to get out ASAP.  I understand with a huge line that they must be tired or cranky as the line didn't seem to die down a bit but boy the look and the tone of voice they use were not friendly at all.  

So going back to the food, my friend and I ordered one sundae as I was told they were big, and it was pretty good as well as I love sweets.  But the deserts weren't anything mouth watering as it tasted similar to any sundaes I had.  For $15 bucks, I can't really say it was worth it.  

Now, going back to the waiter who served me, at first he seemed super nice as when I asked about what he recommanded, he seemed very determined to help me.  It was when I was paying, he took my check and cash but when he gave it to me, just threw the check holder right front of my face...my friend looking all shocked.  So I took the change and since my seat was right next to the computer where he was working at, he just looked away doing something...no "Have a great day,"  or "thanks, hope to see you soon.." Nothing.  

I get better service at any local teriyaki stores that has one server that does everything.  =PThis is a review for their TOGO food menu:

I ordered the works hot-dog. A foot long, and $11. Worth it? I think not. Go towards the Venetian from Quad and you'll see a foot long selling for $2. The pizza my friend ordered (BBQ Chicken) is probably more worth your money but still not amazing either. And no free tap water, really? Oh Vegas, how you dehydrate us. 

I feel like my experience might have been better if I did sit down inside the restaurant rather than taking togo. But maybe another day if I'm in the mood for frozen hot chocolate.I was lured in by the street side billboard offering a Large pepperoni pizza for $5.00-and as they say you get what you pay for.

It was fast & they were real nice and the prices on everything on the menu are real reasonable but...

When I first opened the box I thought they had given me a cheese pizza but quickly i realized they just put the chesse ON TOP.

I have had many a pizza and this was a 1st...the pizza was cheap and nothing to write home about..actually it was another 1st in my house. 1st pizza to NOT get finished.

I wouldn't bother with the pizza here again but I'd give their other stuff a try.Food - 4 stars- We had some really tasty burger sliders and pulled pork sliders. The homemade chips were delicious albeit heavy.

Service - 1 star- Although our waitress was as sweet as pie, the time it took for her to bring our drinks and foods was inexcusable. We also had a 20 minute wait to get seated when there were literally 10 people in the restaurant. 

Atmosphere - 3 stars- I could imagine that the place might be jumpin at night but we were there for lunch and it was DEAD. The mechanical bull is a nice touch though.

If it weren't for a groupon I wouldn't have ever ventured into this place considering Blue Martini and Yard House are close by. It's also pricey, which I wouldn't mind if everything else was up to par.I placed a large to go order. It was placed into boxes and was being bagged when the drive thru/manager got an order for a single meal. She took one of my biscuits and gave it to the drive thru order thus making me wait 5+ minutes for the next batch was made?!!

She put my order on hold to keep her drive thru times down. I was ordering for a family and the drive thru was a single to go order; pray tell which one should be more important? 

My search continues for a clean store with good service!The new set-up is terrible.  The old stand under the trees was great.  The new stand in the middle of the compost is terrible.  It smelled liked I was shopping for food at the dump.  The ambiance carried this place in the past and somewhat justified the high prices, but I will definitely not go out of my way to experience the dirt and dust pile that you have created now.Came here for a late dinner snack (around 10pm).

I was not impressed. I've been to many BWW and have experience great service. I have no idea if it was because it was late and they were tired or they just didn't care...

My date and I walked in and there was no one around to greet us. We didn't want to seat ourselves so waited a good few minutes before someone popped his head up to greet us. He was sitting in a booth... watching the game on the giant screen. Um, what the heck? That really irritated me. 

We put in our orders, got the food and started eating. Then, they started vacuuming! It wasn't super loud or super close to our booth but I was annoyed. Totally ruined the whole experience.

I most likely will only go back to this BWW if I am in the area.Meh, thats really the first word that jumps into my mind when I think about my experiences at Toby Keiths. I went to the one in Vegas at the Harrahs Casino and it was ok, nothing special though. Very loud and crazy bar, at least that location is. Mesa location is a bit tamer but still kinda crazy. Food was typical bar food (burgers, fried food, etc) on both occasions (Vegas and this location), drinks were ok, service was fine both times. I can't really complain but this is not one of those places I would not choose to go to. Typical sports bar in my opinion. A couple of positives I can say is that they do make a hella good fried twinkie dessert and the waiters at the Mesa location are hilarious and a blast. Bottom line, this is one of those places you go to party, be loud and obnoxious. If you are looking for a quiet place with tasty terrific food, you will most likely not find it here.I've hear that Toby Keith's song about his bar says something like "never a cover charge". On Wednesday night there was a $5 cover charge for guys. Then the door people handed me a card saying that there were $1 domestic beers for guys until 10pm. So we went to the bar and, after some delay, the bartender asked me, "Would you like a short one or a tall one?" I said a tall one, so he brings me a 32oz. mason jar with Blue Moon (a domestic) with a slice of orange. He said, "That'll be $9." Some other guy later on that night said he also got ripped off that way, too.
Even the ladies were paying a lot for alcohol, $7.50 for shots of Fireball Cinnamon Whiskey. The place was pretty dead except for our party. The sound system was good, although too loud and we did get some dancing in.Huge warehouse like bar and grill with strange Djs that play country along with hip hop and rap tracks to throw everyone off. The funny thing is that most people are dancing to the twerk songs rather than the 2 step! Its an average bar with average food and average girls.The only complete dud at CityCenter. Confusing layout with people wandering around lost, still lots of big areas of emptiness. There weren't many people looking in the stores, and NO ONE was buying. Give it two years and it'll have a GAP and a Barnes & Noble.Food was very tasty but no left over. Very light on the spaghetti  sauce and the meat ball was very dry. Service was one of the worst I have seen. I will try it again the other foods at the table were great. Hopefully the service will be better. I will repost after my next visit.I'm not sure what all the hype is about this place. Don't get me wrong, it has an awesome atmosphere.. but, it's way too snooty to be a sport's bar(which is what it claims to be.)The food was good, but not nearly as good as it should be considering what you're paying for it--yes, it's pricey (for what is essentially bar food.) Our server was just flat-out rude... We just never felt welcome in there.   It is however, a great place to watch a game (there's tv's at every booth)..Other than that though, not a place to write home about.Slappers.

Drunks.

Cheap paintstripper booze.

Awful music.

Violence.

Same as pretty much any other nightclub then. Awful.The Positive - Nice Ambiance!

Major Disappointment - 
On one of my flights back from Europe saw a documentary about Master SOMM - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUunwFZFqZo

There are apx 205 Master SOMM in the world and one was working at Sage!  

How excited I was being a passionate wine lover and having had the rare chance to visit some of the finest and exclusive wineries in Boudreaux &Napa. My knowledge of wine is far limited as compared to that of a Master SOMM. When I can save up a few shillings I take the opportunity to indulge my senses (with the family) and get pampered in the culinary arms of world renowned (Michelin) chefs where the service is usually bar none and with it put the local SOMM to the test.  

There are hidden treasures and with this is the opportunity for me to get a chance to experience through the help of a SOMM (local usually as there are only 205 Master SOMM in the world) and give them a reasonable price range to choose a wine after describing the flavors and style of wine I am in search of.  99.9% of the time the SOMM comes back with a bottle I have never heard of and causes a frenzy in my search for more!  

Well, guess what this Master SOMM came back with- Chateauneuf Du Pape - (Similar to one I can pick up at one of the local Costco) -

To add to the insult, we ordered the tasting menu and when the runners brought the dishes their passion to explain each dish runs off like a bullet train at 1000 mph only to leave you guessing about the dish you are about to sink your fork into.

While the flavors of the food were actually decent this place treats you like a Vegas hop on hop off bus, just another number Baby!My husband and I met a friend in Vegas for lunch and we went here. Well this place was a disappointment. The only reason they are getting any stars is for their customer service because their food gets nothing. They have a very basic menu which is way over priced and the food tastes awful. I was very disappointed because the restaurant is beautiful and I expected better. I do not really have much to say because the place was so basic and blah it is really unmemorable. It is way overpriced and I recommend easting elsewhere. You can get the same quality food at Dennys for alot cheaper. Their customer service is great though.Not impressed.  If it had not been for friends staying at the Aria as a local I probably would have never experienced this breakfast.   I ordered the Seaside Benedict.   That wasn't too bad.  I enjoyed the crab cake twist on a classic but for $20 the hash browns that accompanied the meal were as hard as hockey pucks.  To top it off service was lacking.  I ordered an ice tea when we first sat down and everyone received their drink but me so I flagged down a passing waitress and requested my drink again.  And then about 20 minutes after that our main waitress bought out my drink order not realizing I had already requested another one and received it.    

What I did like about this place is the atmosphere.  To me it had a futuristic kind of feel like where I might imagine the Jetsons would land for Sunday brunch.   I don't think I will be returning here unless it's not of my choice because the meal and experience I received shouldn't have cost more then $10-12.all i have to say about the buffet here is BLECH...it's not SO bad that it gets only 1 star, but it's far inferior to buffets i've tried elsewhere in vegas (i.e. bellagio)...especially for the price...for roughly $35/person, it's money better spent elsewhere...and actually, now that i think about it, yuck, i would not eat here again

like most vegas buffets, they had an assortment of cuisines, but nothing really stood out...they had king crab legs, prime rib, steak, turkey and sushi stations...sure it SOUNDS good, but don't let your eyes and ears trick you...everything tasted a little off, i feel like nothing was fresh! and i would DEFINITELY avoid the sushi and i'm pretty sure the shrimp was the thaw and serve kind...also, each person get's HALF a lobster with their meal...but again, didn't taste that fresh and they don't clean them very well so it wasn't a very appetizing presentation...and when i mean not clean them very well, lobster poo was still all up in there...i know for some folks out there, they just eat that sh*t up, but for me, no thanks because seriously, do you serve kobe beef with a side of poo, no!

so overall review, either their food had been sitting out for awhile, or it was thaw and serve...blech blech blech...i mean, for it to be in the ARIA hotel and have TROPICANA quality buffet, i would totally skip

desserts were AWFUL...the selection was limited and again, nothing tasted quite right...i would go with the creme brulee, i mean seriously, you have to be tastebudless to get that classic dessert wrong

not to sound like a lush, but the only saving grace is the fact they had unlimited wine included in the $35...i'm sure it's boxed wine, but compared to the tasteless slop they were serving, the wine tasted like rainbows

oh, FYI, after dinner (and for the rest of the night) i had the worst heartburn/stomach ache...i'm convinced it was the lobster!I think this place is a tad overrated- first off I went here for breakfast while en route to Mandalay for a convention. We show up- there are no signs that tell you where to line up when you're approaching from the casino level- by the time we saw that there was an actual "line" we'd been waiting and they felt sorry for us and let us through. The "server" if you'd call her that was bloody awful- she literally slammed my drink on the table- is Aria telling me that there isn't talent in Vegas that actually cares about customer service? Now on to the food- pancakes were hard - yuck and also no maple syrup- only berry toppings- WTF it's a brand new hotel not the Nugget! I would choose other places over this joint for the price.Pretty low end for a purported high end hotel. Price is good ($20) for lunch but it really seemed like a larger version of the Old Country Buffet. Nothing very surprising or interesting to choose from though the Indian station was a bit different.  Crab legs were a bit suspect, too.  I'd save my money and go to a better hotel buffet (Wynn, Paris, Bellagio).Buffet is worth 4.95 very dissapointing coming from Aria. Only French toast, tofu salald and gelato were good.

The wait and price totally not worth it, save your Vegas Money and go somewhere else!!How utterly disappointing this place was! I was responsible for deciding where to eat since I'm on yelp all the time. I decided to lead my group here since this place got decent reviews and it was in our hotel. 

Atmosphere was good. Very dark place and it was pretty empty on a Sunday night. Ambiance is nice for a date since it seems like a intimate and casual location. 

Service was friendly and there was no complaints there. Everyone was very nice and accommodating. 

Food was...well, how can I say this nicely...overpriced and overall disappointing. The food I ordered wasn't BAD, but definitely wasn't worth the price we paid. I ordered the sampler that came with the buffalo chicken lollipops, walnut shrimp, and philly cheesesteak dumplings. All three tasted great, but cost $30 total. RIDICULOUS!!!!! Portions were tiny. Granted the shrimp were more like jumbo prawns, but that does NOT warrant the price I paid. Yes...I understand location and rent and blah blah blah..but that's just ridiculous for such simple food. My friends ordered entrees that were priced pretty high as well and they were unimpressed with the steak and pasta dishes. I also ordered the Doritos Mac and Cheese and felt that it did not have a good cheese consistency. I've had better...way better. 

I was expecting some thrilling food experience, but left with emptier pockets and sad faces. I failed my friends on this yelp-based food adventure.Granted, the restaurant selection in Chandler is slim and pretty generic. And the Ocotillo district, though it aspires to become "the next Scottsdale," has a way to go....the area billed as "downtown Ocotillo" is, in reality, just a mid-sized strip mall.

So by those standards, The Egg and I is pretty decent....the food's not bad and the portions are generous.

But the service...I can sugar-coat it if you like, but in a nutshell, it just plain sucks. 

I arrive with my wife and kids, we have four people ahead of us on the list, and we're told 10-15 minutes...not bad for a Sunday morning. Never mind that we can see four tables, all clean and available...we wait patiently, and after 15 our hostess leads us past two empty booths and three empty tables to a table in the back, with rickety chairs, by the kitchen entrance, and within sniffing distance of the rest rooms. We ask if we can have a booth instead, and are told they're reserved. 

Meanwhile, two groups of four who arrived after us get seated right away, and are being brought their drinks while we're still waiting for any one of six, count 'em, six waitresses to even look at us. Waitresses are running past us every 30 seconds (like I said...we're right in front of the kitchen), and every one of them actually avoids my eye contact....as do the three waitresses standing gabbing with their customers. (I'm not talking about taking their orders...I'm talking about "how did you like the movie," and "my brother's playing football this weekend" kind of gabbing.) If the place was slow, I could see it...but when you've got customers sitting there being ignored, that's just rude.

After 10 minutes of this I get up and go to the front and ask the manager why. She smiles sweetly and tells me their reserved customers get preference in seating. I ask if they also get preference in service and civility....I get a blank look. Either she's considering the question carefully, or she's trying to figure out what "civility" means. 

In the end, she sends us a waitress. The food was actually not bad...not worth the extra 15 minutes between sitting down and ordering it, but not bad. And she knocked a bit off the check to make up for it, which I wasn't counting on....a smart practice for any restaurant that wants to see a disgruntled customer return. That said, my wife was even more annoyed than I was, and I doubt we'll be returning any time soon.Work done OK.  Pricing was quite high.  On-time and fixed/upfront pricing as advertised.  Left me with an "iffy" feeling about way additional services pitched/quoted.

While turning the water back on after installing a new toilet, I managed to somehow strip the main service shut off valve (old fashioned), leaving us with ~20% water flow to the house.  So, we needed a pretty quick fix.   Called Benjamin Franklin because timing was important (just wanted to get it done).

Technician showed up mid-way through the 3-hour promised window.  Was general courteous/professional.  Explained the issue (needed a new shut-off valve) and inquired about pricing for a new hose bib and pressure regulator (all at the same exterior plumbing location on the house).

Was shown a book of standard pricing and a written quote sheet was filled out (definitely had the aggressive car dealer feel... move forward, fast, no questions).  Shut-off valve replacement (w/ service charge for showing up - which was disclosed at appointment time) was almost $470.  Another $585 for a pressure regulator and $285 for a new hose bib.   I declined the latter two given the pricing.   It just seemed way off given that the regulator would actually be installed in-line with the new shut-off valve which was 4 inches down the line from the hose bib.  I'm not comfortable sweating pipes in myself, but have seen it done and understand the basics - the quote seemed way out of line in general - and way, way out of line to do at the same time.

Anyway, work proceeded.  The technician shut-off the service at the meter and then ??? for 20 minutes... not sure... then he came to the door and told me he was going to leave for a while to get parts while water drained out of the house (huh?).   It seemed odd to me given how few and how common the parts were.  It was even more odd given that the guy showed up in a rolling parts closet and the business advertises how they carry all the parts they need with them.  Whatever.

After about 1.5 hours, the tech returned and finished the job.  I'm not a plumber, but the workmanship seemed fine to me.  It functioned as expected.

Bottom line it was a shady, overpriced experience, but I made the conscious decision to proceed - the hassle was bigger than the money or suspicion, and the contracted job was completed satisfactorily.

I would not use this service again in the future.   It could be ignorance on my part, but I feel the prices don't justify the service, and I definitely got the impression that they are comfortable exploiting clients ignorance for any purpose if/when they feel the customer isn't knowledgeable about plumbing.Loved this location so much but the last three visits included a 10 minute wait in line and they still said, "pull around and wait for the food" - way to pull best practices from all the other shitty fast food joints.

At least the guy was honest and said he gave our food to the car ahead of us and needed to recook everything. 

Advice: go to another location!!!I have given Anthony's two chances to get and it right and have been disappointed.  The service is slow even when the restaurant is empty. I have gone on my lunch hour and been late back to work. On my second visit, every table around me got served before my pizza came, even though I was the first table seated.  I am assuming something went wrong with my order but the server didn't feel the need to tell me.  While I was waiting, the host staff couldn't be more bored and was talking loudly at the front of the restaurant.

As for the food, someone needs to tell the cook that coal fired pizza doesn't mean burned pizza. A layer of soot on the bottom of my pizza isn't artisan cooking, it's a clear sign the equipment is not be used properly. I do not think I will give this place a third try.I don't quiet understand all the good reviews for this place. If I could divide this review into two different categories of service and food, I would. I would give 4 stars to service. I went there for the first time and didn't know the menu. The lady behind the counter was very friendly and helped me pick something out of the menu. They had a lunch special but somehow we ended up paying way too much for just lunch. And that brings us to the second category: Food. 

I'm not sure if this place is listed as Greek/ Mediterranean food; but if you have ever had authentic Mediterranean food, you would know that the tzatziki is a Greek yogurt sauce with tons of garlic. They call theirs "dill sauce" and it was yogurt with dill, no spices, no garlic, no flavor. Hubby and  I ordered the gyros, which was also too dry and without any flavor. Last but not least, the desert... We ordered a baklava. 

First of all, the piece they sell you is huge and they charge about $5. There is no way anyone would be able to finish that piece by themselves and if they could, well, then they should reconsider their dietary choices. Second of all, if you have ever had baklava before then you would know that it shouldn't taste like you are licking cinnamon's butt hole. Excuse my language but there was so much cinnamon and sugar in that piece of baklava that hubby and I both almost chocked on our first and the only bite. 

My recommendation: This place needs a serious revision of the menu. They should either stick with the Greek/ Mediterranean theme and learn how to make those dishes, or change their menu completely. Also, if you are looking for a more authentic taste of the Mediterranean cuisine, you might want to try Stephanos' or Baladie Cafe (my favorite).Looking for an early lunch (11 am early) could sometimes  be a challenge. I was so excited to find a place that was literally around the corner from me. I'm unsure what my expectations were. I knew that this would be a "nice restaurant" = expensive which i have NO problem with.HOWEVER, when I'm spending $100 on two people, I expect to have little to no issues when it comes to the taste of my food.

I got the lobster bisque which tasted like a clam chowder wih no clams or potatoes. I had to SALT IT TO DEATH before it had any taste. I can't say that I was too upset about that due to the "soup of the day" only being $5. I ordered an apple martini that was probably the best thing I ordered there. I had the half chicken with potatoes and spinach I think..which was ok. I really feel like I could've done better myself at home due to the lack of flavor on the potatoes and spinach, My chicken had blood coming out of it. My bf had the flank steak and fries.They brought the flank steak and fries out at first and he wasn't impressed. When the waiter came back with the "sauce" for the flank steak that he forgot, my bf was so excited becase he figured the sauce would bring it ALL TOGETHER. Not so. Not so. The best thing about this place is the scenery and service. Our waitress was nice and the view of the lake was awesome. If I go back, it would be for drinks and a nice view.I also purchased on of the chocolate mani/pedi groupons.  I agree with several of the other posts that say it took forever to actually get in for an appointment!  I called several times, and I finally got a Sat appoint, but literally booked it a month in advance!  The layout is really strange too.  I don't get my nails done THAT often, so when I treat myself, I like the full sha-bang.  You will not find that here.  I love the big chairs you normally sit in for a pedicure that soaks your feet while giving you a massage-- not here.   At R Salon you will find yourself sitting at the nail station with your feet in one of those at home pedi soakers.  I used to have one years ago and tossed it because it splashes water all over the place!  

The nail polish colors are rather limited for a salon, but they do use high-end brands like Essie and OPI, which is expected.  The service itself was quite good.  My tech was super nice and sweet- and she did a really good job with the mani/pedi.  My only complaint about her was that she would stop and check her Blackberry AND respond to emails WHILE she was doing my nails!  

That is just common courtesy 101... all in all, I feel I got my money's worth with the groupon but I've received better service at a regular ol' nail salon.  I definitely would not pay full price and probably wouldn't buy another groupon if I saw one.my friend lin was visiting me from albany,ny and after picking her up at the airport, we
stopped by about 6 o'clock, before going to my home close by.
the food was good, chicken marcella and chicken parmizon.
we waited and waited and waited for bread and water, however, we were met by
too many attendants (3-4), each watching and switching plates of butter, glasses,etc.
the main server came by too many times, and i was ANNOYED by him!  was he
wanting a higher tip?
the prices were too, too high for this kind of strip-mall place.   2 dinners were
over $40, plus a small tip.

will not go back for this kind of treatment. however, my friend (who was
starving, made a pig of herself, by slopping the hard bread lots of times in the
chicken sauce.  hope no one saw her (she was in the middle of a divorce.Lots of hype for nothing. I've had better waffles, chicken, grits, etc. elsewhere. The service and staff there were upbeat and fun. I'm glad I didn't have to wait. If you want to try it, go early for breakfast.Not the BEST Mexican food I've ever had, but this was the best, non-fast food option I could find in terminal C at the Phoenix airport.

My tamales, beans and rice were good but could have been better. The service was fast--I bet they are used to serving customers who need to eat quickly.First impression was...cool a Mom & Pops kind of place. I'm from New England and thought yum, fried clams, fish & chips. Fries were not so good, overcooked! Had two pieces of fish. One was overcooked and the other was fine. Everything tasted like old grease to me. My husband liked the fried clams and cole slaw and hush puppies. He thought it was kind of old grease too.
Didn't like the idea of the cooks bare hands handling my fish when it was dropped into the deep fat fryer especially since he had just taken money from a customer at the register for an order. YUCK, wished I hadn't have seen that. Please wear gloves!!!!! All Cooked orders were handled with tongs...that's good.
Won't be going back but glad we tried it.The cheesy bread was awesome.  The pizza was a mess.  Good beers, people at my table said.  The root beer was pretty fine.  But, when cheese and sauce is just falling everywhere, and when the attention to detail is not Lou Malnati's quality, I dock points on my ratings.This places is ok. It's right by UNLV, in a boarded up building, no windows so no natural light. 

It's also a one man show. The bartender makes the bar food, serves the food, pours the drafts and does the tours of the cellar. This means if you want to actually ask questions about the beer your not going to get much dialogue since he's just too busy right now...and for the rest of the night. 

They have a great beer selection for pretty much any taste but I thought it was really overpriced. We paid 20 dollars for two beers. They were good, but I can also buy them for under 3.5 at Total Wine and More and get the same level of service. 

What I mean to say is frogs didn't cultivate the experience of going out so what's the point of paying more? I'll just buy and pour it myself.My wife and I decided to check out this lounge as we've heard so much about it.  We were very disappointed with the entire Mandarin Oriental experience.  We've heard so much about their 5 Star service that we had our hopes up.

We walked from Aria to Mandarin Oriental.  You have to walk down a long set of stairs to get to the entrance.  On the way down, we noticed how filthy the stairs were.  I realize it is windy, but 5 Star properties shouldn't have trash on stairs like that.  There was a lot of trash too.

Our next disappointment was that there was no doorman to open the door for you.  I don't want to sound like a snob, but I thought that was a requirement for a 5 Star property.  Well, there were none.

Then the two employees in the lobby didn't greet us.  They ignored us while we looked around for the elevators.  We had to approach one of them to ask how to get to the lounge.  He was busy texting someone on his cell phone....hmm....5 Star service?

When we arrived at the lounge, we were very impressed by the decor.  Again, it shocked us because there were 2 employees behind this huge desk and not one of them greeted us.  We were well dressed and looked proper, so I don't know what the deal was.  Anyway, we were finally seated in the lounge and our waitress spilled the water when she filled my wife's glass, but didn't clean up the spill on the table.....what?  and she poured across the table instead of next to us....wow, that's 3 Star service 101 and they can't get it right here?

The wine selection was very good and the Cabernet I ordered was fantastic.  The views from the lounge are spectacular.  That's the only reason why this place got 2 Stars....I was very tempted to give it 1, but the ambience, decor, and quality of the wine gave it the extra Star.

Normally this kind of stuff doesn't bother me, but we wanted a 5 Star experience....we could have spent much less money somewhere else and received better service.  Maybe they had an off day....I dunno.

Will I return?  Because of the brand name, I will give this place another chance.They say it's all about location, location, location and if that's the case then this would probably be the world's best hotel. But I'd say it's also about character, service and getting what you pay for.

I was in here for cocktails with a friend a while ago, and it was my first time ever in the place. I have to say, it was pretty soul-less. Being part of the Barceló chain, you know it's always going to be more or less the same standard as any of their other hotels in terms of cleanliness, prices etc but the bar area definitely lets them down in this one.

For starters, although it's open to non-residents (in fact, they usually have a blackboard outside on North Bridge plugging their latest drinks deals) there are no signs or directions or anything when you walk in to the reception area. This wouldn't have been a problem if any one of the half dozen or so members of staff around had been willing to help or even acknowledge that we'd walked in.

When we eventually found it, the table we sat at was dirty. Not a good start. We saw from looking around that you waited at your table to order your drinks rather than going to the bar yourself, so we waited... and waited... and waited. After nearly ten minutes we went up to the bar, only to find that half of the things on their cocktail list were out of stock.

Then we had the same problem with the bill. We'd asked for it, but then waited another good 10 minutes or so before going up to the bar to pay. It wasn't even busy either; I could have counted on one hand the number of other tables that were occupied, so I don't really know why the service was so slow.

The cocktails themselves were great, which is why I'm not giving it 1 star. Apart from that, not great really.I had high hopes for this place.  I mean really, Emeril Lagasse and hyped as  "the best sports experience in Las Vegas" pumped me up for the visit.  Man was I disappointed.  The best thing I can say about this place is they have televisions at each table and just about everywhere you look.   Other than that, there is no comfort feel to this restaurant/sports book.  The menu is over priced.  Based on my experience at other Emeril locations, I expected creative twists on bar favorties.  However, there is little creativity here. The menu items are basic traditional fare with little or no "bam" that Emeril is famous for.  It almost seems like they slapped Emeril's name on the restaurant and added one or two pseudo emeril meal choices just to get people in the door.  I will say that it is easy to place bets here and you won't miss any of the action but I expected much much more.What a lame store.  The employees didn't say hi to me once and were totally unhelpful.  Their dog food selection is decent but their dog toy selection is worse than PetSmart.  Too bad too because good quality pet stores are hard to find.  There has to be something else around here and I would go out of my way to find it.Went for dinner with folks. Service spotty, starters awful, main course was OK. Mom ordered Chardonnay, for which the only descriptive word she could find was "Ganges".

I am told that lunch buffet is good. I would not recommend for dinner.Please note this hotel is FAR from the strip.  You can see it but you definitely cannot walk to it.  The hotel charges to use their shuttle: $5. Cabs swing by some of the time.  The lobby is nice and the rooms are decorated well but the one we were checked into SMELLED FOUL.  We asked maintenance to come to the room and he confirmed it as did the housekeeping staff.  It smelled like rotten laundry/unclean towels/fungus feet.  So management switched our room and while it was better temporarily, as soon as you showered, the smell returned.  The only plus is that it is within walking distance of the tapas restaurant Firefly. Oh, and there is no free breakfast.Be prepared to wait at least 10 minutes and pay 10 bucks for a sandwich and cookie at this place.  The food is good, but definitely not worth the high price and long wait.  (The wait time is purely slow staff, usually the place is empty or half full).my third visit; and i gotta say that they really cut back since they opened a while ago. when they first opened everything was first class!... now its no class-FAIL!!! employees at the meat/seafood counter were not engaginging and rough around the edges- maybe its just me but i dont like being called "bud" and "pal" by people that are supposed to be taking care of me. selection has gone way down since opening; the worst was the produce! i can believe i could not find one decent nectarine, peach or plum, during peak stone fruit season. so sad but i guess they have to cut back like everybody else.I've eaten at Jollibee in Daly City, the PI and this location in Las Vegas as well as the one on the east side of town. So for this location 3 Stars for the Food, it's Hit or Miss, Never Consistent. 1 Star for Service; compared to the PI, I miss the Hundreds of Employees offering their Help and Eagerness to Clean and take your Trash, but here It takes them Forever to take your order and it takes Longer than that to get your food. -5 Stars, that's right Negative 5, for their Lack of AC, ESPECIALLY during the Summer! We first assumed it was just Broken, but after Several of Years of them being in business and experiencing Hot Oven like conditions, we're now Speculating they have a Crappy AC system or they are just a bunch of Cheapskates for not wanting to pay their Electric Bill! It's Las Vegas for goodness sakes! We live in a Desert, it gets to 120 degrees in the Summer! Heck even all the Jollibees in the PI all seemed to have Sufficient AC!A little behind on my reviews.... 

Went here for lunch on 5/5/10. This was a lunch with family/friends. 

We were there at about 11:30. Only a few other tables were occupied. We were seated pretty quickly. Then had to wait about 5-10 minutes before waitress showed up. Another 5 minutes to return with simple soda and lemonade orders. 

Lunch orders included two salads, chicken tenders and fries, chicken sandwich and fries, angel hair pasta dish, and personal deep dish pizza. 

Salads are a Little hard to screw up. Pizza was only warm. Some bites tasted like not yet cooked yet. Both orders with fries, the fries were cold as well as the pasta dish. 

Of course, waitress never came back to check on our orders after a few minutes. So probably 10-15 minutes went by before she came visible to waiver her over. When we told her food was cold, she was clearly confused and unsure what to do. She said she would be back in a minute. 

Manager too sounded confused and surprised... "Don't know why food would be cold?" He offered to bring out new order of fries, which he did fairly quickly.. No offer to discount meal ticket, no offer of free dessert, just apology and fresh basket of fries... 

Would love to go back to this place to try the beer and maybe appetizers. Being a huge beer drinker, would love to try the different brews. The appetizer menu looked pretty good too. 

I realize that any place can have a bad day. But first impressions are critical. Especially for food and restaurants. This will not be a place I would consider again unless the timing for Happy Hour presents itself...I've been here four or five times and never been too impressed. The atmosphere, art installations and eclectic seating gave me high hopes. The location is also unbeatable, walking distance from my place. But the service has always been sub-par, like it's a bother to take my order and converse with me.  Everyone here, including most of the clientele, seem way too cool for school.  The iced tea, my usual, is good; the iced coffee is great-tons of flavor and plenty of body. Espresso drinks are pretty standard for your indie coffee shop. I've asked for their vegan pastry (which changes daily) three times only to be told that they ran out for the day. I know that this happens, and I love that they freshly bake their goodies everyday and have a rotating menu, but I would also like to try the vegan scone sometime please.

Today, I ordered a strawberry-raspberry-cranberry smoothie ($5 for a small!) and confirmed with the boy behind the counter that the smoothies are vegan/non-dairy. He said yes then informed me that they use Naked juices for the base then just add fruit and ice. (Naked juice! So that's where the $5 price tag comes from!) Three minutes later, I was handed a delicious looking smoothie topped with...whipped cream...?

Really?!I really, really wanted to get something from this place.  It was cheery and clean, and helpfully sorted out everything by size and color.  But I could NOT justify some of the price tags.  I mean, I usually do most of my secondhand shopping at Buffalo Exchange and Crossroads, so I know what the upcharge for these stores should be.  The shirt I ended up falling in love with was a Cynthia Steffe for $28, and at the end of the day I just couldn't do it.

Do you and your wallet a favor and go to the Goodwill down the street.  Same selection, quarter of the price.S.L.O.W. service.
It wasn't even busy when I went in. ONE person getting ONE drink ahead of me.

I place my order for a large honey vanilla latte with soy. Wait almost ten minutes. They wrote soy on the cup.  The barrista spent plenty of extra time making the foam at the top look like a swan. If I was drinking it there, that would have been nice. I ordered it to go. It was getting a lid on it and going to my car. I don't need pretty. I need caffeine!
He announced "honey vanilla latte." I added, "soy?" And he said, "no."

He took the cup back, and started again.

I went in for a quick latte to go - on my way to work.

Total time - close to 20 minutes.

Not Okay.

That said - the latte was quite good. I may go back for another one. When I have lots of time to sit and sip and not care what the clock says.I'm Korean so I know what korean food tastes bad or good. The kimchi was good but the soup was not so great and I've tasted sooo much better! The service was a bit bad also, only one lady working while the owner is just sitting around drinking beer and watching T.V. Our lady server spilled the rice bowl on the floor causing a bit of commotion. In one of our orders, they forgot the cow meat in the soup and just gave us the plain soup. We informed her and 10 minutes later she brings out the cow meat in a different bowl. In addition, slow service, it took them 30 minutes to bring us out our food. I've tasted better, I probably won't be coming back here again.The sad thing is that every Japanese resident of Clark County would rather shop at Greenland Market than Nakata or Japan Creek.  Whenever I am at Greenland, I find every single Japanese person I know hanging out at the "Japanese food aisle". I constantly run into the cooks from Monta, the angry old man from Ichiza, a ton of various Sushi Chefs, and even the workers from I-Naba. Do these "authentic" Japanese restaurants actually get their ingredients from a Korean Market?

The produce here is awful and totally f*cking costs too much. 

The only nice workers are the Latino ones, no one else ever even gives me eye contact. 

K JUN chicken in the food court was good while it lasted but apparently they f*cking kicked them out. F*ck You Mr. Greenland or whoever the f*ck owns this place!

Chappagetti is the best jajangmeon we got here in LV but I feel it's slightly missing something on account of the fact that it's not Chinese owned. Jajangmeon is NOT Korean. It shocks me how many Koreans think it is an authentic Korean dish. Jajangmeon is a Chinese dish which became very popular in Korea. 

Anyone who knows me knows that I always bitch to my Japanese friends( most particularly Aaron K) about how Koreans tend to treat me like sh!t. I don't appreciate it at all. My Mom is Korean, so that makes me Korean, and during my youth I constantly attempted to reach out to the Korean community but was always pushed away by snotty FOB Koreans, who hated every single damn thing about me. My Dad is a 3rd generation Japanese American, and no one in my family speaks any other language but English..but is that a just reason to consider me an outsider in the Korean community?  My brother took more of the Korean side of the gene pool and grew up to be 6'5". Many of you idiots don't know this but the average height in South Korea is actually around 5'10", which is considerably taller than South American and African countries. Koreans tend to be one of the taller ethnic groups in the world. Well, the workers at Greenland assume my brother is Korean on account of his massive height and they treat him pretty darn good, but I can't get any sympathy over here. I hate how at Japanese Markets they think I'm Korean, and at Korean Markets they think I'm Japanese, and at Chinese Markets they think I'm weird.

OKAY.... the best thing here at Greenland is the FROZEN SMILING RABBIT MOON CREME BREAD. Believe me, you have to f*cking try it. Pictured here:  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/qVO3l9Q0-KVQE7W9JL9ePw?fsid=IOt7lW-WFEOARLbS_yG77w#Vb2-TK6mBKPndNEUkb3Y2A

They also sell those mega sized Mexican cokes for 1/4 the price you would get them at "World of Coke" for. World of Coke is officially useless now, and sucks!

I've experienced this epidemic of White dudes married to Asian women trying to shield their wives when I walk by them.  They literally grab their wives and hold them really tight when they make eye contact with me. What the f*ck is this? What the hell is going on here? I know I'm really f*cking hot, and I'm a giant womanizer, but I'm not gonna steal your damn mail order bride. Stop being so paranoid! I have white uncles and most my white friends are married to Asian women.It's funny cause in Hawaii, it's just a casual normal thing for Whites and Asians to marry..but for some reason the people here in LV think they are living some "John Lennon-Yoko Ono" fantasy and that their relationship is "forbidden" or some stupid sh!t. Go shop at Albertsons or Smiths then if you don't feel comfortable shopping around Asian people. 

Whenever I come to this Koreatown shopping center, I usually just walk straight over to "SUSHI ON RAINBOW", while my brother eats at Chappagetti. I don't know how we turned out so different. 

The Moral of the Story is to eat FROZEN SMILING RABBIT MOON CREAM BREAD with Mexican coke.

UPDATE- Today I was at Greenland Market and the workers were talking about how confused they were that  everyone was now suddenly buying Frozen Smiling Rabbit Moon Cream Bread. Apparently, they had a hard time selling it in the past.Dont come on a Sunday. You get seated very fast but the wait for your food after you order is very long. I ordered the crab cake bennidct and because the wait was so long, my eggs became hard not runny. The servers however very attentive.Location is awesome for people watching if you sit along the elevated glass railing overlooking the strip. My wife and I sat outside but near the inside of the restaurant. I was not impressed with the food but the location was amazing. The food was just ok I thought by the restaurant sitting on the sidewalk on the strip in front of the Miracle Mall I expected more. I did like the mist sprays to cool the air.It's like the Applebee's of BBQ.  Typical, fairly overpriced, nothing special.  Eat here if you have nowhere else to go :)After all the hype and excitement about this place I gave it a try.... not impressed.  Expensive for an average burger.  The only thing that was cool was the free peanuts but then again, not a huge fan of peanuts with hamburgers.  GO TO SMASH BURGER INSTEAD!!!The food is great, WHEN THEY GET IT RIGHT.  But I swear, they screw up our order every time.  I don't think I'll be ordering from them again...it has happened far too many times.Located in The Golden Nugget On Fremont Street Downtown Las Vegas. Ok so I hate to do this but, this place is just ok. the drinks were good, the service even better. The food was average to not so good. The fish and chips were saturated with oil. The 'tempura' lobster was more like funnel cake. There are much better choices downtown that are a lot cheaper. Live it up, you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!Went to Grimaldi's because of the high marks in Yelp. 

On vacation with relatives, we went in with a party of 13 including a 6-year-old, two 4-year-olds, and a 1-year-old. Found out pretty quickly Grimaldi's isn't the best pizza place for young kids or parents with young kids. The place is kind of intimate (i.e., small). So when you sit, the back of your chair slams up against your neighbor's. So, because we had little kids, we spent the entire time sitting down, getting up, banging neighbors, apologizing - repeat till fed up.

Asked for a kid menu - "no." Asked if they had mac and cheese, or spaghetti with tomato sauce, or buttered pasta - "no, only pizza." Asked if they had a vegetarian pizza, or a "Hawaiian" pizza, or a BBQ chicken pizza - "uhhh, yeah, we don't have that." WTH?

The left side of their menu is pizza. The right side of their menu is salad. There is no other side. And they don't have combinations. They have ingredients and you pick what you want. And as each ingredient is around $3 bucks, if you want a "vegetarian", tack on  an extra $30!!! So, $46 for a large vegetarian pizza. Again, WTH?

We ordered a pizza with red sauce and extra cheese for the kids, and a pizza with red sauce, tomatoes and basil, and a pizza with white sauce, fresh garlic, and mushroom for the adults. The red sauce pizzas were kind of bleh - very little sauce and only spots of cheese. Literally. Spots. Of. Cheese. If you're looking for a pizza covered, smothered, and dripping with yummy melting cheese (and we ordered extra cheese, remember?), what we received was not it. Not even close. Picture this: a pizza with a small to medium amount of pepperoni. Now replace the pepperoni with cheese. That's the Grimaldi's "extra cheese" pizza! haha

The white sauce pizza, with mushrooms, on the other hand, was a different story. The white sauce itself was like an excellent alfredo sauce, with butter, and parmesan, and tons of garlic. And, unlike the red sauce, they actually put a decent amount of it on the pizza. The white sauce pizza was that pizza where you can't wait for one of your friends to try it just so they can tell you, "yes, you're right, that's fricken' amazing." It was one of the best pizzas I'd ever tasted.

If we lived closer, my wife and I would go to Grimaldi's and, with a white sauce pizza with a couple beers, we'd be in heaven. Going in there with a party of 13, four of them little ones, and with it being a not-so-kid-friendly establishment, this was more like hell.I went here with high expectations. Band was stellar. Well worth the cover charge even tho the hostess was trying to persuade me to sit at the bar instead of paying. Whatevs. The bad part was tho I wanted to pay for a table for dinner, they sat me at a dirty table with no place settings. Gross. Relocated myself to a dinner table and had a horrible waitress, Lakeisha -- needs to learn how to serve tables! Was rude, yelling at the hostesses, even as the food runner brought my entree, the salad/ old wine glass was never removed. Why let dirty dishes sit in front of your guest at such a nice place? Good thing the meal was one of the best ive tasted! Carolina salmon, on top of creamed corn, it was Delicious!!!! As waitress trompped around, I felt uncomfortable but tried to enjoy the ambiance. I was going to stay around at the bar to enjoy the band but the bathrooms were so far away I never went back and I am glad i didnt. It was the first time in a VERY long time I left a 10 percent tip but with such lack luster service, i think this was generous.The servers do not speak a word of English, and do not tell you the price until after you've eaten. We ended up paying over $17 for two people with just water to drink. The egg drop soup was terrible, the orange chicken was questionable, the rice and noodles were mediocre, and the skewered chicken must have been 50% fat. Frozen peas and carrots were generously thrown into everything, including the egg-drop soup... They also had zero sushi to offer. The selection was VERY limited. There are numerous superior asian buffets to this one in the area. Their only saving graces were their seafood and real ice cream, of which 6 flavors were available. So unless all you want is shrimp and ice cream, don't waste your time and money. 2/5I starting going to Benjarong about 3 years ago...it was a great Thai restaurant in the neighborhood. I had always gone to Pin Kao but since we moved we thought we try it out. My first couple experiences were good. I told ot friends and family about it. We even had it delivered to our house and ordered their carry out food. I was completely disgusted to find a medium length black hair in the bottom of our Red Curry Chicken- i fed this to my whole family! It wasnt till the second serving that my husband wanted- i found the gross hair. I called to let them know and the reaction i got was that the person on the phone didnt understand and said maybe it was mine! At the time I was a red head and my husband has short hair so nope it wasnt ours....They offered a credit for the red curry. 
A few months go by and we thought, lets give it another try. This time ill pick it up at the restaurant. The food looked good but i realized when we got home, that the white rice that comes with the entree wasnt there and there was only brown rice that i ordered for a woping $2.50 a container. I opened the rice and it smelled like a most sour foul smell ...not normal for brown rice. I took a small bite and spit it out. The rice in a bag was definitely burnt and rancid. I now had no rice to serve to my family with our entree. I went on the the chicken satay appetizer. As i opened the box of food and foil i grabbed 2 skewers and not again...i found  ANOTHER BLACK HAIR!!! I was utterly disgusted my husband was fuming mad. Also that same trip to Benjarong i made sure to tip the server an xtra 10 for a tip.
Well over $20 percent for take out. I really regretted buying this food from them again.The kicker was when i called the lady who handed me my food she said "you must have lost the white rice...i gave it to you, the brown rice is supposed to smell sour and the hair in the food...she denied it again. Im sorry but  im not going to waste $40-60 bucks on food thats rancid, has human hair cooked in it and service that is less than normal and health code appropriate. 
I will NEVER order from Benjarong ever again!!
I dont know whats the matter with who ever runs the place, why the cant keep their hair out of the food they serve others and why the heck they cant admit they mess up people food and dont exhibit clean methods of preparing food but until someone takes responsibility...i think they should be cited and given a fine to clean up their act!The food was excellent but it was very expensive for the portion sizes. For three of us at lunch, the bill before tip was $105 & we didn't even have drinks. Service was good too but again I can't justify the price.Went here for the first time with a gift certificate that I received for my birthday. The people at the front desk were so nice and got me green tea asi was directed to the manicure station. The girl doing my nails was nice and personable, but stopped a few times to talk to other employees in the middle of the service. I personally want my cuticles clipped and I like to see that they have taken the dry skin off. It's a pet peeve when they don't. Heads up, they don't clip the cuticle at all. After the manicure was done, while my nails looked pretty,it felt like I just had a polish change. 
Now on to the pedicure..pretty decor and comfy tufted chairs. ( in my opinion the atmosphere of this place is so much better then the service you are receiving.) no massage in chairs, no jets in the bowl, no cuticle remover put on my feet. They were soaked for maybe 30 seconds before she took maybe a few small cuticles off and trust me they needed a lot of work. Massage was great but lasted about 20 seconds per foot. And that is being generous. Paid extra for callus remover and still had dry feet when I left. When I went to check out the total was 60 dollars! Are you serious?! I will stick to my trusty nail salon any day over this over priced frou frou nail bar. Also if you want to indulge.. Go to DryBar and have a blowout next door...so much better.Really 2.5 stars overall.
I ordered delivery 6 times from Eddie's.  The pizza is good, but a couple of times it was burnt and like cardboard. Called and complained the first time to no avail. After the second burnt pizza, I just stopped ordering from them.  That was about 2 months ago. The lemon garlic chicken sub is tasty, though. They are worth a try, maybe you'll have a better experience.You'd think a place called Hot Dog Stop would serve a great Chicago-Style hot dog.

You'd also think they'd have snappy Sabrett hot dogs, since hey, they have 4 Sabrett umbrellas outside.

Leave your assumptions at the door, since neither of the above is true.  My Chicago Dog was the following:  A skinless hot dog, inside a mexican-style bolillo roll, with chopped tomato, jalapenos, sport peppers, electric green relish, mustard, onions, and a pickle spear on the side.  

C'mon guys, at least try to make it look like the real thing.  Give me a poppy seed roll, put the pickle on the dog, give me a natural casing dog, no jalapenos.  Sliced tomato please.  Sport pepper and relish were fine.  

The owner(?) was energetic, almost slightly offensive.  Tone it down slightly dude.  Customers are uncomfortable when you comment on their perceived hunger based on your judging their body size - even guys.      

The condiment bar was well stocked, but canned mushrooms?  Yuck.  

Also very expensive for what you're getting.  I paid $10 for a dog, fries and a drink.  On a positive note, their fries were really good, albeit a little too salty, but really hot and crunchy.

I hope they can get it together, and other hot dogs looked good.I was looking forward to a feast, but even with the $50 coupon, it was a big let-down. There wasn't a Greek soul IN the place--flies were buzzing everywhere, my lamb soulaki was overdone, my side dishes were exactly the same as my husband's, and he was supposed to be having a gyro platter--with none of the appropriate sides to a gyro. His meat was stone cold. Everything was very UNseasoned. The only good part was the calamari, but the dips for the calamari were more like salsa or ranch dips--I began to think I was in a Mexican joint instead of a 'Greek" place--everyone running the place was Mexican. Maybe the chain was originally started and run by Greeks, and the name says Greek, but it had no other connection, having probably sold out to Mexicans years ago....even the wine was lousy.
Next time, go to Carraba's...WAY way better food, service, ambiance, cleaniness, menu, wine.I have never met a cupcake I did not like, I have been here twice, Both times I have gotten the same 2 cupcakes, Orange Creme & Razzberry, Lemon zest. They are both very good, always moist, I usually have to take the top half of the frosting off because there is just to much of it. I really like the cupcakes but the customer service is lacking, My husband and I went in, there were 2 ladies in front of us. There were 2 workers they both ignored my husband and I and focused on flirting with the 2 girls in front of us, chatting them up for 10 minutes, when the girls left and they finally helped us out, it was "what can I get you... Need your receipt?" we didn't even get so much as a Thank you or a Have a good night. When you don't feel your patronage is appreciated you don't tend to want to visit again!Very disappointed. Cupcake was dry. Purchased on a Sunday early afternoon. Wondered later if they were Saturday's cupcakes. Guess so. Won't be going there again to spend my hard-earned money on stale cake. Sorry, Sweet Daddy.Had the three taco lunch special.

Service was friendly and prompt.

Offered chips and salsa and the salsa that comes with the dish, albeit very mild, is good.  Tried an assortment of other salsas from the salsa bar.  The "taco sauce" was somewhat bland, the salsa verde was very good (and spicy) but the other salsas I tried were lacking punch.

Ordered one carne asada, one chicken and one carnitas.

All three tacos didn't quite have enough onions or cilantro for my tastes but the bartender brought some extra when I asked.

Carne Asada really needed more marinade as it was bland.

Chicken was good, but certainly benefitted from the salsa verde and a couple shakes of salt.

Carnitas, a little over greasy, but flavor was good.

There's not a huge beer selection, which is a positive, but had he standards and a good selection of mexican beers.

Hopefully they can get the spice levels set correctly and I would be more than happy to give it another shot.Pita bread was very good. 
Disappointed with the fattoush. I ordered it as a carry out. When I was ready to eat it, I opened the carton and it had dressing on it and all the pita chips soaked up dressing. Also, the tomatoes in it tasted old. I threw them out. 
Mixed shawarma was not like I'm used to. I had a couple bites and put it down. Not good in my opinion. The saffron rice was fair. 
Hummus had too much tahini and wasn't lemony at all. It tasted pasty. 

Even though I was hungry, I threw most of it out. 

I am middle eastern and hear my friends say how good it is there. I didn't think so.My experience was a little different here.  First of all the parking lot was empty, usually a bad sign.  When we entered the resturant, we were the only ones in there.  The two guys working there were friendly enough and the prices were fantastic.  But the food didn't taste quite right.  Something tasted a little off in both my dinner and my wifes.  Almost like the oil they were cooking with was too old.   And the fact that they charge for refills on the soda (after the first free refill, but it's a small cup) was a little offputting.  The price is right but the food could certainly be better.I have been there 3 times. No one have ever greeted me or even said Hi . No customer service what so ever. Clothes are designer, but old and out of date. Prices are high. Selection is slim. Needs to put forth a bit more effort in my opinion.My GLK hood would not latch properly without slamming the hood. Only one side had the latching problem. While in for service I requested an adjustment to correct the problem. I was told by my adviser that service could not do the adjustment. When I got home I adjusted the hood in just a few minutes. I should not have done that being it was under warranty. I assume they did not want to take the time to do the adjustment. This was an issue that was a while back but it is still stuck in my crawl, so I decided to mention it.Too few checkout lanes open, check. Open checkouts are absurdly slow, check. Restrooms are filthy with sticky floors, check. Receipt contains a feedback/survey link whereby customer comments are completely ignored, check. Yup, this is a pretty typical Walmart store. What? It's a TARGET you say?Once upon a time I had FIrst Union, then Wachovia bought it, then Wells Fargo bought Wachovia, so now my bank is Wells Fargo. I tend to stay loyal to a business as long as the customer service stays good but I've gotten tired of this giant bank's policies and I'm itching to go with something smaller like a local credit union. 
I started to notice ridiculously high fees for things that should not incur a fee to begin with. For instance, I get charged to put money INTO my savings account and then I get charged even more if I or they have to pull it back into my checking. They call this "overdraft protection", but it's MY money coming from MY savings account not a line of credit.  Don't banks like for a person to put money into their savings account? 
While shopping around I have found that the credit unions tend to not do this or if they do charge, they charge a nominal fee for removing money from savings usually only if you do it more than so many times in a month.  NO ONE ELSE charges you to transfer money INTO your savings like Wells Fargo does!
Bottom line is, I have no problem with the customer service at this particular branch or any Wells Fargo branch I've used,  but I think Wellls Fargo charges fees for  things they shouldn't and too much at that. I also think it's the more ethical thing to do to switch away from big banks like Wells Fargo. I'd rather keep my money local unless it benefits me financially to not keep it local, which is far from the case with Wells Fargo.  I'm switching to a credit union.Horrible horrible went with a friend his 2nd time there he had bad experience the first time but went on the first day (no waffles or sweet potato pancakes) so we went around noon place has been open for 2 weeks nice hostess got a table right away then sat there for 10 mins befits someone took our drink order still missing waffles on the menu so I went for a burger I wanted soup the waitress said it's not ready it was 1245pm 1/2hr later we got our food ehhh jus a burger not impressed saw some of the Mack bros there on the way out as we paid hostess asked how it was and I said ok actually not good 1/2hr for 2 burgers that sucked and are over priced he over heard and stared me down like he was gonna fight me lol I'll never go back there againGot there at 3:15, appointment was at 3. Yes I'm late, but yes I have a terrible 2 child. Also, started to call the place at 2:45 to tell them I'd be late and ask if they'd still take me. NOBODY answers the phone here. 

Upon arriving, there were three families in the waiting area, after a couple minutes the girl comes out to ring someone up. She greets me an I tell her "I had an appointment at 3".

She says, "we'll it's now 3:20, and you have people in front of you. I'm sorry I'm here by myself and the other photographer is taking the bus to get here. If you want to wait around we will try and squeeze you in".
This was the only day I could take care of these photos. So I decided to wait. All the while seeing families go in and HEARING THE PHONE RING NON-STOP. They definitely need a receptionist , maybe the manager is a cheap turd. But this lady was by herself until 5! Which was when I got seen. Only took about 8 photos of my little one, because my daughter was tired after that point. 

Did get a free sheet of photos , but ultimately not worth the wait.Q: If you have 3 lanes set up for drive through, each of which are designed for 2 ATMs, how many drive through ATMs do you have total? 

A: If you are the Blue Diamond location of Bank of America, the correct answer is 2.Come on Jamba J, give me a mean green juice NOT from concentrate. I am waiting for you to make it fresh!This place just keeps getting worst and worst to me. Not so much the service, but the customers. In the Summer it was great, but now every single time i go in there, it's like the customers don't know how to add as they shop. Every time, i have to wait 10mins for the cashier to ring up 80 things, and another 10 for her to take off 60items, because the customer only has $20. I'm so over having to deal with people that can't count.The thing that annoys me is that, yes there's barely a wait after you sign in, but once they bring you into an exam room, you sit there for 30 mins waiting for the doctor to come look at you for less than 2 mins. Sucha waste of time. All other urgent cares I've been to has a longer wait time in the lobby but once you were called in, the nurses and doctors attend to you right away. 

And honestly, I don't think these doctors care much. They talk so fast you can't even understand them, then they go "bye" and off to the nextStock standard shopping centre.
Nothing really about this Albertsons really stands out, they have your normal run of the mill bakery and meat department. They finally refurbished the lanes and stocked with new items but still has the average stuff.

Starbucks is kinda slow and sometimes the staff isn't even in the booth.I get all my prescriptions here,  only because its close to my house and also on my way to work, iIt is pretty nasty and worn down in there!!! It's dirty and old, hinky people walking all over the place.  I always feel I have to watch my back in there.  The customer service is nill.  They dont have any type of selection.  But, the pharmacy is ok, my meds are always done and ready on time.  Other then that this place is just weird.  Needs a major make over.My bf recommended this place cause he used to go here back when he was in high school, he remembered it being good. 
We came here and I got the milk tea and him the Choco slush. Unfortunately, the bf and I were fairly disappointed because both of them had an incredible powder taste.Autozone and I have a love hate relationship. Here's why. 

1: Pricing. As an example a bottle of Lucas Fuel Injector cleaner is at least $1 higher here than at their competition. 
2: Batteries. Shopping around for a battery netted me a $30 savings over what Autozone wanted to charge. 
3: Quality: Autozone's lifetime brake pads and shoes have just not held up to regular use. Pads purchased from their competition have held up and are quieter. 
4: Service: Quite frankly this location seriously sucks with attitude, slowness, and just plain sloppiness. 
5: Cleanliness. Parts Stores are not bastions of cleanliness but this one is cluttered and dirty compared to other Autozone locations here in Las Vegas. 

In short, sometimes they have what you need at a price that you can't beat. But that's rare. More often than not your best bet is to pick up the phone and call around. You can often times find parts for less elsewhere.Went on a Sunday and the fried chicken and mashed potatoes were highly recommended. I have had better frozen dinners. Dry chicken and flavorless mashed potatoes. The only good thing I had were the fried pickles. Everything else was just blahhhhhhhh.The food was good for bar food, subpar for a gastropub and not what I really expected from Todd English.  Hard to say if its overpriced or not, given the mindwarp that is Vegas, but none of the dishes were outstanding.  I've eaten at Olives (one of Todd's other concepts) and was blown away and expected a similar effort here, that just missed the mark.

The concept itself is a little confusing, gastropub crossed with frat house sounds like it would be right up my alley.  But upon further reflection, I like to keep my meals and beer pong/"7 second beer chug and its free" competitions seperate.  

Not a bad place for a quick and easy meal, but didn't live up to the Todd English expectations that I had.Nothing special and not worth the long drive all the way out there. Myself and another guest had the fish 'n' chips, which tasted like a frozen, breaded piece of fish from a store-bought Highliner box of fish. It certainly was not fresh.

The side of onion rings was huge, but those too seemed as if they were frozen and store-bought, and many of them were burnt and cooked in old fryer oil.

Fries tasted frozen and/or pre-cooked.

The atmosphere was nice and what you'd expect.

It took 3 servers before one would finally take an order, because the first two would say "sure I'll take your order" then "oh! Just a second..." and wander off to another table.

In sum: stay in the city and you'll find better food with a better price and better service.A Storage Locker is just a storage locker.  The only thing that really makes one better than the next is price and customer service.  I made the mistake of not shopping around and when I discovered that Public Storage on Camelback is significantly more than its competitors, I still wasn't motivated to relocate to more reasonable storage until the office staff became increasingly rude.  Paying more is irritating but there was no way I was going to continue to support staff who have no sense of customer satisfaction and basic courtesy.  Clearly they don't realize that the bottom line is that it is the cusomter that pay their salary.  Never again, good riddanceThe good things about this place are the location and the fact the food is decent. This restaurant is located in the Fashion Mall, right in the happening part of the Las Vegas Strip across from the Wynn. The enchiladas that I got were also pretty good.

The only bad things about this place are that it's pricey, and in my opinion you don't really get enough for what you're paying. I understand that the fact that it is on the strip would make it more expensive, but they could at least provide some free chips and salsa. Most other Mexican restaurants do!Vig Uptown

Too many lawyers and 60+ Cougars.
At least the cougars at Vig Arcadia are hot and 30-40.
What can you expect on this side of town though....?This was my second visit to the Vig. The first visit was not a good one, but my arm was twisted, and I agreed to go again. Yeah, still don't like it. The first time I had some ribs, and I had to question what animal the ribs were from! A hamster maybe? It was disturbing. Glad I didn't see them on the menu this time around, The food is overpriced, and average. The chicken kabobs were dry, and when the waitress asked how everything was, I told her, and she agreed. She said she didn't like them either! Nice. My friend ordered her burger medium, and it came out well done. Very well done. I was brought the wrong beer, but said I would drink it anyway. I don't like to waste beer. When the waitress brought me the correct beer, she said I wouldn't be charged for the first one. I was. 

I really don't get all the good reviews. Most of the people I saw weren't even eating.... because they were to busy posing, trying to get the attention of all the other posers! I thought I was in Scottsdale for a minute. Ugh.Ok food- overpriced. Cool  atmosphere.My daughter and I decided to have breakfast out this morning. Big Mistake.
We went to IHop because she loves pancakes and waffles. The restaurant was busy but we were still seated right away.  
Our Server Kate came over promptly to get our drink orders. When she brought our drinks she got our food orders after that it kind of went downhill.
It took 20minutes to get our food (pancakes with face and brioche french toast) shortly after we got our food and after we had ordered a 2nd chocolate milk my daughter tells me she has to use the restroom. (Daughter is 7 ) . When we return from the restroom our table has been bussed and there is someone else sitting there. We were not in the restroom that long. her pancake had not been eaten and I had only finished one piece of my french toast, als0 her 2nd chocolate milk had not been drank.
I went  over to the hostess stand to say something and they were less than helpful.
They did say sorry. I said that the check was still on the table as well as uneaten food
then they handed me  my check. 
I was about to pay the whole tab and I was getting angrier for the lack of reaction from the Manager I told the manager that I did not think I should pay for my daughters
pancakes since she did not get a chance to eat them.
She removed them from the bill and her note on the check was "did not eat".
I'm not sure what I expected but I will not be back.I'm so disappointed in the direction this place has taken... 

When it first opened, it was AMAZING!  Everything we tried was outstanding, the prices were reasonable, the staff was friendly.  I recommended it to everyone and thought I had finally found "my" Thai place.  

...and then they went under new management.  It was all downhill from there.  The service became worse, but what really became bad was the food.  The portion sizes decreased.  The panang curry, which used to be creamy and delicious is now watered-down and over-spiced.  The pad Thai is bland.  The Nam Sod, which used to be my favorite dish, is now watery and doesn't taste fresh as it used to.  They became really inconsistent with their spicing, too.  We used to be able to order hot and know what to expect.  Now if you order hot, you'll either get hardly spiced at all, or so dang hot that you can't eat more than 3 bites.  And we prefer our food spicier than most, so that's saying something.   

This just makes me sad.  I wish the original owners were still there, or at least had given the new management some training before bowing out . I thought I had found "the one" but now I continue my search.What a disappointment.  I had read some good reviews and was looking forward to trying something new.  I love the concept.  Cool nostalgia, and interesting books to look at. However, everything else was not up to par.  We had brought our young child in and were already late getting her some dinner and to bed.  Unfortunately, it took way too long to get our food and get out, even though there were only 4 tables.  The waitress was super sweet, but the other waitress was sitting outside socializing.  Our waitress seemed to have trouble handling the 4 tables.  We waited excessively long for all of the food to arrive, and the order was incorrect.  On top of this, the restroom was untidy and most of all, the food wasn't that great.  I had high hopes for this place, but I've got to give it a thumbs down, we won't be back.After reading the reviews, I should have known better than to expect good ramen but I was still hopeful.  Sadly, I was disappointed.

I ordered the tonkotsu pork belly with an egg traditional style, as well as edamame and gyozas to share.  The appetizers were cooked well and the best part of the meal.  When the huge bowls were ready, I realized that they gave me the modern version of ramen instead of what I ordered.  The sulky girl behind the counter who took my order originally was not what I wanted to deal with again so I went with it.  There was no depth to the broth and the noodles were not ramen noodles as they were soft and kind of slimy.  The store bought packaged kind is better.  Where was the milky broth made rich and unctuous by hours upon hours of slowly simmered pork bones?  This was a poor introduction to ramen for my friend who never had it before.

I couldn't even eat half of it because it was not good and bland.  When we went to get to go containers since I hate to waste food, the same unhelpful girl asked why we needed two...really?Meh. The food was plentiful and relatively inexpensive, but it was also boring. 

I'll never understand how so many Mexican restaurants can make refried beans bland.

I've had much worse, but I've also had much better. It was worth a shot, but I probably won't be back.I love harkins! i have gone to many and only return to this one because it is close to me. Yes the theater might always be nice and clean and not ridiculously crowed but the management is ridiculous. Some crazy girls in front of me and a friend of mine had something up there you know where and kept trying to get us kicked out for literally doing nothing. We may have whispered hear and there but nothing that would disturb the whole movie. The manager need a reason to kick us out so claimed we harassed two girls in the bathroom (like seriously the most ridiculous thing ever) and when i asked him to please review the security footage to see that me and my friend never even went to the bathroom together he declined and asked us to leave. Luckily the assistant manager is the sweetest lady ever and could tell we didn't do anything so she asked the crazy manager is she could handle it and then she brought us to a different room. however this took my mom coming to the theater and screaming at the manager...haven't seen the man there since and hopefully never will again.

additional info: this was the twilight marathon attached to the breaking dawn part 2 premiere. the guy i speak of was around 5'5 and completely bald. If you ever see him run in the opposite direction. evil man.The food is bland and service is suspect (slow)... clientele is senior citizens which I personally don't mind... food is a little expensive given the mediocrity of taste. I have been there twice now, and was underwhelmed both times. Probably wont go back, but if your 55+ you should check it out as you might see some of your buddies....The first time we tried to get this deal was at Rio. Yet, stand in wrong line, automated machine selling regular price rather than this deal, terrible, terrible service there, it was late and unable to change line to purchase this deal. The food was awful there, really awful!!! Absolutely do not go for Rio, perhaps trying Rio seafood better, but additional $15, worth it? Casears palace was limited in choice. Harrah's was decent. Paris, Paris was okd too. One best thing about 24 hrs buffet pass, you don't have to OD on food , stuffs yourself, but spread over period of time and if you dont have to stand in line for these buffets than probably worth it. It was nothing spectacular, just average buffets for the price...Sometime it's better to pay for quality than quantity, good for breakfasts only.I had a groupon for a spa mani/pedi.  The technician was very nice but the services received were NOT impressive and weren't as advertised.  I'm not sure how I receive a  "spa" manicure with a simple filing of my nails.  I can't even imagine spending full price...Wandering around the Strip on a chilly Christmas Eve, I was EXTREMELY hungry and suffering from intense sugar withdrawal. We had just emerged from the arcade in New York New York (not worth it; it will eat all your coins and leave you poor and desolate) when I saw It'Sugar!

I've always had a childhood fondness for old-fashioned candy-stores (i.e any store dedicated to candy), probably stemming from my early love of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. So, of course, I was hooked.

Looking back, the candy was insanely overpriced. I mean, yes, it IS Vegas but.. really? There's no way a handful of gummies should add up to $5. What is this nonsense |:I would have to agree with a lot of the reviews about the service. Really sub standard. Our server was actually very cocky. Really close to annoying and rude.

The Food. 

Pierogis - OK had some caviar on it. 

Flatbread pizza (with Truffle Oil) - decent -thin crust -had a great crust

Scallops - It was borderline BAD!! 

Chicken wings (Thai curry) - The best dish of the night - chicken wings lollipop style covered in curry Thai sauce. Very flavorful

Tuna Tartare-OK 

Chocolate Ravioli - Horrible 

Toffe cake with ice cream - Recommended to us  - i did not think it was that good. 

We did have a great bottle of Pinot  Noir. !!!

Hookah- OK 

Close to three stars but the service was just not up to PAR. 

I doubt if I would be back..This is perhaps a variation of Tex-Mex, but not really Mexican.  Tacos with flour tortillas only?  Or did I miss the corn variant?  And why was the pulled pork stew (carnitas) so very sweet?  No fresh cilantro on the tacos?
Sorry that I don't share the enthusiasm here -- but this is the type of Mexican food they serve for gringos in the US.  And even for this clientele Los Cardos would be sub-par.This aquarium is ok.  I've definitely been to bigger and better ones.  The fact that it's attached to a mall is interesting, but ultimately a big pain in the butt because you not only have to navigate aquarium traffic, but also mall traffic.  On top of that, AZ Mills is a mess.

Sea Life feels like what it is: a privately-owned aquarium franchise that uses mall space.

I probably wouldn't have gone if I didn't have the 2-for-$20 groupon, since the admission is pricey.  The aquarium itself is small and crowded.  There are also "box" seats seemingly randomly strewn throughout, with which my shins are very well acquainted.

They do have a nice sting ray exhibit, with some sharks here & there.  The 360 degree walk-through was nice, but small.  The jellyfish exhibit was a very small tank.  The crustacean room was interesting.  The seahorse exhibit was great (then again, I love seahorses so I'm pretty forgiving).

It felt like I could have seen the majority of these fish in the Rainforest Cafe in the same mall, or even at a tropical fish store.

There are a lot of kids working there.  This isn't a bad thing, but it doesn't make me feel confident in their marine biology experience.  

I left feeling underwhelmed and a bit annoyed.  Unless I get free tickets, I probably won't be going back.If you like to awkwardly stand around and maybe sway to the music, then Surrender is your place to be. 

Also, if you like to be molested by strangers and have sweaty strangers pressed up against you, then Surrender is still your place to be. 

How is this possible? Because Surrender is the land of opposites with nothing in between. On one hand, we have the space by the pool, occupied sparsely on a Saturday night by bottle-service people on beds and random people walking around and talking but no one dancing or apparently enjoying themselves. On the other hand, we have the area around the bar and the "indoor" part where people are packed like sardines trying to dance. I just wanted to dance and Surrender really wasn't conducive to this at all. 

The line looked ridiculous as well and if I had to wait in that line, I'd probably be even more upset. The bar staff was reallllly slow and getting a drink was so arduous I thought about stocking up when I was actually able to order one. Music got sorta repetitive over time. Overall, I'm underwhelmed.In my Vegas experiences, Surrender has been the place where you expect to have a chill good time. Don't get me wrong, you spend as much here on drinks like you would any other club in Vegas. This place is huge but knowing there is XS right next door, it doesn't satisfy the young's craving for a wild night out in the 702. You can have fun at Surrender but I feel like I would rather spend the night at the neighboring Encore club XS. 

Drinks are the same price at XS. Your bottle service looks better at XS. Just go to the club next door, Surrender is Encore Beach Club during the day and it's your best bet to shell your skrills during the day. Skip the night party at Surrender.Surrender's look is similar to XS with an inside/outside club. The vibe at Surrender is standard issue high end Vegas club scene.

DRESSCODE:
Most people were dressed to impress, but there were the few in flip-flops or Converse...so not sure if they're strict on this or not.

MUSIC:
house and hip hop mixed in with house beats. The music was ok, just your basic top 40. 

Drinks are pricey though.. running about $20 for an AMF with tips. And I saw someone paid $8 for a mini Fiji water..Say whaaatt?? Lots of bouncers strolling around keeping the place in check. They don't let you sit down unless you have have bottle service, but I find that silly when there are so many empty tables.A group of us went, and from around the table, it seemed folks enjoyed their food but wasn't necessarily impressed.  Pricey too.  My chopped liver (I know, am I like seventy? I try anything once) reminded me of sweet cat food and the bagel chips were so hard I gave up for fear of my teeth.  Sweet potato fries, ok that rocked.

i was excited about the bakery section though.  The counter guy was great, patient with me while I basically bought a sampling of everything.  The choc babka was unmemorable and extremly crumb-y (what a mess cutting it), but add insult to injury, I go to Luci's Marketplace the next day and find the same babka there for 35% less than what I paid at Chompie's.I have been looking forward to the opening of Primebar since I saw the signage.  I went with a group of friends Fri, June 4 figuring that they would have had enough time to work the kinks out.  Considering the place is owned by a successful restaurant group, Restaurant-America, I assumed the place would be running on all cylinders by then.  Not so much.  
I was actually shocked by the lack of organization and lack of management presence.  Normally at a place this new, SOMEBODY stops by your table to see what you think.  
The dining room was about 75% full but the service was super slow.  Drinks took forever.  In fact one of our drinks (a draught beer mind you) was delivered after our dinners were cleared.  The drink had been ordered when dinner was ordered.  
Three of the items we ordered had issues (mostly missing ingredients).  I understand some mistakes for the first few weeks but what I didn't understand is how the place handled it or didn't handle it as the case may be.  
Our server was made aware of the issues.  And NOBODY ever came to the table to address the situation.  I didn't expect for anything to be taken off the bill but a manager could have come and said something, anything.  
In one instance, a member of our party ordered a margarita which stated "agave nectar" on the menu.  It came to the table clearly missing this ingredient.  When the orderer of the drink asked if it could be a little sweeter (aka more agave nectar), the waitress actually came back with it and said, "The bartender says he made it exactly how he is supposed to and you must just not like it"  Seriously? 
I plan to give it another try in six months or so but I must say, if someone from the management team had just come to the table and said two words to us it probably would have made all the difference.Over-priced and under-cared for, the Sport Center is a memorial to what could have been if Vegas residents used this place or if the owners took care of it.  The building houses a Cross-Fit gym, batting cages, climbing wall and basketball court.  The basketball court is in great condition and is used for basketball camps.  The climbing wall is decent, but there's no marked climbs and the cost is pretty ridiculous ($8 a climb v. $10 a day in another climbing gym).  

I went for the batting cages which have a great set up with a mock field and mock home run background.  However, the machines are old and not maintained well (4 out of every 14 pitches are low or deeply inside).  The batting cage cost is a little high too ($2 for 14 pitches).  This place could be amazing with the fake field and wall, but the poorly maintained machines and bad pitching ruin the place.

All in all, this place is a monument to what could be an amazing local sports place/community center.  Instead, it's just a rundown place with moments of genius.So disappointed, second time I've been here and the service was horrible. We sat for 10 minutes before anyone even came by. The table was so wobbly our water spilled and when we asked to move, our waiter acted like it was such a problem, seriously the place was not even a fourth full. The chocolate pizza was like rubber, when we told the waiter he said what do you want? I told them we were locals and we had been there before and this was the most disappointing outing I had there. Sorry Sugar Factory but I'll be referring my guest to other restaurants on the strip.After seeing all the pictures, I really wanted to come to Sugar Factory and I wanted to enjoy it....but I didn't. 

Coming in for breakfast, I ordered the Eggs Benedict and the Hollandaise sauce was just too overwhelming. It had too much of a buttery cheesy taste that by the time I finished my food (I don't like to waste...and I'm a fatty) I began to feel a little bit sick. They also drench the plate in the sauce instead of an appropriate amount so it is hard to try and take bites with minimal sauce.The eggs were cooked well although I find it difficult to really screw up eggs. 

My gf ordered the classic crepe with berries. This was very underwhelming for me. Having gone to Cafe Crepe, the one here was just not up to snuff. Wish I had a few more berries and a little more love put into making it for the price I pay. 

Though I will say that the menu has MANY items on it and I'm sure if I had ordered maybe the fondue or a dinner item I would have enjoyed it more. Just as a breakfast place I would pass.Sugar Factory is OK.  Sort of a hit or miss for me.

I've had the chicken and waffles and the french dip sandwich.  The sandwich was easily below average, no flavor at all.  The chicken was actually pretty good, the crust was sweet - definitely the highlight of the meal for me.  Waffles were decent, nothing to write home about.  The fries were pretty good, above average.

The specialty drinks are overpriced.  

They use celebrities to market their restaurant = LAME.  If "The Situation" was sitting near me at the restaurant, I would throw my waffles at him.

Food isn't incredibly overpriced, but not cheap either.  I will resist returning for a third time.  

SUMMARY:  Honestly, this restaurant is for your reality-tv-loving girls aged 14 - 23.  A no-go for food.  Better for desert.After having five wonderful experiences with Sugar Factory in Las Vegas, I have to write a negative review. The new chef and existing owners have decided to chop the menu, removing many favorite items, and to stop serving many of the popular breakfast items at 11am. For a Vegas restaurant, this doesn't make much sense. It is clear that the menu is focused on flavor as the existing items are still wonderful, but the changes are not welcome, in my opinion. I found that the owners are changing the name, soon, so perhaps the store isn't working anymore. Sad.It was good for the price. The service can be a hit or miss. I have been there when we were never offered any chips or dessert. The burrito is massive hard to finish for one person. I have had much better in LA and San Francisco. If i was in the area and wanted something cheap i would try it again.I have given Lee's many chances, and far too many disappointments have come my way. I think that I have particularly high standards for them because they are soo much better in California. Their sandwiches are usually sloppy with a lack of/ skimp amount of necessary ingredients such as pate and picked daikon and carrots. Their bobas are inconsistent and not always as soft and plump as they should be, but rather shribbled with a hard center and dripping with boba water residue in my slushes and teas. The slushes are watered down and flavorless. I have taken my out of town friends here to try, and was embarrassed in doing so. I should've known when I tried to order in Vietnamese, not one person understood me because there were no vietnamese workers there. This really doesn't matter to me, but I can certainly see why the sandwiches are not up to par with my cravings for authenticity. I'd rather go to hue thai for the best sandwiches.This place is tiny. It has basically 3 different types of ramen and you pick and choose your toppings. It is very unique for Vegas and it is what  typical ramen house is. I guess since I am not crazy for ramen, I just thought it was OHKAY. I had the miso ramen with kimchee and corn, because when it comes out it comes out bland. They give you 2 tiny pieces of pork, and it looks very fatty. The ramen noodles were good and seemed fresh. The soup is hearty. The noodles in the tonkatsu ramen are thin and look different.This is probably the most popular ramen restaurant near Las Vegas area because we had to wait about 1 hour just to get in. Restaurant was pretty small and service was okay.  

Miso ramen with extra chashu porks and nitamago ($7.25 + $2.5 + $1.5) - The miso broth was a bit salty, but at least there was some flavor. Nitamago (flavored egg) was actually pretty good. Chashu porks had a good texture, but tasted a bit salty. I do like their wavy noodle, pretty chewy. 

This place probably won't be this popular if it opens up around the Los Angeles area because there are too many great ramen restaurants. Overall - noodle wasn't too bad, but broth was definitely a bit salty.HOT! Not sure if their air conditioner is normally off, but it was 94 degrees inside! Hot room with hot ramen is not a good combination. 

The noodles my husband got were salty. Mine were...ehh. I could have done better with a cheap pack of noodles at home and a few eggs.

For $42, not worth it- just for NOODLES!We took a spontaneous trip to Vegas this past Easter weekend and after seeing the beautiful pictures of Rumor (and after finding out it was about $80/night for the champagne special), we decided to book a couple of nights there. We've never stayed off the strip before, so we thought this would be a good time to try something new. Besides, we've stayed at boutique hotels in other cities and have always loved them!

Well, or so we thought... Rumor is beautiful. The decor and furniture alone are worth the 5 stars, but that's about where it ends..

Our room was at the very corner of the resort and wasn't the room we had requested. They told us they were fully booked and to check in the next day to see if more would be available. However, from the time we checked in to the time we checked out, we barely saw any guests there.

Numerous things about our room wasn't working either. The phone, for starters, was missing the plug to actually BE plugged in. The iron and the outlet in the bathroom weren't working either. Little things, but they really started to get annoying after a while. The hotel also does not have a fridge or coffee maker, which is kind of a bummer.

So, skip this hotel and find something better on the strip.This review is on the bánh mi (Vietnamese sandwich). I ordered the pork sandwich. It was just average. Nothing great but nothing bad either. I haven't had one yet as good as in Vietnam but I'm looking. If I return, I wouldn't get the sandwich next time.What an amazing world we live in. We can cure diseases, put men in space, and pack literally thousands of songs onto one little MP3 player - but we can't make a better DMV.

I came in here a few months ago because I had to have a duplicate license made, since mine had gone missing. I thought this was going to be a quick procedure with no major flaws.

But once I got up to the counter, the woman who was waiting on me (a middle-aged red-haired woman) was extremely pretentious and rude, and contradicted information explicitly stated on the DMV web site. The site said you needed a state-issue picture ID and one of another form of ID. I had a Social Security card, which was one of said forms of ID. I brought EVERYTHING the web site had asked me to. And she said it wasn't good enough.

She started bitching at me, even though I explained that this was exactly what the website said. The customer is always right, you pretentious jerk. Apparently you didn't learn that when you went through customer service training - if you went through it at all. Eventually I was able to find sufficient ID in my wallet, but this woman was extremely rude all the while. If you're working at the DMV, you damn well better know what the website says, and uphold it. Just because you chose to work in a job with rude customers doesn't give you the right to be rude to me.

The facility itself is actually very nice and quite large, however even so it STILL manages to get overcrowded, and wait times for things like this are unbearable. I thought getting my duplicate license made would be a pretty painless procedure, and I'd be out of there in an hour, hour-and-a-half tops. It took OVER THREE HOURS. 

The parking is terrible, it is clear whoever invented this facility didn't know that LOTS of people go to a DMV. It isn't uncommon, as a result, to have cars illegally parked on the street. Furthermore, other neighboring shopping centers have begun putting up "parking for customers only" signs, so that is looking to be less of an option. It looks like construction has begun on another parking lot, but we'll see what happens.

Another annoyance is that you no longer get your renewed/duplicate license/permit during your visit - they have to mail it to you now. I liked being able to leave with my license in my pocket. Why change something that wasn't broken in the first place? 

This place either needs to be expanded or another DMV needs to be built in Henderson. And the bitchy woman that waited on me needs to be fired. Enough said.I've been here a few times and each time it's really a hit or miss. Sometimes my nails come out amazing and other times they come out horrid, and those times they come out bad, no one wants to fix it. They have a HUGE gel color selection and a bunch of different designs to pick from, so I'll give them that. 
The downside is that this place is always packed. If you're going to walk in without an appointment, good luck. The people at the front desk are rude. I get that you're busy, but COME ON! Some customer service won't kill you. Prices are average, but can get pretty pricey depending on what you get. Lastly, you WILL feel rushed. They just want to get you in and on to the next. I have gotten 3D designs here almost every time, and each time the nail tech always tries to talk me out of what I want. They only want to do one finger and always try to get away doing a half ass job and when I tell them that's not what I wanted, they roll their eyes and mumble something to their neighbor.Maybe it's my age or the fact that our group was seated next to a group of people that looked like they stepped out of the TV show Amish Mafia that had BO so bad that we asked to be moved, but this show was terrible! A times I found the performances so awkward I wanted to cover my face. 

The Marilyn Monroe impersonator also doubled as Shania Twain, which I found hilarious after I finally realized (kudos to her for tricking us). The Tina Turner and Michael Jackson acts really did bring it home though, they kicked butt! The Elvis impersonator was so awful, he was shimmying, thrusting around, I wasn't sure if it was part of the act or if he was seizing.

Like I said at the beginning, it may be my age because the oldsters in the crowd really enjoyed themselves, just ate it up! So my recommendation is, if you aren't a current member of AARP, don't bother.The tram project in Edinburgh! Most people think they will be a good idea, however almost everybody cannot stand the annoyance and delays surrounding the works. 

The tram line is supposed to go from the airport to Leith. However, after only a couple of years, work is slow and progress is at a snail's pace. Last year Princes Street changed remarkably due to the noisy works blocking off cars and buses from the street. Indeed, the west end of the city seems to be undergoing constant works every time you pass it. 

I'm sure the trams will be brilliant when they are finished, and Edinburgh will have caught up with other European cities. However one does feel that the money could have been used to improve the already great bus service. I'm sure when they are finished, we will all like the tram system but that I am sure is a long way away.Disappointing , because of the other high reviews I wanted to give this place a try. chicken strips were teeny tiny , the baked chicken strips were flavorful but the fried had a really weird flavor, friendly service and cool drink machine. Wouldn't recommendPros: 
- Easy to make money if you lack a college education.
- A tourist economy that permits upward mobility among lower classes via tips. Also, it has become standard decorum in Vegas to tip in industries in that are not perceived as tip-worthy elsewhere (e.g., nail salons, car washes).
- Kitschy architecture and art that is unique to Vegas. 
- Affordable houses and townhouses. 
- Less racial tension than other larger cities.
- FREE PARKING EVERYWHERE!!! Parking lots are abundant, rarely do you ever have to park on the street, and parking lots are always free. 
- Cool place if you like to gamble and party.
- A truly 24 hour city - you can do your grocery shopping, hit the gym, or go out to dinner 24/7. 
- The winters aren't warm (it's a desert, not the coast), but snow in the winter is never an issue. 
- Never humid, with a little extra conditioner you can get your hair to do whatever the hell you want it to and never have to worry about it going flat or frizzy.
- Amazing shopping (think Chanel rather than Intermix). 
- Fine dining epicenter (housed in casinos only). 

Cons: 
- The women in Vegas are vacuous, uneducated, with bad style. Frosted pink lipstick, huge fake boobs, haggard ex-druggie face, baby-T's and distressed denim, and lots of sweat. I feel like I'm in an eighties porno. 
- Incestuous social circles. 
- No locally grown food, and the stuff that is grown here isn't organic (or particularly nutritious since there is no decent soil in the valley). Consequently, the food off the strip is prepared with ingredients that are shipped in from California. These ingredients are picked before they are sufficiently ripened, treated with chemicals to artificially induce ripeness, and therein lies the reason why food in Vegas is tasteless and the flavors are so muted. 
- Limited things to do if you don't drink, gamble, or go to clubs. This means that if you are under 21, you are at home getting high and playing video games (I know I was). 
- No cultural innovation, since anyone remotely talented or creative moves somewhere else. No available jobs for creative professionals. 
- Commuter university that doesn't lend itself to the establishment of a college town culture. 
- One of the highest high school drop out rates in the nation.
- One of the least responsive media markets in the nation. You will never see a film being released here that isn't being released in at least 100 other cities. 
- Highest teen pregnancy rate in the nation, a result of the insidious but ever-present religious power complex that exists in this city, constantly wielding its power to crush anything progressive or reasonable (like planned parenthood). 
- Lesbian community rife w/ gnarly uneducated women in cowboy hats or catty pseudo-hipster college students. 
- Huge population of people with limited or no education occupying high paying professions, meaning that the people operating this city are dumb as rocks. 
- Limited mental health care facilities, which translates into having a substantial percentage of the local population self-medicated and driving drunk 24 hours a day (hence the astronomical DUI rates).
- One of the highest domestic abuse rates in the nation. Conjoin a bustling drug trade, the 24 hour availability of liquor, and underscore it all with a cultural milieu that hates women (ala conservative religious and androcentric sex trade gender politics), and you get sky high domestic abuse rates. 
- The city attracts people who can't successfully live anywhere else, whether its due to their disaffecting personality, addictive behavior, or delusional relationship with reality. 
- It's a small town masquerading as a big city. People move here because they think the valley is the Strip, when in actuality, if you're not on the Strip, you're essentially in a strip mall somewhere in Arkansas.
- Downtown gentrification projects and new high rise developments are elitist, the cost of which prohibit young, creative, and innovative people from affording them. 
- All apartments have carpeted floors. Like I really want to live on a pile of fabric that has been lived on by innumerable other people that is impossible to sanitize. 
- The men in Vegas fall into one of three categories. A) a tourist who wants to get drunk and fuck, B) local who wants to get drunk and fuck, and then go home to his unknowing wife, C) Las Vegas native with severe addiction/mommy/daddy issues.
- Inconvenient public trans, grid system city planning, no "green" spaces, recycling services that don't serve apartments.
- Post-segregation town; segregation was an irrefutable social scourge, but it encouraged the development of rich cultural enclaves (e.g., Little Tokyo, Little Italy, etc.). Vegas lacks these rich cultural hotspots.Food wasn't bad... I've been in there three times now.  Love having a good breakfast place on Mill.  So why only 2 stars?  SLOWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW.  The last two times I went, it was incredible how long everything took.  And while it wasn't insanely busy, the staff were literally running around... sometimes carrying full plates!?  Waited about 20 minutes after sitting down to get that "Has anybody helped you yet?", and then it took well over an hour to get any food.  If they would just tell you at the front counter that the wait was over an hour, I'd be fine with that.  Pretty much exact same experience 2 times in a row, but like I said I'm a sucker for a breakfast joint.  Maybe 3rd time is the charm?This place was okay. So forgettable that I'll make this very short.

Bad service, understaffed, etc.
Sushi was just okay. Ingredients were lacking.
Expensive for what it is.

Yeah, forgettable.I am sorry but this place gives you way too much food and I don't like the vibe of the restaurant. The employee didn't speak English and didn't know what to say to me. I tried my best to make him understand but I totally got the wrong food. I did not care but he was annoyed I wasn't eating it. He gave me a dirty look and I was very annoyed as well. I don't think I will be going back......Oh, I wanted to love this place! I really did. Phoenix NEEDS cupcakes, desserts, pastries, etc! I was very underwhelmed. 

The Key Lime cupcake was the best of the lot. I'm a sucker for key lime, but that's this cupcake's saving grace. The flavor was very subtle, and this is a trend with all the cupcakes. 

The Lemon cupcake was very much lacking in flavor. Even more subtle than the Key Lime. 

One good thing are the cakes themselves; at least they're moist. And the ratio of frosting to cake is spot on. However the flavors are not quite what I was expected, especially given how much each cupcake cost. 

I'll probably try this place again sometime next year, if they're still in business. Maybe there will be a tastier batch of cupcakes! As for now I'm going to pass. 

On a side note, the ladies behind the counter were in fact very kind and personable.While I can't review actual work, I can review my initial impression from a first visit.  He responded quickly, but Artie dismissed my plumbing issue and recommended I get a shower curtain that suctions to the tub (at least the visit was free, so I didn't have to pay for that awesome advice).  

I'm not just a dumb girl and I had considered that was the problem, but I had called him based on Yelp reviews after I realized it was a much bigger issue and simply felt like he didn't listen to my concerns - unfortunately for him because it indeed WAS a big issue and he missed out!  It took three plumbers until I found someone with enough knowledge and motivation to find and fix my issues.  I recommend DrainPro!Old school fun... good bar staff...cheap drinks...fun!  As for the Tommy Wind show...horrendous...so bad and so bad I couldnt even laugh but rather I was sad for him.  Dont go to see it, it will only encourage bad magic!Okay, so I had mentioned in my 1st review of this place that we would give it a 2nd chance... We still giving them just 2 stars. We went on a Fri night...pretty busy. Decided to eat outside on their patio which was pretty full of people...They we short-staffed on this night. The waiter was nice but always in a hurry to run off & even ignored us a few times when we tried to get his attention. We both ordered red wine....The glass was only about 1/3 full & paid like $8 a glass! ...I can get a 1.5 liter of wine at thestore for this price. We got a greek salad & a margeurita pizza...Pretty good, but nothing extraordinary...Oregano's has them beat by far! We will most likely not come again to BRICK....Oregano's Rocks!I'd been scoping out this truck at food events for quite some time and was excited to finally give it a try last night at Streats. It is such an ingenious idea to turn an old fire truck into a pizza making machine! I especially love when they make it "breathe fire." Unfortunately, I realized why there are rarely any lines at this truck, the pizza was a huge let down. I had a slice of the pepperoni and sausage since it was what they had available at the moment. The pizza was dripping grease, which isn't always a bad sign, so I folded it in half and took a bite. I didn't taste a thing, not the sauce or the pepperoni or the sausage. This can't be I thought, so I took another bite, willing my taste-buds to try harder. Nothing but a greasy, bland mess. As I kept trying bite after bite it became apparent that the pizza is pretty much flavorless. At $4 a slice, I expected that they would be buying quality ingredients, but it was obvious that they were not. Maybe they are buying gas for the truck?I ordered a Asada Quesadilla. I got a very small quesadilla. No salsa available. Was not fresh and who knows what kind of meat that was. I don't know, but it tasted awful and certainly wasn't steak. I don't know what qualifies them to be a Mexican restaurant, but I was not impressed. Your best tip will be to skip this place.not a fan.  the food was meh, the service was horrible.  went there for lunch today with a small group, ordered an appetizer for all to share and each ordered an individual dish.  i also ordered an ice tea - they were out.  i believe this has to be a first for a thai place.  

one of our dishes came out about 15 minutes of waiting, still no appetizer.  finally after about  30-40 minutes the appetizer came out followed by the other two dishes spaced out about 5 minutes apart.  ???  lunch took  about 1 1/2 hours and the taste wasn't worth the time it would take at panda.  f this place.  don't go.actually 2.5 stars, and that is to say, nothing memorable.  I  read tons of reviews on this place and wanted to love it.  Unfortunately from food to service, it just didn't deliver.  Save the spring vegetable spaetzle, nothing was good.  Here's what we had...

the acclaimed cheddar bacon biscuits - positively overcooked.  The outsides weren't just crunchy; they were rock hard.  The insides were dry and flavorless.

the zucchini pancakes - tasty but undercooked and greasy.

b burger - though ordered well done, it came medium.  I know some foodies think well-done is gauche, but that's what my mom wants, that's what she orders so just deal with it and bring her what she wants.  And don't act all pissy about it when she sends it back.  

vegetable chopped salad - such promise on the menu that fails to impress on the plate.  As other reviewers have said, it's an amateur salad and utterly lacking flavor or originality.  

grilled salmon with panzanella - salmon was well-cooked but nothing special.  The panzanella salad was an interesting twist that just didn't work for anyone at the table - cornbread croutons that failed to absorb any flavors.  frankly the panzanella flavors just didn't mesh.  you were eating croutons, cucumbers, tomato, and some dressing.    

my glass of Pickett Fence pinot noir tasted like the bottle had been sitting open for a couple days.  

my other comments about the food are get over the bacon in everything and use the raw corn sparingly.  Sometimes it just doesn't work and frankly gets boring when one or the other is in so many dishes on the menu.

Lastly service was poor.  The aforementioned b burger was sent back to be refired.  Should that take 20 minutes?  Certainly not when the restaurant is just gearing up for the peak hours... Beyond that, our server was unattentive and mistakenly laboring under the idea that he was charming.  This is a nitpick, but if I hand you my credit card with the bill, you should probably hand it back to me when you're done not to my Dad.  Pay attention just a bit.  

With so many new, fun places to try in Phoenix these days, we won't be back.  Blah, trying to hard to be hip, and just not that good.  Doesn't hold a candle to FnB.The dessert was wonderful - some rhubarb thing with ice-cream.  The food :-|On paper Wurstle Gourmet Sausages is an interesting hot dog/sausage concept, but as a business this so called "evolution of a hot dog" is poorly executed.  The idea is not that novel either, as there are other versions that exactly mirrors the offering here (Puka Dog as mentioned by a few other reviewers) or have sausage/hot dog baked into freshly made bread dough (the kind you may see in many Taiwanese bakeries).

The location is good, very convenient for the shoppers, especially if the younglings are in toll, when hunger strikes.  Which was the main reason I decided to give them a try.  Uhh no, I don't have kids or was babysitting one at the time.  Anyway... Getting back on track, the menu with pictures to help customers make their ordering decision is effective.  If you see what you like you can order it, even if you can't read or speak English.  I totally appreciate picture menus.  Just point and like magic, you get what you pointed at, usually.

So what they offer are a selection of 6 sausages (not counting their Breakfast Minis, and 2 kid sizes and flavors for a lower price), on choice of 3 bread options, and 4 "toppings" that are crammed down the hole made in the bread.  Price tag is $5.69 pre-tax.  Besides their main attractions, they also have desserts (Nutella filled Puffs and Mini Cupcakes), fries and chips, and some beverages.  If you are vegetarian, they have a vegetarian option too (asparagus, onions, spicy ketchup, relish & mayo mustard).

The sausages alone is decent, at least the flavors that I tried.  But I would not call it gourmet by any means.  The so called toppings are very pedestrian as well.  Even Costco Food Courts offer these same flavor enhancers at their self serve stations.  About the only gourmet anything is what comes with the Vegetarian Dog, if you considered spicy ketchup and mayo mustard gourmet.  The breads are generic like the options at Quiznos, without the toasting on their conveyer belt system.

For what they are charging, I don't really think it is going to score high marks on anybody's value to price ratio. Without any more interesting and unique sauces in the condiments arsenal, the urge to return and try something else you have yet to try is very low.  Since this is not Disneyland and considering that there are many better options and superior values at other venues within walking distance, you can pretty much figure out why there are no long lines here.

On the bright side, the only employee that was working at the time when I went was very courteous and friendly, and did her best to hold down the fort singlehandedly.

Review #8 of 2014Man, I guess I just don't get it. I've tried this place twice now, and was unimpressed both times. I really don't understand the excitement over this place.

Just another example of how Eastern transplants to the Phoenix area clamor for anything from "BACK HOME." Plus, this place is way too expensive for an "Order at the Counter" burger joint.

Went in last time with a buddy: 2 REG burgers, 1 REG order of fries to split, NO DRINKS - $17.02 WOW! Not to mention (but I will), that it took over 15 minutes to get my order, when this place was nearly empty!!!

The burger was bland and overcooked. The bacon was burnt and crumbled, not even in strips, but looked like somebody just put some charred bac-o-bits on it. High marks for the freshness of the toppings, but so what. After all, it's not called "5 Guys Toppings," is it.

And the fries couldn't be worse if you were actually trying to make them BAD. Just a bland, greasy mess. Yuck.

Maybe, if somebody offers to buy me lunch and insists on 5 Guys, I'll give them another shot. Otherwise; NO WAY!We went to Laziza after work for happy hour and it was disappointing, we ordered most of the appetizers, some drinks and a hookah. Of all the appetizers the hummus was the best but everything else was just bland. The service was ok when we actually saw our waiter. 

For a Hookah lounge I was expecting something a little more intimate and comfortable. I won't be going back to this place again.Not impressed. Had the chicken satay after 2 recommendations from the servers...it was bland and tasted mostly like peanut butter. The portion was small, and I finished it in a few minutes. I didn't think it was worth it, and it was a free meal. I couldn't imagine paying the full price of $22 and being happy!Grab & go? Paid for then stood around ten minutes waiting for a dark brown, crunchy crusted pie that was about 30 seconds from being burned. Good quantity of ingredients though. I'll probably give them another shot.I'd had much better.  My dover sole tasted like a buttered heart attack on the plate.  I could feel all the butter slowly creep down my innards as the night went by.  Don't order the dover sole - it's horrible...

Sitting outside and hearing the waterfall is a nice experience.  It's very romantic and they have a light show when it gets dark every hour?  But show gets boring after a few minutes.

There are better restaurants to eat at inside Encore/Wynn such as Sinatra's.My mother read about this place in the New Times so she was excited to try this place out with me.

We came in on a Sunday late morning and the place was packed. We lucked out though as someone was leaving right when we came in so a table wait was nonexistent. The place is small (with a "patio" sorta), we chose to eat inside. 

It took about 10 minutes before we were greeted by our waitress. My mother tried to ask for 1/2 grapefruit juice and 1/2 orange as her drink, the waitress glared at my mom like she was from outer space. I was pissed about her behavior after she walked off without another word but she seemed to come back a few minutes later with a MUCH better attitude that she held on to for the rest of our service. But at the start, she was a total bunt (replace that with a "c"...)

Our breakfast was blah. No flavor, no fun, no creativity. We were super excited to try the sweet potato tots and these were the biggest disappointment. They were dry, tasteless, hard. I rarely have the willpower to say no to a carb-not only did I say no to these, it was a HELL NO. 

Last time I believe a New Times food review. Come here for some eye rolls and bland food. 

PS-Perhaps the owners should establish a "complaint section" away from customer's ears as it's not super impressive to complain about diners-especially when they can see/hear you.I'm not sure what the hype is about. Having experienced the Gourmet Burger craze in both LA and Dallas maybe my expectations are just too high. Their "Gold Standard" burger has been touted as the best in Vegas... this has to be a joke. The mix of flavors were not balanced well. The goat cheese did not compliment the beef in any way. The ingredients were of good quality but not what I would expect for the price point. 

In general I would say everything on the menu was quite overpriced (even by Vegas standards). This is where Holsteins really fell short for me. I've had $10 burgers that blow this one away. Not to be super whiny but on top of the food not meeting my expectations  the service was a bit slow and my burger was slightly overcooked. Nothing egregious, but I would feel remiss to not point it out here. We tried the Lobster Mac & Cheese appetizer to start and I can't help but compare it to the Lobster Mac at The Capital Grille which is of better quality, a larger portion and actually cheaper than Holsteins. Even the steak fries were uninspired and blah. 

Overall I was disappointed at every turn by this place. The food was acceptable and I won't say it was a bad meal but it does not live up to the bar they have set for themselves. I would not go back. Save your money and go to one of the many other great restaurants in Las Vegas.This was the new place to try in South Point, last time we were there we didn't have time to try it. This time we made sure we tried their food. We ordered a butterfinger shake in their take out line. The shake didn't taste like it was made of ice cream. It tasted like water based soft serve. Nothing like the butterfinger shakes at Sonic's, which are creamy. It had plenty of butterfinger chunks and the whipped cream was tasty. 

After we returned to our room we realized we wanted to try their food too. We were a large group of 12 and the line at Steak 'n Shake was very long. We choose to order take out and eat it in our rooms. Many ordered the burgers, I had chili cheese fries. The fries are shoe string cut which are not ideal for chili fries. The chili was bland, you didn't taste the spices most chili's have. the cheese was nacho cheese and it easily over powered everything. It felt like i was having just cheese. 

I would like to try their burgers next time, it is usually busy so I enjoyed the had the take out option.Free mac and cheese if you check in! but it's not that good..
the burgers were alright. nothing special, esp not for that price. 
garlic and parmesan fries are literally just fries with garlic and parmasan flakes on top. in and out's fries are better.. and it's about 10x cheaper. 
service was good though, so i guess that's a plus.Food is just ok. Place is nice but the quality of food is no where near Kabuki which is very similar in style and price range.
Don't even try the seaweed or squid salad, they came from Costco, and you can get 20 times more for the same price (you can fine the exact ones in the salad section in San Tan Costco).  With this you can pretty much the originality and quality of other foods. 
Guess there is no other choice around the area and people would just go there, but if you truly love sushi there are a lot better place with better price just a few miles away.I thought most all the food was awful. Definitely not worth the money. Much of it tasted over salted or just not fresh...like it was sitting out too long. Would definitely not go back.China Poblano is an Asian/Mexican fusion restaurant that has good intentions but I think misses the mark on communicating their vision and does not get you good bang for your buck.  

I went here for brunch, as the Cosmopolitan is limited on breakfast options.  The group I went with was also not very familiar with the fusion concept.  When we were looking through the menu, many of them were confused because the menu wasnt clearly communicating what was a "traditional" asian item, "traditional" mexican item & "fusion" item.  They also didn't have a good enough description as to what was in a taco, on a tortilla or what was a soup/ceviche on their brunch menu.  Most of my party had no idea what they ordered until it arrived.

I thought it was too expensive for what you got.  First, chips, guacamole, salsa were all extra costs.  Our salsa literally looked like a splash of salsa in the bowl.  If you're going to charge me for it, it better be a bowl of salsa.  Many of the items were about $5-$10 and you literally got (1) taco with no sides of beans or rice.  You would have to spend about $20 each to get a decent meal.

I got the chilaquiles, which are normally my favorite brunch item.  When they arrived, it was not what I qualify as a good chilaquiles.  The chips barely had any sauce on them, it was too cheesy and chorizo was just plopped down on top of it.  I basically had chili cheese nachos and was disappointed.Really really really wanted to love this. I came in with high expectations, especially because I am a fan of Jose Andres's style. He is creative and has a vision that is unique in the restaurant world. The kitchen needs to see his same vision. 

The layout of the restaurant is stunning. Two bars upon entry (left and right) and your in direct sight of the dimsum preparation and steamers. There are creative cocktails to choose from, & the bar has an embedded part of the design to hold a spoon...then dissapointment began. 
Without being longwinded,  Salty! Over priced! Really dissapointing! 

This was the order: Viva China* soft beef tendon/ Kumamoto oysters/scallions/ Sichuan peppercorn sauce -- it was one tiny taco, this was my only tasty thing but the price was a serious turn off for the size. Pescado Frito fried fish/ ancho chile pickled onions taco-- again just OKAY, doesn't justify the cost. Beef 6pc beef/lime/ daikon/ watermelon radish --DIMSUM, I've had better. AND the clincher Shrimp Mojo 8 pc shrimp/sweet black garlic/roasted poblano peppers--Salty

I don't know if the kitchen was off that day but I rarely send things back and the salt content was so powerful we just had to say something. We got the dish made fresh again and sad to say, nothing changed.

Our bill was approximately $110 and it left us starved for a second meal that wasn't going to leave us with high blood pressure. I understand that good quality will justify higher priced cuisine but these portion sizes were abnoxious. They should even slightly up the price and give us two tacos instead! Eating with your eyes is the first step to the dining experience and that left us hungry. 

I will definitely continue to visit Jose Andres's other projects but will stay away from China Poblano in the Cosmo when Blue Ribbon sushi satisfies me a lot more in the same price range!!There are night clubs and there is Marquee the night club. 

A really nice lobby and stuff but this night poor execution. We have table service but it like we have to wait over an hour just to talk to the man handling reservations.  

So yeah after that it was time to jet!I don't know what the fuss about this place is about...

We waited 1.5 hours for a couple slices of pizza. The line wasn't even long at all. We were maybe 15 people deep. This place is just extremely inefficiently set up. The guys are jumping around everywhere to grab a pizza, grab toppings, throw it in the oven, grab parmesan, etc...

The pizza itself was decent but waiting 1.5 hours for 2 slices...Have the people who rave about this place never had pizza before or are they plain drunk? This place is about as standard as pizza gets. Sure, it is not bad, but there is nothing going on here that sets it apart from other competent pizza joints. In the same building, a couple dozen yards away, you find excellent Neapolitan pizza at DOCG. It is a more expensive, but on another realm when it comes to satisfying your taste buds. If you are drunk in the Cosmo and need nourishment, this is not a bad bet. If not, there are plenty of better options.Sub par pizza. Go here for drunk munchies only or you wont enjoy it. It is extremely pricey.  For a large pie with 3 toppings, it was roughly 30 or so. Also the pizza was dry, and if we didn't call ahead the  wait would have been extremely long. Weak pizzaSaying the sushi here is overpriced is an understatement. Especially in a town that has plenty of great local sushi places. Service was a tad overbearing. Asked the waiter to give us something different, he brought us california rolls with real crab. Meh.So I don't know how we got to our table because our host never said a word to us! LOL Then he turned out to be our serve and thank goodness he finally said something then. I started out with a Bloody Mary which was delicious and spicy but no olives or pepperoni like one of the other reviews said! I had the omelet which was OK and I say that because for the price I felt we should have been able to select whatever we wanted in our omelet and unfortunately for me my 3 items for $16 didn't hit the spot.  Their potatoes side dish was awesome though if you like garlic which I do! Honestly for what they served I would have liked Denny's much much much better. Oh and it came with toast and 3 different jams but it was this nasty hard wheat bread! Gross, but I'm sorry but when its late at night I just want some delicious soft white bread. However, considering where they are located (Cosmopolitan) their prices were pretty reasonable ( 2 omelets and a bloody Mary for about $60 not including tip). After all the places I have eaten in Vegas, this is my least favorite! The service was unfriendly and the food was sub par at best.Two $$?  Not!  Try $$$$-$$$$$

Overrated.Food was great in theory, but don't expect any dietary restrictions you have to be competently accommodated. Example: can't eat most grains, so ask for the shrimp on the salad to be grilled (rather than battered and fried), and the avocado not to be on toast. Shrimp grilled, but avocado appears mashed and spread on toast AND the server failed to mention that the fennel on the salad is also battered and fried. This silliness happened after I had already asked about tweaking two other items to be to accommodate dietary restrictions, and was told that everything is "made fresh" except for, apparently, those other two items.

This appears to be part-and-parcel of the service problems referred to by other reviewers; our service was also extraordinarily SLOW. One member of our party waited 10 minutes for his food after the rest had been delivered. 

To top it off, I'm not really sure what the restaurant is doing having the gardener moving around whatever buckets and cloths and chemicals/pesticides he's using in the immediate vicinity of actively eating tables. It's not like the place is open for breakfast during the week, couldn't the owners have scheduled plant maintenance for a morning?Have been here 4 times and the first 3 times it was great then the last time we took some friends in from out of town and one of them ordered a mandarin orange salad. When she got her plate and started eating, the orange tasted bad. I took a bite out of it and yes, it was rotten. She returned the plate and a new one was brought to her but our server stated that when she took it in the back another server and the cook tasted it and it was just fine. I have opened a can of mandarin oranges before and out of the can I have experienced a rotten one in the can which could have been this problem but they cannot judge another one over the one we tasted. I am a cook and know when one is bad, and the one we tasted was BAD. For that we have not returned in a month and I was going there every week. Besides all this we were charged for this salad and most nice restaurants will not charge for something like this as our friend lost her appetite and did not even take her salad to go.The rooms, beds and building are comfortable and clean and we would have had a great experience were it not for the stupid Air Conditioning switching off all night long. The thermostat was on some sort of motion sensor and as soon as we fell asleep it would shut off and let the room get up to 78 degrees or so. My wife and I woke up numerous times in the night and had to walk over to the thermostat to re-set it. Tried calling the front desk at 2AM and got no help. We used Priceline and were put in a handicap accessible room, maybe that had something to do with it but still was frustrating. 
Mentioned it at check out and didn't get any help or sympathy either. We would have had a great experience were it not from this, but waking up several times in the night because your room is too hot kind of ruins an otherwise good experience. 
The hot breakfast was average to above average. Family friendly.I had lunch here September 10, 2013.  I ordered a fish taco, rolled chicken tacos and something that looks like a gordita.

The fish taco arrived at my table cold.  I know what you're going to say, "send it back" but I was hungry and from what I've seen in the past sending food back usually gets you a food with something "extra", like a booger.  Plus, food during a lunch rush should come out fresh and HOT.  If it had been warm it would have only been okay.

The chicken tacos had a tough tortilla shell and the meat inside was also tough to chew.  The chicken didn't have any seasoning or flavor to it.

The "gordita" is covered with black beans, meat and some cheese.  It was warm and okay but was rather bland for my tastes.I took my 2006 Chevy Cobalt in for an oil change this morning (I scheduled an appointment over the phone yesterday). The guy at the desk was friendly and after about 10 minutes, one of the mechanics started working on my car. 

My car has around 122,000 miles so I was expecting them to tell me I needed SOMETHING fixed - turns out, one of my front brake pads and rotors needs replaced. I asked for a written estimate and they gave me one, no problem. When I asked if my car would be safe to drive for a week or two, the guy didn't give me a definite answer - he just said I'd hear squealing. I wasn't expecting him to tell me EXACTLY how many miles my brake pad will last but some idea would have been nice. 

I went in for a regular oil change and that's exactly what I got. For $26.95 (that's WITH a coupon), I hoped they would check the fluids or at least my tire pressure but no. 

Overall, it's a nice enough shop considering it's in San Tan Valley but I'm used to getting a bit more with an almost $30 oil change, that's all.Being a fan of Count Kustoms, my husband & I decided to visit Count Vamp'd. I'm sad to report that we were very disappointed. No one greeted us or was anyone in sight. We actually had to walk inside to flag someone down.  We had to wait for about 30min for our food. Fortunately, they redeemed themselves, because the food was very good & worth the price. Waitress was pleasant but would have been nicer to have that awesome experience from the get go. Such a high profile place, but not standing up to the expectations of us fans. I wish it could have been better.The good:  great music - great cars - a fun place to hang out with friends. 
The bad:  horrible service - severely understaffed and apathetic:  We waited an hour for our waitress to NEVER take our order.  Finally went to the bar and ordered.  They confused our order and we only received part of it.  The worst problem:  when I tried to pay my tab, the waitresses ignored me (not just 1 but 3 waitresses and one man which I assume was a manager).  I waited over 30 minutes at the bar asking staff continuously for my check (they were holding my credit card).  They would just look at me, ignore me, then walk off. This is unforgivable.  I won't be back.Well, on the plus side this is a  Jewish deli near me that's open 24 hours a day. It's hard to find chopped liver, tongue and rugelach after midnight! 
Once, I had the corned beef, and it was good, even served with some coriander spice. Another time, my corned beef was served cold (definite no no) with tomato (gasp!). They asked me if I wanted it toasted. I said no, thinking it would be steamed like all good corned beef and pastrami sandwiches served in delis. I don't want my bread or bagels to be like toast!
Needless to say, I don't take kindly to cold corned beef, and this yid certainly doesn't eat it with a tomato. The matzo ball soup is questionable as well. You start off thinking, ehh this is not bad, but by the end of the bowl, you doubt your order. The small chicken chunks look like something out of a Campbell's can, and you wonder whether this is bouillon or canned soup with a matzo ball plopped in. The black and whites aren't bad, but the rugelach seem more like strudel bite pastries you would buy at Smith's. They're okay, but I'm not sure if they merit the title "rugelach." The bagels are decent. I dunno about this place. It seems like a Jew hasn't been in the kitchen in a very, very long time.I want to love this place, I reeeeeally really do. My boyfriend lives in the Optima so when I saw this little cafe open up, with its little patio by the fountains, I had visions of warm evenings with a glass of wine & appetizers or grabbing a late night latte or cup of gelato. They even have a small market with a little produce, some personal products...even pet supplies! 

On paper, this place sounds awesome.

However, Divine continues to disappoint me, my boyfriend & our friends...even though we all CONTINUE to give them chance after chance after chance. Sad face.

I have worked in different restaurants for over five years. I understand a little of what it takes to make an establishment work. Customer service is HUGE. It is obvious to me that this place has no real management & barely any training for any of their staff. The service is so terrible. No one seems to know what they are doing. The employees are usually friendly, but totally, utterly clueless. Actually had to grab a bag of cat food this morning...apparently $18 for a small bag of food, according to the cashier. When we reconsidered (obviously), she said, "Ohhhh wait, well...how 'bout $6.50?"  WHAT? This is not the first time prices have been negotiated for something from their market.

I have waited for a turkey sandwich for over half an hour. We waited for a pizza for an hour+...& while a man who I assume maybe was the owner? came out to apologize a few times, that was all he did. He seemed totally frazzled & out of it. They had three other tables in the restaurant at that time - COME ON. 

Most of the time they seem to be out of at least half of what is on their menu. I'm 99% sure their "soup" is canned Campbell's. Their hours vary...I think depending on when (or maybe if) someone decides to show up. We went by & thought they had finally closed up for good...but the next night it was open with someone playing live music? So confusing.

I keep going back because their food isn't bad, once you get it. & they have an awesome selection of teas & a pretty nice wine list. & it is just so gosh darn convenient!

I hate to be so negative about a place that has sooo much potential, but seriously. They need to get their shit together. I think their concept is a great idea, but Divine is just falling SO far short.My buddy and I purchased 'learn to drift' package on a daily deal site.  We were very much looking forward to the experience.  I had called the company multiple times to check as to availability, as they don't routinely update their website calendar.  Today is June 7, and they still only show a tentative May schedule.  The main phone number is the owner's cell phone.  I was told we didn't need to make a reservation....just stop by between 5:30 and 9:30 pm on any given day.  We showed up at their new location near the strip just before 9:00 pm.  Initially we were told there were too many people ahead of us and that we should return on another day (despite a $15 cab ride).  Ultimately they agreed to allow us to wait and go that night.  While the potential was there for a worthwhile experience, in the end this was a waste of time.  Of the 5 cars they had, 2 broke down WHILE WE WERE THERE.  Because of the limited space available in the new location (the track is a small portion of an industrial building's parking lot), only one car could go at a time.  While the package was supposed to include a teaching and driving component, due to the limited time available, the pressure of additional people waiting to utilize the 'track', and the difficulty in communicating drifting concepts in a car without a muffler, I felt it would be unsafe for me to attempt these maneuvers so the package turned into a professional drifting our car about 8 times around in a relatively small circle.  In all it was about 10-15 minutes total driving time.  In sum, the management of this operation is elementary, and unable to provide a value added experience.  On the plus side, the two 'driving' employees we met were very friendly and accommodating, and trying to make the best of what they had to work with.  My advice: Save your money...even at the discounted daily deal price, this was no deal.Second time to BLD and so disappointed. The short rib breakfast burrito was dry and tasteless, and the avacodo was missing in action! My friend's chicken fried steak was greasy and gloppy and tough. She could barely cut her steak and the potatoes were cold.  Service was indifferent as in our waiter couldn't have cared less about us. He was absent for much of the time we were there. Hey... how about some water?? What a difference from the last time we were here. Can't rave today.I was in the mood for a burger this evening and decided to try out the Five Guys close by.  It has been a while since I've eaten here since my previous experience (over a year ago) didn't yield any lasting memories.  I walked in at around 6pm on a Sunday evening.  The restaurant was clean and I approached the counter.  This place has a limited menu with burgers, hot dogs and fries along with their varieties.  I ordered a cheeseburger "all the way" and a hot dog with cheese and onions and a medium order of fries.  The cashier informed me that they "ran out of" hot dog buns and if I would mind my hot dog served on a hamburger bun.  I found that a bit odd that a place where hot dogs are one of two menu items that they would run out of buns, but I went ahead and ordered the altered dog.

When I received my order, I dove in to my burger.  Unfortunately, the bottom bun was soggy due to the grease from the burger.  This certainly makes the entire meal a bit unappetizing.  Aside from that, the burger was ok - nothing special but certainly not bad.  The soggy bun really turned me off.  The hot dog was sliced in half and arranged in a hamburger bun.  The dog was Hebrew National and, as expected, was tasty; however, the hamburger bun did not do it justice.  Lastly, the fries, while freshly spliced were good but the quantity was a bit much.

Lastly, given the average taste (and the soggy bun), the price of the meal was a bit on the pricey side.  I would recommend In-N-Out nearby for a fresh burger and fresh-cut potato fries - delicious and reasonably priced.it's funny- i try and not make the mistake of reading reviews while im at a particular restaurant because i dont want my view to be skewed going into it.. but these reviews were pretty spot on, it is kind of a trashy place and my food was well.. just not good. i ordered the queso dip and chips, which really, i dont know how you can screw up, but the queso was gross and the chips were burnt. left a bad taste in my mouth. i will say in their defense, $1.50 beers can't be beat.I didn't expect much from this place.  It was my 14 year old daughter's birthday and she wanted to go here so we did.

This place was definitely built with teenagers and teenager-wannabe girls in mind and I am none of the above so I was mostly annoyed by the bad top 40 music and the cheap-chic decor.  My daughter, of course, was mesmerized.  

What they did here at the old SF is pretty apparent, they melded several different concepts together to form one big, awful monstrosity that is less than the sum of the stolen parts.  Part "brasserie" to poach customers from Mon Ami Gabi next door, they serve French onion soup and mussels and croque monsieur, part Serendipity 3, they serve big, gut-busting ice cream concoctions and frozen hot chocolate, and part Hard Rock Cafe due to their large retail element selling $35 dollar sparkly t-shirts to unwitting parents and douchbaguette rubes.

Whatever.  It is what it is.  My problem was with the service.  The server was rarely seen since I had a couple of kids in tow.  You see, their game is to sell these tooth-achingly sweet cocktails that start @ 18 bucks.  Our server didn't think we'd be ordering any of the fancy cocktails, but she thought wrong.  When she finally made her way to our table to take our drink order and heard me order a Blow Pop she perked up real quick.  Constant upselling and pushing of more cocktails ensued.  When the time came when most people would be ordering a bathtub full of ice cream treats for dessert and we passed due to our profoundly bad experience up to that point, she rolled her eyes and disappeared again.  Just turned and left.  Wow.

I was noticing the same sort of behavior at the tables around us.  The loud, obnoxious drinkers were getting all of the service and the families splitting $22 club sandwiches and not finishing their awful candied cocktails were ignored.  I mean, we spent over 300 bucks for 5 people and the place was barely half full.  It's not like we were drinking ice waters and taking up space.  

SF is not good or cheap or charming.  Even my daughter was disappointed.  They wouldn't even make her a non-alcohol frou-frou cocktail.  What fun is that?Terrible service...  Do you ever go somewhere and just want to end it all while you sit at the table waiting??  Quite unfortunate, however I really have nothing else to say about this experience.  We did eventually get to order food, however no drinks which was quite bizarre till it was worked out.  

We also eventually saw some of the food...  Not 3/4's of it, given the service issues that I may have mentioned, but a few bites here and there.  Needless to say, we didn't actually eat the food, as it was time to take our business elsewhere.  

Good luck with this place if you choice to waste your money here.  With so many other better options within a crawl, I don't understand how this place stays open... boo....My husband and I went here for small lunch last spring after walking around Mill Avenue - Tempe Festival of the Arts. It was our first time to try out this place and it was ok. We are pizza lovers and their pizza???  We think that it needs more seasonings, its kinda BLAND, it NEEDS MORE CHEESE too but the crust is awesome. The meatballs for appetizer was really good and also my rootbeer. Just dissapointed about the pizza.Lunch menu ....salad dressing was salty and the miso soup was not hot just luke warm....meh lets see how the sushi is.... the whole meal was sub par and I don"t think I would go out of my way to go to this place again since we have so many options here in vegas.I ordered the new cheesestake burger combo first time no steak no baked bun as advertised called mgr to complain. I ordered a big carl last week stale bun and one piece of cheese to much sauce sloppy burger.It would be four or a five -- they really are doing a lot right -- but the coffee is just too expensive.  I won't be going there anymore until they lower the prices.  It is a good business strategy, the coffee is good, but the prices are still just plain too high.  If they were the highest in town, but still within reach, I'd go all the time.  But the prices a just plain too high.  I feel like a poor person excluded from a place designed for folks with more disposable income.Came here because I heard that  it is a good place to watch a Patriots game.  That was a really bad recommendation. 

You'd be better off listening to the game on the radio in your car in the parking lot.  

The food was ok.  Not bad.  Not good.  Just sorta generic sub shop fare.  I think that the people here who loved the pizza just don't know decent pizza.  We had the pizza and it wasn't much better than Dominos.I a rooting for this small business, but they just miss the mark here.This was my second time and most likely my last....first time with my relator.... and second with my associate... well.. both times the overpriced menu didnt do much for me....nor the small portions. thanks but no thanks. This wonna-be Fancy Veitnamese just not cutting it..... 
Fancy French..like Vogue..well yes for sure.! 

Wonder how well it will do by next year? Hopefully better.We went recently and found the food okay. I had kibbeh with the lentil soup and my wife had the beef swadharma. I felt first off walking into the place that we were not a priority. While I enjoyed the soup, the lentils were mushy. I grew up eating middle eastern food from an excellent native cook. Her lentil soup was never mushy. I found the kibbeh to be dry and over cooked, but the tabouli and yogurt sauce was very good. My wife's beef swadharma (sp?) was okay and tasted quite gamey. We are not planning on returning, it was too expensive for food that's just okay.Haha pretty whack when we came. I am glad I didn't have to pay cover cause if I did I'd be pretty upset! Used my money wisely to gamble instead...Just left Betty's Nosh, nice decor (2nd star).
First off, horrible optics, 7 servers standing in the middle of restaurant talking, while our sever was working the bar seating and outdoor patrons. Food, overpriced and poorly prepared. Ordered Thai chicken mushrooms with peanut sauce, shredded chicken breast was as dry a possible, peanut sauce...terrible.
Beef and blue mushrooms...same as above different ingredients, same result. Reuben sandwich...store bought shaved corned beef..dry, stale pretzel roll...dry...seeing a theme here...last straw, another customer paid my tab, and I paid theirs and the waitress paid the difference out of her tip...as a fix. Where is the manager???!!! Nice to look at...but way overpriced for this type of service and quality.
Needless to say, we won't be back...oh yeah, this was our first visit.Don't get the SALAD!  I know it's a pizza place, but normally, "upscale" pizza restaurants have great salads.  The topping were decent, but the tomatoes were watery and they use 100% ICEBERG LETTUCE!!  Are you kidding me?  What a let down for a $9.00 salad!  On a positive note, the service was great.This is really average pizza.  The crust almost tasted like sauce and cheese on thick crackers.  The ingredients were fine but neither the cheese nor the sauce stood out as outstanding.  The atmosphere is lovely with new material, nice lighting and the red checkered tablecloths.  Our waitress was lovely but the pizza can be found anywhere.  As I have written elsewhere in my reviews for great, real, napoletana pizza go to Pomo or Andreolis (when they serve it) and, though not as good as Pomo, il Teatro in northern Scottsdale does a pretty good job.Vegetarian burrito AND grilled Vegetarian burritos are both made with animal lard (in the beans).  One employee shrugged her shoulders, another said "that's the way it is", and a third said I'd just have to order it without the (lard) beans.  Why make this naive restaurant mistake?  Don't call it a vegetarian burrito if it isn't vegetarian.  Just call it a veggie burrito.   It's especially annoying because vegetarians tend to gravitate towards more gringo places like this one that are more likely to have vegetarian items than the more "traditional" Mexican places where lard and chicken stock is put in everything.

Grilled veggie burrito had cold cheese inside.  Not melted, not lukewarm, but cold.  Tortilla wasn't the slightest bit warm either, just as if it was served raw.  So there's this cool to the touch tortilla with cold cheese inside, and then the grilled veggies.  

Tables receive salsa which is nice, the hot is really more of a medium, but then a small portion of chips.  The one-top next to me had the same chips portion and we had 3 in our party.  Why do this to people?  You're going to hear a request for more chips within the first few minutes, and people are going to wonder why the table only had one little portion in the first place.

Atmosphere is clean with huge mirrors on some of the walls, and a flat panel TV on the other showing a nature documentary.  A few fake Macaws hanging from the ceiling.  It still has a trace of the Pick Up Stix feel that used to be here but went out of business.  Ordering procedure is the same.

Staff was entirely unlike most Mexican places - vast majority of people were caucasian, or gringo if you prefer, and that raises an eyebrow in an ethnic restaurant.  Maybe that matters to the reader here, maybe not.

On a positive note, the employees did check on tables as folks were dining, and were over the top with politeness.   That's incredibly rare these days.I really like Big Wong. 

This is just to help them improve.

Their service sucks.

Everything is about $5 dollars.

The lady who has helped us both times is always alone. I'm sure it sucks for her. This is a prime location in the surrounding China Town area so I know it gets busy. There's about twenty people in here now. 

Anyways the food I really good. I've had their special spicy seafood soup with wontons and their beef ramen. Both were pretty good. The shrimp and wontons in the soup were of good quality. The beef ramen has a pretty basic beef flavor. There isn't even any taste of like ginger or even onion. The beef itself is cooked really soft. I've tried their chicken wings and their shrimp won tons. Both were good. The wings are seasoned well and came out hot quick and fresh. The shrimp wontons are also good. Both are good sizes for $5 each.

Anyways they give you super small water cups.

So here is my gripe. They have a menu item called 5., 5a, and 5b. It's their special deep fried chicken. One is bone in dark meat, One is bone out dark meat, and they have a boneless white meat. The dish is really good. The dark meat takes 25 minutes but it's worth it. 

So my sister got the bone out dark and my cousin the bone out white meat.

The server comes out and brings pork chops. So we spoke amongst ourselves like who ordered this?

And she's like it's number three deep fried pork chops.

I ordered soup so I know it's not mine.

But we are all positive that they got chicken.

She just walks off and says well you ordered that and shrugs her shoulders and walks off.

No arguing with that right?

So she ends up walking back and says it's wrong it goes somewhere else.

Needless to say she messed up.

There was no apology for the mix up or for blaming us.

Also we never got our drinks refilled. Not once.

Anyways I'll probably just order take out from here. I can't imaging coming here when their service sucks. 

Also I witnessed her have an attitude with another client because they requested a specific table for their large party. 

3.5-4 stars for the food and price but 2 overall.First of all, it's not a smoothie. It's syrup and ice. Should have just got a soda. At least my teeth wouldn't feel like cavities were literally forming as I drank. All I wanted was a healthier option and now I'm going into a sugary diabetic coma and probably going to miss my flight. Overpriced airport fare as expected. Blah.The Good: Can't go wrong with outlet prices, with lower tax (compared to cali) it's a nice place to buy without costing too too much. The store has relatively newer items compared to the Primm outlet store with saffiano items in display.

The bad: the store is always packed with people and there's not so much of a walking space either. 

The Ugly: CUSTOMER SERVICE IS HORRIBLE. Yes it's all caps because it's the only way I can make my words come across with the horrid customer service they have. I had purchased something from the Primm for mother's day, decided to take a quick peek at this store and I decided another bag would be better suited for my mommy. Lo and behold when I was discussing this issue with the guy at the register. He was just so standoffish and not accommodating at all. Standing at the register for more 20 minutes or so without any update of what the hell is going on. When the return/exchange was almost complete he said he couldn't credit back the remaining balance, so I had to look for something close to the balance account. When I told him I needed time to look around and decide he just gave me a look and a sigh of being annoyed. Well, sorry to be such a nuisance mister. But I AM a paying customer you know. He could've said those terms while I was standing there for 20 mins doing nothing. Not going back here ever again.I really did not like this place at all.  The weird thing is . . . . it wasn't the bouncers, the bartenders, or anyone that worked at the club that made me not want to come back.  Everyone seemed really nice and the service was good.  Maybe I went on an off night (Saturday)?  Weird.  Anyway the crowd was hodge-podge of people old men (40s, 50s), short horny Asians, and the jersey shore.  I was mainly disappointed at the lack of good looking people.  You go somewhere like this thinking there will be at least a few attractive men (like in Vegas) but there really weren't that many. Trust me my standards are not that high.  So if you are an average looking dude, this place would be a good place for you to score a hot chick since there was a decent amount.  The odds are in your favor!  Sorry if this sounds shallow but my expectations were really a lot higher for this place.  Especially after hearing all this hard to get by the bouncer business.  Which it wasn't, but I went early (10:30-11PM)  

And one more thing that made this a terrible place to dance  . . . . . the DJ kept playing all these awesome songs, and would remix them with techno so in the end it all sounded the same (techno music, boo).  There were hip hop/top 40 songs but they all sounds like techno music because the dj kept mixing them.  It was terrible (IMO).Only place I've been to that messes up your order twice. I have been coming here for years now and haven't had any major problems just a few mix ups here and there but this time was a little aggravating. I ordered a simple omelette and the order is messed up, no big deal. I send it back and the waitress was happy to make a new one and apologized which was good...BUT when my new omelette arrives it was messed up again! They had forgot some ingredients and the way they presented it looked like they threw it together recklessly. The hash-browns were soggy and drenched in oil and the omelette was dry and crumbled apart from the first stroke of the knife. All in all was a pretty frustrating experience.I couldn't find anything worth eating, even for the inexpensive price. Dinner was only $9.99 with a Station's Card.

I arrived at 7:30p.m. and most of the food had been sitting under the heat lamps for well over an hour. Dried out sub-par pizza, hot dogs reminiscent of a 24hour seven-eleven rotisserie, and a tiny tex-mex section that should never have emigrated from tex-Mexico are some of the fare options diners are subjected to. 

Save your money and get your fill elsewhere.I thought this place was going to be better based on reviews but I guess not. You enter in through the hookah place next door and you are obligated to get your own drinks. I love Indian food, I make it at home all of the time but sometimes I like to venture out. The lowdown:

*I got the tikka masala fries and they were good but they desperately needed salt.
*Mattar paneer also needed salt and spice, I thought this food was supposed to be full of flavor and spice?No creamy texture and the cheese was rubbery and more firm than it is supposed to be. 
*My partner's lamb curry was sadly laden with oil and you could see the separation between the tomato curry and the oil sitting on top. The biggest part of the lamb that was saved for last was mostly, if not all fat. 
*Basmati rice needed salt as well, and I'm not a salt fiend! More oil would have helped to make it moist. 
*Garlic Naan was crispy and hot.

In conclusion: tikka masala fries and naan were good. I was disappointed at the lack of flavor everything had. If you want one of the best experiences go to Royal Taj here in Tempe, if you want some of the best Indian food in your life go to Delhi Palace in Flagstaff at Woodlands Village.The salon was clean, and blessedly, at 10 in the morning, empty. But, there were 4 people available to assist me and 2 of them were having a slight argument about who'd help me. I double checked to make sure I wore deodorant, and my face didn't look funny. (Maybe it was because I didn't have on makeup?)
Anyhow, I got a spa pedicure and full set. It was just okay. They didnt ask if I wanted any extras added, like a paraffin wax or getting my cuticles removed. Either I take good care of myself or the woman helping me was really bored. And, I had to correct her several times in shaping my nails, as I prefer oval and she kept trying to make them "square with rounded edges". For a short, full set and spa pedi, cost was $55. I tipped $5.
All in all, I could take it or leave it. But I'll probably be leaving it, alone.I love that this place has gluten free pizza- when I went to pick up my order I also saw that they have GF beer too. I was visiting my sister in Vegas and everyone wanted pizza but since im GF we had to find a place for me too. We ordered 2 small pizzas- 1 plain, 1 veggie with pepperoni added. We also got a GF pizza with black olives, onions, pepperoni, green peppers as well as an order of wings and a garden salad. When we got there- the owner greeted us and was VERY friendly. Service was amazing which I always appreciate. However, the food totaled to $70!!!! SEVENTY DOLLARS!!!! well I thought, lets just see how good this pizza is. We got back and opened everything up. The wings literally looked like something that was previously frozen- they were also very small and the sauce was lackluster. They tasted ok- but for $8 I would expect a little more. The salad was fine- totally what I would expect for a small $5 salad. The 2 small pizzas were a hit- everyone really liked them. The sauce was very flavorful. 
The gluten free pizza- thats where it goes awry. The actual crust was GREAT- however, it looked like the pizza was cooked JUST to the cheese started to melt. It was terribly under done. The onions were just about 2 spoonfuls of diced white onions, the green peppers were very lacking as well. I would like to give this place a 4 or 5 star review but for $70 that pizza just was not good enough.First timer to this restaurant but an old soul when it comes to Italian food. The restaurant has a nice pleasant vibe, I sat at the bar, it's long and comfortable and provides a great view (I love to see what other people are having). I ordered half a bottle of a Cabernet from Chile, they have a good offering of wines and not expensive at all, love the option of a half bottle. I also ordered the Tuscan Grill Mix, Lamb Chops, chicken and sausage They bring you bread and olive oil, the bread was a bit on the burned side, same as the table next to me, well actually theirs was almost black burned!. Then the food arrived, I was a bit disappointed to find a bit of skinny couple of lamb chops a very thin chicken breast a what resembled a think burned hotdog. Unfortunately the lamb was kind of dry and over cooked, same with the chicken, you would expect dry chicken breast at Olive garden but not here. It was not bad, well seasoned but far from where it should be. Disappointing. Desert menu needs a couple more offerings but that is my humble opinion, I ordered the white chocolate raspberry cheesecake, I know this being an Italian restaurant I should probably had the Tiramisu or the cannoli but oh well, the cake was good, nothing special.
Bottom line, and my rating is always on function of this: would I come back? Probably not, there are way to many other options to try instead on spending this kid of money to try to find that good dish in this restaurant (probably there is a few) but not again.The food was good, however I was very dissatisfied with the service. I ordered for delivery (moving day...we needed sustenance), and although we are well within the distance (a little over a mile away) they advertise as their delivery radius (I wanna say 4 miles?), their delivery service "doesn't deliver to McDowell." Really??

So, whatever, I went for take-out and checked-in for the 10% discount. However, when I arrived, there was no freakin parking on the street they are on, and no parking available for almost a half mile. (We are new to AZ; we don't know much at this point.) 

Again, whatever, we're freakin hungry. When I go to pick it up, the check-in code on my phone isn't working, and apparently they can't figure out how to just give a 10% discount. (My phone showed I checked in, but the code wouldn't come up.) Seems the owner is super cheap. I mean, giving me $5 off and having a chance for a return customer seems like a better way to run a business than pinching every penny from the customers. 

I will not return. This review is more about frustration with poor management than the employee who helped me when I picked up. She was kind and seemed afraid of what the boss would do if she gave a discount without a code. Seriously, give the customers and employees a break.After a great time at Copper Blues I wound up here. Pretty lackluster experience and this is sad because I had high hopes for this place. There was nothing blatantly bad about my experience but the vibe, the clientele, everything about just kind of sucked. There was nothing about the vibe or atmosphere that made me want to stay...in fact I left after one beer. 
The place just opened up, so it's quite possible that everyone is stil getting their bearings so I'll probably pop in one more time in a few months to see if the vibe is the same. 

The bar is indoor/outdoor and opens onto a a concrete patio that is definitely the best feature at this location. The patio has awesom eastern views of downtown and it's really cool in the late afternoon early evenings. Unfortunately they HAVE to do something about the patio high chairs because they are uncomfortable as hell.So ya' want: Food. Beer. Boobs and Sports huh? Like most who try to "do it all", this place excels at NONE.

If you want great food go to Cibo.
If you want great beer go to the Roosevelt Tavern or Lost Leaf.
If you want great boobs go to the Hi Liter.
If you want great sports go to Coach & Willies.

(all of those are within a few blocks of this place)

If you want all of 'em in one great spot ... good luck to ya' champ.Going to be real simple. .i have lived in the area 4years..and one night i went on a walk and wandered in here.. and yeah..wasn't expecting much..but the food was bland..and eh

But hey for a cheap breakfast why not huh? Comparable to an independent dennysSo I call in an order and am quoted 20 minutes.  I leave house 15 minutes later and show up about 2 minutes before the quoted time.  I am greeted with a "you're here early, we haven't made it yet". I wait 25 more minutes as they casually make the pizza.

Would be a one star if they didn't have a decent check in special.  

Oh and the pizza? In the immortal words of the Yelp rating system, "Meh. I've experienced better."Visited several times here during our stay at THEhotel for coffee, snacks, etc. and every time the servers at the register had a look of indifference. Service was what it was...a dud. They didn't smile, and they weren't rude, but I find a smile goes a long way these days.

The pastries at this particular location were just OK and the cupcakes were borderline bad and I'm certain they weren't fresh.  

The only item worth going back for was the little mozzarella tomato salad.  The tomatoes were suprisingly fresh, the mozzarella was as well, and the pesto dressing was delicious. 

If a caprese snack wasn't what you were looking for, then keep walking into Mandalay Bay.  It's worth it.Service: 1.5
Don't really review much but because of my experience had to write something. First off, this is the strangest restaurant I've been to. It's inside a Hair and Nail Salon/Spa inside a strip mall. Couldn't find it initially, then after 5 minutes of looping the parking lot, found a small sign next to the Salon sign. We walked in and there were two gentlemen in front of us waiting to order. They ordered, then we ordered. The lady who took our order told us it would be a few minutes. We waited for 15 minutes then the lady came up to us and said there are two other orders in front of us so it would be a few more minutes. So we decided to go out and come back. We waited outside eating ice cream because it took so long. She came outside with two bottles of water to apologize then another 15 minutes went by before we got our meal "to go".

Left Office: 12:55pm
Arrived in Parking Lot: 1:10pm
Got Lost for 5 Min: 1:15pm
Ordered our food: 1:20pm
Left the restaurant: 2:05 pm
Got Back to Office to Eat: 2:18pm.

Didn't know this was going to be a journey....

Food: 2.5
The food was ok at best. We ordered all the BAOs on the menu. 
1. Duck Bao - Good flavor (probably the best there) Could add more meat though. Just one slice of duck.
2. Pork Belly Bao - Two slabs of 1 inch thick slabs of pork belly. A bit dry.
3. Chicken Bao - Extremely dry chicken. Crispy skin but tasted like they definitely overcooked the chicken.
4. Tofu & Mushroom Bao - Combination of ingredient blended well. Fried tofu but the sauce made it softer. 

Also ordered the Chicken salad because they ran out of sesame noodles. The chicken salad was not good at all. Dry chicken meat with cucumber slices and spring mix? To add to that found a hair in my salad. I know it's not my hair because I don't have hair on my head and it was longer than an eyelash.I was here during the opening.  It's ok.  I like the interior design and theme, however the food leaves a lot to be desired. I hope they improve with time.

The flavor simply isn't that strong would be my biggest complaint.  We asked for lots of extra dipping sauce to slather the mud bugs in, but it just wasn't that tasty.

Prices weren't posted anywhere when I was there so it was annoying having to ask.

I saw a couple of notes about the sweet potato bites.  I think this must be a frozen food from Sysco or somebody.  BB King's BBQ restaurant at the Mirage has the same ones and they serve them with caramel sauce that really finishes the dish off nicely.

Also, having had many  crawfish boil in my hometown of Houston, I'm still flabbergasted how West Coast places charge per piece of corn and potato.  It should be included!!! 

All in all, it was ok. Probably won't return.  Having it here just wanted me to do it at home since I can do it way better!

Note: the crab legs are frozen.  Mine were just plain old resulting in a rubbery texture and the meat not filling the shell. The owner took them back after my complaint, bit it was disappointing.  The shrimp were a good size 24-30U I think. No tiger prawns, but decent.It's not enough to inspire me to change the star rating on my review, but it is worth noting that David, the General Manager of Rice and Company, contacted me to express his concern and regret about the lack of service I received on my visit. That's the kind of attention to customers I would have liked while I was at the restaurant. Maybe there will be some kind of trickle down effect, or whatever the economic term might be, but doubtful I'll volunteer to test that firsthand the next time I'm in town.We ate here due to the good reviews on Yelp.  However, we were very disappointed.

When we sat down we noticed that the table was dirty.  We mentioned this to the server and got some strange answer about how people don't use the tables.  No idea what she was trying to say (she spoke very good english).  My wife got some napkins and washed the table herself.  The server didn't even apologize.

We ordered the asian chicken salad and won ton soup for appetizers.  For the main dishes we ordered Chicken and broccoli and pan fried noodles with beef.

The chicken salad didn't come as described on the menu.  It had maraschino cherries  instead of dried cranberries.  There were no nuts on the salad and the dressing had no taste (supposed to be an asian vinaigrette)  and there was no sesame oil.  If they were out of so many things, they should have told us when we ordered it.  The salad just tasted like lettuce with very little other flavor. 

The won ton soup also had no flavor.  The broth tasted like boiled water and the vegetables and dumplings added nothing to the soup.

Likewise, the 2 main dishes were OK, but lacked any real flavor. I added soy sauce (which I never do) so that it would taste like something.

We tried to explain these problems to the server, but got nowhere.  She didn't even say she was sorry for the poor food.  She really needs to learn how to be a server at a restaurant.  She needs to carry customer comments to the kitchen and apologize to the customer that they weren't happy.

Very poor experience. We will never return and I hope others read this and go elsewhere.So I went here thinking it was the same as the Island Sushi on Eastern, and it's not. Yes, they do make hawaiian specialties like malasadas and coco puffs, and chantilly cake. Asked the waitress if the malasadas are like Leonard's bakery and she said, she didn't know who that was. Oh... no (not the good ono). I tried the malasadas and coco puffs. Not good. Malasadas were dense, doughy, and okay. Maybe I've been spoiled by the good stuff. The coco puffs were not good either. Okay, the chocolate pudding was fine, but the puff was hardened and soggy by sitting in the refrigerator a long time and the pudding soaked in on the bottom. The macadamia nut frosting was just frosting, not much mac nut taste at all, and it was frikkin too sweet. I'm afraid to try the chantilly cake. Although with Misti Y's info about rolls being 50% off, I might try some when I hang out for the local music.it's basically byrd's with different waitstaff and slightly better food*. same mostly dismal beer selection save a few local and/or craft brews. if you like miller lite, sports and fried food, you will love this place. 

* the appetizers were ok, but mostly fried (green beans, poppers, curds, etc.). my friend ordered a grilled portabella (which was on a nice ciabatta roll and came with decent sweet potato fries)... and found a large piece of plastic in her sandwich. gross enough to begin with, but leads me to believe that they don't even use fresh ingredients, because it looked like a wrapper. yuck.Meh.  The perfect descriptor for two stars and also my reply to our waitress when asked how my buffalo chicken wrap was..."meh."  

This bar is close to home and we enjoy playing trivia here on Tuesday nights...but that's as far as my enjoyment goes.  The service is always slow and inattentive.  

Ordered soda water with a lemon.  15 minutes (no joke) later, our waitress shows up with an icy cold glass of...nothing - empty - for the pitcher of beer.  Which would be great if that's what I'd ordered...

As mentioned previously, the buffalo chicken wrap was less than perfect.  Slathered in an a thin (read liquidy/messy), over spicy sauce that dominated the flavor of the other wrap ingredients...and who wouldn't want to enjoy the full flavor of lifeless diced tomatoes and romaine lettuce?!

I'll return for trivia, but dread the slow service and have sworn off the food.

Namio's is all-around meh.The two stars in this review are for the food alone. We just moved to the area and our Jason's Deli in the area we previously lived burned down and had not been reopened by the time we moved. The salad bar and soup were very good and my kids enjoyed their pb&j's. My wife got a ham and cheese sandwich and said the ham was very good. The great disappointment at this establishment was the staff. While not all of them were this way, most were not very friendly and seemed frustrated when you asked for assistance. When I was at the register, it was obvious the guy was new, but no one seemed to want to help him, acting as if they were busy when the store was mostly empty. The other staff would then get frustrated when he would do something wrong and they would have to fix it. If they would spend more time training him, they would have much less frustration.If your looking for a anime themed restaurant this is as close as your going to get in  Las Vegas. Sadly, the ramen bowls are not up to par with places like Shuseki up the road or ramen houses in LA. 

We had the miso & shoyu ramen both came with 2 wafer thin slices of pork, fish cake and a pinch of green onion, bamboo shoots & bean sprouts at $8 a bowl.

An Anime Ramen shop is a great idea for all us anime fans but they need to take a look at the ramen shops in LA & bring it to Las Vegas.Don't waste your money on the food. The food is over fried (in old nasty oil) and lacks edibility.  The margaritas might have given me an instant cavity. The beef is low quality and the fries were literally, the worst I have ever had in my life.

That being said, if you want to stop in for a beer and catch the last minutes of a game, moes is a decent option.  Just don't pick up that menuOk really, I can make better pizza than this. Its over priced which is no surprise since it's in a casino on he strip. The pizza crust is decent but the sauce lacked flavor and I thought the cheese was very good quality, you can tell when you bite into it. Its also greasy. You want pizza you ll do better at one of the many pizza places outside the strip. 2 slices, 1 soda and 1 beer $20.

The price for a whole pizza is like $25This barley got 2 stars. Took my family there for Mothers Day Brunch and although some of the breakfast items were tasty the rest was less than desirable. The table was filthy with gum under the chairs that you had to scoot in. The bathrooms were just disgusting. It was 100 outside and 85 inside. The server we had was sweet and attentive but the serving staff at the buffet were rude and presentation was not important to them at all. By the way assorted desserts really means some dry coffee cakes and nothing to write home about. Also they charged us for my nephew who should have been free and even Ice tea was not included in the brunch price. We will not being going back there. We did mention this to the Manager on our way out very politely and we just were looked at like we were crazy.. you win some and you loose some they just lost 5 customers :(I got a rib eye it was ok. The potatoes augratin was gross way too much onion. Service was friendly. The fries were horrible and the crab cakes seasoning wasn't good. The only thing I enjoyed was the bread basket. Way too pricey for the food being so bad. They really like to season there meat so if you don't like salty ask for noneI miss when this place used to be Mama Luigi's.  I've been here twice since it has been Sunset Pizzeria and although the menu is still very similar... the customer service and food are just not that great.  I was not impressed when our server told us that we could get our own drinks at the drink station, and then two minutes later a group of guys comes in and she takes their drink order and brings it over to them.  Granted, the drink station is not that far away.  But, if drinks are self service, should't they be for everyone?  At the end of our experience, our bill was $50 for 3 calzones and drinks.  I just do not feel that it was worth that much!I've ordered take-out from this place four times.  The first two times were fine.  The second time they didn't make the order until I arrived and then it was totally wrong.  This morning I had a chance to observe the restaurant for a few minutes while waiting for my food and the management is poor. 

The food is fine but I wouldn't expect much for service.So so. The menu lacked lots of green-vegi choices. Name should be various meat and tofu proteins and green drinks. Veggie Garden Burger was just a pale bocaburger (no veggie or garden in it), my wife a life long vegetarian could not eat it.Ordered burger "med. well" for take out even had the girl repeat back my order & made sure it will be med. well only slightly pink she said. Well when I got home with it...it was pretty much RARE TO MEDIUM RARE !!! Will NOT be ordering food there anymore. Too many other places that will get your order correct. The chips were good though. The order was ready on time.Enjoyed this place 4 Stars worth on Grand Opening day nearly a year and a half ago, but it's taken me a while to get back over here as it's a 26-mile drive each way.

Today the food choices were somewhat the same as they are on Day One, except that they were down to 108 items this time (plus sauces & dressings) from 130 at the start.  There were some things to praise about the place today, such as lots of shrimp dishes including Stuffed Shrimp, Bacon Wrapped Shrimp, Salt & Pepper Shrimp and Ceviché, and for dessert there were four kinds of real ice cream, chilled to the right temperature (not so cold that you can't scoop it!).

The problems today that cost them two stars were these:

*  A lot of the food that should have been hot was either lukewarm, or worse, room temperature.  NOT OK!     :-O

*  There was a nasty smell in the place.  Not all over, but I picked up a whiff of it here and there in the serving area.  The Men's room had an odor about it too, although it looked clean.  (No, it wasn't Pine Sol, although I think that stinks too!)  Whatever these smells are, they need to find them & get rid of them!     :-O

*  They have a little Sushi & also a Mongolian style BBQ with 4 meats, but neither were anywhere near as good as what I have just had (twice in the last few days) over at the new China Olive in Sun City, for example.

Sorry, it's only 2 Stars this time.     :-|

Weekday Lunch Buffet:  $7.99/$7.19 Sr.People who work out at this facility use the class room for weight lifting and so on, and get upset if you use the room as it was intended - for a video class - even if you tell them they are welcome to continue doing their own weight lifting in there while you do the class. One of the personal trainers gave me a weight lifting routine that was  much too intense based on my size and ability, and resulted in my getting injured. The facility is okay if all you plan to do is use the cardio equipment and lift weights on your own, but it is not meeting my needs and the management of the shared space is minimal.I came here with 2 of my girlfriends. We had bought a groupon and wanted to give "Foot Spa" (a whole body massage) a try. So we called around 6pm to let them know 3 girls were going to come in at 10pm... Then my friend called and the guy who picked up could not understand anything, and she kept raising her voice hoping he would understand. So I grabbed the phone and let him know that 3 girls were coming at 10pm and he kept saying SEVEN! I said ONE ZERO and he just said "Ok 9" I said NO 10PM! And he said "ah" and I thought that was the end of it.... Then he asked for my number... OMG! I started with "702" and he said "352" and I just said nvm, forget the area code. Started to state my number, he repeated the ALL the wrong number and I just went with it. SO FRUSTRATING.

So we got there, didn't know what to expect. She put my feet in warm water that got pretty cold fast. And made me lay back. There was SO many noises and talking during my massage. You might as well keep the lights on and massage me outside. (JK) But really, it was bad. 

Massage was nice but the next day my whole body hurt and my toes hurt so bad. Maybe she went to hard? Idk. 

After, they pressure you tip at least $10 or you are basically not welcomed. We gave them a $100 to break and they took it and walked away then got mad cause we didn't leave the a $100 tip and started to talk in their language. All three of us left a $10 each tip. Then left. Will not be back, whatsoever. I would go to a foot spa place again....Just not this one. I'm so disappointed.Empty, dirty, and poorly stocked.  That's all I really need to say about my stop into the Einstein Bros Bagels at 90th street and Shea.  It doesn't help that I am not a fan of this chain to begin with, but this location certainly doesn't help change my opinion of Einstein.

My wife and I had breakfast plans that were canceled at the last minute, so we just wanted something quick and easy before heading into a store in the huge shopping center Einstein is conveniently located in.  There certainly wasn't a crowd at 11am on Sunday morning, but that didn't stop the dining room from having a couple of dirty tables and trash cans filled above the rim.  Maybe the employees were busy making bagels since they were already out of several varieties?  No.  At least that's not the impression we were given when we asked if they had anymore of some of the missing bagels and were just told "we're out."  I get that you don't want to overstock, but I don't think our expectations are too high if we hope the bagels we like are in stock just before lunchtime.I am a little confused by the restaurant and unsure if my review should go here or be listed as a new business. The reason for the confusion is the combination of names that exit. My girlfriend said she recently saw a new restaurant called Don Camaron and wanted to take her mom out for her birthday. She gave me the name and the general location, but I was unable to find it on Yelp or other services. Google turned up similarly named restaurants in other places. Ultimately we found the information on Facebook. As we pulled up we noted the sign stated Don Camaron was "Now Open". We pulled into the parking lot of Urban Heat. As I walked toward the restaurant the sign on the sidewalk read Don Camaron, but the name above the door read Urban Heat. Instead the decor had Urban Heat, but also a logo of the Don Camaron shrimp. The menu read Urban Heat (but had the shrimp logo), the paper ring around the napkin read Urban Heat, and upon check out the receipt reads Urban Heat. Perhaps it is going through a transition and it is both places? The waitress that I had was also very new. She didn't seem to understand me well and she was unfamiliar with the food. 

It appears to be a bar/restaurant, which is how Urban Heat (and the receipt) describe it. The menu included mostly appetizers, tacos, fish, and shrimp. The back page showed multiple types of beer in bottles and draft, but they did not have all of those. One draft they have Bud, Bud Light, Michelob, and "Amber Bock". I asked what Amber Bock and the server did not know. It was either Michelob or Dos X. Either way, it was decent and $2.75 but I received an additional $1.83 discount (maybe happy hour?). There were only maybe 6 other people there besides the 5 of us, so it wasn't a big crowd if it was happy hour.

We received chips and salsa first (free). My girlfriend's son ordered a hamburger ($8) and I was surprised how quickly it arrived. It was a good size burger served with a side of fries. It was cooked just a little more well-done that I would have liked. My girlfriend's daughter & mom each ordered the Coco Camaron, which is a coconut with shrimp ceviche and shrimp inside. It also had two whole shrimp with heads, eyes, and legs (yuck) mounted on top of the coconut ($16). My girlfriend went with the fish filet ala plancha that was served with a very tasty side of rice and a nice looking salad. This was a nice-sized portion ($9) and I was a little sad that I hadn't ordered it, but I was afraid it would resemble the fried whole fish that was also shown on the menu (yuck again). Instead I went with the nachos (add carne asada), which was supposed to be $6.99 + $2 for the carne, but it appears I was only charge $6.99). My girlfriend also ordered a shrimp cocktail for $12. Throw in a pina colada for $5.50, a $1.83 bottle of water, and a $1.83 bottle of coke - then my girlfriend's daughter decided she would rather have had a hamburger and fries like her brother (another $8) and soon the bill was $95 for the 5 of us.

Some pros - I liked the live Maine lobster claw machine. I don't know if the customer gets to eat the lobster if the claw game picks it up, but it was interesting. The deco was nice, but again with the differences in the name I don't know if that will stay. The fish filet was another highlight of the meal.  Otherwise, the hamburgers were a little too well done, my nachos were just okay (and certainly a much smaller portion than the fish filet plate), the server was unsure of the menu, the beer selection was limited, and I wasn't sure what restaurant I was actually visiting. Whatever restaurant it was (Don Camaron or Urban Heat), I don't think it was $95 good. Maybe if there are some big happy hour specials and the name gets worked out it would be worth revisiting, but right now I don't think so.Hate to say this, but I really wanted to like this place. Everything started out great, we were impressed with the beer selection and we ended up getting a great beer flight. That was all that was good about this place. 

After ordering drinks, our waiter disappeared. We finally had to ask another waiter to send him over so we could order food. If only we had known, we would have stopped after ordering beer...

We started with the "Devils on Horseback" (bacon-wrapped dates) and they were shameful and bland. You want a real bacon-wrapped date? Head over to La Cave inside Wynn next door. 

I had high hopes for the mussels since they came highly recommended from the staff, however those hopes were dashed. They came in a giant pot (not good for sharing, even though our waiter said they were...) and were also tasteless.

We stopped ordering after that since the food was so disappointing. We ended up having Dinner Part 2 later on that evening since we were still hungry after leaving Public House.

Skip it, there are a thousand better places within a stone's throw of this place.Okay, right off the bat I need to state that I am a Goin-Out-TO-Breakfast fiend. It is my favorite meal to eat out. It's simple. It's relaxing. It's friendly. It's a uncomplicated. A good breakfast joint still offers value, a sense of community and belly full of warm yummy goodness.

I learned to appreciate the beauty of a great breakfast joint at a place called the Red Hill Coffee Shop in Rancho Cucamonga Ca. Side note; It used to be just Cucamonga but then the powers that be got together and decided that tacking a Rancho on the front made it sound less looney tunish...... Nice try. So Red Hill Coffee Shop is the breakfast that all breakfast joints are judged by in my little world. And one of the things, among many, that place it on that oh so lofty pedestal are the hashbrowns.

Their hashbrowns are the shredded variety. Wonderfully crispy and brown on the outside and tender and moist on the inside. Each bite giving you that beautiful contrast of textures and when you get a little bit of the egg or syrup in that bite an added dimension of flavor. Another thing that makes the hashbrowns at RHCS so noteworthy; they don't hold back on the portion.

And that brings me to the point of this 2 star review. I live right around the corner from the S Buffalo location of Baby Stacks. I've seen the yelp and other reviews that have praised this place. I've noticed that it's fairly busy. But in Vegas I always take user reviews with a grain of salt. And that grain of salt gets bigger the closer you get to Summerlin. After all, this is the town in which the readers of the RJ consistently name PF Chang's the best Chinese restaurant (?). 

So I stopped by BS this morning and ordered a side of hashbrowns to go. I didn't have time to sit down and eat a full breakfast. I figured a side of hashbrowns would be a good bell-weather for me. And I have to say it was. You ever go to a Denny's, which I haven't done in 20 years, and when the food comes you look at the hashbrowns and think, "Really?"?  Well in the case of the hashbrowns I got at BS this morning "Really?" would have been a stretch. It was a $3.18 smidgen of fried shredded potatoes. My 16 y/o called them an "epic fail". 

I'm not usually an overly anal person. Obviously I love my hashbrowns but I felt I needed to quantify the ridiculousness of this order of hashbrowns, so I weighed them. With the togo container they weighed in at an anemic 2 oz. $3 for 2 oz of hashbrowns? Really? That's $24 a pound. This review has gone on way too long already to get into the millions of prepared foods that I can get for less than $24 a pound.

BS, I'm sure all your food is as wonderful as your many customers point out. I think it's great that you are a mom and pop business making a go of it. That in and of itself is praiseworthy. But come on, potatoes are cheap. The griddle is always running. It takes little effort to keep the hashbrowns flowing and plentiful. They are a low overhead item that makes people say to their friends, "Great breakfast joint, and you should see the hashbrowns."

Long after the trendy red velvet thing has passed, people will still love going out to breakfast.The pancakes where hard and the butter wasn't soft! It's ok but I wouldn't go here again...I ordered a graduation cake 2 weeks prior to the event. I was very specific with no buttercream frosting. It was to be a red velvet cake with whipped frosting with school colors. I drove to downtown Mesa approx 13 mi one way after texting the lady that I was coming for the cake. Never heard back and it was after the time the cake was supposed to be ready. When I got there, I waited a full 5 minutes before anyone asked if they could help me, seemed like I was inconveniencing them. They asked me what time I needed the cake, then I knew something was up. I said "well, I'm here now" I was told they were putting the finishing touches on the cake and that they would be happy to delivery it around 4pm free of charge. 
When the cake finally arrived at my house around 445. It looked like buttercream. I asked about refrigeration, one girl said no,I didn't have to refrigerate it, the other said yes I did need to because it was whipped frosting. I pointed out that it did not look like whipped frosting. To late now, I needed a cake.
Sure enough, when it came time to serve the cake, it was buttercream. For $55 this cake was not spectacular at all, highly disappointing.  Definately not what I wanted or ordered. 
Still wondering what actually happened, I sent a text message to the lady who made the cake and told her that the cake was not all what I ordered and I wanted to know what actually happened since I got 3 different stories. She then proceeded to tell me that she made a cake with whipped frosting and the  colors were beautiful.  When she went to the fridge to check on it later,  all the colors had bled into the frosting and they had to remake the cake.
Why couldn't they just be honest and say that in the first place? She apologized a few times then zaid she would be happy to make me another cake free of charge. I agreed,  but I think I would rather have my money back since I drove out there, and was lied to a few times before I finally got the actual story. She offered to make another cake, I would rather have my money back which was never offered. I won't be back and its too bad because she was recommended by a friend who is a caterer.I just had their BLT Italiano (to go) for dinner and what a RIP OFF!!! 

First of all, its not worth 11.95 and secondly it wasnt really a panini it was more of a regualr sandwich and the side ceaser salad I got,... wow!! how cheap can you get, I swear I got about 10 pieces of lettuce and no croutons. The only thing is the flavor was good but just a tad bit too salty.

I cant speak for the rest of their food but I wouldnt go back .Normally my family is particular about sticking to the tried and true Chinese restaurants. It is rare to get my mom and dad to deviate from their regular rotation. When my dad suggested this place, it took me by surprise. The Yelper in me is always in search of a hidden gem.

HK Garden is not that kind of place. It is jammed pack with tables of screaming, uncontrollable children. The Asian teacher in me wanted to expel some corporal punishment, but decided against it. A few stern looks were enough to get them into the seat next to their mother. 

The service is lacking. Of course, it is lacking, it is a Chinese restaurant. Of course, I am going to get ignored when I need them most. 

The food is a hit or a miss. 

The seafood and tofu hot pot: hit. 
The mapo tofu: miss.
The porks blood and intestine hot pot: hit.
The HK sweet and sour spare ribs: miss.
The whole fried flounder: hit.

Apparently if $40+ is spent, you get a free entree. We got the flounder. There is something else for $80+.Went there on a Friday night at 7. They were out of chips for the rest of the night. First margarita was goof the second one had no tequila in it.  Guacamole was tasteless except for the lemon or lime taste. Street taco were ok.  Couple next to us at the bar said they weren't come back. We won't either.Been here twice and disappointed both times.

Food is OK. Guac is over priced. Specialty cocktails way too sweet. Staff not very personable ... I would actually go as far as to say continuously weeded and awkward.

Went there a few nights ago with family and friends and we literally sat there and chatted for an hour before I finally made eye contact with our waitress like "HEY WE'RE READY". Just because we're talking doesn't mean we're not hungry.  She was running around all night just looking way too busy.

Tortilla soup tasteless.
Ensalada Sol was good, but I could've made a better salad at home for half the price..
Want to add chipotle shrimp? Don't. Also tasteless and no spice at all.

Apparently the enchiladas and street tacos are good.

Also, the apparent manager reaches over our table to turn on the electric candle... Without saying a word. We all stop to look at him since we had no idea who he was and why he were reaching across the table turning on the candle and then walking away. Try something like "Hi! My name is soandso, and I'm the manager here. How are those margaritas?" ... While reaching for the candle. Or better yet, TURN THEM ALL ON BEFORE DINNER SERVICE ;) 

Customer service isn't bad, just weird. Hostesses are friendly opening doors and what not, but when you mention its still happy hour you should give us happy hour menu's as well and there are tables near the door, hold off on the personal chitchat, because I don't care what you're doing later tonight.

ALL SUMMED UP:
Food: overpriced (not saying it's totally bad, but it's OVERPRICED)
Service: inexperienced staff and way too casual for The Quarter (use proper verbiage, make eye contact, and SMILE... advice applicable to everyone working there, except the young boy who always refilled my water :)
Atmosphere: trendy.

I'll go to Chipotle next time.Great Prices. Clean and very well stocked. The one thing I dislike is the parking it's always full of shopping carts that obstruct parking.I was in the area this morning, and stopped in for my "hang." They didn't have dark roast. The woman said she'd brew some, but laughed at me when I suggested that coffee prepared with different methods tasted different. So I left, and went to a different location where they had dark roast available, and treated me and their own product with respect.This place reminds me of a slightly upgraded Food 4 Less.

Yes there are items that are slightly cheaper than Walmart or Albertsons, but since it is located on the other side of town for me (215 & Stephanie) the .50 cents savings or so is not worth the drive.

The store itself is pretty clean. But I'm not really liking the warehouse feeling.

I do like how they offer certain items you can select the servings on your own (rice, variety of nuts and candy, etc).

Overall I won't make a separate trip just to visit this store. Even if I'm on this side of town, I'm still hesitant to stop by.There is always a line running all the way out the door for dinner time.  Sometimes you can wait for an hour or less but sometimes it's more.  However, I don't think it's worth waiting over an hour for.  Food is okay but nothing really stands out that would make me come back again.  Service is minimal, and the only good thing I can really say about this place is pretty much the price.Hard not to be frustrated with this place. Asked for a burger, medium rare, everything on the side. Got a burger, medium, everything on it, plus fries that had been clearly sitting around. Seriously. You're a sports bar. You can't screw up burgers. Although, given the number of televisions, I don't think I'd classify this place as a sports bar. The waiter finally came over when I had two bites left to ask me how the burger was. Well, dude, it sucked. My wife's flatbread?  No bueno. So then, the manager comes over and asks me if I want another one. Really?   Then he asks me If I want one to go. Look, the burger sucked when it was fresh from the kitchen. To go?  No thanks. Besides, WTF?  No, I can't eat a second burger. I'm a big fella, but come on, man. A second burger?  I really want to like local places that are not chain restaurants.  Keep the dollars local. However, I think I'll stick to Blue 32.I shop craft stores for fine art supplies... Hobby Lobby, while way more organized, is always priced 2-3$ more than Michael's for the same merchandise handled the same way (poorly). 
I only go here when I can't find it at Michael's, or I have a gift card that needs to be used... please no more gift cards here.. omg please... lol2.5 Stars

I've been here five times now and have realized that I only like one thing on their menu.  I will not trash New Asian Star.  I am only assuming that the folks here are all family, but they are so super friendly!

I've had the Thai fried rice twice and five other items on my other visits here.  I can't reiterate the friendliness of the staff here and the superb customer service.  I have no problem knowing I found a spot for great Thai fried rice.  I understand any type of food is subjective and would recommend everyone to stop here and try it out for yourself.This place makes Sbarro look gourmet.

The big up is that the place is clean and attractive enough and the service was polite. But the pizza (we got 2 cheese slices and a medium drink) was lackluster. The crust was a little thick and flavorless and the sauce was a bit on the sweet side and lacked depth. 

Usually "by the slice" places will heat your slice in the oven before presenting it, but we were given two congealed slices right from under the heat lamp.

It was under $7, so for the price, if you're drunk, this gets the job done.  But, if you're looking to actually enjoy a slice of pizza, I'd go elsewhere.

(This review is specifically for the Pizzeria and not the Ristorante, as I've never eaten there and haven't tried anything other than their pizza by the slice.)I read the reviews on Yelp and I almost didn't give this place a try, but I figured since its close and new to me, I wouldn't judge till I tried it. 
Honestly, I wouldn't say the pizza was gross or disgusting by any means. It was just okay... Some reviews mention how it tasted like frozen store bought pizza. I'd say that is very accurate. It wasn't gross, just didn't seem fresh. The crust had to be frozen before they made it. 
DO NOT get the chicken wings, I ate 1 and was finished. They taste just like those frozen chicken wings you get from the freezer section at Walmart. No Bueno!I work in Vegas so sometimes I just want something quick and healthy.  I love their wraps and usually like their smoothies but this time I was not impressed with my smoothie. The smoothie tasted like frozen sugar water.  They need to get to the healthy basics of fruits any nothing else.Awful awful customer service. Aside from not being able to hear your order they constantly repeat back the wrong order. When asked a simple question they pause as if your speaking a foreign language then ask you to repeat it. This situation happen to me twice in one day and 1x today.Service has become slow and poor. Food still ok. We had to ask for water 5 times by walking up to waitress. Took a long time for bill. They need more service help now.The location is great. Right next to LVAC and the tanning salon. I am a fan of Jay Cutler so when he recommended this place I decided to go check it out right away. The food is good; not exceptional but good.
 I was disappointed by the customer service. I will pay extra if the customer service is good. The men at the location were courteous and polite, the woman however, was rude and seemed to be very unhappy working there. 'While looking for a table, the tables were dirty and  I had to clean a table to sit there.
It was a disappointing experience. I guess I expected so much more since Jay Cutler was the one to recommend this spot.This place had some great reviews so I figured I would give the buffet a try. I was really not impressed. First impressions were good in the door, it is nicely decorated and clean. We got there about 7 minutes after the buffet had opened but the food looked like it had already been sitting out a while with skins on the tops. We enjoyed the chicken tikka masala, rice and the naan bread, but everything else was pretty disappointing. I was also surprised they had no desserts besides fruit, most indian buffets I go to at least have rice pudding. We ordered mango lassis as well because they didnt have cold chais...which didnt really taste like mango, they were like white, sour, runny greek yogurt drinks. Honestly, I will not go back, there are much better places in town, perhaps sit down is a better experience.There is nothing exciting about a stale corporate version of Taste of Tops. They have the same beers and are much more expensive than Taste of Tops. Guess the rent on Mill Ave is a lot more than on University a couple of blocks away.  Loud and horrendously bad music doesn't help either.  No food but you can call the local restaurants for delivery, but this is a problem because when the delivery people get there they have no idea on who ordered the food and you can't hear your phone ring so the delivery people just wander around aimlessly.. Also you have Mill Ave parking issues to deal with. They do have a lot of beers to choose from but so does Tops down the street.  My advice, save your wallet and your ears and go to Tops down the street instead.We started out really excited to go to this place, but left feeling sort of deflated about the customer service. 

The decor looked great, background music was a nice indie blend and the place was clean.

When I asked our waitress about the beer selection and that I primarily prefer belgian and wheat ales, she said she couldn't really help me because she only liked hoppy beers since she started working there. She didn't tell me about any of the guest ales on tap (there was an Orange Blossom) or to even help to explain about any of the house beers that would have a low IBU (International Bitterness Units). So I ordered the house root beer. Not bad.

We ordered a pizza for dinner and it was pretty good, but then we waited and waited for the waitress to come around and ask us if we wanted dessert (we did), but she brought us the check (on a slow night with about 12 people in the restaurant) and left before we could even ask her about the desserts. My husband had to go over to the dessert case to get the owner to order our dessert for us. And the tiramisu was really lacking.

Bottom line: For a brewery/restaurant that has been open for more than a few months, I expect better service and consistency than this. Get it together.

Parent Perspective: Two high chairs available (that I saw), two items for the kids' menu and no changing table in the bathroom.The server for our party of 8 left quite a bitter taste in my mouth, Despite her attitude and her general lack of f***'s given, I'd say the food was great. I had pork belly on bed of arugula and a heavenly nut/grain salad that made up for being forced to talk to her scowling face. Why work in the service industry if you insist on making customers feel like they are a massive waste of your time? Lucky for her, the people I went with had class and held it together for the special occasion. 

Honestly, how annoying. 

If I did live in Arizona, I would not go back.Say no to the "IPA"-tastes like Corona!I have a love hate relationship with this place. It's tough to write a review of that. 

It's the closest place to my place of work that's open before 7am so it has that. I like The Coffee Shop at Agritopia because they're cheaper and yummier but I gotta be at work by 7am. Ugh. So here I go.

I will tell you the couple that owns this place are VERY VERY NICE. I like that. I like the looks of the inside, but there's no one there ever. That's sad. But they're nice. The God vibe (lots of church people go here) isn't overpowering for people who don't dig that.

But here are the flaws. There's a barista guy who has dark hair and a goatee who doesn't welcome customers. Twice in a week I went in and was #2 in line. He ignored me. Then people came in behind me and he literally took them before me! I was furious. I've since seen him again and he seems to try to be nice now, but it was very annoying.

Now I have tried 6 drinks in here since July, and I don't like any of them. The pre-med is a good idea but there's a weird taste to it. Ice Mocha, Toddy, everything, has a weird taste. I will keep coming back SEARCHING for a yummy something. I have never eaten here though. Also, costs too much money.Love the concept. This location has vacuums and compressed air stations to help you out after the wash. The customer service here is top notch. Seems to be the same core crew of young men and women. This was an old Danny's Family store. Unfortunately I think they may have just refurbished the existing wash system to make it their own. This wash just does not get your vehicle clean. If you're there to wash away a bit of dust I think it's fine. However, if your vehicle is 'dirty', good luck. Several times I've had to ask to go back through. Also I've noticed an ongoing issue with the compressed air nozzles spitting out a greasy residue. I brought it to an employees attention and they said it would be addressed. On a recent trip the greasy haze was still coming out of the nozzle. Purge and clean the air system? Here's to hoping the owner can address these issues. I really want to like this place. But at this point unless something changes, once my gift card is used up I won't be back.The noise at lunch here left the most distinctive impression on me so I guess the food was good.  I had the arugula salad and a less than flavorful iced tea.  Everyone else enjoyed their food but we all had to shout at each other in order to be heard.  The best part of my experience was leaving.  Come when it's quiet and you might enjoy it more.First time I tried.  It was awesome. But this time it is actually not good.  They also increase the price for 4th July holiday. But the food was worse. Oysters were not fresh. King crabs are small.  We were really disappointed. For almost $70 a person. Totally not worth it. Stay away for good.This show was just ok.  Basically all circus acts that I've seen many times before. There was a trapeze act, juggling, tightrope, gymnasts, and some comedy.  I've seen a few other Cirque shows and this was by far the worst.  Nothing special at all.  I was amazed by the lady who created the sand art.  She was amazing.  I was able to get this show at bogo by playing the myvegas game but it was still 140 for one ticket.  I recommend seeing Le Reve or Mystere any day over this.I generally avoid bars inside casinos...I was certainly into the Public House when they opened though.  They had excellent beer, great screens for viewing, lots of solid food options, and an incredible staff.  ...Fast-forward.  My last couple of experiences have fallen flat.  Specifically the food is not at the same standard, and the service since has been either understaffed or inconsistent.the service was great, the deal was good, the food tasted okay but I was sick for two days after eating here. thats about as much as I can handle at the thought of this placeFirst review on Yelp! 

I used to live right next to the Great Dane in Fitchburg and also have always gone to the Great Dane downtown. When I did live next to the restaurant I ate there 2-3 times a week. (about a year and a half ago) since I moved I always craved their burgers. Recently went back for the first time since and I was deeply disappointing. I rarely eat in since I am never at home I like to eat at my house. I got the Dane burger and all of it was sad. (did not even finish my food) First off I loved their old eco-friendly fiber to-go boxes since they sucked in the condensation and did not make my fries and burger bun soggy. Even tho with the fries soggy they were still good as always. Next my burger was not the same as before seemed like it was half the size and was overcooked. The bun it came with was different then before: stale, huge and gross. On top of everything the lettuce that was on my burger... rotten.

Grew up in the restaurant industry and the quality of this restaurant just went down.Excited to give the House another try since their opening. Our welcome consisted of not being offered the open "champagne" at the front door, because it was not busy enough to warrant a splash. However, there were no outside seating available, yet open tables were visible. 

The appeal of the bar drew us in and we enjoyed a great glass of wine, beer and appetizer.   (Side note) we asked the sophisticated couple next to us their suggestion and all they could say was, food great and cold. Aware that the enjoyable coveted outside seating was not available we decided to order our entree at the bar. ( it is the "House" and dinners are made to be shared) we ordered the Tradori chicken.   Unfortunately, we were denied once again because they only a have certain amount of food for the restaurant and would not allow us to order entrees at the bar.  Needless to say we went to the other less pretentious "House" Eddies.  Bon appetiteCafe rio has great food, but they can never seem to get my order right when I place it through the phone. They don't listen to your specifications and when I ask for extra of anything, they charge but don't provide. I let the manager know that this was the third time they had made my order incorrectly, but she only offered to remake it, when I had told her I was in a rush, hence why I placed the order over the phone. My coworkers also complained that theirs were made incorrectly. You would think they would comp you a meal or something of the sort rather than trying to make you wait for something that should've been made right the first time. If their food didn't taste so good, when made correctly, I probably would not return or recommend it to anyone else.
They definitely have poor management.Was at Target and then had an appointment, so with time to kill, thought I'd treat myself to lunch.

Nice place.  Bright, clean, well-decorated.

Service through-out was very good, if not warm and fuzzy.  Although I seated myself, I had a menu within moments, ice tea came promptly and was kept filled.  Server checked in twice to see if there was anything else I needed.  If there was a service problem before, it's been rectified.

Food: I ordered a chicken gyro and upped to onion rings for 99 cents.  Maybe a bad choice---I can't help but compare what I had at the Summit with the gyros from Greek Pita at Happy Valley.  All I could think was GFS (that's Gordon Food Service)  The chicken was plentiful on the nicely grilled pita, but there was nothing Greek about it.  It tasted like an anonymous herbed chicken breast that comes in a 10 lb bag.  It was okay.  It's probably the same anonymous chicken breast they use for a couple of dishes.  About a tablespoon of small dice tomatoes and two (I counted) slivers of red onion.  The tzatziki came in one of those little lidded plastic cups and if it had any flavor, I could not discern it.  The onion rings were definitely out of a GFS or Costco freezer.  But they were crisply fried and not greasy.  But for flavor and satisfaction, I'd give it a two.  Quantity of food: a 5.

If the level of food had matched the service and cute decor, this place would have been a winner and on my list.  But as it is...  Waaay over priced at $9.99 for the gyro and then the upcharge for the onion rings.  (Lunch for one person was fifteen bucks and some change)  But for that kind of lunch money, I want food that's been prepared for me, not defrosted.  Like I said, I am a fan of Greek Pita and you can't compare what you get from GP for 5.95 to the Summit gyro.

However, maybe I ordered the wrong thing.  Maybe ordering Greek at a Scottsdale "diner" is akin to ordering Italian at Applebees.  You deserve what you get.  

I might try it again, if its the right time and place---maybe another menu item would be better.  I'll let you all know....We walked in for a lunch on Sunday. It happened to be the World Cup and I was surprised that there was availability, but there was. 

We were seated in the bar area and our drinks and appetizers were ordered. This was great and that is where it ended. 

Once our appetizers were ordered our waitress decided to become engrossed doing other things. When she finally did come by we ordered and then we waited for over 30 minutes (easily). When we did get our food the plate was hot but the food was cold. Go figure. 

As far as the food went, it was average. Not bad. However, coupled with that kind of service, no way will I be back.Soot on my pizza, a register Chickie who is too young to serve a beer...

I stopped for a slice...great prices...good sauce...outstanding crust and toppings...BUT YOU GOT SOOT ON MY CHEESE!

Because of your airport location and the number of people always in line, as well as my getting the slice to go so I had something to eat on the plane, I was unable to take the slice back and show it to someone who could do something about it.

Your prices are very fair, your pizza certainly has potential...anything you can do to educate the person who got soot on my pizza will help.

Yer gonna save yourself a WHOLE lot of time and gain more customers if you get someone old enough to pour a beer to run the register.  That way, the folks who order a beer can pay, get their beer and receipt and clear the register to help the next customer.  Having to wait while the cashier gets someone old enough to pull a beer is not an effective use of time or personnel...WHO: Those of you curious about them MEATBALLS! 

WHEN: Not too sure about the time range they are open. Their website says they are open for breakfast, lunch, and late dining.

WHERE: Located inside Townsquare, right beside the AMC theater.

WHAT: Going to and from the theater, this spot always seemed to catch my eye. So, one night after a movie, my friend and I decided to check it out. My friend had already gone here once, but she hadn't tried the meatballs... so... CHALLENGE ACCEPTED! 

We walked in knowing we were going to try the meatballs. While looking at the menu, I noticed they were actually pretty pricey. $9.99 for 3 regular sized meatballs and your choice of sauce on top. We decided to try the meatball sampler (6 meatballs for $17.99) with parmesan cream on top... 

Conclusion.
Not any of the 6 meatballs positively caught my taste buds =(. NO BUENO!It gets the job done.  What do you want, it's a Sbarro's.  

If you want something that's different than the traditional pizza, try a stromboli.  Unlike pizza, it's .... okay, it's basically tubular pizza.  But it's good!

My only beef with Sbarro's is really a beef with the food court it's part of:  The iced tea they serve at the fountain is UNDRINKABLE.  I'm taking off a star for it.  I actually had to pour my tea out and drink water, it was so vile.  There were two fountains, and I tried the tea in both places, and it was equally horrible out of both fountains. 

In an era in which even Jack in the Box manages to serve excellent iced tea, you need to up your game, Sbarro's Food Court!I loved the Garden and I loved all the friendly people who waited on us.   I am sorry but I did not like the food.  I had Natural Chicken which was really a Cornish Hen which I do not like to eat.  It was not tender.  The Mashed ( pureed ) potatoes were good.  I liked the Brussel Sprouts but I like mine a little more cooked.  The coffee was good, the wait time was long.Small tacos, high prices, and dumb policies.... Trying reeeeal hard to be nice and give them that second star.

I was here a few months ago but drunk out of my mind and I couldn't have written my Yelp-worthy review based on my tipsy experience. I decided to stop by the other day and I guess you have to be drunk to really appreciate this place.

Located off Flamingo and Rainbow, Pepe's is a 24 hour taco/Mexican fast food spot in the same vein as Robertos. They have about 6 or 7 different types of meat for their tacos along with plenty of burritos, combo plates, and other standard Mexican offerings.

The tacos were small and at about two bucks a pop definitely not worth it. They only use one small corn tortilla so everything gets soggy and falls out on the plate. =( booo! The carne asada was lacking in flavor and a little dry, likewise the chorizo was nothing memorable. The salsa bar was a disaster when we came in. The two watery sauces they had were splashed all over the place added little flavor to the tacos. 

What really disappointed me about Pepe's were their stupid policies. 50 cents charge for using a credit card, 30 minute limit for eating-in and they even had the nerve to post  sign on the soda fountain about extra charges if you are caught sharing a drink. All these rules and fees make eating their mediocre food more of a hassle than it should be.

If you are looking for an authentic tacos hit up Tacos El Gordo, better tacos, cheaper prices, no stupid rules.This is a good, convenient location and has great deals on sodas and coffees. They also have a good automatic car wash available and discounts on the wash if you buy gas.

The down side is that this location is a nightmare to navigate. The parking lot is always congested and is poorly set up, it is hard to find parking, and when you get in the store is crowded and hard to move around in. This location needs a serious remodel in my opinion.Sorry Gordon but English pub food is for wankers. You don't serve Breakfast and the music is too loud for a Sunday at noon. Get rid of those high top tables also in front or tell your hostess not to seat people there that early in the day.  The lamb burger is a big gooey mess with that goat cheese. Your fries could be a little more crispy too .I was informed of this place (also called The Hop Stop) when I was given a menu while I was attending Glendale Glitters. I was initially very interested in eating there because they had clam chowder in a bread bowl, my ultimate favorite food. About a month or so later my boyfriend and I decided to go for a bite here since we live right down the street. It was bad from the start... When the waitress was taking our drink orders I asked for a Dr. Pepper which she didn't even know if they had and had to check in the back (which they didn't). Then comes the food order and of course I asked for the clam chowder which they didn't have either... So I decided to go with the strawberry salad instead and guess what? No strawberries. So I half-heartedly ordered the tortilla soup in the bread bowl and my boyfriend ordered the BBQ burger without onions. The soup was okay... It could've used salt which wasn't available at the table and our waitress was nowhere to be found, and my boyfriends burger came with a ton of onions.... It's a cute place but we were definitely disappointed and won't be coming back.I used to hit this spot for my pho cravings since its super convienent to mi casa. It has now been taken over and things have changed but not for the better. i went for the Pad Thai since it is usually a good test for me to determine if i will be back again. It was ok...nothing that knocked me off my feet which of course saddened my Thai loving heart.

Pho Ao Sen, I'm not sure what happened but i Miss you and wish you didn't leave.Got a Cole Turkey and the Bobbie, because they roast their own turkeys in house, and The turkey meat itself was pretty good - the problem is that they drenched the turkey in so much mayo and Russian dressing and then the coleslaw had a lot of mayo in it, I had to pull out just the meat and actually dry the meat off

The amount of fat in the mayo, russian dressing, and coleslaw was insane I could feel my heart slowing looking at it,. after a couple paper towels of wipe down - there was very little actual meat on the sandwich (a medium) and it was mainly bread and sauce 

The bread was nothing special - this turned out to be highly disappointing, they certainly are not the best sandwich shop on the block much less the country

The Bobbie was also drenched in mayo but less so, and that one had more meat was better put together and the Mrs liked it

The cookies were just ok to me however the Mrs enjoyed the sugar one quite a bit 

Unlikely we will be back, if we ever do we will certainly ask for all sauces on the side

It is a shame because they have good quality turkey meat pulled from a real turkey and hide it with bad bread and sauces, sometimes less is moreNothing here stands out and makes me want to go again. 

It wasn't that far out of what Red, White, and Blue had to offer. 

This place is NOT vegetarian friendly. The chef was nice enough to make our party specialty items (off menu) to satisfy. 

I ordered a flat iron steak. It wasn't bad, but this also isn't a steak house - it's like an upscale cafe....maybe. 

I did really like the beer selection! Although no beers are on tap, all bottled.Can do way better. Service sucks. Definitely needs to be cleaned up way more. It's pretty ghetto, here. Definitely don't gamble hereEveryone seems to have the same comment about this place... "You get what you pay for". 

My best friend and I went during the week and stayed here for 2 days. We upgraded and still only paid $35/night... but that's about the only good thing about the stay. 

To start off on a positive note, they let us check in at 10:30 when normal check-in wasn't until 4, so that was EXTREMELY helpful. The front desk and bell hop were all very nice, as well as the valet. Room service wasn't available the ONE time I had called, so we didn't call again during the visit. The runner was on lunch so he was unable to provide room service for one hour. In our minds, if you have someone go on lunch, HAVE SOMEONE ELSE COVER HIM!! 

The room was VERY basic. Very old, paint was chipping on the dresser and nightstand. The door to the balcony was broken. Though it was nice to have a balcony, there's an outdoor club of some sort that was outside of our window that was going until 4am every night. It was completely obnoxious to the people staying at the hotel.

Our bathroom had good lighting, and the shower was clean and nice. The downside to the bathroom is that our toilet didn't have a lid. We thought that was pretty unsanitary. 

The elevators were DISGUSTING. Made me not want to go back up to my hotel room just because I didn't want to take the elevator! They were EXTREMELY dirty and smelt like pee. You would HOPE someone walked in there with WAY too much perfume or cologne on so that it masked the smell of a bum.

All 3 days we were seeing advertisements to the restaurant they have called "Quesadilla" and so on the third day we decided to go, when we got up to the 5th floor the restaurant WAS CLOSED. It was 4pm on a Wednesday! 

Checkout was VERY easy, all we had to do was leave our room keys in the room, so that was nice.

Overall, a very awful hotel. I think that this hotel has potential (for the price) when it's done, but plain and simple it should NOT be open yet!Good beer list, but the menu and service are poor at best.Wow, we got absolutely terrible service. The only reason that this place is getting more than one star is that the good was great. 

When we first sat down, I asked about the happy hour specials and was told what they were but that we couldn't get them and would have to pay full price because we were seated inside. I told the hostess three times that I wanted outside as he was bringing us in, but I didn't want to make a fuss about it. We asked to be moved and the girl said that would not be possible, but what we could do is go to the bar. My friend and I went up to the bar to get our happy hour specials while our third friend who doesn't drink waited at the table. While we were getting out drinks three different people came up to my friend who was still at the table asking what the problem was and where we were and what we were doing. They were so rude to her she wanted to leave.

Pro-tip: if you offer different prices at different spots in your restaurant people will go for the cheapest.

The rest of the time the waitress was very rude to us and even ignored me several times when I asked for our check. I don't want to come back here if I can help it.I have mixed feelings about Halo... On one hand, I got my puppy here and he is a good dog, but on the other, our actual experience was not very good. We went one day to look at dogs with the thought that we might adopt. They have a lot of dogs here and the conditions aren't wonderful. A lot of the dogs are in indoor/outdoor cages that were very dirty when we went. The dogs kept indoors were 3-4 per cage. We filled out the paperwork to meet some of the dogs we had seen and handed them to the man at the counter. Then we preceded to wait....and wait....and wait. Not wanting to be impatient, I finally went up to ask how much longer it would be. Oh, they lost my paperwork. Great. We refilled out the paperwork and finally got taken back to see the dogs. The people who work/volunteer here weren't very knowledgeable, but helped as much as they could. We found a dog that would be a good match and his adoption fee was 185$... a lot more than the Humane Society. I understand, but it seemed a little steep. We took our pup home and fed him the food they sent home with us. He wouldn't eat. He wouldn't eat for a week. We thought maybe it was an adjustment period. That is until we fed him a different food and he ate it all. How long had he been at the shelter refusing to eat? I know he had been there at least a week. That just made me sad. Additionally, unlike the Humane Society, Halo does not include a vet visit with adoption, so that is unfortunate, as many animals do have initial medical needs. I don't know that I would adopt here again, but I did get a good pup and am thankful for finding him.


PS The dog was listed as black and white and indeed looked that way....that is until we washed him and he turned out to be brown and white.... would've been nice if they rinsed these poor dogs off. Just a thought.I work in this area every Friday, and every Friday I go to Paradise Bakery or the new Wildflower location for a salad. I decided to try Which Wich to break out of my routine.

I shouldn't have.

It wasn't the unique way to order your sandwich (on a preprinted paper bag), it wasn't the 15 minute wait to get my sandwich, it wasn't the employees...it was the sandwich.

Now, let me say, the bread that my sandwich was on was excellent! It was soft and chewy and crusty...GREAT bread! And the quality of the meat (I had turkey) was phenomenal! But...I needed my glasses to actually FIND the meat! Literally had to go searching for it. I also ordered avocado (for an extra charge) on my sandwich, and it was a spread, not slices. The caramelized onions I had added were tough and unpleasant as well, and the 'spicy' mayo was absent. I was more than a little disappointed.

I paid $10.18 for a 7 inch sandwich, chips and a drink. I usually pay a little under $10.00 for my salad from Paradise or Wildflower, and I take half home. I was expecting so much more from Which Wich, and received so much less.

I'll stick to my usual lunch spots.Be glad you got two stars...it definitely was NOT for the service, the waiter, or the portions.  We were really excited to try this place...we had been fans of Dillons and the countless other restaurants in this spot and went with an open mind.  First off, it was noon on Monday and there were only two other tables with customers.  It took forever for service, our waiter was not helpful, in fact, we ordered our appetizer and he assumed we'd want it with our lunch (you know what they say about when you ASS-UME).  We had to ask for silverware - he brought out two of the lunches and did not return with the other two.  He finally brought out one more and totally spaced the fourth.  The portion...another ASSUMption.  My friends did not order lunch portions, they ordered off the regular menu and when we questioned we were told the computer ASSUMES you want lunch.  Communication, caring, personality would have made this such a better experience especially since we live nearby and would love to frequent the place.  Have to say, the food was good.  I LOVED my appetizer,  which came eventually.I usually don't write bad reviews, but I was very disappointed with the food and service here! My husband and I came here last night (Monday) around 8:00 before going to see Mystere.  I ordered the classic hamburger with cheese (for $16) and their $5 special margarita. The burger was VERY bland! It was under seasoned and overcooked. The margarita was ok. It was worth $5. My husband said his Philly cheese steak sandwich was good, but he ordered a coke which he never received until after he got his food because the waitress forgot. After we got our food the waitress never came back to the table and my husband needed a refill on his coke. We had both finished our food before she came back to the table and my husband had to ask for the refill and for the check. She never apologized for not refilling his coke sooner, just acted flustered when my husband asked for it. Btw, this was not a busy Monday night. When she came back, she refilled his coke and put the check on the table. And the coke was flat. Like it literally tasted like watered down syrup. I thought for sure she would have taken the coke off the bill, but she didn't. AND the coke was $3.75!!! I feel like we would have had better food and service for a cheaper price at Denny's! I guess we should have said something, but I hate complaining when I just want to have an enjoyable time. I understand that we ate at one of the "cheaper" places in Treasure Island, but for a $16 burger I felt like it should have tasted better than what you would get at a hospital cafeteria. And for a coke that cost $3.75, it should have been refilled when we still had our food, and not flat! And for a $45 overall bill, the waitress should have at least been friendly. We didn't tip and I ALWAYS tip even if the experience isn't that great, as long as the servers are nice and food is ok. I would have tipped if the coke had been taken off the bill. Also, as we were walking away from the table we saw the bus boy counting out the money we left right there at the table in front of all the other guests! Like taking it out and counting it out on the table! Seriously? Not what I expected from a restaurant in Treasure Island. They need to step it up!Basically it's the old Centurion tower at Caesar's Palace.  The place just opened not too long ago but it seems like they did mostly cosmetic upgrades.  The rooms were of standard size in that price range. 

The room is pretty simply decorated and gives a more zen feeling which is expected for a Japanese inspired hotel.  The room still smelled of paint and was quite dusty.  For the room we got, there were some problems with the thermostat in that it wasn't working.  Plus the engineer that came by at 4am to try to fix this problem said that he didn't think they changed the windows neither, and that's why there's a small draft coming into the room from the outside as well.  It took  2 hours to get some extra blankets.  These are the reasons why my thought is that they only did cosmetic upgrades.  None of the internals, HVAC, electrical plumbing upgrades were done.

When we were checking out, we complained to the front desk about the problems since they even took the room off the market since they knew it was having major problems that they wouldn't want to have other paying customers face.  We spoke to the receptionist and they said that a manager would call the cell phone number on that account.  Never got the phone call and this was at 2pm.  When we left the hotel later, 11pm, we told them that the manager never called.  Got stuck there for another hour, couldn't get a refund and their compensation was that we could book a bigger suite the next time we come at the cheapest room rate.   I would have just preferred to stay at Encore like I normally do, but wanted to give them a try since I love Nobu's food so much.  Not too happy about the customer service that never seems to lack at any of the Nobu Matsuhisa restaurants.  Extremely disappointed.It was good of the owner to comment on my post. They mentioned we stayed for another hour....yes waiting for our next beer and an order of putine for my brother. I did have to hunt the manager/owner(?) down. She did not find me. I understand they were slammed. We were polite and tried to have a good time anyway. The beer and putine were eventually served after I actually went BACK to the owner and complained after a LONG wait (during which our beers weren't served to us). I don't hold any ill will against the establishment, but I won't be returning. I WILL also tell of my experience.Goodness gracious ! 

Getting in was not a problem, in fact we were lucky to be comped 2 bottles and placed right next to deadmau5 dj arena! We drank the two bottles and were getting shimmy to the left and then eventually other people took over. 
I later was accused by a bartender who i earlier had complimented on how nice she looked (which i never do) ! She blamed me for being the girl she told apparently 3 x not to sit at a certain area of the table! 

I was than kicked out of the table and i pulled the rest of the girls with me! It was soo annoying! 

On top of that they over pact the club so going to the restroom alone, was as if we were in a sardine can, it was just plane terrible!Ugh... cramped quarters with the bizarre pool table room, hip hop room and large DJ area. Came to see Tiesto and maybe it was the crowd with a few serious douchebags... Tiesto killed it though so props to him. Probably wouldn't be back unless it was to see Calvin Harris. Hopefully they can make some changes on capacity and $9 for a mini bottle of Fiji. Meh overallSalads are good - but everything is very expensive and the manager treats the employees like dirt.  I've seen it first hand multiple times.I stopped in to this location with a co-worker for a bite during lunch.  Always on the lookout for good sushi, we decided to give this place a try.  The results were less than stellar.

We both felt the service lacked somewhat.  Not on the server side, but on the food delivery side.  We both felt the service was sort of slow, despite the restaurant being mostly empty.

I ordered smoked salmon nigiri, seared tuna tataki salad and a baked scallop roll.  The Tuna salad was large, but seemed to be doused in a lot of sauce that was sort of vinegar-like.  It was too much for me.  Additionally, the tuna was brown with visible white connective tissue veins.  I did not finish this dish.  

The baked scallop roll was one of the lessor examples of the dish I have had.  Using what appeared to be regular US-style mayo, straight, and little, if any additives made for a roll that any untrained person could execute at home without any flair or problem.

On the flip side, the smoked salmon nigiri was tasty and well portioned.

I also ordered a desert I had never heard of, tempura or deep fried cheese cake.  This peaked my interest and I explored.  Once delivered, it dawned on me that I was looking at a close cousin of a churro drizzled with chocolate sauce and whipped cream (see a photo I have posted).  It was initially tasty, but lost its attractiveness as I consumed more.  It's high sweetness load, combined with the outer "fried" layer made for a bad finish.  This is a desert that would probably appeal more to children at a party.

Overall, not my best sushi experience, but not my worst.  Since I always believe that everyone has a bad day, I will keep this one on my second chance list.I bought a LivingSocial deal to this place for $45 for two hours of cleaning. I know I didn't specifically request deep cleaning but I really wonder what the hell the girl was doing for two hours. I recently moved out of a house and called on these people to do a move out clean. I figured with no furniture and nothing to dust, it wouldn't take that long to clean the kitchen and bathrooms. I didn't go inside to inspect the house until after the girl left but when I did, I was sorely disappointed. First off, she was 45 minutes late (okay, I get that things happen, but at least give me a call so I'm not sitting there waiting). Secondly, the bathroom cleaning was a joke. The microwave wasn't cleaned. The ceiling fans weren't cleaned. I mean I think she just cleaned the floors and vacuumed. She maybe ran a dust cloth over the counters. It was a joke. I've vacuumed my house before and it takes a total of 20 minutes...MAYBE 30 minutes. I have no idea what this chick was doing for 2 hours but I know I'll never call them again. 

The thing is, I told the people when I scheduled that I was moving out and obviously I understand I only paid for 2 hours and didn't necessarily expect it to be in 2 hours so I was prepared to pay the difference. I'm irritated that I bought this deal. I should've known better and just paid full price to get it done. Now I have to go back and clean up. Beyond annoyed with these people. 

They get +1 star because they have an automated email that confirms your appointment...but it doesn't matter because she'll show up late anyway.We were very excited to have a new steakhouse in the neighborhood that excitement quickly subsided when we sat down and began to turn to dread when it took our server 15 minutes to make it to our table and when she was there her mind was elsewhere she seemed distracted and it then became evident when our MEDIUM steaks showed up bloody rare! I mean they were mooing. We informed her and it seemed like sending them back was a total inconvenience. If your gonna go out and spend the money on a good steak just go to Flemings or even Outback for that matter. The 2 stars are basically for the friendly bartender we had, we shoulda just ate at the bar when she asked us.I have been eating here since the late 90's when I was in college. I watched them grow from one small room to two. I was so excited to try their new location. I came in after work alone on a Thursday night and sat at the bar. I was excited to see the great beer selection. I ordered a vanilla porter. It was quite tasty. It took awhile to put a food order in but the food came out pretty fast. I had the orange chicken and a teriyaki egg roll. Both where very good. My beer was gone by this point and I was never offered water. I sat and sat and sat and sat with zero service. My bartender a female with sunglasses on her head ignored me and the only other guy sitting on the one side of the bar. A bartender asked him eventually what he wanted but
Didnt acknowledge me. Finally the female bartender asked if I wanted another beer I said no just a to go container and my tab. I am seriously disappointed. So my one piece of advice is call in a to go and pick it up yourself. Don't waster your time with the terrible customer service!!  Ug. Terrible!!New Revolving sushi in town and a Groupon for it. . . . SOLD! After buying this Groupon deal online we came here last night for dinner. The decor and style of the restaurant was very hip and colorful. The layout of the establishment was horrible. If you were sitting in the inner bar and wanted to use the restroom. You had to walk all the way around and over, Just to get to it. 

The service was awesome; friendly and helpful. Thank you, Carlos.  

The food: Let's just say I enjoyed the coconut shrimp and fried rice more than the sushi. The sushi was very SMALL portioned and bland - I've been to many revolving sushi establishments around town and never seen/had such a small amount of sushi on a plate for the same price.

PS if it hadn't been for the great service, this place would have gotten a one star.Time to update the reviews on this place. Me and wife wanted some sushi again, we showed up..glad to see the place was packed and looks like its doing really well for itself.

Something has somewhat changed here. The decor still rocks, but the atmosphere seems some what lacking. 

Customer Service: seemed to have slipped here, as with so many patrons that it looks disorganized with 3 people cleaning and resetting a table when there are customers who are waiting for orders or drink refills such as I was. 

We also ordered off the menu and it took nearly 15 minutes to bring out half and we never received an avocado roll that was ordered which we waited for 30 minutes for. Our waiter also disappeared for a little bit and none of the other waiters were able to fill his role or help out with the table. 

Also one last thing that the workers all seemed unhappy and gave a weird unwelcoming vibe.

Food Quality Does not match pricing any more:
They also seemed to have raised the prices now to the point where they are trying to match higher end restaurants. Such as the unagi which I can get for $4-$6 for about 4 pieces here its $4 for a plate for 3 in small sizes. There are hardly any $1 white places and my wife loves avocado rolls which there are none to be seen. 

I hope they get their act together soon and reestablish the values it had when it first opened, as me and wife had previously enjoyed this place.Well they gave us bacon instead of Canadian bacon. Bad start to new place.Its kinda loud for my taste, but their drinks are good and so is the food. 
FYI...Portions aren't great so if you got a healthy appetite, this ain't the place for you! Caveat: the chips and salsa are fresh and somewhat filling. A possible solution to the small portions? You decide.
I think they've got an interesting location, and a building with great possibilities. I think they haven't quite hit their stride yet.
I'll keep checking in to see what gives.this place was a fun,  cheap food, cheap drinks,  fun games.   unfortunately we had to leave because our friend was denied entry.   he committed the blasphemous sin of wearing so called ''athletic sandals'' instead of flip flops.  at least,  that's the distinction the bouncer made sure to make so that we understood clearly his rational for standing his ground against the evil athletic sandals.  i'm just thankful my friend wasn't arrested for such offensive behavior.   i mean,  footwear is a number one priority in 100 degree heat.  so just make sure to call ahead and send several snap shots of your foot apparel over for approval before trying to play skeeball.   they don't play here.  oh,  and be sure not to close the door to the patio.   you'll be looked out and the bros on their cellphones will be too cool to hear you banging o the door for help.If you're a fan of Michael Jackson, you'll enjoy the show.  They preformed a wide variety of his music with some nice visualizes.

If you're like me and a fan of Cirque du Soleil, skip this one.  This show was seriously lacking in the acrobatic, strength, and balance displaces that are associated with that name.  It is almost completely a song and dance show.BUST!!! Everyone is over hyping this place. Anyone who says this place is good doesn't know what they're talking about~~~~
I gave this place 2 tries to change my mind or even possibly improve on their product but I was wrong both times; I was unsatisfied with what they were serving "fluff" or "snow cream" ice. 
Before coming to this place I tried two places "Frostbites Shavery (now called Snowflakes Shavery)" and "The Little Kitchen Cafe" both places serve what I think it suppose to be real fluff ice. Kuma tastes nothing like the real thing. I'm not saying I'm an expert on fluff ice or snow cream but I know what taste bad. Kuma's product is very grainy and more equivalent to frozen yogurt. The toppings provided aren't even fresh and the combinations given don't even sound appetizing. The only positive thing about this place is the branding of the company.My fiancé and I only came here because it was the only thing available at the time. No matter where I go, I always keep an open mind, especially at 130am. 

We were seated, went over the menu and I had a couple questions for our waitress. I asked if they could make a tuna sandwich instead of turkey. No, as we don't have tuna in the kitchen. Okay, that's fine. 

I kept on looking and saw a nacho appetizer. Awesome, I love nachos with some added chicken for protein. Joked with my fiancé saying she would say no again. I went ahead and asked, again, as I predicted, she said no. Not because there was no chicken in their kitchen, it was simply because they couldn't; didn't want to. 

I was already in a very shitty mood and had a blt sandwich. It was mediocre. 

In a city that has everything, this place in particular does not have the option to personalize. 

Anyone else that is looking for them to accommodate their simple food requests, go somewhere else. This place WILL NOT!I really wanted to love this place, but it wasn't great. We stopped hear before we saw Boys II Men at the Mirage for dinner. I had dirty burps all night, which has never happened to me. I love Italian food, and this was a disappointment. Go to Battista's Hole in the Wall instead, trust me.So you know when you hear those excessive ads on the radio it'll get to you sooner or later. My roommate and I ventured here and we were clearly in Ravens territory. It's a casual joint with TVs and a bar that opens out to the patio as well. I'm a seafood lover and was really excited to try everything. We started with 2 dozen happy hour oysters priced at $1 a piece. That was refreshing. Then we ordered bacon wrapped scallops in which you can't go wrong with that. Their crabs and clams were just "ok" maybe because it's not in season. The size of the seafood items were rather small. However, their crab cakes were decent. Overall, we weren't impressed with the food. Food quality price ratio is definitely not great our bill came close to $90.Uh, I was expecting something like Curry House back home in Hawaii, especially considering the decor looked like a downgraded version, but I was awfully disappointed. I had the curry udon with chicken karage and the portions were pretty small, for the price you pay definitely not worth it. The chicken karage also tasted funny. All in all, I probably would not come back.St James Centre is always busy.  At least, that's how it feels whenever I'm there.  It's busy and filled with loads of mediocre shops that I pass by without even noting, on my way to John Lewis.

In my opinion, John Lewis is just about the only redeemable shop in the St James Centre, and its location right next to Multrees Walk, Edinburgh's poshest shopping street, is bizarre.  

To be fair, the fact that it seems always busy here (especially when it's raining - NEVER COME HERE WHEN IT'S RAINING) certainly indicates that I am in the minority in my opinion and if you like Dorthy Perkins and Next and the rest, then it's absolutely convenient to have them available in the city centre instead of having to trek out to Ocean Terminal or that place near Sighthill.  Having said that, the spaces for these stores is quite small which means that everything it jammed in and quite tight.

So no, not a place for me, but certainly a place I pass through on a regular basis.We are Las Vegas locals and have tried nearly every steak house in the valley.  We were excited to try Heritage Steak due its convenient location as we were seeing a show that night at the Mirage.  We were greeted cordially by three female greeters that were dressed professionally and were promptly seated.  The section we were in was moderately busy but not bustling.  The visual ambience was very nice architecturally and was warm and inviting.  The background music was too loud and it was difficult to have a conversation over it.  The cooks/chefs were wearing baseball caps, which really detracted from the elegance of the restaurant.  Once we were seated, we were given the choice of bottle water or house water.  The water was served promptly.  Unfortunately we were not greeted by our waiter for over 15 minutes so we decided to go sit at the bar.  As we were getting up, our waiter swooped in and laid on numerous excuses as to why we were not greeted by him shortly after we were seated.  He assured us that we would have a fine dining experience and there was no reason for us to go sit at the bar.  We acquiesced and elected to allow him to serve us.  We ordered the surf and turf with a medium rare filet and onions rings.  The king crab was well prepared and the onion rings were very flavorful.  Our steak was overcooked to medium well and charred externally.  We informed the waiter that the steak was overcook and again he patronized us with excuses for the chefs.  He brought us a new steak that was prepared rare instead of medium rare but edible.  The seasonings on the steak were very well blended and flavorful and the texture and cut of the steak was average for a prime filet.  The waiter was quite transparent with his banter with us and it was somewhat awkward.  The manager never came and apologized for poorly cooked steak.  Overall, it is highly unlikely that we will be dining at this establishment again.Just got back. I had the grilled vegetable salad. It was small and didn't have enough dressing. The waitress didn't come back to see how everything was till we were done.  My friend had the grilled chicken. Nothing special. Kind if foo foo food. Not a big fan. Food was fair, service poor. Wont go back.Will give Echo & Rig another try because our steaks were amazing, perfectly cooked and flavored. Unfortunately, the service was not up to par. We dined downstairs, early dinner. We watched as one couple left because there was no server in sight. When  one popped up, we seemed to haven disturb her. Took our order, no follow up, just the check.Read all the good reviews so I figured I would try it out.  I have tried the gyro:  overcooked and not very good, the chicken shwarama:  just plain old stuff and not very good, and the jalapeno hummus which was average but the pita with it was like cardboard - thin and stale.  No way is this place even an average Greek/Mediterranean place.Had a short break for work, so I decided while I'm in the Container Park I'll give this place a shot. Didn't have much time so I called ahead and placed an order for the Al Pastor Burrito. I arrived at Pinches Tacos 30-40 minutes later to find out my order was never made. Very disappointing. My food was ready about 10 minutes later. The burrito was decent sized, and came with a side order of tortilla chips. I think the situation warranted a free beer, but I was too hungry to complain. The burrito was pretty good! Definitely gets the job done while you're visiting the park. Prices are average, and the menu had a big selection. However, if you're looking for the best burritos in town, I highly recommend Cardenas.Boozery has a great view of the stage.  The drinks are pricy, for a gin & tonic, a screw driver and a Heffinwieter the cost was $27.00 that's in plastic cups and no garnishes.     Seems like either they are trying get rich on every drink or the overhead is way to much.    It's a shame it has great potential as a business. We will be back to container park for the food and music, just NOT for the Booz from Boozery!   Very pricy for what you get!  The beer at the BQ joint is cheaper.First time awesome.  Second time two weeks later not so good. Out of wine and changed the short ribs in a bad way.  We will go to grass roots next time.  Bummer had high hopes.There were definitely a few problems that were found here. Upon entering our room, every time there was this weird smell. It was either a clean smell or just a genuinely bizarre scent. Then, the wifi did not work well at all, the connection was slow and kept on cutting in and out. On our last night of three here, there emerged a leak from the ceiling of the bathroom. Overall, we did get a great deal on this place, and it was in a convenient location, but these problems did dampen our stay (literally).If a neighborhood Chicago bar had gambling, this would be it. The low-limit tables are the only asset I can see. Go for the people watching and to practice without losing a fortune.Good lunch or hang out spot for sure. Hipster approved. Had an order of fish tacos. Not so impressed. Very bland, nothing special. At almost $4 each for a "street taco" I would expect a bit more discovery in the taste bud area. However, the tortilla soup was great. Service on the other hand was mildly annoying. Three different employees came to our table during the meal. I'm not quite sure who was the server, the runner, the busser. The one I'm assuming was the server took our order, stopped by once and ...poof. Never saw the person again. We were left sitting with empty dishes and that we-need-to-get-back-to-work-look on our faces way too long. Everyone was nice, but the restaurant manager needs to tighten up the service process if one expects weekday/workday lunch crowd approval.I had high hopes that this place was on the same level as Salt River in feel and character but I sure did not have that after visiting it last night.  Maybe as I never have been at Wrigley I am missing some of the customized elements.

By far the biggest issue, minus the stupid prices for t-shirts and concessions, is the exceedingly poor scoreboard.  We sat in the lower level of the first base side and had a heck of a time reading the scoreboard.  Here are my gripes on the scoreboard:

Too small to be useful
At night it is not very well lighted so seeing the non-lighted sections is impossible
About 1/3 was being used for advertising
No stats provided for the batter (take a lesson from Salt River)
The line up on the left side did not highlight the batter but with the letters so small it would not be of much use.

By the way the parking lot lighting but there was no signage as to how to exit and the entrance was blocked off!  

I never have been to a ballpark above a crude kids field that did not have the distances from home plate to the outfield fence shown with signs hanging on the fence.My G/F and I went here after reading reviews I have to say it's just another disappointment in an expensive steak. The wait staff was attentive but our particular waitress didn't seem to knowledgable about the menu. She was fumbling and just had to think a lot about certain ?s I asked. In a place like this the service should be professional and top notch. It simply was not in our case. 

Also the steak I was wanting they were already out of for the night. I hoped to order the dry aged ribeye. But I had to settle for the bone in ribeye that is not dry aged. When it came out it honestly was a little tough even though being ordered med rare not at all what I expected for a $60 steak. It just was blah really did not have much flavor to it at all. It was really a shame because I think I could do better at home on my grill. 

We also had crab cakes which were tasty and grilled asparagus which didn't have much flavor either. Loaded baked potatoe was pretty good. Lava cake for dessert was good also. 

With 1 glass of wine and tip our bill came to $175. Considering I didn't get the steak I asked for the least I thought they could do was comp and app. Or a glass of wine for us. Just an expensive chain restaraunt I don't see what all the fuss is about. 

We honestly could have had a better meal at a place in southern highlands called Off the strip. They steak was about the same quality I could have gotten there for 40% less $$ the sides are just as good. The same meal there prob would be under $100 for the 2 of us. No one came around asking how is the food. I really should have sent the steak back and gotten something else. The waitress just asked how it was cooked and if I needed anything else. Never suggested or offered any sauces. I cut into it and it looked fine just didn't have any flavor. If she had come back around I prob would have said something. Just saying for $175 I expected a lot better. Just call it like I see it...This place has an identity crisis and needs to decide who it is and fast - cafeteria or full serve ? gourmet or processed fast food pizza ? right now it's using "some" canned ingredients .(pineapple / tomatoes etc.) and "processed" (powdered parmesan etc.) toppings - they are displayed on shelves and I asked about them.  Also, the serving method is just bizarre - why walk your order up to a cashier and don't pay yet - you delivered everything else to my table including food - then... I end up paying at the table anyway ??

Such a nice restaurant and fine staff - decide who you are and pull the trigger - and please lower your prices if not fresh ingredients and sticking with the 1/3 cafeteria style ?? Such potential - a real shame really.Great location, great enough space, welcoming decor.... BUT...

Food didn't impress me..
I got bunless for I had given up bread for lent.. I got a Turkey Brunch (Turkey Burger with Fried Egg, Bacon, and American Cheese). Meat wasn't dry, but it wasn't moist.. I like my burgers to where a sauce would be extra flavoring. This burger NEEDED sauce, in my case, ketchup... Bacon had a weird taste to it. The egg wasn't to my liking, then again the waitress/cashier didn't really bother asking how I like my eggs.. I had to ask for lettuce on the side when my food came... Instead of being on my plate already because you order, pay THEN sit..

To also add that waitress messed up my coworker and I's orders..

Overall the place is just "ok"... I don't really care for it..Updated:  opened at 10:00 and a sidewalk sign was placed in front of the unmarked ticket window that faced west only. 

Lots of details yet to be worked. 

Review:

Gave it two stars because it looks great. 
Did not get the experience they failed to open as advertised. 

Came to do the Linq, seems they are not ready for prime time. At 9:30 am being worked on and not open to public as advertised. 

  Signage could use some work as well, ticket office is about 100 ft west of wheel. People will need more guidance for parking and for reaching the office. 

Also, the hours are not posted on the door of the ticket office of the entrance to the ride. 

The only thing open and running at full blast is the music for the outdoor shops.  
No talking please. 

Note at the east end the Yard House has it's own outdoor music competing with the mall music.No. Just no. 

So small inside. When I sat down to eat my food in the corner I felt like I was in time out. Dead on a Friday night. 

Ordered the #2. Three different mini burritos. Great way to showcase three times in one visit that I don't like your food. We were told the salsas were spicy but they weren't. Chips were ok, a little salty. My burritos that had meat inside (pork and beef) were very dry. Not appetizing to me. My husband had a breakfast burrito and said they used fake eggs which is a pet peeve. 

We won't go back- Rubios is around the corner with $1.50 fish tacos on Tuesdays that are actually yummy. Sorry America. I don't like the food.We tried chicken & carne burritos & a salad. Really good flavors across the board. Food itself is fine, no complaints there. Major problem is their service & line setup - it wasn't all that busy the day we tried it and yet they rushed us through the line like there was a fire. I get the fast casual concept, but that was ridiculous! There's no point in pushing people through choices when there was a bottleneck at the cashier and we didn't get our food any sooner had they taken a second to clearly explain options or give us a chance to even see what all toppings are available (they didn't design the queue well and you don't see your options until you're right on top of them). Staff didn't communicate well & just about made the wrong burrito before my family noticed and spoke up. Also they just assumed everyone wanted rice & didn't ask. Price is high too for what you're getting. Chipotle & Costa Vida are superior. Likely won't go back but flavor of the food is the only reason they rank higher than 1 star.The décor was nice but the acoustics make the restaurant very loud. A tray of wet glasses was on our table when we were seated and the hostess removed them leaving the table wet that she didn't wipe down.  The menu was wet with Coke spilled all over it. We wiped everything down ourselves. Not a good first impression.
The waitress was friendly. She brought our drinks but didn't bring the bread basket until the second time around. The Rosemary bread was very good but tiny slices about 1/4 inch thick.My husband had to ask for more. Two meals a pasta dish and pork chop dinner were very good but the crab and shrimp stuffed Talapia was not as expected and not very flavorful. It came with about 1 1/2 cups of Kale- that's a lot of Kale. Probably would have been better to eliminate the Kale and serve this dinner with a small dinner salad. 
The worst part of the evening  was a table of misbehaved children sitting next to us. The kids were running around and playing with the drapes and screaming. Some parents just don't care if their kids are annoying  and being rude to other guests. This is not a restaurant for young kids. The hostess should have seen we were four adults dressed up (dress shirt and tie) for a special evening and sat us at a table away from rowdy children. There are many excellent restaurants in Madison. You have to be amazing in one way or another for me to return. Not amazing.stopped in the minute I spotted the place. fake chicken burger was fabulous. Fish tacos were a bit over baring  .  Salad was a waste of time. cucumber, mint water was very good. However there were no prices so the total was a shock! Not sure I'll go back
