I saw Lousianne's on the news one night.  So I took my boyfriend there for our date night.  

We were extremely underdressed for the occasion.  A co-worker had told me it was a little fancier than casual but we went totally casual anyway.  Good news is, it had dim lightening.  We had a drink at the bar and were quickly seated.  I'm a vegetarian, so I tried a pasta dish while my boyfriend had steak.  We had the goat cheese appetizer, it was better than I expected.  It had a sauce to it that had a really unique taste to it.  The entrees were good, I wouldn't say the pasta was worth the price and I wish I would have tried the vegetarian jambalaya.  We topped off the meal with the White chocolate mousse  for dessert.  It was the best part of the whole meal, knocked my socks off.

I would recommend this place, especially to meat eaters.  
The service was great, our waitress was timely.  She checked in often and never hurried us to finish and leave.I recently went here with my family for breakfast and I look forward to going back soon. The menu had many options for breakfast, even for Vegetarians, which I am. I had the Veggie Skillet which was delisious and my husband enjoyed his inlet as well. The portions where large and the quality was high. A very clean place with a very friendly wait staff. Good kids menu too!Quick Review: If it weren't for the stellar fish fry and the awesome beer selection, this place would be a solid 2.5-star establishment.  Alas, the fish is unreal and the beer selection rivals many (if not most) of Madison's finest.

Detailed Review:
The Fish Fry Fanatics stumbled into Dexter's Pub this past Friday and decided to give their fish fry a shot.  The menu selection is vast - we counted at least 6 or 7 solid fish fry options, from shrimp to Lake Perch to Walleye.  

We put our name in for a table, and were told it would be a 35-40 minute wait, so we ordered some of our customary Old Fashioneds.  We were pleasantly surprised to find that the bartenders muddle their Old Fashioneds, but were disappointed by the inclusion of a huge chunk of orange.  I'm sorry to say, but a Whiskey Old Fashioned Sour should *not* include half-of-an-orange as garnish.  

Regardless, the Old Fashioned was solid - very good, actually.  So much so that when we ordered a second round and requested they drop the orange, it wasn't a problem.  Dexter's recovered nicely, and as luck would have it, our table became available soon after we grabbed round 2 of drinks. 

We immediately ordered cheese curds, salad, and soup.  I went with the vegetable garden soup; others at the table went with chili and salad.  The soup and salads arrived within seconds; the soup was good - not great, but good - and it could've been a little warmer.  I'm told the chili was good as well - not life altering, but good.

The waiter came back to take our dinner order: two orders of beer battered cod, an order of lake perch, and an order of shrimp.  He said he'd be back in 10 minutes with our fish.  

Nearly an hour later, we flagged down a waitress for: refills on our drinks, and to inquire about our curds and fish.  She apologized profusely... curds came out a few minutes later - apparently they forgot about us.  The only benefit to being forgotten was that we had plenty of time to read the beer menu, which features a nice selection of craft beers from microbreweries - Dexter's doesn't strike me as a place that would feature such a wide selection of unique beers, but I guess it goes to prove that you can never judge a book by its cover.  

Curds were excellent - not your typical "from the bag" curds, which was a nice surprise.  They were breaded and featured a mild white cheese; they were cooked perfectly.

Fish arrived within minutes, and it was well worth the wait.  The cod was phenomenal.  Three huge pieces with a mound of fries - now that's what we're talkin' about.  The batter was light, crisp, and flavorful.  The fish was thick, meaty, and perfectly flavored.  I loved every single bite of it.

I also sampled the Lake Perch and shrimp - both of which were excellent as well.  Huge props to Dexter's for their fish fry - it's definitely a top-10 offering.

In the end, they also made things good as the waiter comp'ed us our drinks and curds, so we got out of there for under $40.  We tipped well and called it a night.  I'd definitely go back to Dexter's - sure, they dropped the ball, but they did an honorable thing and made everything right by us.  Thanks, Dexter's!!

Dexter's = WIN

Food = 4.5 stars (excellent fish; curds and fries were stellar)
Service = 2 stars (they forgot about us, but made up for it)
Value = 2 stars (would've been over $85 for the 4 of us)
Misc = 3 stars (the place isn't much to look at, but has an excellent beer selection...)

Oh - also, parking is hard to come by, so be prepared to park on the street and/or walk a bit to get there.My sister brought this great restaurant to my attention and I will forever be thankful. She's been coming here for several years so I knew that this place had something going for it, and boy it really did. For our lunch stop, we ordered the general tso's chicken, kung pao chicken, and the house special chow mein. All were above average, but the general was beyond expectations. The breaded chicken pieces were out of this world-- soft, pillowy (yes pillowy) and simply addicting with each bite. If you're into Chinese like I am, you know that many general tso's chicken dishes tend to be overly breaded, crusty, and include questionable chicken parts rolled into one. Not this place! You gotta check it out. As for the kung pao & house special, they both could have had more umff and kick to it, but good nonetheless.

The only thing we worried about as we enjoyed our 3 dishes was the lack of patrons. We got here just before 2pm on a Wednesday and there was only one customer and a few pickup orders. What's the dealio Madison? I've been to nearly all the Chinese joints in Madison and this place for sure ranks pretty high. To our assurance, the lady owner said they were swamped the other day so that made us feel slightly better. 

Besides the great food, their prices are more than reasonable and the service is genuinely inviting. The lunch menu doesn't include anything over $5.95, which includes an entree, rice, and soup. The lady owner (who recognized my sister from previous visits) talked with us for quite some time and enjoyed playing with my baby nephew while we ate. All in all, a great visit that will definitely make me come back for more. ^^Food was delicious. A touch pricey for a "diner" but worth it one we were eating. Service was good too, even when my daughter went into meltdown mode because she didn't want to leave.Yummy sweet potato hash, yummy eggs. Biscuits are decent! Boyfriend was happy with his meal as well (simple eggs, bacon, potatoes, etc.) Service was quick and friendly.Note - grounds only, didn't get to the conservatory.

Of the various Civic Tourism opportunities around Madison, Olbrich takes the prize for best in show. Fantastic assortment of native flora, meticulously planned to keep something interesting to see year-round (except during the Wisconsin winter, I guess).  Beautiful arrangements, with adjoining themed areas: roses, herbs, even poisons! It also features, perhaps oddly,  the only Thai Sala in the continental US -- I think I first saw one in Hawaii -- and its fragile gold leaf has survived multiple midwestern winters surprisingly well. 

It's all free, and while you can self-guide I cannot recommend the tours highly enough.  We chanced to arrive just before the last of the day, and our guide, Paul, was everything you want in a volunteer guide: highly knowledgeable and enthusiastic about all aspects of the garden and its history, our tour was ninety minutes that felt like twenty.Great local place in the Atwood neighborhood. Pizzas are amazing, as are the pretzels. Keith and staff do a great job. Plenty of local brews on tap.I grew up with this as my neighborhood grocery store so it's got a space in my heart.  I never gave it much thought, though, until I noticed it swanked it up big time in order to beat off the Goliath that is Whole Foods.  Rock out, Sentry.  You'll always be my favorite.Carl's cakes really should have more than 3.5 stars. I think partially the problem is a lot of reviews from bridezillas who didn't get their crazy expectations met. They admit to the great flavor of the cakes but then downgrade the stars because the shade of pink was wrong.

Anyways someone had brought leftover wedding cake into my work lounge. I tried a small bite was amazed! Spent the course of the day trying to find out who brought this amazing cake and where it is from!  Turns out Carl's cakes and the flavor I tried was hazelnut apricot.

I went to see what they offered at the market street diner in terms of variety. I was please that they have 4 or 5 cakes that you can get individual slices from but also a cooler with ready to go full cakes in a variety of flavors. I ended up getting a hazelnut apricot cake good for about 8 to 10 people for only 16 bucks. What a steal! Where can you get a awesome cake for that price nowadays. 

They also do cheesecakes which I know will lure me back at some point.This place charms the hell out of me. It's friendly with a familiar old folksy decor. The problem may be that other reviewers don't know a whole lot of stuff about stuff. What I know is that the food is good with big portions, the place is always clean (this aint really a greasy spoon my folks) and the service is EXCELLENT and friendly. Only downside is they aren't open later.We went here for mother's day meal 5/2014 and I was very pleased. It was an excellent day and we were able to eat in the patio area. I remember that the chips, as I had previous read, were great. Some where deep fried, different flavors, and overall a great way to start the meal. I had the carnitas plate and it was very moist and portions were plenty. The flavor was very good. We also took advantage of a yelp check in free desert and the banana burrito was great with banana wrapped in a crispy sweet tortilla topped with ice cream.

The food was great and vibe was really nice on a nice breezy, summer day. The waitress was very helpful, good service and the chef actually brought out samples of desert that I can not remember the name but it was a nice touch. The only bothersome part that there were pigeons that interrupted our meal a few times but not a big deal. If you are in the area, highly recommended.The food is soooo good & the owner is soooo nice.Being new to Arizona, we decided to try 2 new restaurants for our anniversary. This was our lunch and it was fantastic. We had an incredible meal. The restaurant is very interesting with an old train dining car in the seating area. 

We had an appetizer of garlic cheese bread which was some of the best that we have ever eaten. Our entrees consisted of their lasagna and the Italian meatloaf with a side of pasta with the mizritha cheese and browned butter. Very rich and heavy but oh, so good. We didn't have the included dessert because we were too full. 

The service was excellent and very personable. Everything was as ordered and was prompt.

When we have friends and family come out from the mid-west, we will certainly be taking them here to eat.I'm seriously impressed, took my mom's Accord which sits in the sun everyday for the past 7 years in which the paint job has some serious oxidation (and unfortuantely some of the top coat where the sun hits the most is already gone).  

In 3 hrs (quoted 1.5hrs but this car was in bad shape), the Exterior Detailing package was worth every penny.  The car looks shiny, like if I redid the paint job vs abusing the poor car in the AZ sun.  Their package is much cheaper than anyone else's and puts Danny's orbital wax to shame($$$, what I did 4 years ago, the last time I got my hands on mom's car).  No pushy windshield chip people either (chills).

They kindly offered to drive me to the Arizona Center... don't do it, that place is dead and all outdoors (not fun in muggy July), ask to be dropped off somewhere else, even if it's a Starbucks down the street for wifi.12/1/2013 - My family and I stopped for an early Sunday dinner.

It wasn't busy because there weren't any games taking place and everyone else was out of town.  We were seated right away and there weren't any kids' menus.  The hostess went and made copies for my 2 youngest children and made sure that they had their crayons.  

Our server introduced herself as MK.  She was very friendly.

We got our drinks and our server MK asked if we wanted an appetizer.  She suggested potato skins or the combo.  We ordered the Jumbo Combo.  

My oldest son and husband decided on the 10 oz. burger, my daughter ordered a kids cheeseburger and I got one of my usual orders - Chicken Ceasar Salad.  MK noticed that my younger son was enjoying the wings and suggested he order the kids chicken with the Buffalo sauce.  He did.  

My husband and son both liked their burgers,  my daughter ate most of her's (she is a picky eater), my son liked his chicken and my salad was as good as usual.

We gave MK our email address for the Hard Rock Cafe Rewards program.  We have been customers of the Hard Rock Cafe chain for at least 25 years.  We have visited HRC from Hawaii to Florida.   We preferred the other program where we would give the server our card and earn points that could be used to pay part of our bill.The duck sandwich was not bad. Maybe a little over priced.The draw here is to sit as close as possible to the field. The downside, they have a time limit at those tables.  Kind of a bummer if you're trying to watch the game.  What's nice is that you can walk in from the street, grab a beer and watch a few innings.  Great way to mix it up if you went to the game.  I love that you can walk down, get something to eat a normal table (versus eating at your seat) then walk back to your seat. and not miss a single pitch. Now I'm not a big fan of "bar food" and would normally have given this place a 3 star review but I will have to give it 4 because of the service.  I accidentally spilled a fresh beer and they brought me another one at no charge.  Thanks Friday's!!Well, once you hear that you have a 3.5 hour wait for pizza next door, this would seem like the logical place to go to wait it out.  And it definitely was.  

Delicious wine, new beer for the boys to try, and a yummy food plate all equaled a great experience!  Service could have been a tad bit more attentive, but it was busy and we weren't that concerned. 

Oh yes, and the secret drawer....  :)Um, yum!  This place is a great spot for lunch if you work in the downtown, mid-town, uptown Phoenix area.

I chose a hamburger and fries, even though I love gyros, but it was one of those days where a burger and fry were just needed for me to continue with my day.  

The environment is a large open area of basic tables and chairs, it looks like it gets really busy around lunch time so maybe not the best kept up dining room but people move through pretty quickly. 

The menu is MASSIVE-- we are talking, they have pretty much anything to satisfy your hunger.  They even had a variety of low carb options which is a big menu choice these days.  ( i really need to get back to low carb)

Staff is really nice.  We'll be back without a doubt.I've been to La Tolteca a couple of times with Voice daily deals. Let me start by saying this place is not fancy, it feels like a restaurant straight out of Mexico, which is a good thing. This place has definite high points and low points. La Tolteca has very good cheese and beef tamales....the cheese tamales are very spicy and the beef is well seasoned and delicious and they both only cost 2$ each. They also have a really good salsa bar with delicious salsa verde. There are other things that are less awesome such as the carnita sopes, which don't have the same flavorful seasoning as the other items mentioned. The strawberry tamales are really odd....not bad, but odd. They're sweet, but not sweet enough to qualify as dessert. Also, their carne asada burritos are pretty par. I would recommend coming here and stocking up on cheese and beef tamales and reveling in deliciousness.yup, this place is awesome! I finally went yesterday and here's what I got for $78 plus a free bag of treats

-big bag of chicken jerky
-TiGi shampoo for curly haired pups
- a comb
- breath freshener
- puppy diapers(my sister will only babysit my dogs if they wear these, lol!) 
-and a huge economic pack of pee pads.
 
Here is everything my friend got for $180 plus free bag of treats

- dog crate(75 pound dog)
- new toys
- huge bones/rawhide
- the long stick thing that throws the balls for you, i dont know the name lol
- economy size shampoo
- economy pack of beggin strips
- breath freshener
- brush and comb
- 6ft leash
-food and water bowl 

they only get four stars bc the hours are super difficult, we had to schedule time off work to go (they close at 4 and aren't open on weekends), and because the prices aren't listed on anything so you have to constantly flip through this huge catalog to find prices. but, it is so worth it, especially if you have big items to purchase.Just came from here with a dozen box of Donuts, and a large Cappuccino Boba.  I didn't know Bobo and donuts went so well together!  The donuts are very good, but I think I will be coming back for the Cappuccino Boba.  Delicious!Argh! I just realized I never reviewed this place, and it's been a while since I've been there. So I shall have to rely on the lasting impressions.

I had the plato tipico, which I think translates as, "giant plate heaped with fried deliciousness."  In fact, the pictures posted here are actual photo documentation of what I had, while dining with Brian G.

The yucca fries were utterly divine -- crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside, slightly sweet throughout. The pupusas, pure awesomness (and I've had my share, believe it or not). The empanadas, pretty tasty, but not mind-blowing. The tamale, I could have lived with out.

Thank god it's not closer, of I'd eat there every day, and undo all my hard work at the gym.The pseudo-hubster LOVES this place and drags me along every once and again. The salsas, I think, suck, so that's a big time star auto-deduct. It's pretty dumpy inside and out, and it's almost always dead... this is pretty much the entire reason I like it. We can come here without seeing a soul we know, enjoy some good, traditional Mexican food, and enjoy a cerveza in peace.The crab cakes are delicious -- REAL crab and not a lot of filler! Not into crab? The relleno stuffed with veggies and goat cheese and served on polenta is a delicious treat! You can add chicken but it's not necessary... you get two giant peppers!I agree with others that it seems a bit expensive at $15- but that still would not steer me away from going.

For the first time in about 8 years I found myself at the DBG with some out of town family. Wanting to enjoy the weather (since they had just escaped the cold grey winter of Detroit) the gardens were the perfect spot. The garden is equipped with wide paths and plenty of benches to help the old timers pace themselves. It helps remind us city dwellers of the beauty the desert can have and how unique Phoenix truly is.A lovely place to visit while in or near Phoenix.  The Desert Botanical Garden is serene and beautiful. It gives you the opportunity to see things many of us are not familiar with, especially if you're from the east coast.

The large variety of cacti and flowers is somewhat breathtaking. Even on hot days, there are patches of shade around to get some relief from the sun.  Although there are water fountains throughout the trail, the water is very warm, so think about bringing your own and don't forget a hat!

Savings Bonus:  They offer a AAA discount which saved us $3(?) per person.

Its a great was to spend a morning or afternoon.Alright, I'll admit I've been driving past Red Devil for a decade now and always wondering what it was all about. It was always busy, seemingly always open, and really odd looking enough that it drew my interest. 

After all these years, I finally decided to try Red Devil only because it was time I actually stopped, and I had a craving for spinach and artichoke dip. Upon walking in, it was obvious this place has been here forever. It's a relic, and it probably hasn't been remodeled since, well... ever. They still have the light up signs for hte order numbers, and the entire restaurant feels like a cave. It's reminiscent of all those old school Mexican restaurants you find scattered around town with no windows, etc. We were friendily greeted twice upon entry and seated almost instantaneously. The crowd was mixed, but one thing everyone had in common is it was almost an entirely blue collar lunch break crowd. There were some people from Honeywell, and some contractors, as well as some teachers. 

The appetizer spinach and artichoke dip was very tasty... if not a bit overly greasy but with the right amount of fat, salt, and other artery clogging goodness. I ordered the lunch special small cheese pizza, and at the table was also a small white pizza. The red sauce pizza was average, with a very sweet sauce, a tough crust as if it had been made earlier in the day but overall a "it's low quality but oh so tasty" kind of taste to it. The white pizza had no olive oil, no garlic, no anything outside of breat and cheese. It was cheesy bread, make no mistake. 

Overall, I thought the food was average if not slightly below average, but there is something about Red Devil that made me feel comfortable here and welcome. The staff was friendly, there was no sense that you were being judged... it was just a good happy experience... with sub standard but still acceptable food. I walked out the door under $30 including tip for an appetizer, two pies, and two iced teas. I felt it to be very reasonable.This hospital has gone through some changes over recent years but, one thing's for certain, the staff's dedication and commitment to the healthcare and advocacy of those people and communities served is inspiring...keep up the good works!Replaced my cracked Droid screen in less than 30 minutes for under $100. Great deal and he did it while I waited.This is my neighborhood stop and as close to what you get for a "china town" here in PHX.

The Ranch Market is my grocery store and the Golden Buddha is the watering hole I am closest to and its been fun to be exposed to something "different" in the neighborhood. Yeah it's a strip mall with a coy pond and garden to those in other more metropolitan back ground or source, but it's what we got! ( I knocked off that last star for a reality check).  Within the center their are doctors offices, apartments and travel agencies that specialize in travel to Asia. Our stops signs are in Chinese too to paint a picture. All nationalities get their fresh fish at the market and you have to try the bakery for arguably the best chau siu bao hands down.

A definite place to go for lunch if you are here.
Walking through the gardens is the best attraction to walk off the dum sum. Its ponds and series of bridges and temple type architecture will make you feel less like you are under the flight path of PHX and more like you are on a different latitude and longitude if even for a second... 

Adjacent to the airport it represents a grain of cultural sand in a desert of fast food restaurants and Circle K's that is most of phoenix.
Short walking distance from the 44th ST Light rail station where one could possible stumble to while on a light rail jaunt Tempe / PHX bound.  Also next to main airport destination and hotels including a "W" and parking to the airport.

It's a pretty industrialized neighborhood outside but it contains some of the best Chinese restaurants in the valley as well Chinese medicine shop and other various shops hardly found anywhere else in AZ.Authentic, delicious.  If you like spicy Chinese food this is the place for you!  There are dishes that are not spicy also, but Szechaun cuisine is all about the heat!  This region specializes in spicy food.  If you don't like spicy, or can't handle it, I understand but you're missing out.  Definitely coming back here.Ate here with a small group from work mid week for lunch.
Ordered the Green corn tamales.  I don't find these often enough and order them whenever I find them.  Very good.
Sevice was good, knowledgeable.  
Ambiance was fine.  The place is a local chain, i believe, but it is good.Every Saturday for the last three weeks I've schlepped into Pane Bianco to get my fix. Though I feel tragically uncool in my saturday afternoon "best"(which may as well be pajamas) I bravely step up to the counter, say hello to the nice girls and order my delicious sandwich. And they are ALL delicious. The bread is truly orgasmic. They could hand out slices of the bread with nothing in between and I would still pay $9 to eat that shit. 
I'm intrigued by the alleged variety of the market sandwich. The tend to serve the same thing on the weekends, maybe I should try during the week sometime?My friend and I ended up here by accident but I'm glad we stopped by!  Service is very attentive here, and we were quickly seated.  We ordered the cheese crab puffs and the potstickers.  I'd pass on the cheese puffs, they had a bizarre flavor, that I still can't put my finger on.  The pot stickers were perfect.  I ordered the pepper beef and it was very good.  The red and green peppers were cooked just perfectly so they were not too soft or crisp and the beef was also done just right with the perfect amount of pepper sauce.  It came with white rice, which I'm not use to, since I usually have brown, but that was fine also.  Decor is fine, a little 60's china-ish but it seems to suit the place.  From the diverse crowd that was there last night enjoying themselves, it seems they agree with me.  This place is a hit.I was looking for a local florist shop that could create bouquets without following the traditional catalogue style. The owner Shelli did an amazing job helping me out and being patient with my requests. I actually went a few times myself and the drive isn't easy from where I am in Scottsdale but worth it. The bouquet turned out great. They made it definitely unique and many compliments were given. I therefore got to feel like I not only helped in creating it but that the staff was receptive to my requests and helpful in giving suggestions, everything you could ask from a florist. She also provided me a picture of the bouquet as I knew I would not be able to see it and that was important for me. It was maybe a little pricier than your average bouquet but well worth it.So in certain science fiction/fantasy novels, there's this shop that exists only some of the time, and it's packed with peculiar goodies, and it might be a gateway to another dimension?

This is that shop. Note the name. That's your tip-off.

If you carry a large purse or tote bag, lock it in your vehicle, as the aisles here are very, very narrow. The vintage clothing selection was huge and looked amazing, but I literally didn't dare turn to look at it for fear of sending a shelf of china flying. Clothing is something for next time.

There is a LOT of glass and china for the space, and it's not the same five dish patterns that you'll find in every antique mall. If you're looking for something specific, I imagine that the best approach is to act as if you're in the sheep's knitting shop in Through the Looking Glass. Follow the shelves with your eyes slooooowwwwwly up to the ceiling, hoping that your item will not ascend hastily through the ceiling to escape you. If that fails, shut your eyes, think hard about what you want, then try again. There's a better than average chance that it will appear.

There's also all sorts of jewelry and tiny bits of things. The delight of this shop is that it's not "curated" or "precious," but it somehow has a point of view, and the owner is truly the nicest person ever. This is a store for when you're in the mood to browse and chat and stumble over remarkable things -- not for when you're on the track of a list of home decor -- as it requires exploration and nothing is priced; and if you take the experience for what it is, it is literally a refreshing step back to a simpler time with better housewares, some of which you can buy and take home.

It doesn't hurt that it's now part of the most adorable vintage strip mall in Phoenix, along with the Purple Lizard (your one-stop Instant Wise Southwestern Woman boutique), Southwest Gardener (all that glitters for your landscaping), and the Original Hamburger Works (what Fuddruckers aspired to be, with authenticity).

On my visit, the back door gave only onto the mall's shared internal patio (a charming place for a winter lunch), but depending on your timing, your luck may be different.Good location, service is nice and the food is fresh at lunch time.What can I say...they never do me wrong!  I try to frequent mostly local owned restaurants, but Oregano's just calls to me sometimes.  I love the unique salad selection and the fact that I get to choose small or large.  The pizza crust is the perfect thin-ness, the spices just right, I don't have to spend a fortune AND I get leftovers!  
Now the service...again, I have never had to wait for drink refills, hunt down my server for extra napkins, or send back a cold pizza.  I always get upbeat and personable service and as a server mysef, this really makes me happy.  
I don't remember every server's name I have had there, but definitely ask for Trish for great experience!Amazing bread and the calamari was great. Soup and salad comes with every meal and the linguine with clams was awesome. Service was great. Very reasonable prices too! We will be back!I hate this place.  When can we go back?Can't add too much to previous reviews.  The sausage I have had from Schreiners has been pretty good, but none of the unusual, seasonal varieties described by other reviewers have been available when I went in.  The scrapple is not bad but way too much corn meal for my liking, and I've tried it twice.

This place is a classic.  Looks like it has been there for ages.  Amazing signage.  Just a must visit if you are into Americana, Phoenix style.

On a Friday the little space available for customers is so crowded you can hardly turn around in there, but somehow that just adds to the charm and atmosphere.  They do a cheap brown bag lunch, so you can shop for meat products on your lunch hour and not go back to the office hungry.  Just remember a cooler (or use you office fridge if you have one) to keep it fresh and tasty!The Rhythm Room is hands-down one of my favorite places to see music in Phoenix. Along with the Clubhouse, they are picking up the slack that the Mason Jar has left behind . . . 

I've seen a few great shows here, and all were unexpected. Tickets are affordable and you can get up close and personal with the way the stage is set up. 

There are a few bars throughout, both inside and outside, making it easy to catch a breath of fresh air during one of your lesser favorite tunes to grab a beer or a cocktail. 

They went on a run here in Sep/Oct where they were bringing solid acts what seemed like every week but I haven't heard much from them lately that caught my attention. Not touring season, I suppose. Keep your eyes peeled though, as Rhythm Room has asserted itself as one of the premier spots to catch a show in town.I wanted to post a review on the waitress we had for Smunch yesterday, Nancy, but it looks like I can only review a business so I'll just update this one.

When I walked into Scott's this week and asked if I could make a reservation for a large group during Saturday brunch hours, they said no problem without any hesitation. When organizing Smunch every month, this is a lovely thing to hear. 

The table was already set up and ready when I arrived and people started gathering shortly after. We wanted separate checks, though not all separate and Nancy didn't miss a beat. She was amazing. And hilarious. She joked with us the entire time and told us of her serious karaoke schedule.

At one point, someone at our table got up for a minute, and shortly after their food came out. Nancy just sat right down and pretended to eat it. And let us capture photographic evidence. 

I now will come back more frequently. And sit in Nancy's section every single time.The Monte Cristo Sandwich is the way to go when you order here. It's huge! So be sure to have an appetite or bring a friend to share. This deli style restaurant is laid back and casual. I feel like I'm eating in a deli in the heart of New York City. I have fond memories of dining with my mom here. The service is easy and quick and the food is delicious!Pastrami, pastrami, pastrami, pastrami, pastrami, pastrami." on rye...that's the way I judge a dood Deli, by their Pastrami Sandwhich. Well this isn't up there with Chompies (portin wise) but it sure was close. The pastrami sandwich was surprisingly good. I prefer thick, hand-carved pastrami, "The pastrami was a perfect mix of lean and fatty portions and  and freshly carved. Definitely better than your ordinary pastrami. The pastrami here is to die for. Never in my life I imagined that pastrami, or any kind of meat for that matter, can be so succulent and juicy. It literally melts in your mouth. 

I got their Pastrami Sandwhich, my wife got their reuben. To go we got 6 bagels, lox spread, chopped liver, herring in sour cream sauce and some pickels.  

What's good here, the answer is everything As for the desserts ... The massive slabs of Cheeese Cake was moist and ridiculously good (and ridiculously big)

FOOD:  Unbelievably lean and tasty. I thoroughly enjoyed every bite of my sandwich. oh and their pickles..... don't even get me STARTED they were  exactly how grandma used to make them and the pickles just topped it off. PRICE: Although the prices are a bit high you will definitely have leftovers for lunch the next day. CONCLUSION:  The portions sizes are very generous,  especially for the price! I highly recommend giving this place a try!This place is Christmas when it comes to crafty things to discover. There is fabric of every kind, nick-nacks, ribbon, and kitschy things. The employees, though? Oh my gosh grouchy. Forget getting help or friendly service here. Even the guy at the front clearly doesn't want to be here.

Also, be prepared--this is a warehouse setting with poor ventilation. You will get hot and sweaty.

But I found the materials for some projects for super cheap, which was great. That concrete floor did a number on my back, though, because I walked around the entire store. The heating pad was calling my name when I got home.getting some food I wish it was a lot bigger though feel a little crowded. But the wings were delicious the French fries are awesome and the service was fastThis Staples is conveniently located in a strip mall so you can park in one spot and do all of your shopping. I have found that the downfall is that parking really stinks. During the day when I just need to send a quick fax or pick up some paper and get back to work, I have to park all the way down near the Arizona-Mexico border and walk a ways back to Staples. I exaggerate of course, but seriously, parking isn't easy. 

The staff in the store are super super super friendly. Sometimes you have to search for a minute to find someone to help you, but when you do find your new special Staples buddy, they will spend all the time with you that you require. I recently went looking for a very specific type of cotton paper that had to have a specific weight. They didn't have exactly what I was looking for and wound up calling around until they found it for me. Love these folks!The catfish rocked my world.First, the parking situation here is less than ideal.   This restaurant has a friendly staff and atmosphere that is a refreshing change from the cookie cutter chain restaurants that seem to be everywhere,   Upon entry, I was greeted by the hostess and shown to my table.  The waitress was there to take my drink order in less than 1 minute, however, I was here for the Chicken Fried Steak and ordered it, Mashed Potatoes and a Garden Salad along with my drink.  She brought some rolls, my drink and salad back within 2 or 3 minutes.  The main course, Chicken Fried Steak and Mashed Potatoes arrived a short time later.  I am not a small man, but this plate was packed with food and was too much for me to eat.  Everything tasted pretty good.  Overall, a good experience.  I would definitely eat here again.Sometimes, predictable is a good thing.
A dear friend moved away and was coming to visit for a weekend. Turns out, despite being a sucker for anything chicken fried, she had never heard of TEXAZ. So we put together a small dinner party (8 of us) to celebrate her being in town.

The server was fantastic! We all came in at different times, she never missed a beat with greeting us, getting us drinks and taking care of all the substitutions and special requests in our food order. Everything arrived exactly as ordered - and we were a happy and full group of people.

The food is still consistent, the ambiance is still kitschy Texas roadhouse dive, the prices are still very reasonable and I am still super happy TEXAS is in my hood.2 words...Italian Beef

Parking sucks. Prices are high. Lines can be long. Coca-Cola only in cans (RC Cola on tap)...but the Italian Beef...

No where else can you get a sandwich like this...not even Chicago.

Order it wet (they soak the Vienna roll), get your favorite peppers...add a small order of fries, a can of Coke and that is $10 and you are happy all day.I just wish there was a Luke's in Flagstaff!  Try the Combo, beef and sausage, that requires a roll of paper towels to mop up the drippings.  It is so good.  And the Italian sub is bravo delicious!  

The place is tiny and crowded, but it's places like this where stuff of legend comes from.  Amazing sandwiches.  Have always encountered friendly staff with quick service.When I think of hot dogs I think of Luke's of Old Chicago's. Their hot dogs are the real deal piled high with an array of condiments and fries all wrapped up in wax paper to go to get that Old Chicago feeling. My wife and I have been there many times over the years and never had bad service, the staff is top notch! Best place to go in Phoenix to get a dog!Marshall's Rocks.

I love coming by here to pick up any house stuff, stationary, decorations, wrapping supplies like gift bags, fancy soaps-- just a bunch of stuff I don't NEED but like to BUY.

The shoe department is sad but the clothes are a great deal and lots of variety, you just have to go looking thru everything.  SO if you have the time, it's worth it.  But basically I purchase house stuff and crap I don't need and then I go home and look at it all and wonder why I just spent all this money of "stuff"-- but I get the shopping rush at a bargain price. What more can you ask for?I don't have bagels very often but decided to meet my brother today for coffee and a nosh.

We arrived at 11:30, both of us were starved.  He ordered a toasted plain with a schmear. (He's a food purist!) I grabbed a lox on pumpernickel with capers and an onion schmear, along with their house coffee.

Our meal was delicious.  Einstein's is good for a quickly prepared snack.  It's not fancy but is well located and there are lots of great selections.  I like their coffee a lot more than many other retailers as well, so try to have some whenever I go.  I just wish they carried more sugar-free syrups.

I have had their bagel dogs in the past and enjoyed them.  And, of course, the fall season brings pumpkin bagels and the transcendental pumpkin cream cheese.  I try to have at least one or two of those during that time!

I recommend Einstein's for it's service and variety!After spending time at IKEA and Linen N Things, we went mattress shopping. Not the most exciting piece of furniture in the house. Well, not until you get it home...wink, wink! The showroom is a sea of off white cushy rectangular sleeping slabs. Everything looks the same. Try this one. How 'bout this one. This, is our premier mattress. Really? My backside must be numb (insert joke here), cuz they all kinda felt the same. When the salesperson told me I was lying on a $2,200 mattress, I sprang from the bed as if I'd heard some clatter and got outta bed to see what was the matter. We settled on a less expensive version and have been peacefully sleeping ever since. Well. Except for my freight train snoring apparently. But I'll yelp about that later. The salesperson was a good sport as The Culinary Comedian and his fashion designer boyfriend were cracking up and cracking jokes as we lay, man to man, on beds all over the showroom. Plenty of eyes wandered our way when we attempted to spoon each other. You gotta test it out. That's what the salesperson said. Finally, after a day of spending thousands of dollars you get that final pre sign on the dot question. Mattress cover for $99? Uh, no. Thanks though. Well if you spill or tear it or a meteor lands on it, the warranty is null and void. Still,  no. But thank you. It also prevents bed bugs and bed mites. SOLD! You should have mentioned that first buster. Sleep America. Where Gay America (and you other people) Go To Sleep!Great location and even better happy hour munchies. Ordered the honey bbw wings, mozzarella, potato skins, and the calamari which were all delicious especially the wings.Servers were friendly and attentive. Will return somedayRokerij was on my list of "Places to Eat by My Apartment" that was compiled by my fellow Yelpers. THANK YOU, I owe you guys my first born. Rokerij was fantastic. Give me a good meal, good wine with good friends, and Dottsy is one happy, blissful girl. It was Friday night around 7:30/8pm and the parking lot was PACKED. On round two of looking for parking we got a spot smack dab in front! When we walked in, we were told there was a 45 minute wait. When I looked over the hostess' shoulder, there were three bar stools sitting empty! YAY! We didn't want to eat huge meals because we were due for some country dancing after dinner! We decided to sample the variety of Rokerij by trying their small plate selection. We ended up ordering 6 small plates and a bottle of GREAT Zinfandel. Our selections were the following: 

White Bean and Garlic Bruschetta- This was one of my favorites. I am half Guatemalan and this plate reminded me of something my mother would make. The tangy cheese and mild creamy beans were a hit to me. My friends agreed it was good, but weren't crazy about it like I was. That's common. I tend to get really excited about simple dishes.

Steak Tartare: This was my other favorite. The creamy mixture was made before our eyes. We watched the cook meticulously mix and mash the tartare to a creamy perfection. The only thing I would change on this is to make the bread that it's served on thinner. It seemed that our bites were overwhelmed by the thick, crusty bread. My guyfriend and I loved it. My girlfriend isn't a red meat eater so she passed on this one.

Stuffed Mushrooms: These were tasty. I only ate one but it was stuffed with a crab meat mixture that was very meaty, not full of stuffing.

Calamari: This was not a winner. It was served slightly cold, and it was more breading than a meaty bite of calamari. We all agreed we wouldn't be ordering that one again.

Tomatillo Toasts: YUM! This was like an open faced tomatillo enchilada on bread, if that makes any sense. The tangy tomatillo was complimented by the salty and rich flavors of the jamon (thick cut ham) and grilled chicken. Again, I think thinner bread would be a good idea.

New Mexican Sausages: This dish was savory and rich. I'm not much of a fan of sausages, but these were yummy! I only ate one because at this point I was hella full. The onions were cooked to sweet, glazed perfection and the sausages were meaty and not terribly greasy as far as sausages go.

Will we visit Rokerij again? YES. I can see myself becoming a Rokerij fiend! This place impressed me. The service at the bar was hectic but it worked for us. We got to see a lot of "behind the scenes" things. Watching the open kitchen buzzing with non-stop action was amazing. I was fascinated watching the chefs cook a steak to wood fired perfection. Even watching the bread being sliced in 2.2 seconds was amazing! 

A small note, when it's a crowded night, Rokerij will limit your visit to 2 hours if you have a table. The only reason I know this is because there was a BIG scene caused when a party was asked give up their table and move to the bar. In Rokerij's defense, the table had been seated for 3 and a half hours. So just keep that in mind. 

Run, take a fast car, and some food loving friends to Rokerij and I hope you'll enjoy it as much as we did!We went on a double date the other night to Rokerij.  Funny I'd been wanting to go to Rokerij for a while now, and when we finally pulled up, I realized that I had been before!  (I guess I'm getting old or something and really losing it... I actually had been there once before when I first moved to AZ, not realizing what the name of the place was).

I called to make a reservation a few days before the date and was told they could accommodate our group at upstairs, but not down unless we wanted to wait until 9:00.  Alright then... 7:00 upstairs worked!

We were celebrating our engagement and our friends' being pregnant, and we had the perfect booth; kind of a half circle shape.  Lindsay was our waitress and took good care of us.  The atmosphere is dark but warm and cozy... perfect to walk into on a cold night!

We decided to start with a few of the small plates to start... (both guys in our group are big eaters). They let me choose one of them and I chose the stuffed mushrooms - they are stuffed with crab meat and were delicious.  They also chose the spareribs (which I tasted and were quite tasty) and the bacon wrapped scallops.  

For entrees, Jared and I took advantage of the $36 special which included our choice of meet, 2 salads, and 2 side items.  I chose the entrecote and probably would not choose that again.  It's a bone-in ribeye and was way too fatty... we enjoyed our spinach and Rokerij salads and our sides of broccoli and asparagus.  I probably could've just had the small plates and salad and been just fine.  We took home leftover meat for Minnie, so she was a happy dog that night!

Instead of ordering dessert, we walked next-door to DQ - can't go wrong with that!

Overall, I'd say our experience was 3.5 but I'll round up for now because Lindsay was a great waitress and we had fun with our friends.  I'll overlook the fact that one of the bussers spilled steak juice on me when delivering our entree... I won't rush back but I'll keep Rokerij in mind for future gatherings with small groups.Excellent food here.  It's nice to be able to get your chile fix without having to take a trip to New Mexico.  I had their Carne Adovada and Eggs for brunch, which was fabulous.  The pork is first smoked before they simmer it in red chile until it is tender to the point where you barely even need to chew it.   Only complaint with the joint would be that they keep it a little on the dark side.  I felt like I was squinting to see everything despite the fact that it was in the middle of the day.I have been very happy with the care my dog has received at Squaw Peak, they take good care of my pug. The staff is very kind, I can always get a last minute appointment, and I never have to wait. They treat my dog as if he is their own, as others have said.

A puppy was found at work, and when I brought him in to Squaw Peak, he was diagnosed with distemper, and the best course of action was to put him down. When I asked about the cost, the vet was kind enough to take care of it at no cost. 

They have also been willing to bill me for needed vet care and allow me to make payments when I was having financial difficulties, however, I was not pleased about receiving a collections notice from the office after making a payment that covered the majority of the amount owed. The person in charge of billing told me I could make another payment for the remaining amount ($70) this month, and I just needed to call in and make arrangements. Given my positive experiences, I can only assume this was an oversight.Today was a group lunch for a friend who is leaving. The service was fantastic - our server's name was Jolynn. The food orders were executed flawlessly and we all had a great time.I've always noticed the Capital Grille when I went to Biltmore, but thanks to last month's yelp event I finally got a chance to try out some menu items and I've been back twice this month. 

It's the kind of place that you want reservations for, but we made a spur of the moment decision on a Friday night and got lucky enough to find a spot to at the bar. The wine menu is extensive, as you would expect it to be for the prices/quality of food. The steak portions are large and the Kona crusted sirloin we ordered was plenty for two (the kitchen split it for us). It was perfectly medium rare. The bread basket and sides were both good, but not the main reason you'd want to come.

Yesterday we went back to try the lunch plates menu and sat in the restaurant area. The service here was spot-on and we were in and out in an hour. Both the burger and mini tenderloin were great choices.  The ricotta cheesecake was a delicious, albeit overfilling, finishing touch.

There's a slight men's-club feeling to the place and I wouldn't describe it as trendy, but I'd have no problems going back for a solid steak.Free valet parking. Nice touch. 
Had the stoli Doli, very smooth. You need to try it. 
Calamari with cherry peppers , nice variation.  A new favorite. 
Filet was cooked just how I love it. 
The sides weren't as big as other steak houses, less to go around. 
Overall, a very nice experience.
Yes pricey but some things you need to try.   This is one of them.Now known as Julioberto's, Great for FAST, GOOD, TASTY Mexican fare. I pop in here when I'm nearby for their Chili Verde Burrito(all chili, no rice or beans). Big portions and good pricesFor as long as I've been in the valley now, I've never bothered to stop into souper salad.  Why?  I don't know....but I finally did for lunch today.

I really love how this place is set up.  Salad buffett with lots of fresh options. Not the tired buffet of salad stuff that I've seen at other places.  Many options to choose from, along with drinks, desert, and awesome breadsticks!

I got the combo with a drink, breadsticks and salad to go.  The server at the counter was friendly and nice, and I really enjoyed my time here.  I will definately be back in the future!!I had never heard of Sophie's Bistro before I went last night, but can now say that I am a big fan.

It was very quiet when we arrived, but I suppose 8:30 pm on a Wednesday night is late for many Valley diners. The owner greeted us right away and was very friendly, and happy to find out that my date was French. I liked how simply decorated and cozy the restaurant was, and felt more like I was dining in someone's home in Paris rather than at a restaurant in the middle of the desert, with French pop tunes wafting in the background. 

I ordered the Magret de Canard, and it was absolutely delicious. The duck was cooked perfectly, and the skin had a lovely crisp texture. It came with a rick leek fondue and savory potato boulangere that paired nicely with the duck. My date had the filet mignon dressed with brandied green peppercorn cream, which was melt-in-your-mouth tender. We chose the 2007 Jaboulet red wine that was light, and went well with our meals. We ended with a cocoa-dusted creme brulee that was huge, and quite tasty but a little on the sweet side. 

Overall, I thought the place was lovely and will definitely go back, perhaps in the fall to enjoy the patio.I've always loved Williams-Sonoma!  It is more than a kitchen store; it is an experience! A great place to buy presents!

Yes, you can just go in there and buy whatever you need for your gourmet kitchen, or a unique gift for your best friend or your mother. But WS staff is there for more than just to sell you high end kitchen delights. They will teach you how to use your new purchases and the many options that are available that you had no idea you wanted or even needed.

The staff is well-trained, not your usual retail sales clerks, but men and women who know their inventory and how it can make a difference in your cooking life and they aren't afraid to tell you.

The WS staff at the Biltmore are on the top end of the sales scale. They are there to teach you what they have in the store, what you might need to fulfill your every kitchen desire and what you cannot live without. Yep, I challenge you to get out of there without buying at least one thing, or learning how to cook something you didn't even know you wanted.  Williams-Sonoma is a playground for cooks of all levels. And, if you are like me and not a chef . . .it is a great place to buy wedding and Holiday presents.Best French dip ever.  Seriously. Ribs awesome as are stringy fries. Pricey but great on occasion.Hillstone is fantastic and I appreciate that they mix it up with seasonal menu options. The place pays so much attention to the little details and serves up a great meal everytime. If you order a martini, half way through they will bring out a new frosted glass for it so that it stays cold! I've never experienced that until I went here. Seasonally they offer a sushi salad that is fantastic, the burgers are consistently awesome, the fresh fish is incredible and the ribs are dynamite. You can't go wrong with a single thing on the menu.Apple stores are always extremely helpful. This store is no exception. With that said however I have been to more helpful stores. I bought a new Mac and they were more than happy to help set it up. However something weird happened with my Apple ID and was unable to set up track my Mac. When that happened it seemed that out conversation was over. She did give me a nice pull string bag which I really like. 

This apple store and the one in chamfer are the ones I prefer to use. I will returnI have the best, freshest salads here for lunch. It's a bit pricey for going here too often so I save it for when I really just need a nice salad. The pitas are the best too! The owners are super nice and get to know you personally. It's a good place for a date.Clean.  No nasty smells.  Dr. Cruz friendly as well as staff.  Transparent and upfront pricing.La Grande Orange is one of those places that I like so much yet due to so many others liking it forces a strain on my ability to like it.

Allow me to explain. Everything on the menu and in the store is a solid quality product. If it is something to be eaten then it is delicious. If it is something to buy and use in some other form or fashion then it is more than likely a great at whatever it is.

The area where liking La Grande Orange becomes a challenge is that it is always soo overcrowded with customers that the lines and wait for orders can be pretty long. The parking lot is ridiculously small and fills up fast and is almost always full with one or two cars already camping out for a spot.

That said, my mouth and stomach convince me that this place is just too good to give up on.

I have been living in Dallas, TX most recently and have thought about how nice it would be to have a La Grande Orange out here. With all of the people recently relocating to the Dallas area maybe those who run LGO should consider placing a location out here.Good wine and excellent bruschetta. Great waitstaff.AWESOME Bruschetta and great wines!Love Wally's - just an outstanding neighborhood bar and grill. Myself and my friends visit Wally's often and we are huge fans. The restaurant is always clean and inviting, the food is consistently excellent, and the service is terrific. Also, if you're a draft beer fan, they have a great selection. 

I highly recommend the chop salad with cold chicken!!Faster, less expensive and friendlier than jiffy lube. I was in and out in less than 20 minutes.Best Thai I have found in Phoenix, so far.  This is not just excellent Thai food for Phoenix, this is excellent Thai food for the Bay Area.  It's that good.  Thai Lahna's food will intrude into your thoughts for days after you eat here.  Like gustatory flashbacks, you will find yourself thinking about how wonderfully flavorful everything was.

We had dinner here with Christine O & Myles (+1) and shared 2 appetizers and 4 entrees.  We had Chicken Satay and Angel Wings.  The Satay was the least interesting item we had, it was merely good.  Everything else was great.

Our entrees were Phaht Thai which we ordered with no spice and Khung Nahm Prik Pow which was sauteed shrimp with roasted curry paste, onions, chili, bell peppers and mushrooms.  Our friends ordered a spicy pineapple fried rice and a beef dish which I can't recall the name of.  All of the dishes were richly flavorful and had plenty of sauce to carry over to the steamed rice.

One enjoyable highlight was the point counter-point going from the spicy heat of the rice to the almost sweet sauciness of the Phaht Thai.  We can't wait to get back here and try more dishes.

My only complaint about this place is that they need to put some sort of tinting on the windows to a height of about 3 feet.  When cars are pulling into the spots right in front of the restaurant some diners were blinded by the headlights.Great food for the price.  Everything we had was delicious and tasted fresh and authentic.  Customer service was great!  Bring some cash though, because it is cash only.Great Service and Value..  I was shopping for a new sectional and found several in the showroom.  $65 flat fee for shipping to Fountain Hills, so I also purchased two Gel mattresses.  The store service was straight forward and excellent, and so was the delivery.  Employees from purchase to delivery were friendly and helpful, and the delivery was on time with no complications.  We really love the new beds and sectional sofa.. Will definitely purchase from Pruitt's again..If I were to stop and get a donut here..I am not saying I have, just if I did ..I have to say they remind me of the ones I love from So Cal.  They would I am guessing, have that light greasiness combined with sweetness. Probably they are lightly iced .I bet if I went there I would really like an old fashioned one. Just if I went there.I've had nights where I'd give it a 5 star and nights I wouldn't give it a 1 star, but whenever it's been bad they always do whatever they can to fix it.This review is for the Pharmacy. 

The staff here is extremely knowledgeable and helpful. I've been coming to this location for years now and have never had a bad experience! The pharmacists are all very friendly and have wonderful attitudes! They are sure to take their time to make sure you understand everything about the medication you are about to be taking and are awesome about answering all your questions.  

The waiting area could use a make-over and I only say this because I've been to several other locations of CVS and they are all new a updated! This one needs a face-lift for sure! 

I'm shocked by all the negative reviews.  I believe the worst part of this location is the homeless people hanging out front, but besides that the service has always been fantastic!Italian car show this weekend - celebrating 100th anniversary of Alfa-Romeo - free admission, blues concert, BBQ and Lamborghinis and Ferraris Oh My.
http://www.azcentral.com/thingstodo/events/articles/2010/09/23/20100923phoenix-le-bellezze-ditalia-car-show.htmlAs I revealed in a previous review, my family loves InnSuites. This location is nestled in the Squaw Peak Mountain Preserve, close to the prestigious Biltmore area, and offers easy access to downtown Phoenix, Scottsdale and the Camelback corporate corridor. 

InnSuites offers comfotable, clean rooms for a very rasonable price. And as with all of the InnSuites locations, the Northern location includes amenities such as free social hour and free hot breakfast with eggs, potatoes, waffles, toast, cereal, yogurt, fruit, coffee, milk & juices. There isn't really much within walking distance at this location, so either plan to hang around the pool a lot or you'll need to have a car.This place is awesome.  I'm a total girl and lacking in bike repairing ability.  Hell, I didn't even realize that bikes need maintenance.  Whoops.  Anyhow, they've tuned up my bike and fixed several flats for me.  I suck at cleaning/oiling my chain, but Eric takes care of me.  Everyone is super nice and knowledgeable, but I'm partial to Eric.  They've also ordered a bike rack for me and helped me install it, because obviously I am no good with manual skills....  I will definitely be back when I need to purchase another bike.Good store, same as any other Big Lots.  They all seem pretty consistent.  Bit of a "desperation & despair" feeling in there from the employees and clientele, but if you don't mind trailer trash, the deals are the same as any Big Lots.This place was excellent. The butternut squash ravioli was to die for! The lasagna that my husband had was average, although he quite liked it! Our waiter was new, he had a great sense of humor for someone who was stressed out;-) However, like the ravioli, the pasta was homemade and quite delicate. The house salad was also quite good!Don't fall for the old quarter super glued to the floor trick!  They got me and had a good laugh.  Good service though.  I'd recommend.Great food if you like spicy stuff! EVERYTHING is spicy, even sweet-n-sour stuff. I highly recommend the chai tea. Very sweet, but absolutely delicious.This is a 3.5 star place but it deserves to be rounded up.  Why?  Because the servers are exceptionally nice and responsive.  The food is not amazing but is generally standard diner food, but the atmosphere is, well, let's just say - over the top.  The pictures on the wall are almost distracting, they are so large.  

I ordered a breakfast chili combo thing.  It was basically eggs, potatoes, and chili.  Strange combo, I know, but I really enjoyed it.  A little on the oniony side but quite good.  The home fries are home-made so I would recommend them over the hashedbrowns which, I would assume, are from a bag.  They were actually really good.  

In all, I would go back here.  It wasn't amazing but the price was right, the service was great, and the food was tasty.Really good food!!!! I'm so stuffed! Excellent service, the pork sandwiches we had were terrific & very BIG.Their sauce is good too. We'll definitely be back.A small, unassuming salon tucked into a corner of a strip mall. The prices are great ($19 for pedi) and the service is really good. A great find!This bare- bone market is a tiny slice of Eastern Europe in Phoenix.  Does your grocery list beg for an assortment of smoked fishes and/or canned pate (from turkey to pork)?  This is also where you can go when only Hungarian paprika will do.

Also have fun selection of chocolate and candy.I shop here every weekend.  Even though I feel as though Whole Foods has lost some of its original spunk since turning into a giant national chain it is still better than anyplace else to shop.  You will always find a nice selection of organic foods and groceries.  Nice wine and cheese selection.  Great prepared foods.  And they give you complimentary ice so your food doesn't spoil during the drive home before the A/C kicks in.My little man and I had a great time! Such a variety of rooms for the kids to use their imaginations in that it's mind-blowing.  The store is super clean, nicely laid out, and when the cafe is done, will be absolutely complete. Definitely buying a membership our next visit back. Just wish that it wasn't 45 minutes away from my house! 

I do wish they had a cell phone policy though. There was a woman there who spent the entire time, and we were there for 2 hours, on her phone talking loudly in some Eastern European language. She hardly watched her children who were all over the place. There's a difference between letting kids explore and letting them run like wild animals.  She was even on the phone while in the bathroom trying to change diapers. It was unreal. There were other mothers who were there who were on and off the phones the entire time and not paying attention to their children. I think a cell phone policy would definitely get parents to engage with their kids and be present for even just a short while. 

All in all, Imagination Avenue was a GREAT visit. We can't wait to go back!Some of the best (and most filling) cheesesteaks in Phoenix/Scottsdale. Reasonably priced, messy, TV's, waitresses who will not take any crap. Perfect for a lunch with a co-worker, buddies or someone else you are not trying to impress.Friendly staff, clean and really enjoyed my lunch. More than enough food next time I will order the half sandwich.It's been a couple years since we've eaten here and I'm not sure why it's been so long.  Everything here has always been wonderfull.  I'll do everything I can to make sure it doesn't take years to come backI would say it's been very hard to find an auto mechanic I feel I can trust. These guys I do. I took my vehicle to them thinking I needed my alternator replaced. I was convinced I needed a new one. After inspecting my SUV they told me my alternator was fine. After much trouble shooting, it turned out what was wrong with my vehicle was that the battery terminals were "gunked" up. They cleaned the gunk off the battery terminals, and my Jeep has worked ever since. I would strongly recommend Cathedral. Honesty in a mechanic is worth every penny, and these guys are priced just right as well. Good mechanic shop!Really good lentil soup.  Great rice.  Lamb combo was ok but everything else was pretty good!Pros: WE DO LOVE their delivery service (Always on time) and online ordering service.  We love their standard pizza with extra ingredients.  

The salads are great especially the Cobb Salad.

The calzones are very good also.


Cons: We do not go to the dinning room because of the small size.  Their subs on takeout do not rate very highly.I think Daren C. and I have the same taste buds! Now that I have mine back that is.... long story. 

I went to have my dogs groomed in the area and the owner of the kennel said this joint has a great breakfast. 
So I love to eat and I had an hour to kill so 40th street here I come. He was right this joint has a pretty tasty Bfast. I had this skillet with Eggs, Chorizo, onions, peppers and potatoes. It was huge! It was nummy nu mmy in my tummy. The best part is.......wait for it.........they had my favorite coffee ever! Farmer Brothers! I am not a coffee drinker and don't claim to be but I will drink a pot of that Farmer Brothers it is so good! Warning do not order the sausage gravy, it is not real gravy and they just toss sausage in it YUCK! Besides the gravy and one annoying waitress. This joint is cool with me. I took one star away because they need to clean a little better. All and all good food, good price, good portions and a good start to my day! ThanksThis isn't a bad place to go and get a beer and some grub.
Although I'm not really sure why it's categorized under pizza
(Since pizza isn't even on the menu)
The menu consists mainly of burgers wings and sandwiches 
The prices are reasonable 
Staff seems friendly 
The decor looks like every guys idea of a bar in his garage 
I'll definitely be back againGood, solid bbq! Looked up this place online as it is close to my hotel. Didn't have a car so made the 1 mile walk on over in the desert heat. I arrived sweating feverishly, but was quickly cooled off by the pleasant  staff. The guy at the counter was super nice and made me feel right at home there. I wasn't sure what kind of sandwich to order and he suggested the beef brisket. It was awesome! Tender, juicy cuts of brisket with a perfectly balanced bbq sauce on a soft bun. I know this may seem odd to comment on the Coke I had, but even it was just right... I hate when on a hot day I grab a cup to get some coke from the coke dispenser and it's not fresh. The pop here was nice and bubbly just like I like it. 

Prices were extremely reasonable, staff was friendly, & food was fast and fresh (and so was the coke).I'll start by saying that Barbecued  Pork is my absolute favorite food.  I could eat BBQ Pork and coleslaw every single day if I knew I'd live.  And Hap's definitely delivered on awesome barbecue.  To me, I want the people who make my bbq to have a passion for the pit, to love the craft, because really, it is a craft.  And as soon as I walked in the lady (owner?) behind the counter spoke to me with such dedication about how Hap's barbecues their pork...and why it was the best joint in town. Awesome.  She also hooked me up with some extra pork because I couldn't decide what I wanted...everything just sounded too good and mouth couldn't stop watering. That's customer service.  When I did finally decide and got my order it was just what I wanted. Succulent pulled pork on an open faced sandwich that wasn't skimpy on the sauce.  The sauce was incredible too, a really flavorful zing that was way beyond what you can get in the grocery store.  My meal also came with delicious and moist corn bread and a good helping of coleslaw....you just can't get bbq pork with out coleslaw..Im sorry but its absolutely necessary :P  Bottom line, awesome joint where the people really care about the food they make which definitely shows.I've been meaning to give this place a try for some time now, and today was able to actually leave the office and have lunch outside of the office. This is new for me, as the past 2.5 years I was stuck eating in the office.

Once you walk in, you place your order with one of two employees and wait for your number to be called. I ordered the 2 piece fish and chips and  was number 510. There was a bit of a wait, which is fine because the fish is fried fresh and served hades hot. The fries were standard, but the fish was fantastic. I found the batter to be light and crispy; the fish was flaky and moist. A cornucopia of dipping sauces awaits at KKL, but I stuck with the Lousianna Hot Sauce and malt vinegar. There's also ketchup, cocktail sauce, ranch and a few others.

We were fortunate to get there shortly after 11 a.m. before the crowd came in waves.

The nautical theme is kitchy and inviting in a way that reminded me of something that might fit into Sponge Bob's world. I'm looking forward to many future returns.If Henry Rollins' eyewitness account is your only concept of Sky Harbor, you really need to see it for yourself.

I only fly from Terminal 4 (Southwest Airlines), and it's my favorite airport terminal in the United States. I'm always in and out in a flash; the Wi-fi is free, and cute people are all over the place.

The Phoenix metro area is built on convenience and space, and the airport is no exception. 

My only complaint is a fairly crappy food selection.I can't say anything bad about Sky Harbor International Airport as I was only here as a stopover from Mexico to Detroit. I really wish I had known the TSA rule about checking Duty-free liquid purchases when making connecting flights.  I barely had room in my suitcase for the 980ml bottle of Kahlua I bought.  I sure as hell wasn't leaving that behind!

Also, upon my return I found a note in my bag that said I had randomly been selected by TSA for a baggage check.  They sliced open the bubble wrap around my Kahlua (also sliced the label).  Luckily, my contents were not soaked in the stuff...everything was ok except i believe my book I was reading on the beach that was in the front pocket of my suitcase fell out during their inspection.  Not a huge loss as my friend back home had a copy to lend me.

Is Sky Harbor "America's Friendliest Airport"?  I can't answer that, but it is much better than most.

Oh yeah, I love the blue agave cacti that you can see out the window as you ride the people mover through the terminal.  Nice touch, AZ!Very quick security process and effective communication through the loudspeaker (gate changes, etc.). Negatives include the long distances between gates and having to take a shuttle to the rental car area.Ok, I understand there are no 5 star airports in this country mostly due to security concerns. But for ease of access, parking, and food, Sky Harbor is head and shoulders over McCarron and anything in California. It is not uncommon to breeze through TSA and onto your gate in under 15 minutes from the time you park out in the east economy lot. The train from remote parking and covered parking areas areas are safe, easy to navigate, and well lit. 
Sky Harbor does it's best to live up to its moniker "the friendliest airport in the country".check the hours before you make a visit!

i ordered the new york strip as medium rare.  it came out to perfection.  the seasoning, tenderness was right on.  eventhough i liked my experience i still feel like  i've had better.  it's still a top experience just not the best.

all the history in the restaurant is pretty cool.  if i'm wearing my fat pants i'm not going there to read.The food is hot and good. If I was just rating the food I would give it five stars. But the service was slow and unresponsive. In fact the girl bussing helped us more  than our waitress. They adjusted our meal without complaint as I have food allergies. Portion size is perfect, you leave full but not busting. I would recommend this place for great Mexican food.The Mystery Castle (MC) was not on my list of things to do when I first landed in AZ--in fact it wasn't even on my radar. My sister thought of MC randomly one day and whined that she'd never been--all the time knowing full well that I'm always down for some bizarre stuff. So,  we set off to see what we could see. 

MC is an odd and very unique place that's located at the southerly edge of Phoenix, at the base of South Mountain. It's an interesting tribute to a man's love for his daughter that raises more questions than it answers. I'd love to share with you the history but it's really better to come down and experience it for yourself. 

Here's the tour info per the website: Tours are given October thru June on Thursday-Sunday from 11am-4pm. The cost is $10 for adults and $5 for kids (5-15). The tour lasts about an hour and there are no official tour times; you just show up whenever and join the tour currently being given. We came in about 1/4 of the way through and you just stick around as they pass you back and forth between the two guides until you've seen everything there is to see. I recommend it even for kids because there's so much to see in this place that it keeps your eyes and your mind busy.Good quality great portion sizes and good prices.  If you are looking for a solid sushi place n the east valley this is it. Their sashimi plates are unparalleled in value. A ever changing menu of speciality rolls will keep you interested and their birthday celebration procedure can not be beat.

One thing to be aware is they auto add gratuity at 4 people not the standard 6.I'm no sushi connoisseur, but I know good food when I taste it! This place has sparked a passion for sushi no other place that I have ever been too. As a matter of a fact, I have been here 4 times for lunch in the past two weeks! Since I'm a bargain shopper I usually get the $10 lunch special which comes with a salad, miso soup, an assortment of nigiri, 2 stuffed jalapenos, and a California Roll. All of the lunch special is delicious you can even upgrade the regular Tuna for the Big-eye tuna for $1 more on special days. This place is so good I literally dream about eating here and I can't stop thinking about it until I go. The fish is so tender and fresh! This place is kind of small and Lunch is only served from 11am-2pm, so get there early if you want the special. One of these days I'll make it here for dinner to try the Teppanyaki, but right now I'm committed to lunch.   **This place does not have silverware on the table so if you despise chopsticks (like I do) you will have to shamefully ask for a fork or pretend like you know how to use chopsticks***I went here because I really wanted potato skins and I had an awful experience at Gallaghers and left. The food here was not bad,but overpriced, and the service was above average. I would go back, but would probably prefer happy hour :-)If you are looking for anything "baby", this is the place to do it in.  They have items here that I have not seen at any other place except the web.  Sometimes it is just nice to see them in person before purchasing them.  They have tried to stay competitive on their prices, but Target and Walmart beat them quite a few times.

I love the fact that they cater to babies and young children with their rest rooms.  Forget a diaper- they have them.  They also have a photo studio inside.Good place for a gyro sandwich.  The service is friendly, fast and the decor was old but clean.  

I had the single gyro combo.  Some of the best fries I've had in the valley.  It was around $8 for lunch.  The tomatoes were fresh and tasty pita bread was fresh.  

Didn't try the baklava.  They had a display though and it was dripping with honey and looked delicious.I haven't been to Dr. Woodland since I was in grade school, however I am confident that he was great! I remember going to him a lot in the second grade and I was so embarrassed because I thought that meant I had bad teeth. Several years later, I said something to my mom about going to the dentist so often when I was a kid, and she told me that I wasn't getting fillings, I was getting sealants!!! What a relief to know I did NOT have bad teeth! I still try to keep that going ... Every 6 months for me, like clockwork! 

I have never had any fear or anxiety about going to the dentist and from the stories that I hear, I seem to be in the minority on that one. Seeing as how I was going all the time when I was younger (or what seemed like it to a second grader) and I still don't mind the dentist, almost enjoy it in fact, I am fully convinced that is a direct result of my first dental experience with Dr. Woodland!Went to AZ Grand resort in the beginning of April for a working vacation.  

Great staff, good and clean! water park.  Very close to the airport and good location.  Surrounding areas have good gas prices.
 
Stayed here twice for business.  We stayed during Spring Break and thought the room was a little dirty.  The second time was during a less crazier week and the rooms were immaculate.  Didn't like the layout or the small televisions sets but it had good amount of channels and we didn't stay in the room.  Although you can hear noises outside the door, the walls were not paper thin if you stayed in a room that did not have an adjoining door into another room.  They had an Easter Egg Hunt for resort guest kids.

TIPS
-BYO Internet connection 
-Very noisy towards the weekend (Thursday - Sun) and weeks surrounding holidays.  Kid noise, like squealing, it is a family-friendly resort.Stayed here for the Fiesta Bowl earlier this year. The staff was nice, the entire resort was gorgeous and we had a lot of fun here. They also have a very nice gym which we took full advantage of. 

The only negative I can write about is that I had their mushroom and truffle oil pizza and it made me sick. I think it was more of an aversion to the rich oil than an issue in the kitchen. Still, the food was fantastic.

I would highly recommend this resort to everyone and would definitely stay here again.They carried a product I have been searching the high heavens for for about 4 years. I finally found it at the boots no. 7 counter. Great selection of this British brandRevisited this place right at 5:00 when they open for dinner. They seemed a bit unprepared, like all the staff had not arrived. So, for the first 15-20 minutes we had what seemed like a "fill-in" server who did not know the menu.

I was all good though... had the Chicken Saag. It was fan-tastic. My parents ordered other dishes and we split two orders of naan among us. They pimp drinks here a lot--must be a high margin item for them. The only disappointing thing about the saag was that I asked for it spicy and it was not spicy. I mean it was Cleveland spicy, not Punjab spicy.

As an aside, this place is always good for people-watching. We had the pretentious neo-hippies next to us who couldn't be bothered to have their children sit down to eat, lest their creativity be stifled.I love this place the lava taco is amazing and the carmel empenadas are a good treat.I must say I really enjoyed this little gem of a library. I just recently moved back to Phoenix (Ahwatukee) after 4 years of hanging tight on the far east side of town (Gilbert/Chandler area). This is a very clean library with ample seating and various degrees of lighting depending on what area you are in. I'm one of those nerds that still enjoy reading a good hardback book. I noticed they also had a decent amount of public computers available if you need a place to get some work done. The staff was really friendly and the lady at the desk quickly helped me to update my information in the system.  They don't have a large selection at this library but it is in-network with all the other Phoenix libraries so you can reserve a book from another library or have a book sent here for pick-up. Another cool thing about this place is they have meeting space you can rent out for less than $10 an hour! Go check out your public libraries, heck your tax dollars are funding them so you might as well use them.This one is not in walking distance of my Apartment as I mentioned earlier....LOL...it is however a very good target. I just wanted to update this review to get the facts straight. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!Maybe I lucked out - who knows - but my experience was mostly positive.  I walked in on a Friday afternoon with no appointment and was seated in a spa chair immediately. Though the space is tight, the tech gal was attentive and thorough. She took her time and did a quality job on my spa pedi and gel mani. This store had tons of gel colors, and the up-selling/add-ons was kept to a minimum. Two days later after lots if sun and pool time, the nails still look fantastic - brand new, no chipping, and I'm happy I went. $35 for a spa mani/pedi but gel is extra, not too shabby. Much better than paying premium local resort hotel spa charges.  Update:  Also, my gel mani lasted exactly 3 weeks!!I ate lunch here today with my daughter and the food was great.  Nicole was our server and the service was excellent!I don't usually visit Roy's in Hawaii because their locations tend to be in shopping centers - not on the ocean. But here in Phoenix, I have found it to be a challenge to get really good, fresh fish and Roy's is my "go-to" spot when I am craving something coastal or Hawaiian. Our most recent visit was for an anniversary dinner, but despite reservations.....we were not seated for 1/2 hour. My husband was told the earliest reservation he could make was for 5:30, but when we arrived we not only waited, but noticed the patio and restaurant was quite busy with customers seated well ahead of us. The fact that this was a rough start was soothed by Roy's always-fantastic food. We split the lobster ravioli as an appetizer, and the restaurant really should put this on the menu as an entree. It was "ONO" (Hawaiian for delicious). Speaking of Ono, how could I pass that up as my entree?? I didn't even read the rest of the menu! I went straight for the Ono, and I have no idea what the buerre blanc was, but it was roll-my-eyes-omg wonderful!. I have family members moving here soon, and this will be our special spot for many occasions in the future.I really like this place.

After eating here a few times, and loving it of course... The food is always great, the service is fantastic and the menu is wowzers, BIG.  There are many choices and it's fun to share and sample, as the food portions are large.

In the summer, stay away from the beautiful semi-enclosed wooden benches in the back.  The air does not circulate well inside of them and I almost melted.

Yay! I'm a fan!!!Pizza is pretty good but it's kind of overpriced for what you get.  The slices are pretty small. I haven't tried anything else there.I'm a pretty new patient and was referred to Stockton Dermatology by a trusted friend who works within the specialty healthcare industry and has insight into the best Derms in the state. Although it's true Dr. Stockton is booked out until 2014, I have been extremely happy with Laura Devlin. The care I have received for myself (skin cancer screening, biopsy and Mohs surgery referral) in addition to treatment of my 2nd graders' skin condition and my daughter's acne have been outstanding. The office is modern and professional, and the medical staff are very helpful. I was really surprised reading the yelp reviews because I haven't had those experiences. Yes, you will see cosmetic related advertisements in this office, but that is because this practice happens to offer aesthetic services as well. Not once have I felt pressured to consider cosmetic procedures or services at any of my appointments - although I wish I could afford them! I also don't have the best insurance plan, but I was never given any problems. In fact, they took the time to find me a doctor they trust to perform my surgical procedure that would accept my plan so that I did not have to deal with the frustration of doing it myself. It's true they are sticklers about being 15 minutes early for your appointment; however, they were upfront about this when I was scheduling so I was not surprised the one time I was running late that I had to reschedule. I am really happy with Stockton Dermatology and trust the quality of care they provide. I plan on continuing my relationship and would highly recommend them.I visited Best Hong Kong due to my friend from Tempe who told me he had to stop by here every time he came back home.  Raved about the duck.  I've never understood duck...very little meat and bony.  Why not just eat chicken?  Anyways...

We were greeted by a very non enthusiastic male server who seemed to grunt more than speak.  I thought maybe it was a language barrier...but my buddy said he was his least favorite waiter and a horrible one at that.  We both work in the service industry and are very sensitive to bad service.  He took our order competently and brought us back cokes and waters (always order water!!).  He brought the food out and was not very agile in placing our plates (my buddy ordered for both of us and always listens to his stomach!).  Twice I thought he was going to put a plate on top of a plate...I hate when I have to move stuff around for them to place it.  After that...we didn't hear from him until he brought the check...even the sound of a straw being sucked with little beverage failed to get his attention.  Finally a girl who was hanging out by the kitchen spotted us and brought refills.  The service was the worst part...

The food was incredible.  My buddy ordered a 1/2 duck, 1/2 chicken, pepper pork chops, beef chow fun and Chinese broccoli with oyster sauce.  

I've never had duck this good.  This duck was actually meaty (still bony, but what can you do right).  Very, very good.  Blew the chicken away.  The chicken was good too...but it was a very familiar taste.  Beef chow fun isn't my favorite noodle, i prefer chow mien, but I went with it and it was good.  The pepper pork chop was very good.  I think i ate more of that then anything else.  The Chinese broccoli was delicious and I ate many stalks of it (and I'm pretty much anti-vegetable unless prepared perfectly).  

I hear they have other servers that are better and I'd recommend going in on their days of work.  The food is incredible and I'd definitely give this place 5 stars if the service was superb."yummy, authentic, local Korean restaurant!" - 4/5 

We were so happy when we found out about Hodori. Since I was first introduced by my Korean friend Kristy to Hodori, I have been dragging J there for at least 4 times now. 

We always ordered spicy tofu + seafood soup, seafood pancake, bulgolgi beef and jap chae when we were there. The service is fast and good. Even though the price is a bit higher but it is worth the price. You won't be too disappointed with Hidori!This was a nice little place that my sister introduced me to. I played here and had a good time the crowd was very responsive. The bartender was very cool but it helped that my sister was a regular there. We only had few drinks, I had all mix drinks and stuck with the good ol' Vodka Red Bull. It was a good size drink (meaning I got a whole can of red bull not just half) hard to mess that one up.

All in all I had a good time just chillin with my sister after I played my set. She and her boyfriend showed me a good time while I was in town.

One think I really liked about this place was the fact we had such good service, and a nice place to sit down and talk at. I can't wait to go back and visit Hollywood sometime.Very Italian, tasty and busy on Friday nights.  It is a mix of neighborhood types on dates, older couples and regulars.  You might have to wait so make a reservation.  The bread was awesome and the meat sauce was perfect.  Good wine and beer selection.  A bit pricey but they know what they are doing.I went in for an oil change. After adding inspection, adjust and clean rear brakes (was needed) and signing up for the Firestone card, cost about $70. The nice man offered me a whole slew of other things they could also do, but didn't pressure me at all when I declined most of them. Very good service for this basic maintenance I had done, for a price.I have been frequenting this place for years. Great chinese food. The food is always better if you go for dinner. Dining in is waaay better than take out and lunch time. For dinner they bring out fresh fried wontons and for dessert you get fried banana wontons and fortune cookies. Brings back childhood memories :)
We always order the golden gate fish which is fried pieces of fish in a sweet sauce with toasted walnuts. It's very good, better than the shrimp version. The szechuan chicken is really good too. If you like it spicy make sure you specify that when you order. I always need chilli oil on the side. But the food is very good, I keep going back. 
Service can be slow, so if you get a hold of the waitress tell her everything you want at once, cuz you don't know when she will be back :P But the staff is very friendly.This is a great spot to go for a good, old-fashioned Italian meal.  The decor is riduculously kitchy and stereotypically "Italian", but a lot of fun.  If you go with kids, I highly recommend asking to sit at the "kitchen table", a booth that's actually located right inside the kitchen!  You get free entertainment as you watch the chefs and waiters scurry about.  (It's usually tough to get this table for dinner, but fairly easy during the lunch hours.)

The food is very good, and the "small" portions are easily enough to split between two people.  We ordered a "sampler" meal, which included ravioli, cannelloni, stuffed shells, and manicotti.  Delicious!  Our little guy ordered the spaghetti and meatballs off of the kids' menu, and barely finished half of his meal.  Prices are reasonable, given the portion sizes, and I have found several coupons for $10 off of a minimum $20 purchase, which is a great deal!

Tip: Come for your birthday and receive a free dessert (if you have room)!Went again last week with my wife.  She had their shrimp tempura and beef teriyaki combo lunch and I had their Korean rice bowl with various sashimi pieces and veggies -- very good.  The owner, who is Korean, also told me that I can order some Korean dishes the next time and if they have the ingredients, she would make them for me.  I thought that this was nice and I appreciated her willingness to satisfy my craving for some hard to find Korean dishes.  We still like this place.Good bar, and great wings!!! Tuesday and Thursday .39 cent wing nights. I stop in one of their locations every time I am in town.Tacos are delicious and the fajitas are phenomenal!  Great service (even when its busy), fresh tortillas, yummy salsa!  Definitely worth the trip.They do a good job at a good deal but negotiate and get yourself a great deal! Make the sales man work for his sale.Pretty simple to make my kids happy with the consistent goodness off a couple hot cakes in the morning. Thanks Ronald!This is a great place to get sushi. The atmosphere is so-so, but the staff is Japanese and they do not hold back on the quality of food. The picture of me is actually at the Ichi Ban drinking the Volcano. 2 of these ENORMOUS drinks will get you buzzed, so I have 4 or 5. The fresh eel is the best the place has to offer, and it comes highly suggested. Give this place a try and you'll be back. And by the way, it's HEALTHY FOR YOU.Just got my new 2012 Passat tinted at A better tint.  No only from the first time i called to ask a couple question to the point of paying for my services every single staff member was amazing.  They were there to answer questions and even give there opinion on how things would look.  

I had an appointment at 10am but happen to arrive at 9:30 they got me all signed in and started working on my car immediately.  They said it would be 2 hours well they did it even faster and finished in about 1hr and 15mins. 

This was one of the best groupons that i have purchased and will always get my windows tinted at a better tint.Super Yum!  We were on our way to a lecture on Art Appraising and I wanted Hawaiian food, so I looked up a place near where we were going and found Aloha Kitchen. 

Gary had been there numerous times before and said it sounded it good to him, so we went!

We shared won tons, and ordered chicken teriyaki and bulgoki and had 2 pineapple orange juices. 

Everything was really super yummy!  Our dishes also came with macaroni-potato salad which was delish! 

AND!  They have a recycling bin for the juice cans! yay!  I'd definitely hit this place up again if I were in the area.Crackers and Co. is always a treat. Like other users have mentioned the California Eggs benedict is absolutely awesome. Also like other users said, parking can sometimes be a pain. The location in South Tempe usually has less people, but as with any breakfast place if you go between 7-10 AM expect a bit of a wait. 

The employees here usually outshine the food, especially so at the Mesa location. A gentle old lady let us pore over the menu for 10 minutes before putting in our order. The food was out of the kitchen quickly (despite the full house) which is a huge positive in my book. I hate lingering around restaurants at their busiest times.

The last good thing I'll mention about Crackers & Co. is the low price of the food. Guaranteed to stop your brain from leaking out of your ears after a night of heavy drinking.We came for breakfast on a rare rainy day in September and we weren't disappointed. We tried a variety of items and all were good. The one hiccup in service was the water we requested never arrived, but the good food made up for the oversight.I stumbled upon this restaurant when performing a Yelp search for Ceviche in Mesa the other day.

I was a little skeptical due to some of the low ratings, but we decided to enter the humble looking venue, in the primitive looking strip mall.

We were immediately greeted and seated by a lovely hostess / server. She was extremely attentive and informative, as we were not familiar with Pupusas or much of the other Salvadorian Cuisine.

We ordered and shared the Shrimp Ceviche, which was garnished with fresh Avocado and Cucumbers. The freshly fried tortilla chips were very tasty, and the ceviche was a little more on the sweet side vs. the typical intense lime flavor. It was very fresh tasting, and we both really enjoyed it.

We were given a lesson in what Pupusas are, and asked our lovely waitress to pick three of her favorite choices and send them out. She chose Carne Asada, Chicharon with beans, and the last one was not quite identified, but was very tasty.

Before bringing out the Pupusas, she dropped off a small bowl of a red sauce, and a bowl of spicy cabbage, which were meant to be used as toppings for the Pupusas.

We both thought that the Pupusas were very simple, yet tasty. The spicy cabbage and red sauce as toppings really added flavor to the Pupusas.

We were impressed with what we perceived to be authentic Salvadorian Cuisine, so we ordered one last dish. 

We had to try the fried Plantains, served with a black bean sauce, and Crema. The plantains were fried to perfection with nice caramelization. The black bean sauce was interesting, and the cream was a little on the salty side, rather than sweet as I would have expected. It is small details such as these which led us to believe that the food was authentic.

Don't let the other reviews mislead you if you are looking for a fresh, authentic experience. 

If you want a fancy location with beer and wine, then forget about it. This place is all about giving an authentic, down to earth, culinary experience to those who seek quality without the distraction of interior design.  :)Salvadoreno Restaurant

Having never eaten Salvadoran food before, I decided to try it, and am so glad that I did. This is totally different than Mexican food.

This is a relatively small restaurant, with a tiny kitchen, but don't let the size fool you - that tiny kitchen turns out some wonderful food. I noticed that I was the only gringa in the place - a good sign that the food is muy authenitico.

The waitress brought my drink along with a nice, crisp cole slaw type salad with some greens in it that I was not able to identify, but which gave it a nice flavor. Service is a little slow, but I attribute that to the fact that every dish is cooked to order - no steam tables here.

Next, was the main course. I ordered the Lengua Guisada ($9.95). Nice, big slices of tongue braised in a wonderful mild tomato type sauce, served with rice that had veggies in it, and small dish of liquified black beans along with two of the most succulent corn tortillas I have ever eaten. Instead of being crisp and crunchy, these were firm on the outside, and soft and tender on the inside. For the more adventurous, there is also hot sauce on the table. The flavors were all wonderful, and I used the corn tortillas to mop up all of the sauce on the plate. I would be lax if I didn't mention the fact the that food was served steaming hot.

I had to try the Pupupas, which are stuffed corn tortillas which are then grilled. I tried two different ones, and although I was entitled to get rice and bean with them, I opted not to have them because I was already getting full. The first Pupupas was stuffed with shrimp and cheese, and had a lovely texture and flavor. They have a tomato based sauce on the table that you can slather on your Pupupas if you so desire. I found that it really augmented the flavor and ended up using it on both Pupupas. The second Pupupas was shredded pork and cheese, and while tasty, wasn't up to the flavor profile of the camerones.

Unfortunately, by this time I was stuffed and had no more room to try anything else, but I will be back to try some more. Next time I want to try the Sopa de Pata/Mondongo, which is a hearty soup of heart and beef tripe, along with the Ensalada de Camarones Asados, which is a grilled shrimp salad.

It's hard to leave here hungry - you really would have to work at it!

Sanitation was good and the place is handicapped aware. They also will modify menu items to make them vegetarian.

I give them 4 stars for a really tasty meal that was muy authentico.My husband brought me to the clinic on Thanksgiving after I was feeling VERY dizzy all morning and wasn't going away. The wait was average, they had others to see before it was my turn. My head was down almost the whole time but from what I seen the clinic was clean and orderly. I wish they would have had a bench or something so the ones that need to lay down can. The male nurse was very nice and the doctor was very good. He did what he could, check my urine. He thought I was dehydrated since we just moved here and am not used to the weather yet. He called some antibiotics in. I went home, drank a whole bunch, rested and felt better later on that night. I was very impressed that they didn't treat me like crud ( even though I looked and felt like crud) like alot of doctors do. I will go back there and will tell anyone I can to go there also.I have always been a huge fan- love the food, the environment, the overall experience.  Price is right, service is normally fast and food is good quality. My only "dislike" is no beer/wine/bar, I am no lush, but occasionally enjoy an adult beverage while dining.  Otherwise- great place!Like my other review, I STILL love the garlic knots. This time trying the calzone.Cesar salad, wings very yummy. Pizza could have cooked just a little longer. Staff friendly and helpful. we love coming here when we are in town.Lets just say I love that I can order Chinese food and have it delivered to my place! Came home on a Sunday night after being gone all weekend and the kids and I were starving, so I said lets order something, so we ordered beef fried rice, crab puffs (my fav!!!) orange chicken, pork lo main and after we placed the order company showed up and I asked him if he was hungry and he said yea I told him we just ordered some chinese, do you want some, he said ok, but didn't know what to order, so off we went to Red Dragon, my phone order was already out the door by the time I got there, he ordered pepper beef and egg rolls, we took it home and had a good dinner! Now I have a take out menu at the house LOL.Pizza by the slice.. crust is crunchy and just right:) 

We had a chance encounter with this place, by just driving by and decided to give it a whirl. Its a nice tiny eatery on the corner and it must be legit, because almost all the people ordering take-out and dining in were Italian.. We only tried the pizza by the slice, so cannot comment on anything else. 

Give it a try!Finding authentic Pakistani food was almost impossible despite a large community and so called Pakistani restaurant called copper kettle. This restaurant serves chicken karahi which is actually tasty. The nans are freshly baked and are a delight. The restaurant itself is about the size of walk in closet and can only seat eight people. I would only recommend it for take out food. The owner is very courteous.My son Daniel kept buggin me to try this place, but I was reluctant. No good reason. I just already have my fave taco shops, and plus the bland strip-mall experior just didn't shout "Eat here" to me.

But he got to choose where to eat the other night after his National Honor Society induction ceremony, and he chose here. 

I gotta say, my kid really is smart. Los Favoritos is definitely a notch above typical fast-food-ish Mexican. On my son's recommendation, I got the "breakfast" chorizo burrito (served all day). It was on a tortilla the size of a small planet, and stuffed full of savory & spicy meat, cheese, potato and egg.  My husband ordered carne asada, and Daniel got chili rellenos. They were wonderful! 

The service was ify, simply becuase communication was a bit hard with non-English native speakers. But they get an A for effort.

I guess I owe Los Favoritos an apology for judging it on outward appearances alone. I'll certainly be going back!At first I was skeptical because of the reviews on yelp, but the food was quite good. There was nothing wrong with my order. It did take awhile for my order to come out but other then that, it's a nice placeThis is not my first review of Floridino's.

I was very close to never eating here again after being served "understuffed" calzones 3x in a row.  The outside corners contained nothing the last three times I dined there.

The saving grace for this restaurant is the Pizza Muffins.  They are excellent.  The pizzas are really good as well.  I'll stick with one of those two when I go there.  My daughters love this place, so I can't avoid going there.  I gave an extra star just because my kids love their food.

Step your game up, Floridino's!  Do some quality control with your calzones!Now this is the real deal of a local pizza joint with flavor.  Another review stated the calzone is not completely filled with stuffing at each corner, that is still true..a lot of wasted space and I don't care to eat simply cooked dough.  I too most likely will refrain from this menu item, but all else, well you cant go wrong and for my military buddies they have a military discount.

I'll be back...I would bring a date here!

The food is Cajun style with that New Orleans motif for decor.  The service was on point (good), and seating was more than adequate!  We asked for beads to darn on ourselves ---- and they brought us some!  The food is spicy as is Cajun style and the selections are terrific.  They serve alcohol and other libations...

The location is a bit outside of Phoenix Proper, but if you are looking for that Cajun effect---This is a good place to start.  

As a bonus, they gave us a gift card for $5 off our next visit...This was a nice evening to say the least...I recommend it.

Four stars: One for decor, one for how the food tasted!  One for service, and one for price (reasonable).Tasty steakhouse.  There's a coupon in the weekly junkmail bundle round here that makes this more affordable.Best little quilt shop in Chandler!  Staff is always friendly and helpful!!!I've been meeting with friends here for dim sum for the past few years and also had dinner here a few weeks ago. The food is consistently quite good, affordable, and fresh. The service is generally quite good as well.

My bride and I held our wedding reception here this past weekend in the small private room at the back of the dining room. The service and food were great and our guests enjoyed the dim sum adventure, a first for many of them. Fun and affordable!

The fun part is we'll be able to return to our reception restaurant with our friends anytime we like.Really nice people, always treated me very fair. Good services and reasonable prices.At a time when it's tough to find a place with any inventory of guns or ammunition, it is refreshing to find a decent selection of both AND super personable customer service!  Paula and Vic at Guns, Etc. were so patient and insightful and not only did they help us find/obtain what we needed ...I witnessed them helping other customers with equal poise and upbeat attitudes.  In fact, the whole team was clearly working under the pressure of the Saturday morning "rush" with lots of customers coming in and out and the phone ringing off the hook the whole time!  We left feeling energized and well taken care of.  I almost hugged Vic on the way out the door because he was so kind and helpful!  He got a warm, heartfelt handshake instead and our promise to recommend him (and his team there) and to return ourselves.I came to the Sheraton Wildpass for a conference and came across this beautiful restaurant - Kai.   The service at this restaurant was quite incredible.  The servers were so in sync with each other with the plates placements and all other services, it was actually pretty fun to watch!

I had the best Ribeye steak here - it was done just right and the meat just melted in my mouth.  I devoured the entire 16 oz of it without thinking much about all the calories.  It was done just right and I never really experience that much anywhere else.  

I also had the chocolate three ways for dessert and I actually was a bit disappointed with this.  The shake didn't taste too good and not much chocolate tastes in it.  The cake in the middle was kind of hard.

In summary - A nice restaurant and well decor that serves a killer steak.I went to India Gate with my boyfriend and had a great experience. The interior design was pleasant, the music was energetic, and the servers were extremely nice and helpful. We ordered paneer pakora as our appetizer and cheese naan. Both were undoubtedly delicious. For drinks, my boyfriend ordered the Merlot while I got the Cabernet Shiraz Indian wine they offered. The Indian wine was a real treat and the Merlot wasn't too bad itself. I don't remember exactly what my boyfriend got for his main dish but it contained shrimp and he loved it. My main course was the vegetarian dinner: Soup, two curries, daal maharani, rice, raita, naan, and kheer. While everything tasted perfect, my favourite was definitely the vegetable soup which consisted of lentils, numerous vegetables, and just the right amount of spices and herbs.Was there for my birthday yesterday, but it's not the first time I had been there. The service was excellent this evening, but I think that was because we got there at 5:30, just before the dinner rush hit. Our meals were brought to us in a very timely manner, and they even accommodated a picky child. I'm not sure why it says it's not good for kids, as the place was full of them and they have a kids menu.
 
The servings are always way more than you need. I had the Cobb Salad and brought most of it home. Had the calamari as an appetizer and absolutely loved it. And of course I needed a piece of vanilla bean cheesecake, after all it was my birthday. :-)  I definitely recommend going but try to plan a down time or just before or after a normal lunch or dinner rush.Last night my bestie and I dined at the CCF with a friend from college and his co-worker who were both visiting from out of state. We were seated immediately. Drinks were served within minutes of our arrival. I ordered the avocado egg rolls (delicious!) and the chicken parmesan sandwich. The sandwich was very good, but I had to take 1/2 of it home because I was so full. My bestie ordered a salad and it was huge! Overall this was a pleasant dining experience. I'll be back.This was my first time to Olive Garden in quite some years and the food was good.  The salad and breadsticks have not changed, but there were some new additions on the menu thay are worth the try.  Waiter and manager came around frequently to check on service and see how things were going.  Overall a good value for what you pay for.This place is fantastic! This was my son's first visit and I couldn't get him to leave. I really like the way this place is set up. They are very aware of child safety and they have a lot of different policies in place to make sure kids stay safe. They also have a lot of different activities for all ages of kids. When your party arrives, you are all given a wrist band to ensure what kids belong to you and your group and that you leave with them. Stranger danger under control here! This definitely puts a mother at ease when so many kids are running around and having a good time; your little ones can't leave without you! The area is nice a spacious full of all kinds of different adventures for the kids. They have a large tree house, full of obstacles, climbing areas, slides, dead ends, crawling spaces, bridges...... you name it they have it! They also have a little arcade tucked away, so if you want to buy some tokens to get away from the jungle gym for a bit you can. I think this would be a great place to have a bday party, for they have awesome party packages to choose from, you get your own private party area and a coordinator to help with it all! I will be looking into having my son's bday here this year. The best way to describe this place is a huge jungle gym for kids to have a great time at, while the adults can sit back and relax!BJ's is fun if you're with a buddy and need a quick bite before a movie over at Harkin's. The beer is made on the premises and is really good, they got a ton of huge tvs, sitting at the bar is a good idea if you're not there with kids, and the baked potatoes rock. Pizza is just so so, salads are good, and burgers are just average.Great beer! If it was the beer by itself I were rating, bj's would get 5 stars.The blond and piranha pale ale are my favorites. Food is good, but service is hit or miss(never actually had terrible service, however only once had fantastic service). I go for the beer! And you should too!I've been to Teakwoods a couple different times and have enjoyed myself each and every time. My last visit was one of the most memorable. We were there in large group and they ran out of the larger draft glasses on the last 2 of us (me and my boyfriend). So, they brought us each out a mini-pitcher full of beer and charged us for the glass. Amazing! 

The service is great- quick and friendly and with peanuts on the table, you can't go wrong. Inside, it's your standard local bar (with peanut shells all over the floor). And, on the outside, it's tucked inside a strip mall with ample parking.We had Dugan Plumbing come out as a result of a warranty claim with our Home Warranty Company.  Our initial experience was with one of their techs, and when he left our home, we believed everything was all set.  However, when we went up to bed that night, we found water throughout our master bathroom and into the carpet in our master bedroom.  We understand that "stuff" happens, and we wanted to give Dugan the opportunity to make it right.  Geoff answered the phone late that evening and  promised to have someone out in the morning again to take care of it.  When I expressed my concern with having the same tech out, he offered to come out himself and take care of the problem.  By late morning the next day, Geoff had come to the property and remedied the issue.  I asked him what we were supposed to do about the water soaked carpet.  He immediately got on the phone with his water restoration company and they came out within a matter of hours to set up remediation and protect our floors and baseboards.  Dugan's response to our issue demonstrates that when "stuff" happens, the good guys come out and make it right.Accepts student I'd's! 7 dollars instead of 10:)Planned a little day trip and drive to Florence, Arizona, and knew I had to stop here for lunch.  Hadn't been here in about four years, but seemed to have remembered liking this place . . . and my memory was correct.

The beer was good and cold . . . had a couple of Shock Top drafts . . . the wait staff and bartenders were cheerful and talkative . . . the atmosphere was as I remembered it . . . kinda biker / dive barish.

Ordered the Road King burger and steak fries . . . burger was good, not great (three napkins), and would have like it a little less done (more toward medium) . . . and the steak fries were crisp on the outside and soft on the inside . . . just the way I like them.

I will definitely be back . . . even if I have to plan a day trip again.i almost didn't take my car here when i saw the other review, but discount recommended them...
my experience was great-everyone there was really nice, got my car in the garage right away (had an appointment), got the alignment done, and i even added on an oil change. i'd go there again.This is a great place for a casual evening. We've been for dinner 40-50 times and it has yet to disappoint. Most evenings there are only a handful of diners, so it is a great place if you want to have a conversation over dinner without straining to hear.

The Tom Yum Gum (sp?) is a great soup to start with - and they do it a little on the spicy side. My family particularly enjoys the Crying Tiger and the Sweet and Sour Tofu as entrees. We also usually have the coconut ice cream and the Thai custard for desert. They are excellent.I must have gone on a rare night compared to these other reviews (ok so what we were already trashed) but we loved this place. The band was playing 90's grunge, the crowd was fun, and the burgers are to f*n DIE for..  definitely a good bar for being on the east side of town. and JAKE RULES !!! xoxThis place isn't bad. Despite being a busy Saturday night, the service was pretty darned good. We had our drinks refilled regularly and our food came out promptly (and was hot). 

The food overall was really good. The beans were creamy, as was the guacamole. I love their guac. Their fried ice cream wasn't too bad. The selection of food to pick from is wide which is also nice. 

My only complaint is that the food is a bit greasy. Even the chips that they give you have a thin layer of grease over them, which you notice more and more as they cool off. 

I definitely would come back here again.My husband and I were hungry for tacos and we really enjoy Nando's.  It was a beautiful night so we sat outside on the patio.  Yes.....me....I sat outside.  LOL   I don't care for real hot salsa and theirs is perfect for me.  Their shredded beef is flavorful and moist.  The only negative I have with this place is every time I have been there the wait staff is not a friendly as I would like and they do not make eye contact.  That is a pet peeve of mine.I've never met a taco didn't like. That being said, the shredded beef tacos are bomb!! If you are expecting a fancy Mexican spread then be prepared to be disappointed. This is quick, solid Mexican food. 

My kids love coming here. The kids meals are cheap (something parents like) and they come with churros!! Need I say more?

I've never used the drive thru but it never seems to move quickly. Park and come inside so you can peruse the extensive menu. They also have different specials for each day of the week so look out for those. Oh, and the horchata is pretty good too.Delicious food but we went during Valentines day so there was a huge line! I would definetly come here again when it is not so busy.Still great even after the move to downtown Gilbert from the old farm house.  The food is very much like farm fresh breakfast you would find in the mid west.Great place, delicious breakfast, relatively cheap. Sad that they don't use real maple syrup, but their cinnamon buns are amazing and their scrambles are top-notch.Livestock. Yes, livestock. This weekend I bought livestock from Aden's Hay Oasis. I started small - getting 4 chicks, but I will soon expand my livestock ownership to goats in the next few weeks. Aden didn't carry goats, but they had food, cages, and accessories for ALL kinds of livestock, from goats and sheep, to dairy cows and show horses. 

I was able to pick out my chicks and get all the essentials from Aden's. The two guys working the shop were less than helpful...they definitely seemed detached and they were a little slow checking me out. But when I asked them a direct question, they knew what they were talking about and helped me out.

If you're coming from far away, call first to make sure they have what you need...because it's a long drive only to find out they are out of something!If you have bunnies or guinea pigs, it seems like there is a constant search for good quality hay that won't break the bank.  Aden's hay oasis offers bermuda, alfalfa, and timothy hay by the bale for an inexpensive price compared to other small animal retailers.  I'm not sure how many pounds a bale is, but the bale I bought was approx 1'x2'x3' and will fit in your car (bring 2 33 gallon trash bags to prevent any loose hay from invading into the upholstery or the trunk).  The timothy hay they sell here is 2nd cut, and a bale is $17.99 including tax.  The quality isn't as good as hay I've bought from other places (Tranquility Trail, kmshayloft online), as it's less leafy, with thinner blades of grass, and more brown, but the price can't be beat, and it's relatively close-by compared to the other two.

In addition to hay, Aden's sells baby chickens, ducks, various types of feed, and supplies for livestock.  Those baby chicks and ducks are adorable!Pretty neat "one-stop-shop" for pretty much anything that you might need or want.  Prices are a little higher than other conveniance-type stores, but their selection seems better, especially in the booze department.

Staff is nice and friendly, but they seem (look) overworked - ?  I hope they are treated well by the owners, because they always greet me with a smile when I'm in there.

Hopefully the Circle-K opening across the street does not hurt them too bad.I moved to this area last year and decided to check funny looking (Giant Pink Hog) shop out!  We are sold!!  I get my bacon and sausage here and my family loves it!!  It is definitely a treat when we need pork products to get them here! They are usually busy crazy, but it's kinda fun and exciting for this area to have a local shop doing so well!Good dept store. Great selections of products. Weekly sales to make it interesting.Contrary to what most people think - Chicago pizza's are not all deep dish pies! I like the occasional deep dish but mainly prefer the thin crust that I grew up with.

When I moved to greater Chicagoland, Rosati's was my most frequently ordered, as it was very close to my favorite small-town pizza joint. This place is true to its roots.

Rosati's has great pizza and if you visit the store, the staff treats you very well as others have noted. The Big Cheef is an incredible Italian beef that I get when I'm really hungry. I recommend adding tomatoes, sweet peppers and some sauce! My wife and daughter love the lasagna.

You won't be able to get one of those $10 pies the chains are battling over but the pizza from Rosati's will blow those guys away any day.Houston's always has consistently very good food.  The service is pretty decent, though I have had a few incidences of a snotty bartender.  I have eaten everything from the smoked salmon appetizer, to the tuna salad, to a steak dinner and it was always well presented and delicious.  The drinks are a bit on the pricey side, but I guess that is to be expected at a nice restaurant in Scottsdale.  

The atmosphere is great if you want an intimate setting.  The booths are cozy and arranged so you don't hear 3 other tables' conversations.  Last time I went they had a very pleasant Jazz band playing in the background.  Also, the bar is a great place to sit if you are alone and just want a good meal and a drink.  

I should also note this is a very busy restaurant and the wait times can be long.  If you have a big party or want dinner on the weekends, I recommend booking a reservation.If it's Corned Beef and Cabbage you like, Randy's on Thursday night is the place to go!!  I'm there at least twice a week. The food is good and there are planty of specials on the board every day.  Their soups are always great!   They now have gluten-free bread so I can actually get a sandwich again!  Best of all...the waitstaff are all wonderful, friendly and attentive.  They greet you like an old friend!  Great neighborhood place.Pickle Chips! What the hell?

...and man are they good, I had never even heard of them before -- deep fried pickle chips served with ranch dressing... Yum!

My girls really like it here - so we tend to visit about once a month. The food is good overall, though sometimes the service can be a little slow... The atmosphere is cheesy and perfect for kids.The food here is excellent.  I have yet to have ANYTHING that was less than delicious.  Their stuffed croissant sandwiches are perfectly made every time, crispy and tasty.  This is a coffee shop...I've never had the coffee, but we end up here for lunch several times a week- they have a full lunch menu, mostly sandwiches, but you can't go wrong with any of them.

If I've put on any weight lately (likely) its because they are very good bakers here, their muffins and especially their chocolate chip cookies (ask for them warmed, if they aren't already, early morning muffins are always warm and freshly baked on site).  Amazingly good.  

I give them less than five stars for one reason:   their prices are a bit steep for the area.  But its good.  I'll be going back very soon.Thousands of miles on three sets of tires and every visit for the "free" rotation and balance has come with prompt and polite service.  No hidden or extra costs.  On two occasions I needed a new valve stem and other occasions I needed rebalance.  No questions asked and no charge.

How many places can you take a vehicle and have service performed with no charge?

The new tire service has been outstanding every time with honest deals.  At most I have had to wait 45 minutes to an hour plus can walk across the street to Best Buy to cool off and check out the latest in electronics.

No need to throw the tire thru the window!!!By far my favorite place to boogie the night away, it is the quintessential 30 something spot. An inviting patio with white chaise longues, couches, and love seats, with access to the high priced bar, is a wonderful way to start the night, and welcome patrons to what to expect within.

Before continuing on, there a few things to note and to remember:

There are two locations; north on shea blvd. and scottsdale rd., and in old town on 4175 N. Goldwater.

Old town location:
Pros:
-Ladies always get in free, no matter what time of night.
-Sandwhiches, bottled water, and roses await the patrons as they leave the bar at the end of the night, gratis.
-Music is very diverse, and bound to please every patron at least once

Cons:
-Dance floor is so packed by 11pm you can forget about venturing out there
-Crowd is younger, college age crowd
-Sometimes you can stand in line for an hour, because they pack them in and don't 
send anybody packing
- if you are looking to sit back and relax, forget it! there's too many people

North Location:

Pros: 
-Two for One Drinks all day and all night on Thursdays, until 8pm on Friday
-all appetizers are half off on fridays until 10p
-More space
-Mature crowd, see more thirty somethings and up
-Music evolves and alternates all night from techno, rock, disco, to hip hop, middle eastern, salsa...
-Food served until 10pm, and it is delicious!

Cons:
-I can't think of any

Having stated the previous... Devil's is posh, 80% of the patrons are dressed to the nines and looking like they just got airbrushed, everyone is friendly and just wants to partake in the baccinalia, the drinks are strong (though pricey), the dance floor is flooded with john travoltas and pussycat dolls, and half the people there are looking for late night rendez-vous.
There is a VIP area with its own bar, where the DJ booth is located.  Three other bars are found within the club, and there are also private cabanas for rent.  With the cabanas, you have private table, curtain optional, with a bottle of Dom P. and 10 of your closest friends, which is $300.  Basically, you are paying $30 per person, and they get in free at the door and get to drink your expensive champagne, too.
I have met and boogied with some of the most interesting characters...Physcial therapists in training from Scotland, Aussie backpackers, multi-million dollar entrepreneurs, and a flurry of beautiful young women escaping the humdrum to headbang to AC/DC.

*Hints:
best night to go for drinks is thursdays, when it is two for one, but there aren't as much people
friday nights it is busy and fun, but you will notice an older crowd
saturday nights tend to be the younger crowds, and i notice that i don't have as much fun
arrive early. 8:30 isn't even early here. by 9pm the tables are removed, the chairs gone from the bar. by 9:30 the first people are hitting the dance floor. by 10pm people are standing in line to get in, and the cover charge begins.Meets all the criteria for a splendid lunch.  Quick and efficient service.  Great prices.  Food that doesn't make you want to take a 2pm nap.  And food that is exceptionally tasty....even a tad healthy.The check in was awesome, fast and friendly.  The only thing I did not like was that our room was like located so far from the front lobby, it was like we had to go through a maze to get to it.  Anyone who has stayed at the Carson towers at the Nugget in Vegas, u know what I mean. But the service was IMPECCABLE.  They have a beautiful dessert display at sundown, so u can take a dessert back to ur room. Check out was very easy.  We opted out of the valet. I dont think paying $26.00 bucks a night is necessary.  The free parking is not that far. However if you dont plan to go to the spa or work out, you can opt out of the resort fee. We should have opted out, but we didnt because we were undecided on what to do. Beautiful resort and very very friendly staff willing to serve you whole heartedly.  The only thing I was upset over is when we went to dinner at Tommy Bahamas, we got stuck in the elevator for 20 minutes. Either than that, the resort experience was more like 5+ stars, not 4.Update on my previous complaint-The resort manager at Kierland, Brian Montalbano reached out to me. He went above and beyond to correct the issues I had and has won me back. With solid leadership like Brian, my faith has been restored in your company. However it was still annoying how late the maids tried to clean the rooms every day.We have been coming to this restaurant for the past nine years and haven't had a bad experience yet. My father and and husband are addicted to the veal gorgonzola and ordered it the other night as usual. They raved about the tenderness of the meat and the richness of the cheese sauce. Unlike these gentlemen, I order something different every time we go. This time is was the gnocci with shrimp and argula---yum! The potato dumplings were sleek, plump, and velvety, peppered with plenty of shrimp in the sauce. I find the freshness of their seafood and the pastas pretty amazing. 

Of course the service tops it all off. Our lovely "mustached" waiter, who had obviously been doing his job well for many years, kept things humming and organized. We received a very warm greeting at the door as well to start things off on the right note as well. We love this place!First timers to Handlebar-J and it was wonderful! We went at an off time so it was dead but the food was still amazing. My husband and I got the grilled artichoke to start, the fish and chips for me and ribs for him. The ribs were so tender he barely pressed into them and the meat melted off the bone. Sharon our server was kind and informative recommending all her favorite items which we accepted gladly. We will be back on a more lively night for dancing!Oh Tutti Santi.  How I love this place!  Whenever I am in town, my mom and I come here for dinner.  That's mostly because it is so close to her house that we feel we can freely consume copious amounts of chianti.  I'm always surprised by how busy this place is given it's location.  Even if you have to wait for a table, head in to the bar where you can expect a generous pour!  

The food is pretty decent, though not inexpensive.  I would best describe it as Italian comfort food.  For some reason, I LOVE the fettucine alfredo, though I'll admit it isn't spectacular. 

Plan to top your meal off with a complimentary shot of sambuca.  Make sure to leave an espresso bean behind for luck!Okay so before everyone gets all JUDGEY about the impossibly high rating I gave a sushi restaurant in Arizona that's part of a chain owned by Benihana (THE HORROR!), hear me out.  My office is located in the Kierland Commons. This can be nice when I want to blow half my paycheck at H&M during my lunch break, but it's not so nice when I NEED to blow half my paycheck if I want to be able to go somewhere walking distance from my office for lunch. Originally, I thought my most reasonable options were a $7 Asian Chicken Salad at Chloe's Corner or crossing Scottsdale Rd to get to Chipotle. That is, until I ventured over to RA today and saw what I had been missing.

For starters, they have some amazing lunch specials.  Yes, they are pricier than Chipotle but in the grand scheme of sushi, they're pretty damn good. They have a Sashimi Lunch combo that is four pieces of salmon, tuna, and yellowtail with a miso soup and a salad for like $12.  Their Bento lunches come with so many things I can't even remember them all and cost like $9.  For the area (this mall in particular), these lunch prices are incredibly reasonable.

What I got today, the Tuna Squared Salad, isn't even on the lunch menu and it totally blew my mind that for a couple bucks more than the tuna-mayo salad over greens I get at Chloe's (which is delicious BTW but that's not the point), I could be getting a huge portion of greens topped with about 5-6 pieces of seared ahi, about 5-6 slices seared sushi-grade albacore, avocado, and cashews.  These are all very expensive things!  This should be a very expensive salad! But it's $10 and it's glorious.

Oh one more thing that I probably won't be getting while we're in the triple digits but I have had before and it's delightful: Miso Hot Soup.  Picture a huge miso soup full of shrimp and tofu and mushrooms with with a kick strong enough to clear your sinuses.  Plus it comes with these fried rice balls (I usually get it to go and they come on the side) that are surprisingly delicious. I always think I can save some calories and not eat them, but it never happens. Those suckers are in the soup by the second spoonful and gone before I'm half done, they're just that good.

All in all, no, I don't go to RA for mind-blowingly fresh, melt-in-your-mouth sushi. But I do go for decent lunch options at prices that allow me to blow money during my lunch break the way God intended: Shopping.I like this place overall - MOST of the staff is great and the food is consistently yummy.  I especially enjoy the home fries and their thick bacon slices!  Bloody Mary's are filled with horseradish and kind of pricey IMO at $5-$7, but are nice for a treat every once and a while.

Also, they have great coffee and a dog friendly patio.  If you're trying it out for the first time, get a yelp deal or SOME type of deal, take a leap, and dive into the bagels head first!Wonderful staff, great stylists, a little pricey, could have a better floor plan.

I went here with my entire wedding party to have everything done. My sylist even came in early before they opened so she could accomodate us. We were all finished in a timely manner and we all loved the outcome of our hair, nails, etc. 

Positives: If you are willing to pay for the service, it's worth it. The staff is very friendly. Even if you go there for the first time it doesn't feel awkward. 

Negatives: crowded and noisy when they are busy, can get a cheaper haircut that turns out the same from somewhere else, like AZ Hair Company. 

Other: I would recommend making an appointment even though they do walk-ins,Better than Macaroni Grille.  You gotta love the soup and salad and some entrees are pretty tasty and a standard fare.  Olive Garden actually has some very good items.   Their salad dressing is yummy, and their drink menu is tasty.  Olive Garden is solid and reliable.  They are always adding new dishes and they make some great new combos.I really enjoyed living at Bellagio Apartments - in fact, I would still be there now had my job not transferred me to Pennsylvania.  The apartments are all very large in size, and the community is quiet and has a lot of well-maintained green space.  The staff that works in the office are very friendly and any maintenance issue I'd encountered was quickly resolved.  The location in Scottsdale was close to the 101 and 51, as well as Scottsdale Road shops and restaurants.

The appliances in the kitchen could have used an upgrade, but everything worked just fine, so i was happy on that front.  The Washer and Dryer in my unit were brand new.It's like the Meatloaf song, "4 outta 5 ain't bad"  I can't seem to give the 5th start to Phoenix Sushi places, it's like I am blocked by the God of Shashimi. Don't get me wrong this place is great they have a wide variety, friendly and quick staff, and it is really off the beaten path. It is pretty small and quaint, ( I actually had a debate with a person I went with here, can something be both small and quaint?) Either way, it's nice inside, you get a cozy sushi feeling. The Miso soup is great, and the shashimi is fresh, and cut into big pieces. The prices are OK,  the down side, no happy hour of any kind.  It is a small place, so I can see why they don't have a happy hour. I highly recommend this place to all sushi lovers, you won't be disappointed. It's very clean and inviting.

In the terms of atmosphere, I was tempted to get hammered off saki here, (though I only had 1 Sapporo)  it's that type of place that you want to do shots of Saki with the sushi chef's and pass out on a plate of ahi tuna, to awaken with a tattoo on your arm that says "Konichiwa Bitches" and has a picture of Morimoto the Iron Chef from Japan, it's that quaint ;).As you approach this building from the outside, you don't really expect alot, or at least I didn't. It's in a strip plaza (across the street from the Fry's on 90th), surrounded by shops catering toward spyware and vitamins. Odd, huh? In any case, you walk in and immediately notice how small the place is. Some may call it quaint - perhaps that's a nicer way of saying "i could walk the length of the restaurant if I took 50 giant steps." 

Sushi bar is where to go. The chefs are polite and offer suggestions. Don't expect to be entertained, but do expect to receive your order in a timely fashion. 

You get a clean towel here, too. And prompt beverage service. 3.50 for a Sapporo - you can't go wrong. 

So, is there anything extraordinary about this place? Not really, but perhaps that's why it works. Without the loud music and flashy scene of Scottsdale, you instead find succulent sashima in generous portions, along with a menu that makes you "hmmm" and "uhmmm" a bit longer than usual. 

Miso soup is medicore (i've had better) and the edamame is refreshing without a thunderstorm of salt - thankfully!

Jazz Roll. Crazy Roll. Shrimp Tempura Roll. How do you decide? When it doubt, just try it all. Or get the Caterpillar Roll - it's made different from other places. I can't quite put my finger on it, but there's something oddly wonderful about mixing textures - from the softness of the rice and avacado to the crunchyness of the inside. Oh, and eel is divine. So is the extra bonus of shrimp ontop. 

I wouldn't consider this my fave place, and it's definitely not in my neighborhood... but if you live, work or just happen to be in the area, definitely stop into Hiro. You shouldn't leave disappointed, unless you're expecting something other than great food, friendly staff and, lo and behold, a restaurant where you actually hear Japanese spoken by the staff. Now that's worth a bonus star!Always has what I'm looking for.  

Good place to run in for what you want, or to wander aimlessly because you just don't quite know what you want to read next.I've been to this Fry's twice now and each time I feel like I've entered a delightful culinary labyrinth. I took my husband once and had to warn him not to be in shock/awe but the second we got inside he stopped dead and told me he was in sensory overload. This place is THAT large. There's a sushi bar, a salad bar, a hot food bar, etc. The list goes on and on. There is so much to see and definitely makes me want to spend more time and money than I planned! The one downside is that they do not have furniture like that other fancy Fry's Marketplace on Tatum/Shea. There is some outdoor patio furniture when you walk in, but not much. Otherwise, this place has all your food needs at great prices. I would definitely recommend this place - but only if you've got the time. It's like Ikea, you come for one thing but wander for hours.Whataburger is so much better than McDonald's.  There is a new McDonald's at Granite Reef and McDonald Dr. SOOO bad.  Three tries and I'm done with this location.  

Went to this Whataburger and had a very tasty burger.  My new favorite fast food burger.  Friendly staff.  Wait inside was a bit long but the burgers were fresh and hot.Quite possibly one of the loveliest pools around.  It's actually more of a complex of interconnected pools complete with a beach at one end (kid alert!) and a swim-up bar on the other side.  At night the whole complex is enchanting.

The staff is quite friendly and the hotel boasts several good bar options for hanging out and soaking up atmosphere.  

Did I say friendly staff?  Hmm, let me just say that my every interaction with a member of this team was accompanied by a genuine smile and/or "How are you?".   Hospitality industry veterans (yep, that's me) are pretty good at spotting the grit-teeth-and-smile-at-the-annoyance look.  I never saw it here.

What I truly love about this hotel, however, is the very dramatic lobby with it's many levels and views.  It just screams "I am at a resort!" and I adore it.  

Full disclosure - I have never stayed here as a private guest, only as a member of a business conference (several years in a row), but I would definitely put this place in my top choices of places to stay should I ever come as a private vacationer.I've been frequenting this location for about 9 months now and am pretty happy with the selection. Not that I'm a vegetarian, but I'm a big produce guy and everything seems fresh and for the most part either come from California or Mexico. I also suspect their meats and chicken are more naturally raised and fed...at least when compared to a few other grocery stores I have purchased from. I like that you won't see products from more well-known brands. It makes them more distinct and choosy in what they offer and I believe that's why I prefer doing much of my grocery shopping here. It doesn't have the huge corporate boxed store feel from the more well-known stores like Safeway, Frys, and Bashas that saturate the city, but they still maintain reasonable prices. The parking lot in this strip mall is relatively small, but I've never had trouble parking during the weekends when I visit. 

A few other short, but important viewpoints: 

1) The staff are friendly.
2) They play old music, perhaps, from the 50's, 60's, & 70's, which I'm  not a big fan of but I can get past that.

Also, my sister came in here once inquiring whether they had a particular root beer that she liked. They didn't, but offered to order it for her. She decided not to take them up on the offer. I don't know how prevalent it is for grocery stores to order something for you that they don't normally stock, but you may find this to be a helpful tip.Shoes for men and women and purses.  Give me my feet and slip on some shoes. I was pleasantly surprised at the brands they had.  I could have done some damage but this trip was for buying for my kids not me.  I will return on my next visit.  Trust me my next time there I will be buying some shoes for me.We have shopped and bought tires at various Discount Tires over the years, including this one.  The service is great and they are more than willing to work with you in finding the right tire for your car. 

Recently, we needed two Michelin MXV4s for one of our cars. We shopped online at DiscountTire.com and found the tires we wanted.  Priced it out, paid, reserved the tires for this location and just came in to have them mounted & balanced.  Nice!  In the end, it saved us $65 over their previous quote. Also, nice!Love Kohl's, have been there twice in the last month, they keep sending me coupons through the mail, $10.00, coupons, I can purchase a blouse that is regular price of $38.00, on Sale for $14.99, and only have to pay a little over $6.00, using my coupon, they always have Great Sales ! And it is right up the street !Great service. Food was good bar food nice atmosphere. Great place to chill and have a beer.Thank you yelp to introducing me to my favorite unique sandwich spot!

Wildflower is a cute chain, very much like panera bread, incorperating the norm with fun and funky but warm flavors.  With a great range of bread choices, different mustards and cheeses, toppings and combos and sides, its hard to not find a sandwich you will love.  

Though I've had a lot of different things here, my absolute FAVORITE sandwich in this world is the BLT plus.  Do me a favor - do the BLT plus, switch brie for cheddar, and add cucumber - and you will be sandwich heaven.Drool.  This place is my own personal furnishing heaven.  The first time I walked in here I think I literally gasped.  I have always tried to describe my ideal decorating scenario and the best I could come up with was things you would find in a castle.  Yeah..like a castle. Cuz I'm goth like that.  And..voila..Razmataz. 

 As for it being furnishings for big folks, I am ok with that.  In fact, I am wiling to get fat in order for it to look more appropriate and to scale.  One problem.  My eyes are bigger than my wallet.  Champagne taste on a beer budget if you will.  But a girl can dream....and drool...Ahhhh...anyone wanna help me put together my Ikea entertainment center?This is my go-to Target.  I am glad it is fairly close to me.  They are renovating it now, so I cannot get in and out as fast as I used to, but I am sure it is going to be worth the inconvenience.The huge sandwichs are good for lunch, but don't miss out on their breakfast omelets. Its a great place to people watch on Saturday mornings. I have honestly never had their bagels, because I am too in love with their egg creations.Fantastic bagel place!  Quick and get the order right each time. I would love to see them carry other milk options for coffee but the bagels are so worth it. Great hometown feel and portion sizes are generous. Very friendly service.Very nice stadium and the staff is very friendly. Would give it five stars but after going to the Goodyear Stadium and finding out that they had a really cool area where kids can play their own ball game I had to deduct one star.Whenever I am craving decent italian food that is not the dreaded Olive Garden, we usually come here. The lunch specials are awesome and priced just right. I LOVE their lasagna, the sauce is homemade and to die for! But boy howdy bring your tums... I agree with some other reviews, sit in the bar area, much more chill vibe.I-LOVE-THIS-PLACE!!! Noodle soup in a bread bowl . . . can't go wrong, makes me happy every time!I learned about Venezia's when they started following me on Twitter.  I finally took the time to stop and I'm glad I did.  The atmosphere was great, the pizza even better.  

I must say that wings were also good, but they do need to provide some "wet naps" to clean your hands with when you are done with them.

We'll be going back and enjoying more of their pizza's and maybe even taking the "Party Pizza Challenge"There isn't a lot you can say about a dry cleaners, they clean your clothes and have them finished on time. Their charges are in line with what other cleaners charge as well. In my mind what sets them apart from others are the owners. They are there working almost every day. They remember my name and greet me every time I come in. They also do repairs and alterations as well and are eco-friendly. If you have an item they don't think is worth the effort because of the type of stain or the repair wont look good they recommend you don't do it and save your money. I like frequenting local businesses who appreciate my business, are honest, and go out of their way to make sure I have a pleasant experience. They have all of these qualities in spades.Palo Verde is a true Dive Bar Gem, its one of those places that you have to experience to really have lived here in Tempe. Drinks are cheap, I once got a double of Glenfidich for $4.50. Its easy to bring a group and take over, the bartender will usually wrangle the more vocal regulars (as long as your group is spending cash) 

BTW bring CASH! There is no credit here!

If you can make it from 2am until 6am you can begin your morning here, as far as I remember (and the memories of that night are hazy at best) with a happy hour attended by the third shift from the milk plant down the block.

This is not a bar to bring a date to, a partner that you have been with a while...awesome! If you bring a first date and she has a good time, it'll probably be with someone else.Day 2 of Az Restaurant week fared sooo much better! We made reservations at Top of the Rock. We had been there about five years ago for some occasion....birthday or something. We remembered it being good and the view to be fabulous...and we were not disappointed once again. We were seated immediately and our server (Rod) was friendly and had a good sense of humor. He was thrilled we were there for Restaurant week (good start!) 
My husband started with the seared Ahi and I had the Gnocchi. Both tasted fabulous and the presentation was lovely! Our main courses (he had lamb, I had salmon) were also terrific. My salmon was perfectly cooked with an interesting chutney like topping and asparagus. Yum. And for desert we had bananas foster and the molten lava chocolate cake! Now THIS was a fabulous menu and so worth the price! Obviously Top of the Rock was showcasing their wares and wanted us to come back! And we will!My family and I have been going here for years.  We have always enjoyed our food and the service has been great.  The chicken parmesan is the best!I've been coming here forever.  Good quality work for a very reasonable price.

In probably 15 years, they have lost maybe one shirt.  I get at least 40 shirts cleaned there per month.Fast reliable auto service is hard to find. I'd been going to my previous auto shop for years. I used to have to call them the afternoon after I dropped off to ask what was wrong with my car. Then I'd have to wait at least another day, maybe two or more, for them to fix it. I had to rush to get there before 5:30. It was dirty there but hey my car got fixed properly. I didn't actually think you could find a place that would do better, but there is! 

I've been going to see Tony and Johnny at Oasis Service Center for several years. Their service is friendly, prompt, and reliable. I've unfortunately spent thousands of dollars with them over the last few years but my car runs great. 

Here's why you should go. 

They actually call you within a couple of hours or so to give you the run down. You don't have to let that pool of sweat about what is wrong or what it's going to cost gather too long. They'll actually let you know. 

They will not charge you or encourage you to service items you do not need. They fixed my friend's door for free when she was there for another service. On a recent trip for a break job, they identified a noise coming from what I'd call the appendix of my axle. A rubber piece had broken free and was flopping around making noise. They cut it off for free. He told me not to replace the axle just for that, it isn't vital (like our appendix, get the reference now?). If it vibrates at high speeds, then replace it. How cool is that? He could have told me to replace the axle for that but didn't. 

The prices are reasonable, and my estimate is always accurate. Fair market value for qualified, certified technicians. It does make a difference. Your mom's friend may be able to fix your car, but doubtful he'll do it properly. Trust me on this, you don't want some yahoo digging in to the car just to save a few measly bucks. Don't be such a tightwad, it won't save you in the long run, get y our ride fixed right. 

You don't have to kill yourself to get to them before closing. They have a gas station just one mile away that is open later (til 11 pm I think) that they'll drop off your keys to so you can pick up your car after hours if you ask. You will need to pay with a credit card over the phone for your services in that case, but hey, it makes it easy to drop and pick up! 

They're open Saturdays! I believe they close a little earlier but I've never had a problem getting a repair done on Saturday to avoid the whole figuring out a ride to work thing. 

They're in a bigger location now, and have moved the service department to a spot by the Fry's on Guadalupe and McClintock. I understand they also have a spot in Gilbert too. 

So if you're in need of good, honest car care, this is the place to go!Let me just say I hate having car problems and being a girl!!! 

I woke up this morning and hopped in my car ready to start my day. I got the click click click click when I turned the key and just froze. Yikes really? I saw a roofer guy working across the street and wish I knew who he worked for so I could give him a huge kudos. Anyway, he jumped my car and off I went. Now, what about that receipt for the battery, where did I put it? Yeah, I found it in my car file, amazing I actually did it right this time, LOL!. I headed to autozone and the guy came right out and tested my battery, I gave him my receipt because it was a 7yr battery and it has only been 25 months since I purchased it. So they prorated it and gave me credit towards my new battery and installed it in less than 5 minutes. What a great relief and no hassles and the guy even said that I didn't need the receipt that they go by your phone number, so just in case next time... Good to remember. So no idle chit chat, just fix and go. Thanks autozone!Decent selection and prices considering the state of the industry right now. I wouldn't drive across the valley to go here, but if you're in the area they're worth stopping in.Super fast service! We don't have a Sonic near us in Michigan, but have to stop for Cherry Lime Aide when in AZ.  So good!  The food is typical greasy fast food, but good options and breakfast is available all day.Delicious teriyaki. I have only have the Oahu so far and it was awesome! The chicken was cooked just right and the sauce was definitely made in-house. I will be back!Wow! Really good BBQ. My favorite part was the individual wrapped jelly bellys with the check. 

I ordered the combo dinner with pulled turkey, sliced ham & sweet cornbread. I chose baked beans and french fries for the sides. I would have been happier with the just the pulled turkey and no ham. All the sides were tasty.


My man V had the pulled chicken sandwich with mashed potatoes. He said the flavor was good but it was a little to chunky for his 'pulled' standards.The fish tacos are amazing but I cant pass up on the steak quesadillaI've been going to this practice for several years now. The great thing is that they have walk-in clinic hours, including Saturdays if you get sick but don't want to pay for urgent care. 
The staff is friendly and they have a lab on site which is convenient. 
I would and have recommended this practice to my friends and family.I stopped off at Fresh Wasabi for lunch today. I wasn't expecting too much when I walked in since it was empty and almost 12:30PM.  

I sat down, ordered a water and 3 rolls from their lunch menu special. 11.95 for a Philly, spicy tuna and yellowfin rolls.
I also got an order of Monkey Brains.

Let me tell you, the rice was so delicious! It was cooked perfect and applied perfect. The vegetables were crisp and the fish was super fresh. I appreciated the fact that the chef didn't overdo the amount of rice on the roll. Too much rice isn't good on a roll.

Anyway, that's all I had and I am definitely going back soon.Green Chile Cheese Crisp, if you grew up in the Buckeye area you grew up eating this, so if you go to this restaurant you order a GCC.Kevin was my tech and he is fantastic! The salon is super cute, they even have kids chairs for those of you who bring your little one to get her nails done too. I had a back fill with glitter tips and they turned out great! He was super attentive to detail made sure my nails were exactly what I wanted.I stay here when I go to Mariners spring training and I have always had a pleasant experience. I love how close it is to the stadium.. I once forgot a photo I wanted to get autographed and ran back to the hotel room and back in just a few minutes. 

Their rooms are large and clean, and I appreciate their breakfast assortment of cereal, waffles, bagels, fruit, yogurt, etc. You're also very close to a lot of restaurants too, which is convenient. 

The hot tub and pool is nice too-- it's never been crowded.One word to describe this place...yummy!I'm always so happy with dinner at Anita's! My parents live here in Wickenburg and I look forward to Mexican food all week long every time I visit. Anita's is a must. The service is great and I'm always happy with my huge plate of delicious tex-mex! 

I was in Thailand a couple of months ago and after a few weeks, needed a change. I made my way to a Mexican restaurant (yes, a Mexican restaurant in Thailand!) and I happened to meet someone who was a huge fan of Anita's! I guess it's world famous! :)After being sent home from work, made the decision that something was seriously wrong with me and I should probably see a specialist. I don't like going to the hospital because they charge 5x as much on my insurance as a Quick Care. Came in pretty late so the wait wasn't so bad. With only 3 people ahead of me I was seeing the doctor within 15 minutes. After doing a quick check up on me, I was treated for the stomach flu, was prescribed medicine. 

The service was pretty good. The nurses were nice and patient. Felt much better and glad I didn't try to guess and treat it myself. If had been during a busy time like during lunch or midday, I would have given them 2 or 3 stars because I know it would have taken over an hour to see the doctor. But, the nurses were kind, and the doctors here are pretty knowledgeable. And I was able to save a lot of money by not going to the ER.This restaurant is very ono.  the food is good and the portions are huge!  great value.  would definitely come back if i'm ever in the hood.Location is odd, in my opinion, and the interior may need some work, but for what it is, this is exactly what I envision a great Hawaiian Local food joint to be! 

The prices are amazing for the amount of food you get.
This is seriously the ONLY place that my boyfriend doesn't have to ask for more rice, OR borrow from my plate! HA.

I always get the spicy korean chicken (think Zippy's korean fried chicken... MMM). If I'm fiending for more variety, I will combo that sucker up with some sweet and sour spare ribs, or whatever special they might have.

Also, my boyfriend and I share one fountain drink, and get a "combo" plate each... the total is still UNDER $20! 

Who can beat that?
Winnahz.This was pretty good! We got delivery from Orchid Garden on Sunday. The lunch specials are also offered on weekends, which is great! They also have a very extensive menu and everything looked pretty reasonably priced.

I got the lemon chicken lunch special, which was a good amount of food for under $6. Delivery won't include the soup, but it had the entree, rice, and a small salad. 

Everything tasted good and they were completely accurate about the estimated delivery time, which made me very happy!Always a great place to get a beer and 1/2 price appetizers, (they now serve Goose Neck IPA!!!!!)
The bar side servers are always on the ball, friendly and fast.A nice place to stay. The breakfast is good and the coffee is fresh. If you arrive around 6p, they have oven fresh cookies available. The bed was surprisingly comfortable. The rooms were clean. It was about a 20 minute drive from lake mead, but worth it. They do not have boat parking, but the lot was not full, so we were able to park there nonetheless.I absolutely love Mexican food! 

There are reasons they won't get a 5 star that I won't go into. I had a carne asada burrito it came with rice and beans. The food was great, the service excellent, and the price was a bit much at 15 for lunch.

I thought there would be more food for the price. We didn't have any problems and they were able to keep up with us with the drinks. We drank like camels, 3-4 glasses each  even when it got busy. 

I look forward to the next visit!Truck stop in north Vegas - Nuff saidOk this place looks a little scary not in the best neighborhood but let me tell you there chicken fingers are amazing and then get a regular hut so good n cheap.I know this place got bad reviews, but I had a favorable experience today. In and out in under 45 minutes. Nurses could have been a bit more gentle, but that's not a deal breaker; they were at least nice. Doctor (didn't catch his name) was really funny, nice, and right to the point. He listened,  understood what I needed, and took care of my issue (allergic reaction). I'd go back, they got the job done and were fast! (Without making you feel rushed)My boyfriend and I wanted "real" italian. Not out of the box dried pasta like Ventanos. 
Service was great. The owner was the first to greet us. Our server was kind and there  if we needed anything. 
There wasn't much of a crowd considering it was a tuesday and our food came fast. Low lighting and soft music. GREAT food!

I'll be back!!!Wed Night Pub Quiz!!  so much fun and the food is very good too.So far the best Chinese food I have found in the Las Vegas valley (just got here 5 months ago) .  I ate also at a location by Warm Springs which was also good and also the one on Durango which I found to also be good.Nothing beats Baskin Robbins on a hot summer Las Vegas day. Heck... even during the winter you can find me in there ordering. Granted one thing that makes this store unique to other ones, (and by that i mean the ones i have been to), THEY SERVE PINK BUBBLE GUM ICE CREAM!! WOOHOO!!!!

Yes ladies and gentleman, I love me some pink bubblegum. LOL And most importantly, the staff here are all awesome and deserve our business.I love Winchell's. Just some good ol' fashioned food in a friendly, neighborly atmosphere.

I first started eating here because my then, girlfriend (now, wife) worked here when we met. I've never really been impressed with the food that you can get at neighborhood bars around here. It always just seemed like something to keep you busy between drinking and losing all my money on a video poker machine...not anything I would go out of my way for...and certainly not the star of the show.

But Winchell's is different. They have food with flavor. Classic delights like calf's liver and onions with bacon, fish & chips, and salisbury steak are done with an unusual finesse and a skilled hand. But I usually go for a late night snack and those dinners are only available from 5pm-11pm.

Where Winchell's really shines is their sandwiches and burgers....one particular burger comes to mind: The San Francisco - served on a grilled parmesan-sourdough loaf and loaded with homemade thousand island dressing and swiss (wipe the drool from your mouth...you don't wanna ruin your keyboard). As a matter of fact, you can request that bread on pretty much any sandwich.

The Cuvee salad is another favorite: a delicate balance of mixed spring greens, candied walnuts, smoked gouda cheese, apples, grapes and chicken all tossed with a stringent, yet sweet champagne vinaigrette. By the way, all the dressings are housemade. Did I mention that they make their own potato chips too? And that they're delicious!

I've tried most things on the menu here and I have not yet been disappointed. The servers, bartenders and bussers are all friendly and attentive. The atmosphere is warm and cozy. This is a diamond amongst the lumps of coal we have scattered throughout the valley.We order their burgers and they are excellent! The service is great and the room is very nice and comfortable. Great for late night eating and a few drinks.I love it, she loves it, we love it. Everyone seems to love 'I love Sushi' (sorry Lucy).

A couple of years ago when gf san suggested this place I wasn't so sure. Eating sushi at a place called 'I love Sushi' in a shopping complex behind a gas station you say? Standby while I check my notes please. Sorry gf san, the answer is no. BUT I love sushi and I needed my fill so we tried it anyway. Since then this has become our go-to spot. We love the ambiance, we love the food and we love the kimono-wearing ladies cursing in Japanese (just kidding!).

The food's all good. While the sashimi isn't the best I've ever had, it's good enough. Their special rolls are delicious (not to mention creatively-named). The crunch roll and spicy tuna roll somehow always find their way into our order. The lunch specials are ok and I can honestly say I've had better bento box lunches. But if you're eating the bento here you're doing yourself a disservice. Have the real deal - the sushi and sashimi rolls. Finish off with the awesome green tea tempura icecream!The food is pretty awesome and the service is great..but the only thing is once they feel you reached you ayce limit they start packing the rice..can't stand that and for that you get 4 stars
The price for ayce is great though 23.95 you can't beat itMaple Cleaners has been my Dad's favorite for years. We didn't think nothing of it until our usual cleaners Pal Sillips (i changed the name to protect the innocent) ruined my wife's dress and said "it" happens. Awesome customer service Pal Sillips!! So, we went with Maple Cleaners and have been going there for the last 4 years or so.

They do a great job and i've also had my suits altered here by Michelle. She is very good at what she does and fast. She's also done work with my wifes and kids clothes and I can say we are satisfied customers. They keep you on file and give you a percentage off...no need to cut coupons. They do same day service, in by 9 out by 5. My suits and shirts come back perfect. If you don't like too much starch this is the place to go, but if you want a stiff shirt, just tell them extra starch.NIGHT TO REMEMBER

Wednesday's three plus hour visit to the St. Rose Dignity Health's emergency room eliminated the idea of a home cooked meal. By the time I was released it was already most dark. So, where do you go for late dinner ?  How about trying Henry's American Grill that has been in our Garmin forever.

This place is a few doors from Fausto's and across the street from the dreadful DMV. Two entrances, one to the dining room and the other for their smoke filled bar which was full of patrons.  Dining room was occupied by just one group of six and then us two. We pulled up to the small round table adjacent to the open kitchen.

Tonight I'm in a mood for something fried. It would have been the chicken fried steak and eggs but they only start serving this after midnight. So how about their Pollack fish and chips. Tonight Yu-go chauffeur can eat a bear and quickly focused on "The Henry" aka "The Hank" their Blackened Prime Rib Sandwich. He asked our server Kali if she would request from the kitchen the closest to a rare cut.

While waiting for our meal, we're watching the Chicago Bulls/ Thunder game. Derrick Rose is definitely back. More interesting was the sighting of the NFL TV package banner in front of the kitchen counter. Going to call in before Sunday to see if they'll show the Niners/Jaguar overseas game in the dining room where there's no smoking.

The coleslaw, tartar sauce and three large pieces of pollack was plenty filling.  Not to forget their crispy fries.  Yu-go couldn't stop raving about his prime rib sandwich. He said it was the best with the rock salted outer trim, tenderness of the cut topped with a slice of Swiss cheese together with seasoned grilled onions and peppers. He didn't think he could put the sandwich away in one sitting.... how wrong was he. Definitely five stars for "The Henry" or "The Hank" when he eats it again.

Kudos to our server Kali who works only on Wednesday evenings. Thanks for all the suggestions and information about Henry's American Grill. Looking forward to returning on Sunday morning and trying out their chicken fried steak and corned beef  hash while watching an NFL action in Wembley Stadium.

Update:  Returned for another dinner plus watched a NBA game on TNT. The chicken fried steak was over the top wonderful. Prime rib this time was slightly disappointing.

Cannot enjoy and watch sports in this environment with the type of background music being played.  I guess we could have watched the remainder of the game in smoke filled bar. But elected to head to the Sunset Casino for a quieter setting.I've not stayed in the hotel so this is solely a review for the club.

I love the Artisan...once you get in the door there is an energy and an underground vibe that hits you because of the awesome, dark decor and the pulsing techno or house. The resident DJs also DJ various other clubs on the strip during the day or night and I think they really let loose with more experimental tunes and more flavor at Artisan because its after-hours and it's unpretentious and there's no cover, no VIP guest barking orders on what music he wants the DJ to be playing. As a local, I rarely EVER go to a club on the strip because all you find is pretentiousness and VIP big dogs like ultra rich and celebrities who want the house DJ to play "Livin' on a Prayer" and have been known to get well known house DJs KICKED OFF THE DECKS because they have such pull because of their money. So as far as music is concerned and club experience, Artisan is where it's at for me in Las Vegas. Minor updates could be applied like making an alternate walkway to the bathrooms (if possible) instead of directly through the dancefloor. I'm usually too wasted to concentrate on little inconveniences like that so that doesn't factor into why I gave 4 stars instead of 5.

The reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because they are still employing some god-awful bouncers. I'm not sure where they get these people, especially the bald white guy with the attitude, but hassling people and giving them attitude is inexcusable when more than any other club I know of in Vegas, the people attending are just looking to have a good time. There are very few meatheads, no rabble rousers. Lighten the hell up!  I'm a security professional by trade. When I say security professional, I mean I was a bodyguard for Senators and a certain President in Iraq and in Afghanistan. I have 108 armed employees under my control currently. Securing an entrance and being a doorman does not require an attitude. In fact, it can escalate problems or cause them where there are none. People are coming in to spend money and create profit for the Artisan, why adversely affect their experience and cause them to not come back? I think the management at Artisan needs to seriously take a look at the people they hire out there. A smile and a common courtesy as opposed to a glare and snarl goes a long way when someone's first impression is the doorman. 

Just some helpful advice from someone near the top of the professional security food chain;)

I hope to see you all for my birthday when I get back from Afghanistan!

Take care,

JakeI don't know if pho shop owners gather weekly to come up with clever or hilarious names, but I like it. (maybe they do a weekly "Pho"ne Con"pho"rence.) The only thing more memorable than the restaurant name is the pho at this place. Pho Kim Long is delicious pho goodness in Las Vegas and it's open 24 hours. I never even considered eating pho in Vegas because I'm always trying to go to the buffets, but now I think I have to go here every time I visit thank to my drunk Japanese boss who suddenly craved pho. Because it's Vegas, it's one of the nicest looking pho restaurants I've ever been to. I just wish it was closer to the strip.Since I had access to a car the past trip, my buddies and I wanted some good ol asian food to nurse our wounded livers on a saturday morning. What else to do that than some Pho or some rice plates!  Just a short drive down Spring Mtn Road, Pho Kim Long is in the heart of Chinatown.

I opted for a rice plate since I wasn't in the mood for Pho while is 100 outside. The grilled pork, pork skin, and egg dish hit the spot. Nothing fancy, just down to earth good viet eats. It wasn't the best ive had since i'm spoiled with good viet food at home but it sure hit the spot.

The service was attentive and the place was clean. This is quite strange for a Pho restaurant, a clean one? Total dmg was around $50 for 5 people with tax/tip included, not too shabby at allA Chinatown in Vegas?? Only a measly 10 minute cab ride away? Vegas, you really do have something for everyone!

After a night of enthusiastic fist pumping to Armin van Buurin at Marquee, our arms were sore, our feet were hurting, and our stomachs were empty. My friends had already gone the night before (in a limo, no less -- we do it big in Vegas), but pho just really seemed to be a really good idea. 

The taxi line was monstrous but we managed to squeeze into a 5-person taxi and off we went to pho heaven! The small bowls were big, the broth was brothy, the noodles were noodly, and the meat was definitely meaty. The basil was so basily my friend couldn't help putting several branches in his mouth like a koala. Pho really is the best drunk/hangover food ever.

In the words of one of my dear EAP friends... "MM, this really hits the SPOT! I'm not sure which spot it is, but it's hitting it!"

Also, I love that they have a large man standing in the front who opens the door for you. Is he a bouncer? A door-opener? Who knows??I came here hungover.. Hoping the pho would help me with my hangover. But no. Pho is pretty good I guess. #13 I'm still hungover after all thisThe best pho place to end up after a long night of drinking and partying. 
Quiick service + good pho = A happy drunk beezy. 

The calamari here is delish too. But only when youre drunk! I was craving the calamari sober so I went back SOBER, mind you and yea it wasnt to die for any more. Actually it was quite greasy which is aparently great when youre wasted. Kinda like jack in the box tacos great when drunk not so great sober. Dont get me wrong tho the pho is still good sober. Hah.Just had an amazing meal at Pho Kim Long!!  Food was great and service was execellent!Always open with good broth. Definitely a good late grub after the club gets out.Im a san gabriel valley LA resident, so ive had a ton of pho places.. this place is on par with a good one from home. Prices are fair, portions are good, lots of MEAT in the pho, goodsize rice plates as well.

i recommend this to anyone craving this type of food. they're open till 3am or later i think.. 2 thumbs up..

i almost forgot, i had their fried eggrolls, they were good in size, came with greens to wrap/eat with them.. they were wrapped just tight enough, and were packed with a good filling. they came SUPER HOT(which is a plus)Good pho with flavorful broth.  Crispy, delicious egg rolls.  Generous with bean sprouts, basil, mint, lime.  Fast, efficient service.  Would give 5 stars if restaurant had working A/C.Very good pho most days. Sometimes it's watery. When the broth is good it's one of the best in town. I love their beef salad and egg rolls too. A lot of the waiters seem tuff as fuck! Wouldn't want to encounter any in a dark alley. Love this place!Because my mom is an amazing cook and restauranteur, her food has become the very high benchmark to which I compare all Korean restaurants. That being said, there are no restaurants in this valley that surpass or even meet that level. However, when I do want Korean food and my mom isn't here, Tofu Hut is very comforting.

What brings me here is their Soon Dubu Jjigae (soft tofu soup). The type of tofu that is used in this particular soup is difficult to purchase non-commercially, so soups made at home will not be able to mimic this silky offering. The flavors are so delicious and indescribable. You can also choose the type of soup you want like Kimchee or Seafood, changing the overall flavor of the dish. I always go with Pork because I think its flavor really transforms the broth to something amazing. The spice level can also be chosen (don't let the red color scare you, it's a non-spicy spice they use). The best part? It's around $10 for the meal! It comes with a bowl of rice and unlimited Pan Chan (side dishes).

When I dine with certain people, I will also do the AYCE BBQ. It's not my favorite thing, but for $17, it's pretty awesome! My favorite cuts of meat to order are Beef Tongue, Brisket, and Marinated (Spicy) Pork. They give you the traditional sesame oil/salt mixture to dip your unseasoned meat in and a refreshing salad of cabbage and romaine lettuce. It's a modern twist on the traditional Korean dining method of wrapping the meat and rice in lettuce leaves called Sang Chu Ssam. I thought it was weird at first, but I've really grown to like it! Bonus: Soon Dubu Jjigae is only $5 with your AYCE meal! Score!!

Expect a wait during busy times for AYCE since it's only available on one side of the restaurant. Fortunately, the longest I've waited was about 15-20 minutes.Regular pedicure was $23 and a gel manicure was $25. I was expecting to pay $35 for the gel manicure, which I was quoted over the phone. They had a lot of colors to choose from, including gels. I found my shades of pink perfectly. The lady who did my nails didn't carry any conversation with me, but I was totally fine with that. I wasn't really in the mood to talk anyway. It's been 2 days since I received my gel manicure and it's still perfect. Let's see how long it's going to last me!Xong did a great job on my gel polish.  After 2 days at EDC,  my nails were tore up.  She cleaned everything up for me, and gave me as awesome daisy yellow glitter look.  So happy!  Will come again next time I'm in town.  Thanks Xong!It's been a long time since I've eaten here and it still satisfies me. The food here really is good. Love the macaroni salad and their Lumpia's, hmmmm :-)

They remodeled too which is great because now it's more trendy.Okay, this was my first strip club, so I don't have anything to compare this place to. However, I think it was a great place to cut my teeth, so to speak. The dancers are decent-looking, and could stand to put on 10 or 15 pounds. I was truly amazed by the pole-dancing and bleached anuses; these girls are committed to and are good at what they do. The only turn-off was the bored expressions on some of their faces. It's like, I get that you're so over flashing your gash at strangers every day, but can you fake it for me, please? How about for my $4? The biggest disappointment was not being offered a lapdance by any of the girls combing the floor. I guess they assume that females aren't interested or won't pay as much. I must admit that my private dance was the highlight of my visit, even though I had to ask one of the dancers for it. (Her name was Mirage...sigh.) Also, I have to compliment their use of props on the stage. One girl came out in a Grim Reaper outfit, complete with sickle. It was a little strange seeing her doing her thing on the pole whilst sporting a hood that covered her whole head. Another girl dressed up in a fireman-inspired bodysuit and sat on a Fischer Price firetruck going "Nee-ner-nee-ner-nee-ner!" (like the siren?) while another dancer wheeled her around the stage. Hilarious. We were there until 5 am.
Overall I think I'd visit this place again if I happen to be in Vegas. Some of the dancers seemed friendly and kind of sweet, and the DJ's pretty witty if you listen closely. Just stick with the free soda and water, and tip the help.Ah Trader Joe's..What can you say. This was the original store, opened to not much fanfare but quickly grew into cult like status.
They have the super nice quirky staff, the super good deals on wine, the super selection of all things that makes Trader Joe's, well Trader Joe's.
Go and see for yourself, the legion of faithful Joe-ers aren't wrong!at first i found trader joe's to be small with a minimal verity but after making this store my primary food source i find that the use of space in the small area is amazing. The staff are always friendly and kind. Lower cost on organic food than Whole-Foods and  always fresh. and free samples to boot!This aint your basic grocery store. Actually, to tell you the truth, I did not really start coming here until this cookie butter craze took off. 

This last visit, I was actually there to get some Mac n Cheese in the frozen food section because I have had some at somebody's house before and it was just brought up in a recent conversation (Yelp Talk strikes again!). 

Ironically, there just happen to be some Speculoos Cookie Butter available on the shelf. Since I already had the regular cookie butter at home, I got the Cocoa Swirl this time. I was a bit surprised that there was any Speculoos at all since people pretty much grab all of them as soon as the store opens up.

If you are not in a rush, I recommend you take your time shopping here because not only will you discover new things, you will also learn that the employees here are very helpful in anything that you might be looking for.

Besides your basic grocery items, you will find that TJ's carries other things that even the major grocery stores don't carry. These guys might not be the biggest stores, but they house a lot of goodies that people come here specifically for. Things like various nuts, vegetables, spices, pickled items, chips, etc. 

So get on up and check this place out any time you pass by one or are in the area. Stock up on some goodies!

Yelp 2014 365 Review Challenge #41We were shocked that this place was not busy on a Friday nite.  The food is delicious, the salad bar is very fresh and the service is outstanding.  Rita the hostess makes you feel like your family.  Locals should flock here, it is a great value, I had halibut, it came with veggies and salad bar.  The bread basket is also good.  All this for $24, amazing.  We certainly hope this encourages more people to give this place a chance.  We love it and can't wait to return.I can't believe it's been over a year since I visited Las Vegas.

It was my first time in Las Vegas. There were four of us: two friends, my bf, and me. We were on a tight budget. I found a deal for the flight and this hotel on Expedia, and quickly snatched it. Since the price was surprisingly low, we has expected a, you know, crappy hotel and service, which we didn't really mind because we didn't plan to stay in the hotel for the whole trip.

But we were wrong!

The hotel was really nice. They have shuttle that run from the airport to the hotel. We had to wait for a long time, but it was better than taking a cab. The room was nice. Everything was clean. Beds were nicely made. No weird smells or stains.

They have good buffet as well, both for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I was only at the buffet for breakfast a couple of times. The food was good for a cheap quality hotel as this one. I'd give it a 7/10. There were a lot of options, which I liked. The dessert was kind of nasty though.

This hotel is a little far away from the strip, but fear not, they have shuttle that go to the strip several times a day. I actually had read reviews about this hotel beforehand, and some people had complained about this. I thought that the service was good. You just need to make sure that you get there on time. 

They also have a hot tub by the pool. A small one, but it was nice :)Amazing and authentic Japanese food! Came here late night on a Monday.  It was close to 1am and the place was packed, there's wasnt an empty table anywhere.  Only a handful of customers weren't Asian.  The waitress was super friendly and very helpful. I got the eel with cucumber, a friend's recommendation, and it was soo good!  I also got sushi, it was shrimp and topped with a delicious piece of tuna.  Loved it!  I also enjoyed the DIY drink.  The sell Shochu, tastes kind of like vodka, very mild flavor. They serve it with club soda and your choice of fruit (or plain on the rocks).  I ordered it with grapefruit and they brought me half of a fresh grapefruit and a manual glass juicer and a shot of simple syrup. And voila, you make your own drink!  Will definitely came again next time I'm in Vegas!The first thing you have to know about Ichiza is that most of the good stuff is NOT on the menu.  Rather, the majority of menu items are posted on little sheets of paper filling all 4 walls.  And unfortunately, the wait staff is often so busy that they don't have much time to explain what half of these items are.  Fortunately, regular customers will!  Taking the advice of our next-door table, we had a great meal.  Just wish we had been able to come back to try a few more items.

The food is very Japanese in that while it has a lot of traditional dishes like Oyakodon, it also has some very interesting Japanese takes on american foods. We didn't go too adventurous this time (we'll have to do that when we go back) and got the following
Ika Rings
Pork fried Udon
Spicy Tuna Roll
and a few other items I'm forgetting now.

However, the dish that made our meal was the Honey Toast, which they should really call the "Honey Loaf".  It's seriously half a loaf of bread toasted (the insides are amazingly fresh and doughy) covered with a large scoop of vanilla ice cream and a healthy layer of honey. Perfection.
God damn it's good. Thankfully my wife was nearly full so I got to have some of her half as well.Great place to go to have some drinks and food with a group of friends before heading out for the night. Service is mediocre and most of the menu is on the wall which was frustrating but the menu is very diverse. Really enjoyed the wagu carpaccio and the butterfish. Toro and uni were very fresh although the portions were small. One of the coolest things about this place is the fact that the pitchers of beer have a ice chamber in the center to keep your beer colder for longer! Genius!  The wait can be long so come early.Came here actually after seeing some girlfriend's facebook pictures of all the awesome food here from several years ago. This review is written after 2 visits.

First visit I came with the bf, we had a bunch of appetizers like the Takowasa (wasabi marinated raw octopus) and others and they were all fantastic. We also had the sashimi platter which was delicious. We also ordered the ramen, which weren't to our liking since we've been spoiled by all the ramen shops in SoCal but none the less was very good. Awesome izakaya atmosphere and I can see myself going there at night for a good time next time. We got the honey toast to go and ate it in the car on our drive back to LA and it was just so good.

Came here again with friends several weeks after and we re-hashed a bunch of the appetitzers along with the beef tataki as well as the miso black cod which was so smooth and buttery, the miso added a depth to it that was super satisfying. One of us got a curry beef bowl and I heard good things about it. We again got the honey toast but this time we had it there it was every better since the toast was still warm and the crush was crunchy and so good with the honey and the ice cream... MMMMM!

We'll be back for sure!

=====================
1 star - "will be telling everyone to stay away" bad
2 stars - it's okay, i won't return
3 stars - it's okay, i'll come back
4 stars - it's pretty good, i'll come by again!
5 stars - it's really good, my go-to places!This place is cool because they leave you alone.  I don't want to be touched unless you are a burger.I'm a fan of the Golden Steer! My friend brought me here on our first night in Vegas and we were all impressed with the friendly, attentive service and the great food. 

The tableside Caesar was tasty but could have used a bit more garlic in my opinion and the shrimp was awesome! Lots of garlic, a little white wine and a bit buttery.

My friends had steak and they loved it!

Overall, we loved the place, including the cool, retro decor. Next time we are in Vegas, we will be back. Thanks Golden Steer!Superb selection and great service. I only give 4 stars because we have only been there once and I want to leave room for improvementI missed this place! There use to be one much closer to my house but that one closed down. The place is very cosy and vibrates with energy. Not the best place for VEGANs because everything has eggs or dairy, but for vegetarians, pretty darn yummy.  I got the Jolly Green Giant which is an omlete FILLED with veggeis.. but since american style restaurants are always so gigantic in portions i got the baby omlete size. I love that there's such option!!! Their potato spuds are a sinful delight of homemade potato chips. Greasy and salty but SOO yummy!!! Come check it out!CAPASTRAMI! DO IT, DO IT! this sandwich was all i hoped for after reading the rave reviews from the yelpers. Tasty loads of pastrami nestled in a perfect bun by itself would be just fine for me. BUT, they through a heaping helping of coleslaw on top and it becomes decadence in your hand. I loved it. Unfortunately my wife got the cole turkey and hated it. I tasted it and it just tasted like tuna salad to me, not my fav. 
CAPASTRAMI is the way to go for sure, i'll be back next time i roll through Vegas for sure. 

PS..I do hate when restaurants don't have fountain drinks, it's cheap and lame.In the interest of matrimonial harmony, Ronald's is our 'must do" source of breakfast at least once on each of our Las Vegas vacations.  This small bakery is a true mom and pop operation with Ronald arriving by 4AM each day to begin baking and his wife arriving later to greet the first customer of the day.  We shared both a fritter and an old fashioned donut that continue to be the best in town.There are times in your life where you think something happens only once in a lifetime, like seeing a yeti, or Halley's Comet, or in my case, seeing the "3 DIVAZ" license plate in my local Smart & Final parking lot.

Friends, I am here to preach that lightning struck twice last night.  The triad was in full effect, and it was like holding a rainbow in your hand.  A sassy rainbow.

Grocery experience is still the same: Lots of food for reasonable prices.  I still probably need to pick up some Mexican Coca-Colas as my supply is running low.This was the first chinese restaurant I came to when I moved to Las Vegas 13 years ago.  It is where I would take out after getting off of work late at night, or after a late night of anything.  Is it the best Chinese food in Vegas?  Nope, but I give it 4 stars for consistently satisfying my hunger and cravings.Great service. The food was decent. But kinda expensive.We had so much fun and everything went very smoothly. I enjoyed the ceremony and we had a lot of laughs!!!!
The pictures and video came out great too.There are so many souvenir shops in Vegas that carry the same stuff, and I constantly wonder if I will find something better or cheaper at the next store.  This one has everything...and it's the cheapest.  So make your life easier and just come here.

We laughed when I walked by the "insult parrot" and it said, "Hey baby, show me your tits!" Lots of fun trinkets like that.

Excellent for bachelor or bachelorette parties, birthdays, or just fun stuff to take home to your friends.  The reason I don't give it 5 stars is because it really is all the usual stuff you see at the other souvenir shops.We ordered the Boston Special, it was delicious. The dough is amazing and the pizza was not greasy. Parking was plenty and the lady was friendly to me. I will go back to try the wings and ranch sauce along with other menu items.I was at the club watching the male strippers and had a great time.  There were several bridal parties were also their.  The date was September 17, 2011.  I was on stage for a lap dance with a stripper outfitter as a doctor.  I did not have a camera with me so I as asking if anyone there that saw a middle aged woman in a Hawaii shirt, I am asking a big favor.  If anyone still has a picture of me please I am begging you to forward it to lgitner@gmail.com  Thanks it would mean a great deal to me.I went to Los Tacos for lunch about a month ago. I had a carne asada and an al pastor taco along with chips and salsa. I got everything on the tacos so they were kind of expensive for tacos ($4.50 each) but they were worth it...some of the best tacos in town.I am in love with this place.  Even though the service can sometimes be slow, the wait for food is completely worth it.  Whenever friends come to visit from out of town I take the here.  The price is reasonable and they have a great tapas menu everyone can share!  I went there with friends from NYC who were used to paying prices on the strip and outrageous food prices in the city.  All three of us ate dinner for $48, they loved it!

Additionally they have an art gallery right around the corner you can enjoy before or after eating.

One the side note, a must try is the sweet potato fries!This is a strange place.
The location is not that good.
But the food is fantastic.

Parking is ample and there is adequate lighting in the lot even though its in a sketchy mini mall.
But the inside of the restaurant is strange.
Not horrible but also not good.
Just go and you will understand.
However the decoration is not what we eat.
And if the place is beautiful with a great location and the food sucks that is not good either.

The food is where this place shines.
Top notch Thai food.
Great flavors and strong menu.
I actually like the unassuming decor as its like a leaf that hides the flower.
The pad see ew here is excellent.
Definately full flavored and cooked well.
The other dishes that shine here are the mint stir fried dishes, the curries and the coconut soup.
My friend says that the large vegetarian menu is also very good.

I am stunned that such a hidden gem exists.
Would like to give 4.5 stars but ill give em 4 to keep em working hard to keep up the excellent standard.
Strong A-/B+We were invited to dinner here with a few fellow Yeeps ;) and were pleasantly surprised! Luckily one of them let us know exactly where it was because other mentions about it being hard to find are spot on. Instead of driving around commercial center, just go straight to the middle building there and the restaurant entrance faces West. It looks kinda small from the outside but it's a good size restaurant and they seem to keep it very clean...that's always a plus!

Now on to what's not small...the menu! They have a pretty extensive menu that comes in the form of a book that weighs about 5 pounds! We got a few things to share between all of us, starting with the herbal salad, tod mun & fresh spring rolls. The herbal salad is a must try dish! I'm not even a huge fan of tofu but they fry it up and toss it with a few things like lemongrass, apples, onions & cashews. It is by far one of the freshest tasting dishes I've ever had and packed with awesome flavor and texture. The fresh spring rolls were also really good and come with a delicious peanut sauce. I wasn't a fan of the tod mun...the corn was so overpowering that I didn't taste fish at all. 

We also got a few entrées...chicken chow mein, pad-thai and a curry dish. I can't say I'd order the chow mein again as it was just okay but the curry was really delicious, especially over rice. The pad-thai was definitely the stand out dish, for me. It is really, really good. The noodles are cooked perfectly and I love the texture you get with the ground peanuts. Also, if you like spicy, the little spice tray they bring out can really set the flavor off!! I noticed they offer shrimp pad-thai which I'd really like to try.

The service here was pretty good as well. Our waitress was helpful in explaining menu items to us and they kept our drinks full the whole time. I was also really surprised by the price. While most of our table drank water, there were a couple beers and the bill only came out to about $80 for 5 people. I'm no expert in Thai food but this is a solid spot serving up delicious food and I will definitely return!Cool place. Love getting gas here instead of Henderson.This place is always packed. They usually have 20% off coupons that they give you at the door. Customer service is good.I had foot surgery to have pins inserted to repair a broken 5th metatarsal.  I have nothing but good things to say about the LV Surgery Center.  I was registered right after I arrived.  I didn't even been to take a seat and be called but rather sat down right at the registration desk right after arriving.

Registration was quick, and I sat for about 10 minutes before an employee came to give me a few more papers to initial and sign and then I was taken inside.  My phone and insurance cards and license were secured for me.

My surgeon had arrived early and he came to see me as they were hooking up the IV and getting ready to take me to the surgical suite.  After the vitals were done, I went to the surgical suite and before long, I was in dreamland.  I woke up in recovery.

Everyone from the Center with whom I was in contact were polite, personable, and professional.  Friends drove me to the Center and brought me home and I was out of my house all of about 3 hours.  Not bad.

Kudos to the people at the LV Surgery Center.Tokyo eggroll.......I would drive across town just to get some, seriously.

My normal order is 2 orders of enrolls and wanton soup. Hubby' s is teriyaki chicken.  I  really want to try the yakisoba, but the eggrolls suck me in every time.After reading the mixed reviews and since im leaving Vegas for good and going back to Colorado i wanted to try it. Well i did about a Hour ago. I was greeted soon as i walked in. And smelled Authentic Thai Cooking. The buffet wasnt the biggest. And sure the food isnt labeled but you can tell what your eating just by looking at it. I had the Pad Thai, and some Egg Dish, and Veggie Eggrolls. And Broccoli Beef, and a Coconut Jelly item. It was ALL Delicious. ,I had my 3 plates full and i was full. They have soda in cans but make sure your drink is always full. I told them it was my first time here. 

I regret not going in sooner. I gave it 4 stars because they dont have the fountain drink machine hooked up. I should of asked for a Thai Tea which i seen they did have, and it looked good as well. I will venture in there one more time. The Buffet is from 11am to 2pm Monday thru Saturday and worth it. 6.99 is a deal. Nap time on a full stomach.Being a guy, haircuts are pretty basic.  Keep it even and don't make me look like a dork.  Great Clips does a good job of a decent haircut at a decent price.  Plus my stylist was a super-hot Asian chick.  Finally something for me to look at while getting a haircut.  The only drawback is the parking lot.  Not so big and no traffic light at the intersection.  I have to go the opposite direction then u-turn to get back home.  A small price to pay to see super-hot Asian chick again.Close enough to the strip to walk if you want of 10 by cab. Felt safe, which in Vegas off strip isn't always the case. Left my top down on the car, only prob in the morning was the yellow Lamborghini parked next to it :)

Clean room, quiet, easy check in and super nice staff. AM breakfast manager was helpful. Downside?  Pool was just closed for renovations...in June...really?  Why not January?Great food especially when coming home drunk from the club lol.Vegas is a town that seems to have some sort of bar on every corner. Sometimes multiples! O`Aces is the bar on the corner near my work, so we go there for lunch from time to time. We have occasionally gotten food to go as well. 

The bar itself is pretty standard for Las Vegas bars that target locals. Lots of tvs for watching sports, video gaming for the gamblers, and comfortable booths for groups that want to eat away from the bar. The bartenders pour strong, even the first drink, and that is always a plus. 

The burgers are big and juicy, and you can get them with sweet potato fries! I love that they have sweet potato fries as an option for the side at no extra cost. Salads are nice and large, and the club sandwich was good enough that I'd order it again. 

Good bar food at good prices. 3.5 stars is what I would rate them if I could, but since I can't do half stars, I will round up.Very good food. The carne asada burrito (super mex style) is exquisite. The chips are great,served promptly and with a wonderful bean dip (upon request). The bar side has friendly and attentive bartenders who make you enjoy your visit.Came here with some family because they wanted chinese food.  We ordered the dinner specal and there was a ton of food and it was really good.  They have a veggie soup that was really good.  There egg rolls were hot and fresh but a little oily but still really tasty.  We got sweet and sour chicken and something else and a beef dish and they were all really tasty.I love this place! It was my first time rock climbing and my boyfriend & I wanted to kill some time before our flight back home. 

The instructor was friendly and gave us a quick tutorial and demonstration of how to climb the wall. I was a beginner and it was very scary at first, but because I know there's someone supporting my weight on the floor, I felt very safe. 

The place was clean and pretty big for a indoor rock climbing place. There wasnt a lot of people that day so we had a chance to try out different levels of difficulty on the walls. 

Definitely recommend this place!Usually the food is fantastic and the service is great.  The blonde manager always seems to run the restaurant the best.I am definitely a big fan of Trader Joe's.  Why?  Because they focus on healthy, organic, natural foods AND they manage to keep their prices low. 

Trader Joe's is small (in comparison to most grocery stores), so they have a more limited selection of certain things like fresh produce, and because of their smaller size the aisles do get a little congested at times. 

However, they also have more extensive selections of certain things. The nuts and dried fruits aisle is fantastic.  One of my favorite healthy snacks that you won't find anywhere else is the Cashews and Hibiscus mix.  

Trader Joe's also has an aisle with a generous selection of chocolates and chocolate-covered nuts and berries.  Who doesn't love chocolate?

Trader Joe's has a unique selection of delicious, gourmet-style, ready-made frozen meals like Polenta Provencale and Gnocchi alla Sorrentina. These are not among the lower priced offerings, but they are tasty.  

Another great about Trader Joe's is their wine selection. While they have plenty of the more expensive wines that I can't afford, they also have cheaper wines like Trader Joe's own brand of "Coastal" California wines, which at $4.49 a bottle is well within my budget.  I'm no wine connoisseur, but I also think it tastes good.  I would even say that the cheap price makes the wine more palatable.

Trader Joe's doesn't carry everything I need or want, but it has a lot of things I want that I can't find anywhere else.  I like knowing that Trader Joe's doesn't stock items with artificial colors, flavors, preservatives, added trans fat, or genetically modified ingredients.  And I like their reasonable prices.I'll have a three rolled beef with guacamole combo, cheese quesadilla with guac, some chicken tacos, and extra quac. Thank you. That is all.For fast food Mexican I can't complain...I'd rather go to a taqueria, but at 9pm they aren't open :( So, Del taco will do the trick. The people working were nice, or food came fast and everything tasted good (for fast food :)) No complaints for this fast food joint. And Del Taco is cheap :)Our tour of classic old school Vegas restaurants continues with a trip to Bob Taylor's Ranch House for a friend's birthday.  We live pretty close-by, so the Ranch House isn't too far off the beaten track by our standards.

Rolling up, we were totally transported back in time to when this restaurant was located in the middle of nowhere (except now the Ranch is surrounded by tract homes and lost some of their land to the 215).  According to a friend, this place was once so remote that the mob used to stop here for some steaks and drinks after doing, ehem, nefarious things to people in the desert.  Ah Vegas and your local lore!  

Enough about that, on to the food.  We were seated at a four-top in the corner, away from the large windows that face the front yard unfortunately.  The ambiance wasn't as fancy as I expected, kind of more road-house than steak-house - which is A-OK by me. I love places with personality!  I ordered the Fettuccine with Scallops in Chardonnay Cream Sauce as an entree, which was huge and very well done. Overall, I felt the dish could have used a dusting of grated parmesan for some extra ooomph. Two of my dining companions got the Broiled Shrimp - which they both said was super flavorful, taking on the smokey flavors from the open mesquite grill.  The wine list was super reasonable, allowing us to enjoy a full bottle of wine for the table at very little cost.

Take some time to peruse the artifacts that line the glass cases in the entrance and the bar - they have some pretty cool Las Vegas memorabilia. I'm docking one star because the women's bathroom was a little too funky for my taste and could have used a good cleaning.The service is consistently slow, but the beer is good and the food is delicious. Sit in the bar to watch a game or sit in the dining room with the kiddos, either way it's always a good choice.Papa Murphys is by far my favorite of the chain pizza available in Las Vegas. I always get the DeLite crust, as it reheats much better than the thicker crusts. You get to pick your toppings, and they have a bunch to choose from. The sauce is good, and the toppings always taste fresh. 

Look online for coupons before you go. The website always has some, and there is usually one for the DeLite crust. You can call ahead, but it usually only takes a few minutes if you go in to order.

The reason I can't give them 5 stars is because they always seem to be out of something. One time, it was the DeLite crust. They stretched the regular crust out instead. They have been out of bacon at least twice while I was there, and various other toppings at one point or another.

But if you are looking for a cheap, tasty pizza and don't mind cooking it yourself, go to Papa Murphys.Been here several times and the food great.  Service is also friendly which can be rare with asian restaurants.  My advice, bring a lot of friends so you can order a wide variety of dishes.  Again, the food is delicious!Came during my lunch break from near by CSN. I was craving something light and not expensive. I came in and it was a very cute spot--very mom and pop. 

I sat down and was given water immediately and a menu. I had their Prik King chicken dish with a side of soup.

When I got the soup first it was pretty tasty and so I ate it with a quickness. After, I got my Prik king and I was a fan on the first bite. The chicken was well cooked and the sauce was well done--not too salty and oily. The rice made is good compliment to the dish as many Asian dishes.

I would come again.Went to eat here after not eating sushi for about 5 months.... Still good like I remember and they added a few items I don't recall on the previous menu.... One of which was 'peppered tuna' roll, a baked 'ocean' roll and a 'bbq' roll..... definately all 3 were delicious and I got my usual 'volcano roll'Been here a few times, always very busy, mixed crowd of people.  Tonight it was busy, but service was excellent.

The garlic knots were good and the fried zucchini strips were good.  We ordered a large pizza meatballs, sausage, mushrooms and ricotta cheese.  It was great.  Overall, it was a enjoyable meal.Great little neighborhood dive in Chinatown. Cheap beer and comfort food. Lots of dart boards and cold beers on tap. Like Arnold said, "I'll Be Back!"Got the gyro time sandwich with lamb n beef shwarma, tender tasty meat, good tzaziki sauce, haven't had a gyro in years, this one holds up to most, but one time at band camp..... Oops
Next time gonna gnosh on the falafel (is that the spelling)? 
Free drink refills, u get fries w the combo for 3bux more....

Gyro you later!

CaliI love this place. The mesquite grilled chicken is always really good. The bbq sauce is good, not anything too special but tasty. The sweet potatoes are really good too, a nice alternative to a mashed potato, which my coworker loves theirs. 

I quite like their sauteed vegetables and fresh fruit...they put more than just cantaloupe in the bowl, so I opt for this all the time. I didn't care for the spinach pasta with feta, it lacked flavor which surprised me. 

All in all you can't go wrong with the chicken here, I can't wait for the one near my work to open. The ribs always smell amazing so one day I will have to venture outside the box and go for it.During this holiday season ... I must say, I'm so glad i get to order my favorite combination together ... A caramel brulee and cranberry bliss ... yummy in my tummy!Hubby and I went here for happy hour (4p-7p). Overall, SOLID! We ate in the dining room (the bar/lounge area was just way too smoky). Seat yourself, service was very friendly, quick, and attentive. We got sodas, an order of the hot-tiaki wings, garlic parm chicken tenders, the beef tacos, and a cheese quesadilla.  All of these were on the appetizer menu, so our total bill was under $20! 

The food was good- although the hot-tiaki wings tasted like regular buffalo wings (no terryiaki flavor). Everything came out piping hot, and the portions were really big for appetizers. I had to box up some things to take home. 

The atmosphere was your typical dark wood paneling, dim lighting, neighborhood lodge. It was close and convenient to our house, and made a nice pre-movie dinner. We'll be back!We go to basketball games here, NBA exhibition and Olympic practices. I'd give it five stars but the parking makes it hard to get out unless you park near the exit which makes for a long walk to the stadium.  Great hotdogs and friendly staff. ;)I sometimes substitute teach in a school near Mama Maria's and I've heard my students rave about the food.  Today, I finally got bored enough to make the drive and try it for myself.

First of all, the place is in a somewhat dingy plaza.  Don't be fooled, though.  Inside, Mama Maria's is a cute, clean little mom 'n pop type of place.  The server greeted us right away and brought us tortillas and salsa.  I say tortillas because they really are tortillas, not chips.  The salsa is, quite frankly, the best I've ever had.  Having lived in west Texas for a couple of years, I have tried a LOOOOOOT of salsas.  I can say that this is the best I have personally experienced.

The beans and rice here are fab.  I got the tampiquena.  The steak was tender and well-seasoned.  I was impressed with the cheese enchilada - I normally find enchiladas (especially cheese ones) really boring, but this one wasn't.  It was flavorful and gooey.  

I am looking forward to coming back and trying a few new things on the menu.  This strikes me as the kind of place you can try new things and just trust that they will be good.The Blue Diamond Saloon is a dive bar by all means. It does not serve food, so you should probably eat before you go, otherwise you will be eating McDonald's while drunk. 

There are usually heaps of specials on any night. Lucky for us, we went on a Saturday, so it was ladies night. Ladies get 2 for 1 drinks and that is amazing since they are not that expensive to begin with. So we got a bucket of 5 domestic beers for 12 dollars, 6 mixed drinks, and two beers on tap for 40 dollars. With the 10 dollars we spent on shuffleboard, it was a great way to spend a Saturday for 5 people. 

It is dark, smoky, and minimalistic, but that is the charm of this place. There is a dart board with areas which adds another challenge to the game. The two pool tables don't seem to have any defects. The highlight of this place is the shuffleboard. It is fun to get a group of people together and play while talking smack. On top of that, my partner and I came back from a 14 point deficit to clinch the victory leading to my lose free night. BOOYAH!i just went there for drinks, and the bartender was what made the place.  i had some good, strong drinks (i hate watered down drinks-i'm paying, you fuckhead, get me buzzed and you'll get a bigger tip) and the bartender lady was personable, had awesome ink and kept us there for a few more than we intended to have.   never had their food tho.Painful, as a Marquette grad to rate anything in Madison as positive...  But it is a pretty good sports bar in a hotel.  I've been here a couple times and always found the staff friendly and attentive (morning breakfast excluded, and why I ding a star).  

Bar staff was amazing, friendly, attentive.  Heck they made us chicken quesadilla appetizer that was even on the menu.

Morning service (aka bar supporting hotel) not so much.  Staff in attentive and know most are on coupons, etc.  Once the buffet wasn't even open.  

But as a guy that relocated to the South...  Visiting in January...  Only option ;)Very great selection.  The staff are very intelligent  and can help find almost anything.  They also have a good deal of material regarding how to use natural remedies.  I would give them five stars if they had better hours.Best drinks when I'm reminded of how good I had it growing up in the caribbean.

Do NOT go between the hours of 4-9 on a Friday/Saturday night, you won't fit.

But otherwise, my fave place to get fruity yummy drinks!!!My husband and I were in Madison for business trip. I wanted to try something different. And I am so glad I found this place on Yelp! This is going to be one of our regular stops in Madison. The fish was AWESOME! 

The only problem, they don't take credit cards. Cash or check only. We were not prepared, but they had an ATM machine (charges a fee).

It was sort of hard to find with the road construction going on. But worth the hassle of driving around looking for a parking spot.There is a line outside the door every day at lunch time. When I walk in, I hear so much Arabic flying back and forth that I think I crept in to a back-alley shawerma stand in Jerusalem. Take these things as you will. 

I've brought a few people here who were very unimpressed, but that's just because they've spent significant portions of their lives in the Middle East. My obviously-homesick Arabic teachers love this place. You, on the other hand, are probably a white yuppie who can't tell the difference between koshary and mansaf. While the taste is not truly reminiscent of the Arab world, it is about as close as you're going to get in Madison.

In my honest opinion, the falafel is shit, and the chicken shawerma is nothing special. My 4 stars are for the lamb/beef shawerma, which is excellent. Get the lamb/beef shawerma, and only the lamb/beef shawerma.

Portions are also uncharacteristically small for this kind of cuisine. Expect to spend a decent sum in order to get full.

Also, I'd eat here a hell of a lot more often if they actually accepted plastic.Really more of a 3.5/5 in my opinion. Really great atmosphere in one of Madison's coolest neighborhoods. Sandwiches are pretty good, and most of the ingredients are fresh and well-prepared which elevates this place above your typical sandwich shop. The Gazpacho was amazing as well. 5/5 on that front.

$10 for a cup of soup and a sandwich with a nantucket nectar seems reasonable to me. I'll enjoy this again on a lazy summer afternoon.Ding-ding-ding!! Capitol Centre Market "Serving Downtown Madison since 1983" served me well in 2013. This was exactly the grocery store I was looking for, and where I will be buying my groceries. The selection wasn't enormous but satisfying enough. I had options between name- and off-brands and it felt shopped -- it wasn't crazy busy when I was there, but people were coming in and out; it felt like a real grocery store (and it is haha). 

I was extremely pleased with the fresh produce, cheese, yogurt, and meat selection. I made a delicious beef stir fry with porta bella mushrooms for dinner with my purchases. Prices were higher than going to Hy-Vee or even Copp's, but I honestly thought my total would be closer to $200 and it was only $60. Blame my bad math or applaud my deal-savvy shopping but I totally impulsed shopped. Nutella and Odwalla bars can attest to that. 

I noticed a good amount of organic products in the produce and cereal sections (hooray Puffin cereal!!), which Cap Centre does advertise. I also really enjoyed the atmosphere. The employees went about their business but were polite when needed. The cashier who bagged my groceries could've saved some trees but he didn't put cans on top of my fruit or bread - that's all I really ask. (And I guess I could've saved some trees by not asking for paper and/or remembering to bring my own reusable grocery bags). 

For no-car-lives-around-the-Capitol, this is a great grocery store.  I loved the narrow aisles and am a happy camper with my cupboards full of food.I have never had East African or Ethiopian cuisine before. I was hesitant to try Buraka at first, but I was pleasantly surprised. 

The Samoosas and the fried plantain appetizers were delicious. Most of the main entrees at Buraka are curry dishes. I tried the Dorowot and the Siga Alicha and both were pretty tasty. The good thing is that for adventurous patrons, there's an option to try a combination of two dishes and do a half-and-half. I highly recommend that.

The service at Buraka is great, so ask for recommendations. You won't be disappointed in their food.We were in town for the Arizona State v. Wisconsin game and, of course, had to stop at State Street Brats.  Great atmosphere and good food.  One of the best places I have ever been to watch college football.best place in Madison for Thai Food! I'm writing on behalf of my workplace and my own personal experience. We ordered a bunch of food for over 100 people and everyone loved it. Their vegan dishes are perfect for the vegan vegetarians.

I've ordered fried rice for myself a few times now with the 4-star spice rating and it's cooked perfect. Very spicy, very good. Definitely recommend this place!Because I am an adult and not a child (no matter how much I wish the reverse were true), this is a review for Adult Swim. 

Adult Swim is a great concept. Friday night + booze + puzzles + games + crafts = way too many things I like in one neat little package. They've got some decent beer offerings to boot!

Climb on the play structure, construct a giant fort, walk around the rooftop garden, hold a live chicken. That chicken might not be too grateful that you've had too many beers and are contemplating smuggling him out under your jacket, but that's another story.

My only qualm with Adult Swim is that I always leave wishing there were just a little bit MORE. Maybe I'm just romanticizing the Children's Museum from my own tottish days, but I think the ratio of cool enticing activities to just standing in a neat space drinking a beer is a bit off. That being said, I like standing in a neat space drinking beer, so I'll be back!Great hotel - nice staff, very clean, lots of stuff to do here and nearbyThe guy serving me up slices of pieces said that this was the original Ian's Pizza location. That's always exciting. It was weird though, as soon as we came in, we saw a scraggly looking man at the corner table shouting at the two employees that were towards the back of the establishment. Nothing vulgar, but dude, shhh... there are only 3 (now 5) people here. Why are you yelling? The two employees seemed to act like that was a normal occurrence.

As I looked for a slice that I wanted, I told the guy "I can't decide, there are too many options!" To which he replied with, "that's a good complaint to have!" Indeed it is. $2.50 for cheese or pepperoni. $3.50 for any other slice. Deal!

My younger brother stole the last mushroom/pepperoni slice by ordering just before me, haha. So I asked if they had anymore and he said he could put mushrooms on any slice. I saw him take a plate of mushrooms and cook them along side the pepperoni slice. But as he piled the shrooms on the slice, he had extra that he just threw away (*insert sad face). I would have totally had all the mushrooms on that slice! Oh well.

The other slice I went with was the buffalo chicken slice, a favorite of mine. My brother loved his Mac & Cheese slice. Regardless of this strange experience, I like Ian's pizza and will continue to frequent any of their locations (I first had them in Milwaukee, and went a lot!). No one has near the selection by the slice that Ian's has.I could get drunk off the book smell here... what an awesome place! Everything is super old and if you're super old like me, the history & art sections alone are worth taking a couple hours to pick through. Which I did. 

I really liked this place, but I do get the overwhelming feeling that the books are all talking about me... or something. You know what I mean. That, I'm not sure I want this shiz up in my house feeling... Or that the books themselves have a sordid history... never mind.All around good place to stop for a bite.
Reasonable prices and quality food.I want to really love this place. The food is really just lovely. We came here for brunch. 
I had the crawfish crab cakes with the rosemary polenta. They served it with fresh fruit salad. I liked what I ordered. But, I didn't think it was spectacular.
The son ordered Chilaquiles Verde. The tomatillo sauce was nicely spicy. They served it with poached eggs and fresh fruit.
The daughter got the 2 eggs and bacon. AND if you ever want bacon, ordered this, here. The plate had a mound of bacon.
The husband ordered the the vegetable omelette. Fine- nothing special.

The best dish was the Chilaquilas. The place is really small but the friendliness makes up for everything.

Word of caution: they have ventilation problem. Its extremely smokey in there.Delicious bagels! Bagels are not huge, but so good. Great bagel sandwiches. Slower service, though.Very good and cheap but crappy service. The staff is slow, rude and inefficient.Best place for breakfast in Madison. Hands down, if I'm there in the morning time, this place is my first stop, no matter how long the wait. I mean seriously, it doesn't matter, this food is always top notch. I am sad to have been blessed with the gift of having non-cooking friends in Fitchburg, only to lose them to Seattle, thus losing my connection to the Madison Pancake House. Doubt I'll go to another location, my expectation is too high.This place tops my list of most frequented breakfast/brunch spots. 

Pros:
- yummy waffles and pancakes
- freshly squeezed OJ

Cons:
- often 20+ minute wait on weekends
- cash only (there's an ATM inside but who wants to be charged a fee? Come prepared)
- decor is barebones and outdated

I still fantasize about the strawberry waffle-- thick with crispy edges, fresh strawberries (none of those mushy frozen strawberries that are typically in a thick syrupy sauce that you might get elsewhere), and freshly whipped cream (not rediwhip). It's heavenly. Get it-- you won't regret it!Grade: B-

Excellent food. Poor food service. Expensive!The quality and comfort of the shoes at this store is fantastic. The prices are in line/competitive for the quality of the shoes they sell. The employees are very knowledgable and friendly. It is a full service shoe store. My only gripe is that it can be hard to find someone to help you because they are busy - but once you get a turn they give you their full attention. They also have a punch card system where you can earn $50 off a future purchase by collecting enough punches. That was a really nice unexpected bonus to find when I purchased. I will go back again.My wife and I tried this restaurant because we had a coupon. It was a little difficult to find at first (had to walk up some stairs, then walk through the bar), but once we met the hostess, it was smooth sailing from there. I ordered the steak and was very pleased with it. We liked the atmosphere, the service was good, and we would go back again.Point of clarification regarding Jen's review, Casa Del Sol (as it is now known) has no legal ties, nor has it ever, to the Casa De Lara downtown. It's likely the decision to change names had a lot to do with this fact, although I'm not certain.

I'm a big fan of authentic Mexican cuisine, and for the price, this place was outstanding. We were started off with a small basket of spicy tortilla chips and an authentic salsa with just enough kick to let us know the kitchen here doesn't fool around and won't be placating weak gringo palates. Along with our drink order, we took an order of guacamole, served in the traditional stone bowl. DAMN! that was good! It had a perfect texture, not excessively blended nor impossibly chunky, and a fresh flavor that I wanted to savor as long as I could. I ordered the Carne Asada a la Tampiqueña, but I could have ordered literally anything on the menu and have been just as satisfied.

We came on a Friday night and were sat immediately. This place is a sleeper. By that I mean, you'd never know the food was as good as it is judging by the dinning room furniture. This food is easily of high enough caliber to be served at a far more expensive joint. It's not an ugly or horribly cheap dining room, although the atmosphere may be holding there success back a bit. To get that coveted 5th star, I suggest replacing the metal (yet, comfortably upholstered) chairs and matching tables, with handcrafted wooden furniture. Anything to separate this experience from La Hacienda's cafeteria-esque appearance will be a step in the right direction.

The only (minor) complaint I have is that when I ordered a Negro Modelo, I got a Dos Equis Amber... our conversation was so engaging, I didn't notice until it was time to go.A really nice bar, they used to be over on University but are on Gorham now.  Their new location is huge and sometimes feels too big, but the bar is great and has this sweet ice strip through it to keep your drinks chilled.  Cool bartenders and good specials.Hey, its nice.  Good food, good drinks, very cosy...and again, NO SMOKING...a perfect place.  Great for after work gatherings...Terrible acoustics, but that's the only negative thing I can possibly say about this fabulous little slice of Madison charm. It's small, so there is often a considerable wait if you go on a weekend night or there's something happening at the Kohl Center. The desserts have been disappointing in my limited experience, but that shouldn't matter if you've ordered their awesome antipasto platter and easily the best ultra thin crust pizza I've ever had.Pizza Hut was the best location for lunch at high school.  It was virtually a cheap pizza party each week.  We would  always compete to see the person capable of downing 12 slices, pasta, bread sticks and as much Mountain Dew as possible in a very limited amount of time.  Sure the pizza wasn't great, but it was the only joint offering a buffet of pizza... so it was more than good enough.

Since high school, I have frequented Pizza Hut less and less.  Maybe it started with obnoxious menu item, "P'Zone".  I think it had more to do with valuing my calorie intake with higher quality and better tasting heart attack inducing sustenance.  

Yesterday, I jogged my way back to 1993... those wonderful school days of scarfing down food in a pizza trough.  Pizza Hut!!

Gone are the days I could be carefree enough to gorge on 12+ slices of pie.  When you're in your late 30's, moderation is regrettably key.  

The restaurant is full sized (like the junk in my trunk following the feast). It was clean and well-maintained. I was seated immediately.  The pleasant server came within a minute and smiled while she paved the way to rekindling my glutinous memories of the pizza days of yore. 

The restaurant was very busy and the pizza was well-stocked with so many varieties.  Off the top of my head there was a thin crust cheese and pan versions of; barbecue, supreme, sausage and 'shroom and many more.  There was also some cheesy alfredo pasta dish, cheese bread and cinnamon and cherry dessert streusel pizza.  

The flavor of the conveyor belt pizza was pretty much the same as it ever was.  This location was better than most because the pies were hot, not rushed through the pizza assembly line (in other locations, I have been issues with goopy under-cooked dough). 

The buffet was unbelievably cheap - $7 or so.  I believe in 1993 it was $5.49 or 
$5.99, so the price point is very friendly to their customers.  

As far as my ability to eat vs. my former self... it was no contest.  Yesterday, I ended up that I was only comfortable snagging water, six slices, a scoop of pasta and no cheesy bread or dessert.  Of course the 17/18 year-old-me would have openly mocked and ridiculed me for being a wuss.The selection is incredible - I've yet to leave empty-handed, no matter how esoteric my search.  They cram an unbelievable amount of inventory into a very small space, so the layout of the store takes some getting used to.  Pricing is reasonable, slightly more than on-line sources, but a good value considering the expertise of the staff.  They also have a decent selection of kitchen gadgets, though not to the level of Orange Tree Imports or the Kitchen Gallery.

While the staff members are not over-the-top friendly, they are incredibly knowledgeable.  I also like the fact that they will let my daughter and I browse freely when we have the time to explore.  The store also offers a variety of baking and cake decorating classes for all skill levels.

Finding a parking spot in front of the store is a breeze, but navigating the congested Odana Road corridor to get to the store - not so much fun.

If you are in need of baking supplies, I encourage you to check out the Vanilla Bean.You know the thing about living in Phoenix and daprting from Phoenix is that there are really only two options that makes sense.  One is Southwest the other us USAirways.  And if i think about how often I fly i have had very few issues with both.  I think every airline has their issues, but all in all I have been travling on USAir (Am West) for more that 14 years.  I have seen some bad things with them, but lately I can not complain.  I hear a lot of people complain about USAir, but take it from a business traveler, if you have a problem on USAir you will have a problem on Southwest, Delta, United (you get the picutre).  I have more the 500,000 miles on USAir and not because I do not use the miles because the miles program is so good.Okay, I'm going to try and redeem this place.

I'll start by saying the reason people come here, or bring out of town visitors (should be on your list for that) is Nicole.  I've been to many a piano bar and I don't think I've ever seen anything like her.  You try and text message your friend while playing Clocks by Coldplay!

They serve sandwiches and salads.  The most expensive thing on the menu is $13.  They're not serving foi gras or a 5 course tasting menu.  If you're looking for that, head to Scottsdale.

The purpose of ordering the food here is to be able to soak up the half-priced bottle of wine you'll inevitably be ordering.  Or, maybe the monster-sized martinis.  Much like the size of the drinks, the food portions are also quite big.  I very rarely leave without a box.

If you have room, the desserts are YUMMY.  The Tuxedo, Chocolate Lava Cake, and the "Tira Tini" are all great.  I suspect the others  are too.

So, ignore the naysayers and check it out after 7pm Wed-Sun so you can hear the pianist.  If you can get a table up close, go for it.  (no it's not too loud).  You can't leave before Nicole plays her version of Flight of the Bumble Bee, so drink slowly or get your $10 out to request it.  Phenomenal.We came here for breakfast and I liked this place. I ordered the eggs Benedict and it was perfect. The taste was great and the size was good (maybe too small for others). The bread was absolutely fantastic- I ordered a side since it was THAT good. My wife had an omelette, which was good but nothing extraordinary. 

The atmosphere was a bit too big and open for me. For breakfast, I tend to like more quaint, homey-feeling places. This atmosphere was a bit 'cold' for me but the food distracted me enough to where it wasn't an issue. 

I haven't been here for other meals but I'd recommend it for breakfast!I had Jury duty on Friday.....and I was in search of some coffee and a snack. This establishment is right next to the Municipal Court building downtown. While I didn't end up getting anything....the place is very nice with plenty of outdoor seating in the shade. I left court at about noon time and it was packed.....so I assumed the food was great and the service is definitely fast. Midwesterners might compare this place to "Potbelly's" which is a popular sandwich...soup...and dessert spot. So if your ever downtown near the municipal court house and you need a quick meal....this looks like a good choice. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friend!!!!yeah. i like dodge theatre. i like the staffers - they're friendly and helpful. i like the bathrooms - they're large and they're clean. i like the music memorabilia on the walls. i like that they allow re-entry. i like that i've sat in all the different sections and never had a bad seat. i like that the sound is pretty much always good. i like that they get some pretty good acts. 

oh! i also like the bargain parking option. arrive around 6:30, feed the meter until 8 (about $2) and go have dinner before the show. the meters are free after 8. the best part? cheaper and closer than the garage down the block that charges $10!networks is located in the hyatt regency phoenix. it's a pretty cool sports bar-- they've got several large screen tvs for you to watch any game that's on.

i liked that they had booths as well as high-top tables available in the restaurant. 

we went two nights in a row for some drinks and a snack. my husband is totally ecstatic that they have fat tire on tap! his favorite beer. we can't get it where we're from.

we had the same server both nights. the first night she was pretty chatty (she talked to us for more than 10 minutes about her vacation to hawaii (because that's where we're from)) and it was a little too much for me. i hadn't seen my husband for over a week and i was on a date with him! but, she was really nice, nonetheless. she was very prompt with service and always got us refills, even without us flagging her down!

the second night, it was a lot busier (probably why she didn't stick around to chat) and we had my sister-in-law and her husband join us. her husband ordered a burger, and it was the biggest burger i've seen stacked that high in my life! he said it was really good. i liked the chicken tenders covered with parmesan-garlic. ask for honey mustard sauce! soooooooooo good!!

hopefully the next time we're back in phoenix, we'll make it here again.Pretty nice theatre. Great vibes here.I only wish the indoor dining area was bigger. Fast service, tasty food, affordable experience.Summation of two visits within 1 week...
First visit was during lunch rush.
Second was late lunch post-rush.

Nice comfortable interior.
Good to excellent service.
Good food.

Was left wanting for drink refills the first visit during lunch rush. Second visit I felt like I was in a 5 star restaurant with the service we received.


I had the Chili Relleno both times. 
First time I ordered it it had a bunch of grilled or sauteed onions on top. Didn't care for the onions. Second time I ordered it smothered in Green Chili. It was a little better but the green chili had little pieces of overcooked pork (I think) in it. Threw the taste off for me. So I avoided those little chunks.

Good quality cheese.

My coworkers loved the Steak Picata.
I'll return when in the area.I love the old brick buildings and the huge library that makes you feel like you are in an actual regular library. I love the art department, when you come into the area it is located centrally and has a dark, cool tunnel-like hallway. This is a very diverse school so you got to love that about it. Get involved in as many clubs and activities as I did! This is a great school that has that mini-university feeling like the other reviewer said.There is a God in Phoenix and (s)he is Chinese. For the last 6 years I've been on a quest for decent Chinese food in Phoenix and come up consistently empty-handed. Diamonds answered my prayers.

Everything I've ever ordered (I get take out about once a week and try to mix it up with safe faves and new diversions), has been fantastic.  Diamonds is the real deal for Chinese in Phoenix, as substantiated by the fact that every time I'm in there there's  a very healthy multi-cultural   mix of Asians, Latinos and Euros.  When you walk in and you see the bubbling tanks of fresh fish & crustaceans plus a room full of Chinese diners -- you know the place is good. 

The two key indicators of good Chinese IMHO are the fried rice and the lo mein.  No BS here and no fakery. No nasty dried out yellow/orange sazon goya rice with frozen peas and no Barilla scorched in oil masquerading as lo mein.  Diamonds fried rice (all kinds) is the best I've had in 30 years and all of their dishes are custom cooked to order and sered brilliantly hot. From soups to apps to main dishes, everything is fresh and delicous.

The one downside (which is why I gave only 4 stars) is that when I'm craving Diamonds, I'm worse than a crack-whore jonesin a fix. I need it  NOW.  And as they prepare each meal to order the wait can sometimes be laborious.  They also have a stock answer of "20 minutes" for any order and I've placed my orders in advance and sometimes waited up to 45 minutes for the take-out to be ready.  In their defense that has been when I've gone in to pick up my take out and the place got packed and I think they prioritize those in the location over take-out orders sometimes... which stands to reason when you have a hungry table of people waiting, I guess.  The lady who works the counter is always nice while I'm waiting, offers me a seat and a glass of water, so I cant be too pissed at 'em.

Face it -- we're not in NY, San Fransisco or any town with a real Chinatown, so when it comes to getting your authentic fix for Chinese in Phoenix, Diamonds is worth the wait every time!I love my guys at this bike shop.  super knowlegeable and bright funny dudes.   always a killer clearance rackMy first experience at Mi Patio was several years ago, and I have been recommending it ever since.  
This restaurant is just wonderful! Good food, great atmosphere, amazing service! It is not my first pick for mexican food, but it remains a favorite restaurant for me due to the environment and service.Clean dining area, not too fancy. Great if you have kids and need to feed them fast. 
Get the Indian taco with the beef! Yum! The desert was the highlight, deep fried bread with cinnamon sugar. Ugh! I wasn't hungry for the next 12 hours...Let me be frank: I love Sacks. I love their sandwiches so much; I would drive a crazy distance to endure lunch time traffic and terrible parking just to have one of their delicious sandwiches. When I come to this location, I always feel like I'm going off to battle and will return victorious. I usually call ahead, since the line to order can be out the door. My favorite sandwich is the Symphony - minus the sprouts.  I also love that it comes with a cookie - yum. This is one of my favorite lunch time destinations downtown and would jump at the chance to eat here. 

However, I hate, hate, HATE the parking. It's horrific! You can spend 15 minutes driving around, lurking and waiting for someone to come out just so you can snatch their space. It takes so long to find parking, you could probably place an order form the parking lot and your sandwich would be ready by the time you found parking. On top of this, the Papa John's delivery drivers block people in and that makes it even more of a cluster. 

Short Story Time: The parking is so bad that as I'm trying to leave the parking lot, I get stuck behind this woman and I'm patiently waiting. As I'm waiting, this guy gets in his car and just backs into me! Luckily it wasn't anything serious but damn. It really is a battle for one delicious sandwich.Yummy in my tummy goes the won-ton soup. It is my go to for when anyone is feeling sick and totally hits the spot with all its veggies. Best in the valley, IMHO. The fried rice is also really yummy here. They don't skimp on the veggies which I love. 

Last visit to eat in was a couple weeks ago and the waitress/owner(?) was super nice to us and our French friends visiting from across the pond. I will definitely make an effort to eat in more often instead of ordering out.TASTY spicy pork taco plate.
Chili Relleno was a little disappointing... too small of a chili inside the egg batter. The sauce was killer, though.

The chips were a little greasy.

The details were all very good, though. The salsas, the rice, the beans... all very well done.

I also had a little taste of their poblano mole... oh yeah... it's good!

The main thing here is probably to order the right thing... the menu is extensive and not all of it is perfect.This is my favorite city-run 9 hole course.  It's mostly par threes with three par fours that aren't really long.  It's easily walkable and always in good condition. I prefer this over the Encanto 9-hole because the greens are a little more dynamic, more breaks, hills etc...and they always roll pretty smoothly. 

The downside for me is the tee boxes. They are lumpy as all get-out so it can be hard to find a nice flat area to tee up. 

This one also has a driving range on site (irons only) plus a chipping area and putting green - unlike the Encanto 9, where you'll have to warm up at the 18 hole course a block away. 

Tuesdays and Wednesdays are my weekends so I play this course once or twice a week. I never have problems just showing up without a tee time to walk the course.  

It's not the most challenging course. There are no bunkers and the water never really comes into play - unless you have a wicked slice, then you might end up in the water on the first hole. 

My personal favorite is the eighth hole par 4. It's only 256 yards, but has a narrow fairway and dogleg left.  There are some tall trees on the left preventing you from driving the green. 

Anyway, it's a great course. $9 to walk during the off-peak season and replays are only about six bucks. If you have the Phoenix golf card you'll get discounted green fees and earn points for a free round every time you play.Food was great! Pita is amazing... Prices are a little high for lunch and the area/parking is not great.I love this place. I have the chicken tacos, chicken taco salad and the machaca beef taco salad. All very good. Love the chips and salsa. Love the service. Went there the other nite told our waiter that the last time we came my son ordered the Carne Asada Burro dinner did not get beans and rice but got charged for it. My son ordered it that nite again and the waiter only charged us for the burro to make up for it. Really cool. My other son really likes the Chimi. My boyfriend loves the cheeseburger not a great Mexican fan is he but he goes with us for the burger. I will continue to go here.We have not been here for years (5+) the food is not as good as I remember it being. The service was OUTSTANDING!!!! Our waiter Matt was so good he had a great attitude joking with us and very pleasant. He was on the ball. Next time you dine here you have to ask for Matt.Between my parents and myself, we have pretty much eaten our way through the menu and because there are several items that I actually find myself craving, I thought I should update my review.

The veggie lo-mein is better than your average noodle. There are always a ton of fresh veggies (brocolli, carrots, onions, cauliflower, etc) with just a hint of smokiness to the noodles. Really quite wonderful.

The sesame chicken isn't like any I've ever had. It's really more like a honey glazed chicken, sprinkled with a few sesame seeds, but it is awesome. The chicken and vegetables is awesome and not over-dressed with gooey sauce. And all of the chicken dishes are made with all white meat, so you don't get that weird feeling half way through your meal that you are eating some sort of mystery ingredient.

They have two "family meal" options that are dirt cheap and for those of you that question whether or not you will have enough food for your family of 4 or 6, trust the guidelines and grab a big table because once the plates start arriving, you will need the room!

Although the original owners did sell about 1.5 years ago, the new family that took over is every bit as nice and dedicated to putting out good food for a decent price.

The last two bonuses are their huge delivery area and the fact that most items on the menu can be ordered as either an a la carte item (enough for 4 servings), as a meal (which comes with rice, egg roll, and crab puff), or in a bowl (with just rice).  

The standouts on the menu, along with the super low prices and the flexability  for ordering just what you want, earns them an extra star!It's Saturday and we decided to go to Great Wall for dim sum. I had heard about this place from my cousin, but didn't have a chance to try it until today.  We got a late start and by the time we got to Great Wall it was close to 1 pm.  

The place is fairly spacious and we were seated right away. We noticed that they had a live fish tank with lobster, dungeness crab, assorted fish and even shrimp.

The bustling dim sum carts came to us pretty quickly. 

We tried the following items:

Steamed spareribs- small cubes of spareribs steamed in a black bean sauce. It was actually pretty tasty and not super fatty like some places. Would order this again.

Long noodle (churng fun) with shrimp-  the noodles were too thick for my liking even though the shrimp was nice and crunchy and it had a light soy sauce over it. Probably won't order this again unless the noodles are rolled out thinner.

Baked pork bun- these buns looked great, all nicely golden brown with a light layer of sticky syrup to give it a sheen. The bun itself is soft and tasty, but I had to take literally 4 bites of the bun to get any "char siu" or bbq pork filling. Slightly disappointing.

Cocktail bun- these buns seem to be quite popular, as the lady took one quick round trip around just half the room and they were gone. 3 buns come in one order. These are long shaped buns with some sesame on top. Inside are sweetened coconut filling and the bun is soft. A good combo and better than many other places I've tried.

Chinese tamale (jung) - A lotus leaf surrounds the savory goodness of rice, pork and green beans and chinese sausage (lap churng). They also have the option of peanuts instead of green beans if you want.

Fried taro puff-  Mashed up taro is stuffed with minced pork, green onions with 5 spice powder and fried up with this puffy coating. I thought the taro puff here was a bit harder or denser than some places I've tried.
 
Steamed shu mai- is perhaps one of the more famous Chinese dim sum items as it is steamed shrimp and pork dumpling. However, the shu mai at Great Wall is mediocre at best.  The shu mai is a bit denser than I am normally accustomed to and the skin falls off easily as you pick it out from the mini steamer.

Pan fried turnip cake- this was surprisingly better than expected. It was pan fried to a nice golden brown on both sides and you could taste the dried shrimp, lap churng and bits of turnip. Definitely recommend trying this.

Congee / Porrdige - we tried the 1000 year old egg with salted pork porridge and it was fine. Lots of chunks of egg and pork mixed in the porridge.

The bill came out to be a little over $27 for 3 people - not bad at all.

I haven't tried their dinner items so this review is just for their dim sum. Over all, one of the better places that I've encountered while visiting the Phoenix area. Would come back for dim sum again and will give this place a try for dinner sometime soon.This place was next door to our hotel. After a few days of greasy burgers, we were hungry for some veggies. This salad/soup/pasta bar was just the ticket. We enjoyed the food, it was fresh and the serving areas were spotlessly clean. Our waitress was attentive and friendly. 
I'll try one of these places again.Delicious meal, great service, inviting atmosphere.

Waited too long to write this, don't remember the menu item I had, but it was delicious.

Would definitely return.These guys rock. I needed to get a new fan motor for my heatpump and they checked around and got me a good price on one. When I showed up to pay for it, one of them actually drove to the place they were ordering it from and picked it up for me so I could have it that day. They were also offering to give me a free capacitor for it, but it wasn't necessary.

Only negatives: I waited a full week after telling them to go ahead and order it because they never mentioned that I'd have to pay up-front. Simple miscommunication.

NOTE: their hours on Yelp are not currently accurate; they close at 4:30pm.I had to work on my birthday today... how frustrating is that?!  

Luckily, I have a fun job and my work today was manning the Yelp booth at the Sunnyslope Fall Festival, so it wasn't so bad.  It was a beautiful day afterall!  And to make it even better, Christina P remembered my birthday and brought me some treats from Karl's!

I'd never heard of Karl's before, but I may have to make a special trip next time I am craving some baked goods.  Inside the cute pink box from Christina were several really pretty cookies shaped like leaves and a turkey with the colors of autumn - they were so beautiful I didn't want to eat them, but I did... and they were yummy!  Also inside the pretty pink box was the best apple pastry I've tasted in a long time!  It was doughy and sweet and delicious!  There was a brownie but I gave that away even though it also looked pretty amazing.

Thank goodness calories don't count on your birthday, right?

Thanks again for the yummy birthday treats, Christina, and more importantly, thanks for introducing me to Karl's!I had to mail my books back to school and the service was amazing. They got my shipping label printed and all I had to buy was a $2 package. I've come here on several occasions for copies, printing, etc. and enjoy the well kept facility. Right off the access road and easy parking. Great place to get all my shipping and printing needs taken care.I've never had a problem at this Wendy's. It is one of the few drive-thrus that don't screw up the order. 

Food is always fresh and hot. Those pretzel-bun bacon burgers are mighty tasty, in case you were wondering.It gets 4 stars because it is Waffle House....

and we don't have them in Cali...


However my Brother would disagree and I have plenty of friends that call it Awful House.....

one down side on this location....come on guys mop the damn floor...kind of gross...

Was a cutie seating near me at the counter....

I got my Waffle House fix....cheese egg special for me

Cheap as Hell...wish we had them in CaliI get made fun of at work for having brought a couple of my coworkers here in the past. I convinced them to go because I had a coupon and we'd all save a few bucks compared to Sweet Tomato. I've never gotten them to come back. Something about the lettuce looking wilted and the vinyl being cracked in the booths and the carpet being threadbare. Well - that was two years ago and they've updated the interior!

Personally, I think it's pretty awesome that you pay $5.55 with a coupon and get the same amount of food as ST. Now, the ambiance isn't quite as nice and the outside of the building is funky, but for salad, it's great. I get the takeout salad for $3.99. Yes, I said $3.99 which is $4.34 with tax!! You can't beat that! And, if you do it right, you can shove like 2 pounds of salad into that little bowl (you just have to squish the edges until the top pops on). They also give you a little baggie for fruit and such. It's great.My family and I frequented Golden Greek at least once weekly growing up, though I hadn't been in at least 5-8 years, until last night.

It's EXACTLY how it was 10 years ago. It's a dive, neighborhood hole in the wall. Small, quiet restaurant, with basic and tasty Greek and Italian food. I had the Pasta Napoli last night and it was tasty, as were the spanikopitas and the garlic bread. Our hummus was very watery and chunky... would not order again. 

The people who run the place, and have ran it forever, are completely indifferent. They slam glasses and plates on your table, say "what do you want?" and tell you "good customers get their own to go boxes." It's not that they are unfriendly, but they just have a different way about them. You're in the restaurant and they treat you as they would family or friends, rather than kissing your ass for being in their place. I like that charm a little bit. 

I don't think anything here is really home-made, rather they are just putting together ingredients they have warmed up, but it is good!

And CHEAP!If I could go here everyday, I would and I would also be 500 pounds. It is soooo delicious. The salsa is good, the chips are better, the taco dish (I think it was called "Six Halves") was pretty freeking yumm and the side salad that came with it, wow. 

The prices were reasonable. They have beer,wine and margaritas. The only thing I'd suggest is faster mamacitas (the service was slow).So, during December my computer died not once, but twice!  The hard drive went out on it, and after trying to get it fixed by a friend, I finally accepted that it was toast.  I wasn't really prepared for this to happen, as I had anticipated it lasting another year before replacing it.  But, such is life, and I guess it was time for the computer to go.

Mind you, I've never made a major purchase from Fry's electronics. I've been here in the past  for smaller purchases, but nothing more then here and there. Being that I was in the market again for a computer, and since things have changed since I last purchased a computer several years ago, I needed to refresh myself with what was out there.  (not just computer wise, but even the retail landscape has changed dramatically as well.)

I did some shopping around at Costco, Best Buy, and after a friend accompanied me here, I decided that Fry's had the selection and price that I was looking for.  I came in for my purchase on Wednesday night, because their New Years sale was ending. I was down to two computers that I had my eye on, and figured it was time to purchase before the sale ended.

The guy who helped me was awesome.  Total tech guy who totally new his stuff.  I was impressed with his knowledge. I showed him the two models that I wanted, and asked him which one would be better for me.  After explaining the differences, he said that either model will do me fine for a laptop, and that the $50 price difference was really up to me. He said that the cheaper model was the way to go, and that for $50 LESS I was not going to see a major speed difference for what I was getting.

He went back and grabbed the computer and had it at the register after I finished wandering the store.  He also told me that if I purchased Microsoft I could get it for $89 instead of the $120 that it would cost me if I waited until the 60 days ran out and they charge you. I said that I'm not a huge word user, and would pass.  

He was really educated and filled in a LOT of blanks for me that I couldn't have filled in myself.  I had a really positive experience here, and I feel like Fry's is the new Best Buy for me.  Plus, even though Costco has great prices, your on your own with buying and hoping its every thing you need. Plus, I've found that they rotate stock a lot at Costco and what you see today may not be there in a month. (trust me, I tried. The computer I had my eye on in early December there is not for sale through them anymore.  They rotated and put out an entirely different stock when I went back to purchase around New Years.

Even tho Costco seems to have a better warranty and tech support offer on their computers then Fry's, their stock rotates to fast and if you don't buy it within a short window of time, you may not get the make and model that you want.

Overall, had a great experience here and I would make another computer purchase from Fry's again.Chop suey is my go-to here. Recently tried the "House Special" version and was really, really happy with both the size and number of shrimp included, along with at least 2 meat ingredients and a few snow peas, plus veggies of course. Try it.  Service here has always been pleasant, to friendly.Good beer, wings and pizza. A lot of tvs.  Waitress was attentive and prompt. Definitely found bada$$ sports bar.Great food, great service, LOVE the atmosphere with all the televisions.  The ONLY negative I dock it for is that they could definitely have better specials...which costs them a star, but everything else is great and we will definitely be back.Yes the Baker wee! I do love their breakfast sandwiches and coffee! If you are in the area go get a croissant sandwich with ham and cheese. Man o boy is it good! Plus Their name is funny! 

Great B-day cakes and stuff like that too!I've never been here, but my coworkers keep bringing this stuff into the office. It's great stuff! The cookies aren't too soft or too hard, and packed with flavor. The brownies...oh my, they're the best brownies I've ever had! They're so dense and full of cocoa, and the frosting on top augments the flavor without adding too much sugar.

And that's what I like about this place the most...I love baked goods, but a lot of them are too sweet for my taste. Baker Wee seems to focus on a quality product that tastes just as delicious as it looks.Great Location,   Great Food,  Great Service    One of our favoritesVery, VERY good Italian! The decor is romantic, I would say it's a good date spot. My husband and I took my mom and sister there moments after we told her I was pregnant so again... so alcohol sampling for me, I promise to go back and update this at a later time. We had the calamari appetizer which was actually very good seeing as how AZ so rarely gets anything fresh. We all ordered and we all enjoyed so much that we had to share. The husband and I shared the Tirimisu for dessert while my sister ordered the Chocolate Souffle. Our Tirimisu was divine and the Souffle was just OK. Definitely recommend this place! It's even rather quiet and surprisingly not as busy as I would imagine with the quality of food.I rented a 3/4 cello for my son over the summer.  They had the best price.  The cello was old and really bad looking.  We did take it back for repairs because woofing and other vibrations.  The luthier did a fantastic job and that ugly cello made beautiful music.  Oh, they also gave us a free loaner cello. When we returned it after 2 months because he was now big enough for his full size cello that we already owned, they gave us no hassle.  This is a great music shop to do business with.Whenever I drag friends along to return to my Arizona roots, I take them to Elmer's.

The strips are out of this world. If you haven't had them, imagine chips topped with shredded (not melted) cheeses. Plop on some hot sauce (conveniently offered in ketchup bottles for maximum squeezage) for a heavenly combo.

I highly recommend the mini chimichangas with a huge soda.

Oh, and park around the back.PREPARE TO WAIT!!!!  i'm not gonna lie-the service is great and the breakfast is really good too-i usually make my own omlett but have also had the salmon lox on a bagel w cream cheese, their yogurt and granola w berries, pancakes...Basically i've had a l lot of food there! haha.  The only thing is that it's never anything SUPER SPECIAL to have that kind of a wait.  Most of the time i drive by to see if it's packed or not-if i wanna go in, and 8/10 times its a line out the door.  

But i will say this-it's super consistent.  i've never had a bad order or anything like that and it is reasonably priced as well-so if you don't mind waiting for breakfast-give it a try!This was my first time at Scottsdale Stadium and I loved it! It definitely had the vibe of AT&T Park in the sense that you could really feel the excitement from fans and it definitely felt like home, only it was about 20 degrees warmer ;)

It definitely has a great location as it is in downtown Scottsdale, making it easy to get to whether you are driving or taking a shuttle in. 

We had lawn seats and at $30/each they were pretty pricey and this is the only reason why Scottsdale Stadium isn't getting 5 STARS. We got there just when the game started and struggled to find a good spot but eventually did. I highly recommend getting there earlier so you can snag a good spot. I liked that there were trees scattered in the lawn area so you could get some shade. Bring a blanket!

As far as food goes, there were tons of options. The boyfriend and I both got the Island Noodles and loved them! I liked that Bay Area beers like Anchor Steam and Sierra Nevada were offered - made it feel like we were at home. All vendors are CASH ONLY and ATM's are provided but with a service fee.

I really liked Scottsdale Stadium and had a great time - it felt like we were at home, fans were great, and everything offered was awesome. Plus, the Giants beat the A's and who could complain about that? ;) I can't wait for the 2012 season to start!This place is definitely 5-star quality food, but simply slow service. Expect to wait a while before you sit, and then wait a long time before your food comes. Breakfast on the weekend will be about a 2 hour ordeal.  

Having said that - the food is fantastic, all sauces are homemade daily. Everything is fresh, large portions. Their bloody marys and mimosas are excellent. I'm partial to choosing "Green Flannel" for breakfast, and without a doubt you must get "The Rustler" for the single best lunch sandwich in the history of lunch sandwiches.

I have brought every out of town visitor there for several years and they always say "that's the best sandwich I've ever had". So - go give it a try. If you don't want the Rustler, try the Bitchin' Chicken. 

I've never been there in the evening, but I intend on going for microbrews and live music sometime soon.Great Monkey Pancakes!.......... huge.
Great Breakfast Sandwich!

REALLY friendly people at this place. Our server was great. The busboy was super polite, friendly and talkative. 

Food took forever to get to us...... but since everyone was so nice and the food was so good........ it was worth the wait!I was impressed by the quality.  It was more than i expected.The place has a nice atmosphere, inside and outside seating. One draw: no beer on tap. We tried the babaghanouj with the pita bread as an appetizer and it was good
But nothing crazy. Service is really slow so expect to wait a good 20 min for your food, but the wait is worth it. I had the combo plate that has beef and chicken kabob
And kafta with rice and it was delicious. It is also open until 2 am including the kitchen so it's perfect for a late dinner when other places are already closed. Overall great experience.I really expected this place to be a lot more crowded on a friday night. Much to my surprise (and delight), there was room to move!

Great staff, 2 bars, decent prices, good drinks (STrong), good times!

This place is so wrong, its right!Overall good experience. I was disappointed that after I had called ahead and reserved a trailer for my specific vehicle model that they never asked if I had electrical ready for the trailer lights. However, they did install a wiring kit for me the next day for $100. It cost me a day, but they were professional and helpful.Was up all night with some sort of tummy bug. Finally at 3am I couldn't stand it a second longer. Uhg!  Try finding a place that sells Pepto, in Scottsdale, open past 10pm.. good luck. Fortunately this is the only Walgreen's even remotely close to where I live that's open 24 hours a day. 

Let me warn you though, at 3am there are loads of freaky people! So, keep to yourself, get what you need and get out.This is our local pharmacy of choice.  They usually have what we're looking for, and the pharmacy's turnaround times are consistently quick.Arcadia Farms reminds me of Lifetime: TV for Women (and gay men).  On any given Saturday afternoon, it's fun to place bets on how many bridal and baby showers will be going on simultaneously.  This place puts out a siren song for the ladies who lunch.  As a result, the people watching is top-notch.  It's often like having an episode of "The Real Housewives of North Scottsdale/Paradise Valley" unfold at the table next to you.  Arcadia Farms is like a shrine to estrogen and it's rare for the BF and me to see more than another man or two in the place, but we don't mind.  The floor show is free, after all.  And if you want the valet to park your car in front of the restaurant, be sure to bring the Bentley.

The decor is one step removed from shabby chic.  It's feminine, but they got rid of most of the frills a few years back.  If the weather is accommodating, the back patio is the place to be.  It's really a lovely setting under the trees.  The small building at the back of the restaurant is usually reserved for the aforementioned bridal and baby showers.  

The food at Arcadia Farms is very good.  Don't go expecting gourmet dishes; it's important to remember that at its heart Arcadia Farms is a catering company.  Actually, the BF and I have Arcadia Farms cater our annual holiday party and they do a fantastic job.  

For appetizers, the Savory Smoked Salmon Cheesecake is delicious.  The portion used to be way too huge, but now it's been scaled back to a very manageable size as a starter for at least two people to share.  The Crab and Avocado Tower is also a good option, but the tower invariably collapses before it arrives at the table.  The BF and I usually start off by splitting an entree, the Wild Mushroom, Spinach and Goat Cheese Tart.  It is packed with cheesy goodness and comes with a side salad that creates nice contrast.  It splits into a hearty appetizer.  It was a dark day when spinach was pulled from the market and Arcadia Farms couldn't make this tart.  Thankfully, all is right with the world again.

For entrees, the Strawberry Chicken Salad is a classic for good reason.  Where Arcadia Farms manages to find such ripe strawberries year-round remains a mystery to me.  The Oriental Chicken Salad is also delicious.  Whenever I order this dish, I go for the gusto and request an extra side of the peanut sauce as the chicken pieces are luscious when dipped directly into the peanut sauce.  The California Club is a solid sandwich choice.  For me, the focaccia bread is too thick, but you can ask them to substitute another bread.  For something more substantial (and sinful), go for the Chicken, Wild Mushroom and Leek Crepes.  They're fantastic.  This dish also splits well.

Everything on the Arcadia Farms menu is fresh and tasty.  The challenge will be deciding what to order on a given day.  Ask if they have specials as they can be good.  On a recent visit the server went through a very lengthy description of a special salad and then she casually mentioned that they had already run out of it.  The BF and I found that rather amusing.

The signature Arcadia Farms beverage is apricot iced tea and it's quite flavorful.  The one nit is that they don't serve the tea with a straw or an iced tea spoon.  There are no spoons at the table and it's hard to catch your server's attention because they're busy moving from table to table.  So you are forced to stir your iced tea with the blade of your table knife.  The BF and I have talked about this several times while dining at Arcadia Farms and I think one of the servers overheard us the last time because they finally brought our iced tea with spoons.  Perhaps that will be a permanent change as it would certainly be welcome.  Beer and wine are also offered, with the expected restaurant markup.  

In terms of pricing, you get a good amount of food for the price.  For a fancy brunch/lunch spot, the pricing is fair.  This place isn't in the cheap eats category, but you could get out of here for $20 per person if you only had a salad or sandwich.  But what's the fun in that?

The desserts at Arcadia Farms are pretty good, but the BF and I never have room for them.  The carrot "baby cake" is tasty, but it's big enough that you will need to split it with at least one other person.

Arcadia Farms also offers private luncheons and afternoon tea.  This is really an ideal spot for a bridal or baby shower.Arcadia Farms is a lovely place to take moms and girlfriends for a super cute brunch in Phoenix's amazing January weather.

The restaurant has ample seating, both indoor and outdoor, but it might be a good idea to make reservations as it seemed pretty busy on a Friday afternoon...I can only imagine the weekends!

I had the mediterranean melt, which was an assortment of grilled veggies and melted mozzarella sandwiched in between pesto and ciabatta bread with a side of spring greens. I'm typically not a big fan of ciabatta, but in this situation, it complemented the veggies very well. My girlfriend got the chicken quesadilla, which was probably the fanciest queso I've ever seen in my life. Both were plated nicely and tasted as fresh and good as it looked.

Yes, it is on the more pricey side, as each entree ranges from $12-20 but I'd come here again considering the options for cute brunch joints are disappointingly miniscule.I was suprised...how good the food was...really a simple buffet Chicken Parm...but great flavor and moist chicken...how hard it that...Anyway the venue itself is funky...long a narrow, so with the event being at the head of the room...hard to feel the buzz of the show...but not too bad...the real issue where the drinks, the bartender trying to pull-off well vodka as grey goose...shame on you!  Overall fun night.Wanted: A dress fit for a senorita. Maracas that can liven up a room. Sombreros, because what fiesta doesn't have sombreros? And finally a pinata. Could Old Town possibly have a store full of all these fiesta essentials? Amigos, the answer is Si. 

I waited years for the excuse to shop at Mexican Import. I would pass by on the way to spring training games, the farmers market or Sunday brunch and I always wondered, "will I ever have a need for any of the items in that store?" It's full of authentic and fun from the land of tequila and sun but the items are not necessarily ones you "need." That is, until I saw a fiesta on the horizon and when I did...I realized that my time had finally come. 

Mexican Import has pretty much any knick knack you can imagine for a reasonable price. Sombreros (both authentic and costume), fiesta attire, pinatas, shot glasses, ceramics galore, puppets, blankets, maracas (large and small), rattlesnake gum (not as scary as it sounds), cowboy hats, desert post cards and anything else you need with southwestern flare. It's a store that you wish existed for that one off chance you need a sombrero hat on the fly. Even if you aren't in the market for something they carry, this is still a pretty classic store to browse on a weekend afternoon. When you walk inside, it's like you've left Arizona and entered a small shop in the heart of Mexico. 

So yelp friends, the next time you need a taste of authentic Mexico, look not further than Mexican Import.I had the "blue room" all to myself for lunch on Saturday.  Nice and peaceful watching the  salt water fish being fed fish pellets.  No sharks just little fish chasing around and trying to eat quickly.

I wanted something light so ordered the chicken tostado ala carte with quacamole.  A pleasant surprise with large chunks of hot white chicken, chopped lettuce and just a few beans, tomato and cheese. on a crisp corn tortilla. The quac came on the side so I could add as necessary.

The tostada with a glass of Dos Equis came to $11.01 and that included a basket of chips and two sauces.  The tostado was a healthy alternative plus I didn't cave in for many chips.Great venue, with an atmosphere that is low key. Good place to unwind and have some wine. Nice on the wallet. very unique music talent. You can get flights of wine and try a variety of the large variety's they have.Great live music and wonderful atmoshpere to enjoy.I have been to Cowboy Ciao several times for lunch and dinner and I just realized that I have never written a review for them!  A must have is the Stetson salad; I love this salad!  I doubt it is very healthy though, but if I wanted healthy I would just stay home and cook for myself.  After having the Stetson salad every single time we come in, my husband recently decided to change it up and order his own salad.  He tried the testosterone salad and loved it.  Definitely a man salad; extremely hardy.  
They do change their menu quite often so if you love something, go much back as much as possible while they still have it.  I love their pork belly dishes!It's been my intention to have dinner here again (we visited many years ago) but alas, it still hasn't happened.  We did a culinary food tour in Scottsdale and this was one of the stops.  We were served their famous chopped salad and it was tasty.  Delicious drinks too!The Fork That Roared.

For some reason, maybe due to the name, I thought this restaurant would be just a step above a Chili's or a TGIF--that is to say, a chain restaurant. I should have known better, however, since Lynn W. selected RF for her birthday dinner--and she has excellent taste.

The basket of assorted breads was a fantastic way to start the meal. And the seared scallop appetizer was worthy of a good old-fashioned plate licking--but I abstained. When my pork tenderloin arrived my stomach jumped in anticipation. The tenderloin stretched the breadth of my plate, anchored by a dollop of cheesy grits, and topped with grilled corn and a wonderful sweetly tart sauce. The pork was very tender and cooked until it was rosy in the middle, as I had requested. I never order pork in restaurants because I'm always afraid it will be dry. But after eating each delicious bite of this tenderloin, I will certainly start ordering more pork.

I skipped dessert because I was so full. Instead I sat and marveled at how good the food is at Roaring Fork and took in my surroundings. The ambiance confused me a little, I'll admit, as I couldn't tell if it was supposed to be a fine dining restaurant or something more casual. Regardless, everything I ate was delicious, and everyone in our party agreed. I would definitely recommend this restaurant and will happily eat here again.

Plus there's the bonus of being able to play with the branding iron in front of the rotisserie in the entryway when it's late and nobody's watching. ;)

Rawr.I had the ribs they were great.  The beer selection needs work.  I do not understand why places like this have Bud Light on the menu.  There should be a lot more craft beers on the menu.Good happy hour.  We ordered almost all the dishes on the appetizer menu and they were great.  Notably, the queso con puerco is delicious!  I also like the pork wings.  Chicken on flat bread is good, as is guacamole.  

You cannot beat $5 drinks - several good spirit drinks and wine, too.  I had two mojitos and they were fine.

We sat on the patio and it was very pleasant.  The bill for two drinks and two appetizers was $28 before tip.

I recommend this happy hour.just a tad pricey i thought for Thai food, but the portions were more than enough to share with many....loved the soup, wish i remembered the name!I LOVE the House of Rice! Unfortunately, I heard they no longer offer cooking classes, but these were the best cooking classes ever. Even without the cooking classes, this is still a great store for all your Asian food needs. Before the 99 Ranch in Phoenix opened, this was one of the few places in the area to get any of these ingredients. Unlike 99 Ranch, though, at House of Rice they carry only the best ingredients and the best brands, so even in a small store like this you have just as much selection. Everything is carefully and thoughtfully packaged, and many of the ingredients come with instructions if you need them, as well as some free recipes. In their refrigerator/freezer section, they have a good selection of veggies and meats, as well as a variety of pre-prepared items (dumplings, spring rolls, egg rolls, etc.), which are made there at the House of Rice. They also have a great selection of Japanese knives, as well as woks and many other cooking utensils. They also have a bunch of non-food pseudo-kitchy Asian products, which they also sell on their website, http://www.houserice.com. Anytime we're in Scottsdale we always make a stop here.Such cheap drinks! Its a great place to start with your friends before you hit the clubs. Its also good for big groups to pregame at.A rather large location for a Dillard's store and it has a ton to offer in all that space. It was very clean and well stocked.  We did have to search for a staff person to check out our purchase, but the options are there and they are organized in an easy to look through fashion.

This anchor store definitely outsizes and out offers some of the others in the mall.  I recommend stopping in if you have the time just so you can see all the things they pack into this one!

Overall: A
A definite must stop in for this mall.Thanks Groupon and yelp for introducing me to this place. I probably wouldn't have tried it if there hadn't been a Groupon, and probably wouldn't have bought the Groupon without reading the good reviews on Yelp. This place is pretty hidden so you most likely wouldn't find it unless you were looking specifically for it. I love Indian food, though there aren't a whole lot of options for it in the area, especially in Old Town. The first time I went there was an office Christmas party going on so we went and got some beers at OTT first and then came back and even though they were still pretty busy they were accommodating. Both times we got the kabobs as an appetizer and split the Chicken Tikka Masala and both were really good. One entree is enough for two people to split for sure. The garlic naan is also the bomb and last time we were there we got some mango ice cream for dessert and it was really good. Haven't been disappointed by anything there thus far. They have a patio and an inside area which is cool because I love patios and I also like options. If you want to get in and get out go around 6pm otherwise it will get pretty crowded. Also, they give you some stuff to munch on when you first sit down, which is always a plus in my book.One word here - Burgers

The open faced green chile burger is supernaturally good.  I think I'm possessed by a green chile demon from eating it.  

The Patty Melt is uberbomb too.  

I haven't ventured far from the burgers, but I know the Chile Rellenos are solid as is the Blue Corn Enchiladas.Very interesting and authentic NM food.  Lots of different places to be seated.  The Habanero burger was great and as hot and spicy as promised!  I also tried the burrito - it was good but the green chile seemed more like Bueno's (hence the 4 stars).  Will definitely be there again!WOW!  It was awesome. Peppers suffer with dungeness crab.Came here with a group of 10, and it took a while for them to seat us even though the restaurant was "empty" in my opinion. But other than that, the food was good, the waiter was attentive, and no one had a complaint.Great little sports bar just a couple blocks away. Large patio, lots of TV's. The pool and shuffleboard tables are a bit of a squeeze. The happy hour and reverse happy hour are very good and for can be a hit or miss. Usually the waitress will tell you if you as if something is good or not.... with an honest answer. This is a growing local chain and I've been to 3 of the locations which seem to be consistant.So I left Arizaona a few months ago and forgot to write a review of my favorite restaurant.   We take all our friend who come in from out of town here, especially any Sports fans.   The food is as good as any high end Steak House that we've been to throughout the country.  The sports memorabilia is amazing, we've recently moved to AZ and have gone here a half dozen times and still haven't seen everything that Don has collected over the years.   For a good time this is a great place to enjoy your favorite piece of beef.Really good barbeque and steaks in an old school setting decorated with baseball memorabilia. The service was tight also which is always a big plus. The food is definitely artery clogging, so i'd reccomend it only once-in-awhile. 

They have some great price points in here modest wine list. Oaky cabernet sauvignon for beef and go for a zinfandel for the barbeque. For the prices, you can't go wrong!When we were getting ready for our trip to Arizona I got on Yelp to stake out the best Sushi places in the area. Kyoto seemed to have some of the best reviews, so we decided to check it out. We got there just in time, they close at 2pm for lunch and open back up for dinner later in the day. 
The salmon was fantastic. The unagi was fantastic. the rolls were nothing spectacular, in fact, a little dry. But, all in all, a quality sushi place. The prices were reasonable, about what you'd expect to pay for decent sushi.
What I want to know is this: Is there a good "all-you-can-eat" sushi place anywhere in Phoenix or the surrounding burbs?I have been coming to Brioni's for years.  Since I moved out of the area I have not been here in a long time.  On my birthday a large group of us were planning on going out to dinner but did not decide on a place until the last minute.  Of course they could not take a party of 8... what was I thinking.  Anyway we came to the decision of Pasta Brioni so I gave them a call and they were very accommodating.  Within 15 minutes of getting there we were sat.  Our server was great and very knowledgeable.  The food was as good as I remember.  I will always be a customer of Pasta Brioni.Great Pizza.  They filter their water in a way to make it taste like New York water.  This makes the pizza dough taste like pizza dough from Brooklyn. 

Skip the anti pasto (olives are terribly salty and Salami is poor qualtiy)  and the caprese salad (tomatoes are nasty).  Focus on the PizzaGreat little outdoor courtyard to eat a good salad and pizza during the cool months.Had a wonderful dinner with my daughter here tonight. Great service by very professional and accommodating wait staff. Soup was delicious as was my chicken parm...so huge, I couldn't finish it. Yay! I get lunch tomorrow!  

Brandon was our server. I totally felt catered too. Not cheap, but well,worth it 

Loved the atmosphere and the funny owner. He wasn't bad at all. Relax people, it takes all kinds to spin this great  world. He was funny and sccommodating.My husband, two year son and I just started going here and really like it. They have cheap happy hour appetizers but do not reduce the portions,. Their wings are huge! The staff has always been friendly and the service very decent. The menu offers your usual American food but, again, the portions are larger than a lot of other place. We want to come for karaoke but need a babysitter. One of these days....Check it out.I came here with a group of hungry guys after the Jackson Barrett car show. Throwing down the booze, eating a ton of food and chatting the night away. They've got a great selection of liquor and that includes my Malibu. Thank you!!

We got a corner booth on a Saturday night (9ish) with no reservation... although we did have to wait about 20 minutes for whatever reason. 

Started with the obligatory cornbread. Ya. It's good... and really filling especially when you order a slab of meat for the entree. They know how to cook a medium rare which is always good in my book. 

Decor is dark and old Hollywood with a modern flair. Kind of like you are having some clandestine affair-type meeting place. I dig it!My first time at Razz last night with a group of 25. They really brought their "A" game to service us. I'm told that they are always busy...even on a Tuesday night. Hate going to a restaurant and it's 1/4 full. Scares me. This place was hoping and we added to it. 

The space is done just about right...contemporary and not pretentious. We had plenty of choice on entree's (not the whole menu) and with 25 people in our group...I think I saw the bulk of the menu. I had the Bouillabaisse and guest to the right had the halibut and to the left had the short ribs. Immpressive portion was my first immpression on my dish and others as well. The broth was light, not chunky and heavy, perfect consistency as this is a soup and not a stew necessarily. Well, it was cooked perfectly and seasoned well- flavors were subtle, no one flavor overpowered the soup, and the tomato base was light. I like a little more wine flavor coming through but was not disappointed. I wish I knew how to give a half star here because Razz is not at a 5 but it could get 4 stars here. 

Oops....salad, very imaginative, and combined 8 or 9 ingredients and again, the portion was very immpressive. They have a long life in the restaurant business, get there and enjoy.That crazy St. Francis ~ Dr Doolittle of the Catholic church.

I'm pretty much a-religious, but seeing the Blessing of the Animals and Adoptathon event posted, and knowing that the Franciscans are the mellow cool hippies they are, I felt like this would be a great day, and it was.

The grounds are beautiful, but I didn't set foot indoors.  Francis wouldn't have been indoors, either though!  He'd be out with all the dogs, cats, and even rats waiting to be adopted into loving homes.  

Lots of rescue orgs, breed-specific or not, were there with some wonderful and gorgeous animals.  I'm glad to see so many actually went home with folks that day.

The best part was the sign above the area where they did the pet blessings, that was not even put up specifically for this event, but is simply a regular fixture on the front of an outdoor gazebo, which says: "All God's Creatures Are Great."There is such a thing as "Grilled Meatloaf". And everyone should experience this wonder.

It's not my mother's meatloaf. (Shh! Sorry Mom. This is better. I'm really very sorry.)

Tucked on a corner of the The Shops at Gainey Village is a quaint little restaurant, complete with an outdoor patio. 

Alas, the patio and I were not properly introduced as the super comfortable looking loungers and tables were already scooped up. Instead, my friends and I were greeted like friends at the bar and found three (count 'em, three) stools right in a row waiting for us.

I don't know if the patio is always this super busy, as this was the 1st Thursday of the month. There's music 1st Thursdays (until March of 2014) in the center area of the shopping area with different live bands.  I do know that reservations are not taken for the patio area. It's first come, first serve! So hurry kids, hurry! Those seats look mahhvelous.

Given how delish the food was I can understand why. Hoh Boy.

Our group took the hearty advice of Rick, a super bomb diggity bartender, and went with the "hot crab dip". The serving size is large and plenty for a group of three. If I were to attempt this at home I'd perhaps throw in a hint more spice. (Maybe a touch of celery.) But really, this gal was sassy pants happy scooping away at the dip. The provided copious amounts of toast to enjoy the dip which was rather nice.

My friends shared a Cobb Salad. I had to laugh at them. The serving size was gigantic. HUGE. I turned away the opportunity to sample what looked like a wonderful salad. 

I was being single minded in my determination to eat AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE of my meat loaf. (My friends said the Cobb was very much to their liking. They eat out quite a bit, so I take their word for it.)

Grilling meatloaf put a new spin on it for me. Ok, fine. The menu does say "Family Specialty". I was majorly bummed this morning when I remembered my left-overs where not, in fact, in my apartment. They were sacrificed in the name of car pooling.

Yes, that happened. My heavenly grilled meat loaf was sent off to a better life. And I did not get to enjoy left-overs today.

I will go back to the Village Tavern and eat this again.

Thank you Rick the Bartender for a *great* recommendation! 
(Also, you were a wonderful server!)

Oh! And the house red is a new friend of mine. (Five bucks!) 

Can't go wrong here.

UPDATE! UPDATE!
I sat on the patio! No wonder this spot is hard to come by. Very large area with super fine seating. Comfy. So comfy no one wants to get up :) 

This time my visit was during a Sunday brunch slot. Boy! No joke. 11:30 is a popular time. We were super lucky and scored the last table. On a Saturday, I doubt this would ever happen. (I heard men dragging their families inside with, "NO. We have to sit inside so I can watch "the" game." Yay for me! I mean, us. There was a group of us :)Consistently great service. Pretty standard food quality for a high end chain. Have really enjoyed this location both when busy and quiet.  Cocktails aren't particularly exciting or strong, but a great wine selection makes up for it.  Best way to describe the experience, 'consistent'.My wife and I have been to Lon's many times, but last night was an unusual experience. On a very busy night, they couldn't find our reservation, booked on their own website which uses OpenTable. This made for an awkward start to the evening (I was pretty irritated). They then spent the next two hours trying to make it up to us by seating us next to the fireplace, comping my first glass of wine, and by providing outstanding service and excellent food. Not to mention apologizing at every opportunity. They really made us feel like they valued our business.  I think it's fair to say I forgive them. Oh, and when you book, ask for one of Dolores' tables - you'll see why.Boy was not as impressed as I but I thought it was good and worth mentioning. 

We went for restaurant week, which I have learned can either be good or bad. (During one restaurant week several years ago I was served overcooked chicken on what could only have been canned peas and corn-we never went back for the regular menu) I was impressed by Lon's.

Ambiance: Excellent although next time we will request a patio seat. If it isn't 100 degrees outside, I suggest you do the same. 

Staff was excellent. Our server was introduced to us as "Frenchie." We immediately found out why. She was thorough and thoughtful with her recommendations.

Food: Now here is where it gets complicated. I had the chilled pea soup and I thought it was really great. Flavor was good, ingredients and style were all appropriate for the weather. The roasted chicken was my next course and  thought this was great too. Overall, excellent food until I tried the boy's calamari- not so much. I know many people appreciate large portions but the law of diminishing returns applies to one's appetite as well. The calamari was large, deep fried and piled high. Bloated and uncomfortable after consuming large quantities of fried food, he wasn't even slightly hungry after he finished the first course. Now, I know, he could have stopped eating the on his own. I agree. he made a personal choice to eat the fried but I think there has to be some portion planning on the chef's part as well or at least a warning "Caution: you will not be interested in any other food item after consumption of the calamari". Needless to say he was not impressed at all with his second course, the hanger steak. 

Wine: lots of options- very pleased.So this place has a drive up window, Mike greets you by name, they offer next day service and oh, your clothes are done right!Flat iron steak was darn good at a nice price. Only reason it isn't a 5 is because the beer selection stinks and the saloon was dead.I found this place by surprise. My Bf and I wanted a nice romantic dinner and did not want the usually Italian restaurants so we landed here. Its a nice, huge place with dim lighting and very cozy ambiance. When we walked-in it was crowded, but we were immediately seated and served with pita break and a plate of onions, butter and cilantro (we are still at mystery with the whole concept of a big onion cut down the middle). For appis we just got hummus and that was amazing. For dinner, I had the chicken shish and it was to die for. My bf, since he's a vegetarian, got vegetarian kabob and he was disappointed. However, he enjoyed the hummus and the rice and pita bread. The drink menu was pretty legit. I had a Champagne Cosmo and it was absolutely amazing. If you are a meat eater you will love this place!

The only down to this place was that the service was pretty bad. Our server disappeared for most of the night. She took our order soon, but barely came back during the whole meal to check if we needed something and I usually need something. Other than that, it was great.Yum!!
I love Frasher's. I love that there has always been speculation amongst my friends as to how to pronounce it. (it's not rocket science people) I love that the place is often full of strippers (who doesn't like strippers) and I love love love the food. 

They used to have this shrimp salad that was amazing. I haven't seen it on the menu for quite some time but every time I went I ordered this salad. This was back in my pseudo vegetarian days when the only meat I consumed was of the fish/ shellfish variety. Now that I'm fully obsessed with suicide by red meat I opt for the Filet. The Toasted Ravioli and Stuffed Mushroom Caps are also a favorite, especially if I'm more there to get my buzz on than eat a full meal. 

All in all I've had nothing but good experiences at Frasher's. Even if my meal didn't come with a lap dance... I can always just run across the street for that nonsense. 

P.S. Bring back the shrimp salad.Gotta say, I usually only order pancakes at Denny's and they usually are solid each time. Several times though, I did order a burger in a Vegas Denny's and it was actually hand formed and that was good too. Here at 9am today and can't say anything bad. Dining companion had a big omlette that was well cooked and served with english muffin and hash browns - she said it was good. I wasn't that hungry and went with a short stack of three buttermilk pancakes with fresh sliced bannas on to for $4.50. Waiter refilled my coffee three times and was pleasant and there was also some regular's there that the servers knew by name (I hope I don't become one of them), but it was a nice touch. Menu is now huge and Grand Slam was on special for 5 bucks. Seats in the booth are well worn, so slide your butt to the end of the booth and you should be fine. Not as crowded (half full) as you would expect, but a goiod start to the day and coffee was hot and hit the spot.I've been going to Defalco's for over 5 years, and I've never been disappointed.  The place feels a lot like a typical neighborhood Italian grocery and I like that.  The food I've ordered has always been delicious (and I say that, having ordered nearly every sandwich on the menu) and it's always made in a reasonable amount of time.  They're not "fast" and they're not overly friendly or warm, but that's okay.  I usually don't stay there to eat anyway; I usually take my food to go!Guy Fieri never steers you in the wrong direction...

We went here this particular afternoon after watching a previous episode of Triple D and since we were in the Phoenix Metro area we just had to try it out! When you walk into this place it look like a little mom and pops grocery store but when you get to the back where the deli is its like a slice of heaven back there. They have this huge menu that you can choose from with pastas, pizza, cold and warm sandwiches, and desserts to die for. 

We ended up ordering the Veggie lasagne and the Pizza Bianca. I let my fiance decide as I know she is a little more pickier than I am when it comes to Italian or I would of ordered Spaghetti and Meatballs and a sandwich filled with lots of goodies and finished off with a side of heartburn! The Lasagne was excellent. The veggies were fresh and crunchy. The sauce definitely compliments the dish very well and the pasta I think is even fresh! The pizza bianca is basically a margherita without the sauce and Ricotta cheese. The ricotta is so fresh you can definitely distinguish the freshness of it the crust is nice and crunchy and the fresh basil tickles your taste buds as you take each bite of your pizza. 

What stole the meal was the desserts we ordered. Their chocolate covered Cannoli's are simply amazing and the Tiramisu there, words cannot describe how wonderful it was. I've had some really good Tiramisu over the years and I will say this was the best I've had in my entire life. The ladyfingers were spongy, the marscapone was so good you just couldn't stop and the balance and layers of flavor left you only wanting more. Unfortunately, we stored the Tiramisu overnight at our hotel in Tucson and ate it the next day only to discover how wonderful it was. It was way too late to come back and get more! 

Our next trip to AZ we will definitely be coming back to try more items on the menu. Overall I really enjoyed everything. Only downsides I can think of is its really not set up to be like a restaurant and its so busy but really worth the wait here! In addition, I forgot to mention the staff here really takes customer service very seriously. Everyone was super friendly and very patient when I explained to them it was our first try and we heard about you guys from Triple D and never once felt like they rushed us or was unhelpful with any of our questions.Tempe's Four Peaks is big with Valley hipsters, college students and local musicians. The food is delicious. The bar offers an abundance of brews and they even give brewery tours so people can learn about the crafting process through something I like to call Beer 101. I'm a big fan of the bar's large patio, which overlooks 8th St. It's a great place to socialize and kick back with a cold glass of Framboise (try it if you're in the mood for something fruity!) and people watch. Be forewarned, parking is a pain here since the lot is small, but there's usually a decent amount of street parking and they even offer valet service.WATER!  make sure you try a glass of water here. No, really try it, it is the best tasting water I have ever had. It must be the purified water they use to make the beer and the price is right.

Free water aside, Four peaks in Tempe makes many great beers, some good food and combines it in  a unique industrial warehouse atmosphere. 

On my last trip here I went just for the beer, like many other times. I tried the seasonal, all be it after the season, pumpkin ale. It was pretty good with subtle spice notes,a clean finish and not too much residual sugar. 

I also had the Hop Knot IPA, the strong hops in this beer have some distinctly fruity and floral notes adding to its' complexity. 

After all of that great water and beer, take a trip to the hidden Men's bathroom in the game room, it is a very unique experience. 

In north Tempe this is my place of choice to go for a drink.I picked Four Peaks because this was a 1st date and he had told me that he liked microbreweries. I had never been to Four Peaks but surveyed some of my male friends and found this was the place to go. 

So we went Sunday around 12pm, and when we got their the football games were playing and come to find out Four Peaks is home to the Vikings. We sat inside, it was both of ours 1st time there. It was a nice crowd, and at one table every time the Vikings scored they would blow their Viking Horn, thought it was kinda cool.  I love places were fans can come together and watch their team play and share the wins or loses of their team!

My date ordered the sampler,which had all their beers but in 4 oz glasses and their winterwobbler (seasaonal beer), Im not really a beer drinker but my date was in enjoying himself! He said it was a great place for him, I think I did good picking it, haha

So we ordered the wings with spicy thai peanut sauce and beer bread, the wings were so dang good, it packed the right amount of heat! The beer bread, omg that was soft and so good, you don't need any butter to put on it, it was perfect without!  I ordered the Popper Burger, which was a hamburger with lettuce and tomatoes, onion strings, fresh steamed jalapenos and cream cheese, came with fries. Let me tell you. The burger made my eyes water and lips burn, it was perfect! The combo of the fresh steamed jalapenos and cream cheese was so perfect, it's like they were meant for each other and that the hamburger patty was their guest star in their perfect duo,  so dang delish!  

When we were close to being finished the manager Trevor came over and was talking to us, we shared that this was our 1st time there, my date shared more info with him about the beers and other beer related stuff, but my focus was on Trevor. Ladies Trevor is great eye candy! Beautiful eyes I tell ya!  Anyways our waitress brought us our check and come to find out Trevor paid for the sampler of beer! How kick ass was that!  

Glad to have found Four Peaks, I will be back!This is one of the few places I literally get cravings for. Yes, cravings. For a bar. I feel like readers might judge my palate for that statement, but I can't help it; I love me some Four Peaks.

Honestly, I'm not even a big fan of beer, but this place was the first that allowed me to enjoy it. I prefer my beer on the lighter side, so I always order a Pale Ale, Sunbru, or Peach Ale (my favorite, great if you like sweet, fruity brews!). I've heard the darker beers are fantastic as well from several beer-loving friends, and the selection has something for everyone.

What really gets me here, though, is the food. Oh my god, the food. I have never tried anything here that isn't delicious. If you love spinach artichoke dip, theirs is TO DIE FOR. I won't let myself order this unless I'm sharing it with at least two other people; otherwise, I'll finish it because it's my drug here. They serve it in a huge plate with all the pita bread and tortilla chips you could want.

I've also tried the Thai hummus (great spicy kick!), their gigantic burgers, a few sandwiches, and some fried food. All of it has been amazing. For dessert, you can't beat the Stout Shake. And after trying the seasonal Pumpkin variety last fall, I'm looking forward to its return this year!

The totally chill vibe and set-up of this place is pretty cool, too. If you don't know, it's not an entirely enclosed space; kind of open, similar to Dos Gringos, with a large outdoor patio area. It does get a little warm in the summer, but it's not too bad. 

Downsides? This place gets insanely busy on certain nights and weekends. Which leads into the next point: parking sucks. It's seriously horrible. You either have to park on 8th street, off some random neighborhood side street, or try to find room in one of the tiny lots nearby. I always hate the long walk from my car to Four Peaks, and I hate the drunken walk back even more. But I gotta say it's totally worth it.

Great drinks, great food, and a great place to hang out with your favorite people. Definitely not your average bar!Gotta be the most affordable sushi happy hour prices in all of Phoenix. Really great sushi, really great service!Their happy hour prices are very hard to beat. Perfect location next to ASU. Not to mention the sushi quality here is good. Not many places in Arizona can too 101's sushi I highly recommend this place for people who are 1) looking for good sushi, 2) looking for a good happy hour, 3) looking for great prices especially college students.This place is a serious no brainer for vegans! Lots of options to choose from considering they have a vegan section on their menu. I got the vegan combo to go and everything was delicious. The portion sizes are large and I got over 2 meals out of my take out! I wish it was a bit spicier since siracha flows like ketchup in my house, but it was all very flavorful non the less. Tried the vegan raw strawberry shortcake dessert from new raw and organic menu and it was ok. I wasn't crazy about the frozen strawberry portion as it tasted like Italian ice, but the creamy filling and crust under that satisfied my sweet tooth!Who DOESN'T want a margarita at 3 in the afternoon?!  I was headed to Gammage for the Broadway show Wicked.  I started with a double shot of Cabo Wabo Anejo and a 20th Anniversary Marg.  Nice way to kickstart the evening!  Enjoyed a Z Salad (my fave) and an order of cast-iron skillet dumplings.  Both were absolutely delicious!  I had to keep after the waitress for water, cornbread and MY CHECK!!  I was almost late to the show because she took 20 minutes getting my check to me!  

Interesting, though, was the fact that I had originally ordered a different tequila shot and the waitress returned to tell me they were out of it, so I ordered the Cabo Wabo.  It wasn't until a few days later that I looked at my receipt and noticed she had still charged me for the first shot (they were out of).  $10.25!!!  Did I say it was $10.25?!!  OUCH!!! 

I immediately contacted the restaurant and spoke to a manager named Angela.  She was extremely helpful and immediately resolved the situation.  Not only did she refund the $10.25 to my card, but she also sent me $20 in gift certificates!  No worries, Z'Tejas -- I'll be back!!

Love this place!I can't really complain for $40/nt. The pillows are a bit too firm for my taste. The rooms were cleaned daily and they have coffee and tea in the lobby.

All on point, well seasoned, good atmosphere and good service over all and the portion size was more then enough. If I'm ever back in Tempe inwould deff go back here for lunch or dinnerSeriously, it's not that bad. The stage is easily seen from any angle. The bathrooms were clean and fully stocked every time I went in there. Bar prices are average. In fact, they're much cheaper than other show venues and of course, sporting events. Sure, all of those ticket "fees" are annoying, but where else can you go where that doesn't happen? Too many couch-complainers on Yelp over a $6 beer - WAAAAH!!!I must admit, I don't think Ethiopian food is my end all, be all. I've had it twice since moving to Phoenix. It's not that I shy away from eating with my hands. It's not that I don't appreciate the culture, or how unique of a dining experience this is... authentic as you're going to get in the Valley, I can imagine. 

It's not any of those things... I think it's the food. Now, c'mon, I'm not going to lie. The food is tasty. It's just not what gets me going. I went to Lalibela with a couple co-workers. I was looking to get out of the office and enjoy some chit chat. Mission accomplished. Yet, can 3 people seriously get full from sharing a plate of Lalibela's finest? I think not. Besides, I get kinda skeeved out when dirt or food gets caught under my nails. Yikes. (Watching my co-workers pick at their fingers after the meal was not the most pleasing way to polish off my lunch.)

Sounds like I'm complaining, right? Well, I'm not trying to. I mean, this place is good. Don't get me wrong! I s'pose if you enjoy Ethiopian food and eating with your hands (and strange textures and really thin bread), then this is the place for you. 

I give it 4 stars for what it is: a really good Ethiopian restaurant... With, if you didn't know, really good chai tea. Oh, and the food... Well, I'll let you decide for yourself. Maybe it's your end all, be all.I have now been to Lalibela twice.  My first experience was tastier, but the food here is solid.  I took a 1st timer to ethiopian food (also gluten-free) and she really enjoyed her meal.  The lunch special sampler is a great deal and of course I love all the vegetarian options.  My favorite is the Tikil Gomen which I double up on!if you don't know or love harlows....well then get on it.  this place with it's casual morning after atmosphere and large menu is just what any hangover would order.  greasy, cheap, tasty, and fast.  the wait staff are always friendly and one top of their fast moving game.  it's good for groups, and for the unshowered.  parking is always @ a premium so beware,  and the wait can sometimes take 30 minutes.  but that's because it's a good overall dinner in the classic sense.  go .. enjoy.  fill up on dinner coffee....  and take a nap.Your average pub; I am not a big fan of Mill Avenue.  However, Rula Bula is a great place with good food, good selection of beer, good service & live music.

I only gave it four stars out of my own personal preference.  This is still a good selection if you like the college pub scene; you should definitely check it out.DELICIOUS!! 

Sometimes I crave a good steak, some yummy roasted chicken or a slice of delicious roast pork but Green has changed my food wants, recently I've been craving the delicious goodness of Green's awesome food. 

From first bite of the drunken mushroom chicken Green won me over. I do love mushrooms but the mock chicken totally fooled my carnivore mind. I love the flavors in the dish and how it was made together. Since my first time last Thursday 3/28 I have been in love with this place. I've had their samosas which are good, the Singapore Tofu noodle, yum yum! the vegan chili fries, outstanding (although next time I'm getting the chili on the side to avoid sogginess)! yes, thyme fries are my new loves. lol. the buffalo spicy "wings" are on point. BuT the one thing that makes Green extra awesome are their... Tsoynamis!!! These vegan treats, wait are they vegan? hmm still are worth my cheat days!! YUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMYYYYYYYY! The PB&J is so freaking good, love the peanut butter especially, the butterfinger is just addicting and the banana cream pie is my new crush! 

Green thank you for being around and thank you for your awesome bites. love you. Oh and they have Vitmo... yea that's a star for just being kick-ass!! =)Really fantastic food in a fun, airy atmosphere. There's a beautiful motto about friendliness painted on one wall, which unfortunately I don't think any of the staff has ever had the time to read, seeing as they all seemed to be too busy proving exactly how many rungs they were ahead of us on the ladder of cool.My first meal at Jim's was over four years ago... i went to lunch with my friend Tom. It was love at first sight... (not with me and Tom; with me and Jim's!)  Jim's reminded me of the old school diner types of Coney Island restaurants I grew up going to in Michigan.  I had a tasty Greek Salad, warm pita bread, great service, and while Tom picked up the bill, I remember the prices being moderate.  All that and it took me approximately four years to return.

But I finally made it back to Jim's today... and it was just as good, if not better, than I remembered!  As a matter of fact, I may just add Jim's to my rotation for favorite lunch (and breakfast) spots in town!

Here's why:
*Excellent service! Della was our waitress and she was awesome... she was patient with our party of four, she joked around with us, got our orders right, kept our drinks filled, and had an amazing looking green studded belt on to boot!
*Excellent food with lots of choices! You want breakfast food? They've got it!  You want salad? There are several choices! Gyros - sure thing... and if you get a sandwich, you get your choice of sides including cottage cheese, french fries, apple sauce, tomatoes, and more!
*Moderate prices and large portions!
*Old school decor!
*Comfy booths!

Thanks for sharing a fun lunch with me today, Brandon, Blair, and Lindsey... and glad I beat you to reviewing Jim's!  Let's do it again soon!Spent a good chunk of Saturday at the outdoor portion of this bar watching various NCAA basketball games. A bunch of regular drunks seem to get preferred treatment, but overall the bartender/manager was a nice guy and changed channels and made some conversation when pressed. The guy's name was Jake, making me think he was Jake from State farm (you know this if you watch CBS alot).
     Beers were mostly $3 and $4 as things stretched into happy hour. I did also sample the $2 Happy Hour chicken tacos. These were pretty large flour tortillas filled with normal chicken cubes, lettuce, cheese and some salsa on the side. It was good for that price and later on, I went for the 3-topping cheesesteak with curly fries. This was a way better version than most of these idiots in Phoenix are putting out. The meat is chopped on the grill (saw him doing it), the cheese is folded in and the rolls are from Philly. Fresh mushrooms and peppers and onions made this a pretty tasty dinner. The curly fries were also a good side dish. The inside of this place was pretty empty all day, but patio was full by 5pm. Great place to watch sports outside.Good ambiance and great service. It is hard to find great Italian in the valley. I rank this food as a 7/10.This place was great! Better than most of these hookah lounges they have out in Tempe. The service was great, the staff was down to earth and friendly, the atmosphere was relaxed with comfortable couches, and the hookah was great (while keeping it in the price range for a college student). If you have never been here or heard of this place give it a try. You wont regret it.I like Haji-Baba quite a lot. They have a delicious falafel sandwich that is priced well. If you are a vegan or vegetarian like me, this is a big deal. Granted, that's about all I can order here, but it's worth it. Probably the best part about Haji-Baba, though, is their market. The food and kitchen tools are reasonably priced.Don't let the unkempt look deceive you, their pizza is pretty amazing. The fact that the price is pretty cheap is just an added bonus. Compared to other places in the area, its a steal for good food. When you don't feel like paying 10 bucks for a meal that would otherwise cost half that, Slices is great.

I couldn't decide between three or four stars because of how dirty the eating area looks. However, I give them the benefit of the doubt for having really good pizza and pretty friendly staff - at least anytime I've ever been there. Its small and homely inside but for me it adds to the atmosphere. 

Oh and its conveniently located next to a Palm Reader and the Hippie Gypsy...I stopped in for a slice recently and was reminded how much I enjoy this. I used to work closer to Tempe and frequented this location regularly. A slice or two always hit the spot. Now I work further away and rarely get back here. Another huge boost with me is they deliver to World of Beer, which I am frequently in attendance. It is just across the street, but that extra service is well worth it! They have a wide variety of pizzas, and all of them are good. This is a great fast, cheap option in Tempe.One of my favorite Mexican restaurants in Tempe and Peoria.
I always get the red corn chicken taquitos and the ground beef enchilada. The chips and salsa are also very tasty. If you're used to authentic homemade Mexican food this may not be as good because it is more of a chain restaurant. However I still feel their food is well seasoned and they give you good portions 
I would pass one the fried ice cream though for dessert, for the price not worth it, just make it at homeSuzie's a great place for their lunch specials, they have good posole and beef tacos, and I remember they only cost like 6-7 bucks for lunch, throw in a 1 penny beer and you are ready to go back to the office a happy man.

Like someone else posted, you have to know what to expect.  Think a nice sit down Filibertos with bigger variety and a little more food.  and yup, the food's gonna be a little oily, but their salsa is nice and spicy :)

My buddy from El Paso loves this place cause he says the food is pretty authentic, like what his grandma would make when he is home.Super good! I haven't had anything bad yet. Both the red and green sauce are great. Good seafood options too.Ah, another high school pit stop. This place is great for random gifts, humorous books and furnishings. Keep an eye out for their clearance items, great discounts.This was my first stop when I got to the city to visit my friend as we were starving an it was basically across the street from where she lived. I love small family owned hole in the wall style places so this was perfect for me. We sat out on the patio and I think because of that we kind of got forgotten about a couple times but it wasn't bad. We sat next to two retired couples doing a road trip across America stopping everywhere for everything. They were from Alabama, they were so cute I want to be just like that when I get old. 
The chips were hott and tasty but a little oily, no worries just cover them in the delicious salsa and its all good. I ordered the chicken lime salad and it was amazing. All the chicken had so much flavor and the salad was sitting on a crisp tortilla covered in beans and cheese. It was all soo good. My friend got the steak fajita and complained that the meat was a bit dry and it did look it so watch out for that. My other friend got the cheese enchilada plate and I could tell it must have been good because she was the first to clean her plate. The portions were plenty and the prices were right.One of my favorite 'dive' bars. I love the events they have, their food is great, it's a cool space, I love the covered smoking patio, and the prices are reasonable.Top's - oh how I love beer so oh how I love Top's!

I don't drink wine, I've tried and tried but I rarely like it. So all the better that I review their wine selection. There's a lot and it's mostly in bottles. This is where I'd go if I was trying to locate girls, Europeans and/or winos.

Now, on to the beer!  There a lot and it's mostly in bottles...however the contents taste a lot better than that stuff over in the wine section. But be warned, there's nary a female, Euro wino in sight. Go here if you need/want/like a ridiculous selection of beer.

I'll pull a Stan Lee here, with a  "'Nuff said".We went to this establishment a couple weeks back for my girlfriend's birthday.  There was group of 14 us that evening, so we were seated in a private room.  The layout of this restaurant is really cool and is filled with history about the restaurant and Tempe.  I ordered the Filet, cooked medium; it came out perfectly cooked with excellent flavor.  The atmosphere was perfect and definitely was worth the menu prices.  

The only downsides from this visit is this private room had poor ventilation, or the A/C was not turned down enough.  It became extremely hot in this room the later the night went, and the waiter heard us discussing this while taking orders but ignored our statements.  Also, the waiter mentioned that if we wanted to split checks up, it could take an additional 30 minutes plus, and it would be best to not split up the check.  This is something we had to do, given there were 5 couples and the remaining were on single checks, and we all had our cards, not cash.  This did not take more than 10 minutes after providing our cards, I personally feel the waiter didn't want to break this bills up (which is understandable, but he could have shown professionalism and it explain there could be a delay rather than exaggerate and try to push us all on one bill).One of my favorite Thai restaurants in Tempe. I love- you guessed it- the Thai Basil! :)Good beer, decent food- but thats not why you go, close to campus, and a great way to end the day. Definitely enjoyed a happy hour or two especially after a long day or week of school.  Its really nice to sit outside and just hang out or people watch. Casey's certainly can attract an interesting bunch. All in all a solid place to drink and hang out.This place is fun, and customer service was awesome, food is good, and prices are okay. Since I have to force my husband to come with me to seafood restaurants he actually had a great time here. He liked the ambiance and music. He loved the dancing, he actually joined in. 

I got the steam pot with Dungeness crab, shrimp, corn and potatoes. Wish they had more spices but I'm just wishing they would open a boiling crab here in AZ. Anyway it was good and we enjoyed dinner here. It was kind of packed when we went, parking was kind of scarce but maybe because it's near a mall.I was looking for a top that would fit. This place had several different tops to try in my size and once I determined what style and size I was able to find the color I wanted. They also had lots of different style bottoms to try too. If they didn't have the color you wanted, you could order it and have it in 10 days. They make the suits. The owner was so helpful and I was very happy with my purchase. I will be back with my mother and sister-in-law. Bikini cost  $95 bucks, but it fit right and looked great.This dollar store is a cute lil gem tucked in the back of the Fry's Shopping center.  I just moved into this neighborhood last week so I stopped in on part of my 'get to know the area' walking tour.  Lemme just tell you... this place has great deals!  And ex... Rubbermade tupperware that would cost $$ at any other store is only $1 here.  Picture frames that run you $5 and up at other stores are only $1 here.  I also got a silicon rubber spatula for only $1.  

This store isn't good for all of your needs but it's fun to browse for cheap holiday decorations, party supplies, kitchen gadgets, and more. 

See ya there!I really like Trader Joe's. It has a lot of items that would ordinarily be really pricey elsewhere ie flowers, soy ice cream, cheese, wine and gluten free items. 

Its not really ideal for those that  like to make a lot of things from scratch as its more of a specialty retailer. I would say its a pretty good place to go for those who don't really like or don't have time to cook, are single, or want the finer things in life for dirt cheap. I'm sold.The food was very tasty and reasonably priced.  I had Bangkok chicken curry and my girlfriend had Dan Dan Noodles.  he he he  (Dan Dan is slang in Mandarin for something.)
Anyways the food was good but the one problem was the high oil content.  I had to visit the toilet 5min after leaving the restaurant.   My girlfriend who is a total FOB had to go also, so don't say that I'm not used to Asian food.Great service.  Make sure you call to make a reservation.  It can maybe hold 25 people maximum inside. Yes they do have outside seating, but it can get cold during the winter.  Even with the outdoor heaters going.  

I like the home feel of the place, I felt like I was eating inside a friends home.  The food is the same as it is comfort food.  I felt very satisfied when I left.  The sample plate was great and gave me an idea of what the food was like.

I did enjoy the service, nice home feel of the place, and the food.  If you want to try Polish food in Arizona, this is the place.If you are looking for good polish home cooking, then this place is for you.  It's not personally my style, but it was still pretty good.  The service was stellar.  I can see why they get so busy.  The owner or server was very friendly and accommodating.  

I ordered the goulash with pasta a green beans.  It was pretty good.  The portions are quite large.  My husband had sampler dish.

I would recommend to those looking for comfort food.Very good food for a fair price. I like to try small local places and this fit the bill perfectly. If you ever in the area stop by you will enjoy it.Charismatic little diner with good service and good food & coffee. Will be back to keep enjoying a delicious fresh american breakfast menu. They were busy yet we sat down quickly and food came on time...I have to disagree that Denny's is similar to this place. I have been here twice for breakfast and it was yummy both times. A lot more "homey" feeling than a commerical Dennys. Staff is always nice, always there to give you something before you ask for it. Buttermilk biscuits are yum, eggs perfect, potatoes are good. Prices are cheap!Good, typical diner-style food. Breakfast is served hot, fresh, and fast. Family-friendly and family-run. The decor is dated, but the restaurant is very clean. Service is fantastic.Located at the Rancho Mañana Golf Resort in Cave Creek. Beautiful setting. Get there in time to view the grounds by setting outside before the sun sets.
Good selection on the menu including steaks, chicken and fish.Love the food at Harold's, the large menu, the atmosphere, the great service, and the fact that it shares a parking lot with Buffalo Chip so it's easy to mosey on over for bull riding after a good dinner. Buffalo Chip has mediocre food, a tiny menu, and bad food service if you get there too late and it's super busy.

Harold's has a large dining area and a wonderfully large menu. While most of it looks vegetarian, I found out when researching rehearsal dinner places that many of the sauces have some kind of meat stock in them, making it unvegetarian. The server we had for dinner was really nice, prompt, and helpful. The menu has a ton of different choices like regular bar food, mexican food, tons of bbq, pizza, pastas, and burgers/sandwiches. The salads are fresh, the bbq sauce is amazing, and they serve warm, soft bread rolls with just about everything.

The inside has a charming western feel and doesn't get too crowded feeling even when there are a lot of people because the rooms are quite large. The patio is really nice with a ton of misters, a beautiful view of mountains & cactus, and is sunset-facing. 

I definitely recommend getting dinner & drinks here and then heading over to the Buffalo Chip for Friday night bull riding.We went at the height of the dinner rush on Friday.  We wanted something different outside of Surprise and this was just what we were looking for.  The place was packed.  Lots of retirees and locals it appeared.  I would give the Rio Mirage (3.5)  4 Stars overall since there is not an option for halves.   

Ambience: 4 stars!  The  Rio Mirage was a nice old school mexican restaurant with plenty of seating.  Very well kept and clean. I also noticed that there was patio seating which looked comfy.  I would like to sit out there next time on a nice night.   We also loved the roaming mariachi band.  That was a nice touch and the kids loved them.  Lastly,  another note...when and if you try this place, you may expect to wait to be seated, but rest assured you won't go thirsty.  The bartender is stationed right next the entrance and the margaritas are pretty tasty.  I upgraded to the ulitmate, to get a splash of grand marnier.  3 stars on the margaritas.

Food: I give the food 4 stars.   My wife ordered the fish tacos, which looked great. Fried white fish and shredded cabbage on a corn tortilla.  She gave them 2 thumbs up.   The kids had the "Kid's Taco" meal,  which came with a choice of beans.  They devored most of thier meals.  Their tacos were fried with shredded beef, lettuce & tomatoes.    I had the El Bombero Picado.  Strips of asada steak, covered in a green sauce with sauted peppers and onions.   It was real tasty, but was not as spicy as the menu was leading on.   However, real good.  My meal came with rice and beans on the side and a choice of tortillas.  I chose the "homemade" flour tortillas, 2 large tortillas (equivalent to 4 regular sized).  They were awesome.   My meal was great, I would just make a note to have them exclude the melted cheese on my beans next time.  It was a little "overkill" , but not a dealbreaker.  I just scraped the cheese off and it they were set.  The rice was nice and fluffy,  real subtle, with a great flavor.


Service: 2 stars.  I am giving our server the benefit of the doubt, SIMPLY because she was very friendly and helpful when we did get her attention.   She just seemed very overwhelmed and maybe she was having an "off night", which may likely led her to forget my tortillas after asking her twice.  Lol!  Once I get the "homemade" tortillas...muy bien as mentioned above.  Everyone else seemed to be getting served promptly and had smiles on their faces, which was a plus.  

Overall,  I would recommend this place.  It is worth your time to try.  Remember,  avoid the rush and tell them to hold the cheese on the beans!  Good luck!I have stayed here three times now on a business trip. The room was under $50/night. They just remodeled all of their rooms (suites are being worked on) and it's impressive.  I do travel a lot for work and stay in nice places but considering the price, services and quality of the rooms, this is one of my favorites.

Pros: nice and friendly staff, ok breakfast (bagels, waffles, eggs, yogurt, apples, juice, coffee, cereal), clean rooms, comfy bed and pillows, a/c, cable tv, fridge and microwave in the room, free internet, pool, free printing services in lobby, gas station next door that has a mini mart for snacks.

Cons: if I had to come up with one, sometimes you can find some 'interesting' people staying here. But with that said, I have never been bothered or felt unsafe.

Highly recommend!Great Mexican food!  I had the shredded beef burro enchilada style and my husband had the cheese and fajita chicken quesadilla.  Both very tasty!  Very big cold beers too for a very reasonable price.  Nice atmosphere in the bar and close to home.If you want Pizza, wings and beer this is the place to go. 

The Pizza is always served hot and tasty. The price is reasonable as well. The staff is generally very attentive to your needs and always friendly. 

They have a multitude of TV's that are viewable from just about anywhere in the joint and are always willing to change the channel on a TV near you if you want to watch a different sporting event than the one they have on. 

The chicken wings are not as good as they used to be several years ago, but still darn tasty. Years ago they had more of a vinegar based sauce than today, but none the less are nice and tasty. If you want an adventure go with the suicide wings, if you are not as adventurous then go with the mild as they have little if any heat to them, but are fried up and have a wonderful flavor to them.

We have not tried many other things on the menu beyond the pizza, wings and an occasional salad. The few items we have tried are tasty, but not what I would call outstanding. Then again, they are about what you would expect from a place that is known for pizza, wings and beer. 

** Note the "outdoor seating" is  a couple of bistro chairs and tables on the sidewalk next to the parking lot and faces west so it is rather hot. I do not recommend the outdoor seating.So happy I FINALLY talked my boyfriend into going here. I used to grub here at least once a week when I worked up at the lake. Bar food yes, but way more than that. Sandwiches and fresh pastas. Daily specials that you can almost never go wrong with. I've had a meatloaf sandwich as a special, chicken Marsala and omg the egg fettuccine noodles were so yummy. Fish fry Fridays. 
Good service, not AMAZING but it seems like a family style spot with a decent crew. Not a chain joint, and did I mention they have watermelon wings? 
Minors are allowed in the restaurant area, I've yet to check out the bar but the bartenders were all young and attractive. Seems like it would be a cool place to watch a game, unless your going against the team playing the Bills, cuz this is def a buffalo bar!In town for business and needed a good hearty breakfast. The Omelet House did not disappoint. While the decor is stuck in the late 70's, the food and the service is spot on! I had the 38 Special Omelet Bacon, Ham, Sausage, Cheddar and jack Cheese. The eggs were fluffy and delicious plus you did not have to search for the meat...IT WAS everywhere. I am a big eater and the portions were HUGE.  Great potatoes too. They were almost like chips. Good Stuff.Awesome place for pho ! Special combination is good,  but there serving is  not consistent sometimes you get a big portion then next time you get a sad face
 :( but this is the only restaurant that serves pho in my area . Service is excellent ! Hope 
This information is useful :)McCarran Airport and I share a strong love/hate relationship.

- I love to travel; McCarran is an international airport (important)
- I love seeing family and friends visit (and picking them up)
- I hate the useless signs that go to all different directions 
- I hate waiting on my plane 
- I hate leaving Las VegasOne of the most organized airports we've seen.  Car rental dropoff center:  buses frequent & organized lines with attendants to keep the pushing to a minimum.  2 stops, we went from the center to terminal 1 in 15 minutes.  Delta has priority member line & bag drop right there.  Security checkpoint has a line for 1st Class, not priority, & the line for non-first class were long, but after ids check, there are many scanners & they seemed to be moving well.  Very short (& frequent) trams to D concourse, short walk even to the furthest gate (D40-43).McCarran is money for me. I like the way everything is set up here, especially since they made the "special southwest only" security check thru area to go to terminal C. Not once have I taken more than 15 minutes to get through security flying southwest airlines, and most times I walk right to the front of the line (maybe that's cause I'm a smart traveler and book days that aren't holidays or busy weekends, just so I can avoid high volume hassles traveling)

The airport is very centrally located in Vegas, as we all know, it's just south and east of the strip. It's easy to get into off the 215 or from Tropicana if you come from that part of town. They have been going through some expansion issues, and have changed the way people drive into the departures and arrivals area and I think that has made the congestion go way down.

One of the things I love about this airport, is actually not about the airport at all.  One of the reasons I decided to live in Vegas is because I travel a lot and there are always millions of flights in and out that I can choose from and the price is pretty low compared to other airports where I could've chosen to live. Any time I decide to travel I always have lots of options (mostly Southwest and United airlines).

Another thing I like about this airport is that international travel flies out of Terminal 2, which is completely separate but uses the same runways. That keeps the traveler congestion down in the main terminal, which is huge, because this is always one of the top 5 busiest airports in the US every year. 
A quick tip: you have to check in 50 minutes prior to your departure time. I have heard stories of people running late and checking in 45 minutes prior to departure, and the ticketing agent wouldn't let them check in and have made them change their schedule to a later flight to avoid missing the flight. 

The WIFI is free here. The restaurants are all here, whether you want a sandwich, quick lunch, sit down at a restaurant and have a nice meal, sit at the bar, have a drink and watch the game, or just grab a banana or muffin and a bottle of water, this airport seems to have all the choices.
Can't really give an airport 5 stars can ya???
4 solid stars for meI'm rating the porter service on this review. We got to Terminal 2 and was greeted by a porter. Nice and friendly, took our bags led us inside. Told us to find a seat and he'll take care of everything. Came back with our boarding passes we tipped him and we were off to our gate. Very easy!I fly in/out from McCarran pretty much once a month, and it has always gone smoothly. There are rarely delays, you never have to wait too long for your luggage, and there are hardly ever huge lines at security; I can usually get through in less than half an hour. I always fly out of the D gates, and there are so many food options: starbucks, cinnabon, CPK, pretzels, a diner, chilis, port of subs, etc... There's also a bunch of shopping and boutiques, slot machines, and places to sit. There are outlets at every gate to plug in laptops and cell phones. McCarran is great, and the only things that could be improved are the parking situation, and having more seats by the baggage claim.I like this airport. It's small but oh so conveniently located, just ten minutes from The Strip. I like how it's easy to find your way around; there's good signage and it's easy to navigate. I like how the bathrooms are a-plenty and they're clean. I don't gamble, but I like the novelty of hearing and seeing slot machines right when you get off the plane, as if they're singing "Welcome to Vegas, baby!". The food options weren't as abundant or diverse as I'd prefer, but hey, for a smaller-scale airport, it wasn't bad. 

The luggage carousels were large and well-delineated, and one can easily pick up a taxi or shuttle van right outside, to take you to the Strip for under $10 (at least, I got a great rate on a shuttle). On my return visit, to fly out of Vegas, I was able to get through security in an unbelievably fast time (what a refreshing change from SeaTac Airport! Like, night and day).For a busy airport, McCarran is very good airport.  If you're flying in and out of the new Terminal 3, it is really fantastic.  It is not as busy, and ticketing/TSA security is normally a breeze.  In Terminal 1, especially on Southwest, it can be a headache, because it's so busy.  It really needs a Dunkin' Donuts or a Tim Hortons though.  The concession choices are terrible for an airport of its magnitude.  The coffee choices are really terrible.  But overall, I never mind flying in and out of this airport.Hawaiians, for whatever reason, love Vegas.
Hawaiians, for whatever reason, love staying at the Cal Hotel when they go to Vegas.
Hawaiians, for whatever reason, will spend their last waking moments in Vegas... literally an hour before they take the early evening flight on Hawaiian Airlines back to the islands... eating local Hawaiian food at Aloha Specialties at the Cal Hotel!

At least this was what was going on when I was here the Sunday after Thanksgiving. We waited in that long-ass line close to HALF AN HOUR. I struck up a conversation with the woman behind me about how the tap water in Vegas tastes terrible. (For those of you who aren't aware, the tap water in Hawaii is magically delicious.)

Alright, now for the actual review. This place is like a Zippy's with a much longer wait but a much smaller menu. However, for a mainland Hawaiian restaurant, the prices are very reasonable and the portions are generous. My dad and I both ordered the fried saimin (which to my dismay was mediocre... should have gone for the $4.95 large regular saimin!). My mom got some special Japanese lunch box (which I forget the name of), and my sister ordered the Korean-style beef and chicken plate lunch combo, which was really good. The mac salad hit the spot too.

There are a number of Hawaiian places around Vegas, but my guess is that this is the place to go if you wanna feel that real spirit of Aloha. Maybe that's just because it's full of Hawaiians in an extra good mood because they're grindin on yummy authentic local food. Just be prepared to WAIT.

Took a spam musubi ($1.50) to go, and ate it while I waited for my flight back to SF. I bet I got a bunch of weird looks by those unaware of the power of something resembling a oversized, angular sushi roll... but I don't care!This is a great place to bring kids to blow off some steam while the adults in your party go gamble.  The place is actually fairly large (2 stories) but it has an odd layout everything on the first floor seems compressed and everything on the second floor really really spread out.  The Berenstein bears area is cute there is a nice play area for the younger set as well.  I also liked the dress up/play stage area and the bubble/water area.  The upstairs is mainly scientific geared but still fun.  It is a little pricey for what you get.  There is a little area when you first come in that you can bring your own food or buy vending machine food and eat.  They have a miniscule gift shop.So sorry to hear this Las Vegas Classic has closed. A piece of local history is gone, and with it a connection to the family that kept this eatery a place with heart for more than half a century.
To the owners, best wishes to a well-earned rest. My sympathy to all the loyal locals who will no longer be able to enjoy this special place.I can not believe that as much as I shop here, I have not reviewed this outstanding shop hidden away on main street.

Everything you can think of related to gambling and the experience of gambling can be found in the store.
The only thing that keeps the general store from a five star rating is that the parking is very limited and it is not easy to enter. 

One of the outstanding features of the store is an amazing collection of slot machines for sale. 
All styles can be found, however, there are some states that it is illegal for you to own a slot machine in your home.

They have the greatest collection of books for sale on every aspect of gambling. The number of books on Hold "em Poker is astounding.

I buy my table chips for home use here, and they have decks of previously used decks of cards from all your favorite casinos. 

The staff is totally knowledgeable and very helpful.
Also very friendly....
A great specialty store.Where the Strip seems determined to raze and rebuild, the Golden Gate is proud of their 100 year history. The place is a museum and that 99 cent  shrimp cocktail they have is the best deal in town while being the tastiest.Spitting distance from fremont street making it a nice alternative to casino food. The menu is huge and eclectic with argentinian food, Uruguayan food, pizza and typical American breakfast. While we were there two different argentinian families bought out their empanadas--they must be good!

We had the sausage breakfast sandwich and Denver omelet. They were both totally decent.  We also had the iced coffee which was good though came with milk without asking... Next time we'll have to get more adventurous with the menu.

Great service and awesome high, vaulted ceilings.A very nice and well organized display of very interesting objects.  We went on Science fair week so it was free and there were professionals at tables educating the kids on what their career path was like.  Even the author off Deputy Dorkface was there.   There is a fish tank made by the TV show TANKED.  Beautiful displays of african animals, king tut's tomb, the sea world, geology and nevaa native animals are coupled with many interactive exhibits.  I'm used to bigger museums but this one packs a lot of punch for such a small space.I love the gold spike.  Its the sleaziest hotel/casino that I've seen in Vegas, and the rooms are cheap!  It is a little scary to park your car in the lot (not to mention to walk through the lobby) but that's part of the adventure.  It's also walking distance to the hilarious Fremont St "Experience" which I enjoy just by watching the people who are enjoying it.  Vegas has never been about gambling or buffets for me, more about sleaze-spectating.  If you feel similarly you should definitely stay at the gold spike.This review is only for the California Hotel Restaurant!

I traded Sonic one cold Vegas night and decided to come here and try their famous "Oxtail Soup". I wasnt disappointed!!

The soup was very hot, lots of green onion and was served with kanin (rice) and cilantro. Being a hardcore Filipino chomper, it was perfect. I love the Hawaiian-American Diner-Japanese fusion that they have.

WOULD DEFINITELY come back here!!My parents and I stayed at this hotel for 6 nights while competing in the World Food Championship, which was held on Fremont St. For our needs, this hotel worked perfectly. Basically - you see what you get. It is older, sure, but has more character for it. Plus, it is right on the Fremont Experience - just walk out the door and you're under the lights. The rooms were clean, quiet, and comfortable. The entire staff was very friendly and helpful. I wish they would have had free wi-fi, but I guess that is becoming rare these days. Magnolia's - the restaurant there, has fast service and pretty good food reasonably priced. Careful though, their promo prices are with a player's card and it is $1.00 for a to-go box. Overall, I was never bored staying at this hotel. There are loads of cartoons both inside and out on the street. As others have said, the Four Queens isn't as nice as the Golden Nugget, but it is functional and cheaper. Also, parking is free if you stay.I first learned about the El Cortez Casino in 1999 on a road trip from Cleveland to California.  Long story...

So, I am in Arches National Park with my business partner and his 2-year-old son.  It is 112 degrees outside and we are hiking around and enjoying ourselves.  We were traveling in a camper.  After a day in the park, we decided to head out and on the way to our next destination.

About 10 miles out of the park, we broke down.  The engine was seized!  No oil...oops.  This was especially bad since we were 2 hours away from the closest town with an auto mechanic, which happened to be Green River, Utah.

We called in a tow, which came after a couple of hours and we were off to Green River.  I drove our car behind the tow truck and my friend stayed in the camper with his son on top of the tow truck.  This would have been fine, but I could barely keep up with the speed demon in the 18-wheeler in our purple Dodge Neon rental car.

When we finally got to Green River, it was bad news.  The mechanic with one tooth said, "It's gonna take a while."  I swear it reminded me of the mechanics that ripped off Chevy Chase in National Lampoons Vacation.  After an evening of phone calls and begging for favors from friends, we decided to get another tow to a bigger town the next day.

Once the camper was in the right place and repairs had begun, we had to find a place to go for 10 days...how about Vegas?!  With a 2-year-old!  In a purple Neon!  Off we went.

Has anybody tried staying in a Vegas hotel for 10 days?  With a 2-year-old?  Crap.  That was a challenge.  Try getting a bottle of milk from room service multiple times daily.  What do you think a hotel charges to wash a pair of socks for a 2-year-old?  Anyway, we drained our funds pretty quickly.  Especially since my business partner kept raiding the bank for gambling scratch.

Finally, the phone call came from the guy fixing the camper.  It needed a new engine, new tires, new this, new that.  Blah!  The total for repairs was over $6K.  How much did we have left in our travel fund after 10 days in Vegas?  $1K.  Uh oh.  I know my friends wife wasn't going to be cool with us coming home late or without the camper.  What were we going to do?

Alas, the El Cortez comes into the picture.  Since we were already screwed, I came up with the bright idea of going to the worst casino in Vegas with the last of our money and 'going for it'.  My business partner, who is good at Blackjack and has a huge set of huevos, said he was in.  We hired a babysitter who flew out from California (no joke) and headed downtown in the neon for a little action. We went straight to the El Cortez and parked in the lot on-site.

As we entered, the first thing I noticed was the exteme stench of cigarettes.  This place clearly didn't have a ventilation system.  We sat down at a Blackjack table and started playing.  Within an hour, my buddy was up a few thousand dollars and I was up about $500.  This was a great start, but we were not ready to leave.  As the pit bosses started moving the dealers around, we decided to get up and move with the dealer we liked.  This seemed to get some attention upstairs and we were being closely watched all of the sudden by pit bosses and a random person that came out from the back.  For this reason, I stopped playing and began walking around the place and having a few drinks.

When I went back to check on my business partner, he was playing the table max bet and on a roll.  He had at least $8K in black chips in front of him so I grabbed $6K worth and went to cash it in.  No problem.

Another hour passes and he is still playing and still winning.  Now, he has a stack of black chips in front of him that totalled over $9K...and I have his other 6K in my pocket!!!  I told him we should leave and he agreed.

That was when we hit a little snag.  As soon as we got to the cage, they had people waiting there for us.  They said that we had to pay taxes on our cash because we had won over $10K.  Being drunk, I began to argue and told them that he owed me the money that I took from the table.  Technically, that was true since our money was pooled going in.  They hassled us for a while, but ultimately paid us in full and let us leave.  I will never forget running to the Neon in flip flops and cargo shorts, holding my pockets tight so the money wouldn't fly out.

I love the El Cortez because of this night.  I will always love the El Cortez.  I carry matches from that night everywhere I go to this day.  They live in my briefcase.  During our big win, I remember asking the pit boss if we were going to get a room comped to us.  He said no.  I asked what the most expensive room in the hotel was running that night.  The answer was $19.95.  I guess we didn't play enough to warrant the comp.

We left and got the heck out of Vegas the next morning.  We picked up and paid for the camper repairs and his wife never found out that we even went to Vegas.Located on the first floor of the Golden Nugget hotel, across from the pool.  Open 24 hours and was good and inexpensive.  There were so many options for breakfast, lunch and dinner and the dessert selection was great also.  Ate here quite a bit because there there so many options.  American food, traditional.We didn't stay at this hotel but hung out here while visiting Downtown Fremont Street.

I have to admit that compared to other Downtown hotels, this one actually was nice (I'm guessing it's because it's owned by Steve Wynn). It was bigger than Binion's and the 4 Queens and classier too. It still had the low ceilings and smoky smell but hey, it's Downtown Fremont Street which is home to all the older hotel-casinos.

The coolest thing about this hotel was the shark tank in the middle of the pool. There's also a waterslide and the tube goes right through the shark tank! 

Not sure if I would stay here but I would sneak in and use their pool.I stayed here for my 30th b-day 2 years ago, and again this weekend, and loved both times. I know what you are thinking, "eww, Fremont St?" But Yes. This hotel is the best one downtown and has been fully renovated. It's lovely inside, has a warm interior, plenty of restaurants and lounges and doesn't feel old school at all. 

Our king size bed was SO comfy, and we even jumped on it a little. :) I love how all the hotels are going Euro style now with plush white linens and duvet covers, no more tacky flowered bedspreads, hooray! 

Only bummer was that our room was close to the ice machine, so we kept hearing this weird noise. It was a little annoying, but we survived. 

Blackout curtains, flat screen TV (which we didn't turn on once, but I just wanted to let y'all know), spacious, ipod dock in the alarm clock, it was all very nice, just as nice as anything on the strip. The pool area was cool and apparently you can swim with sharks. (It is February though, so no swimming for us.) 

We went to the resident club at the hotel, Gold Diggers, and while it's a little low on the quality of people quotient, it was good music to dance to and very low key, no pretentious people. :) I dug it!Very comfortable beds for a hotel.  It would have been nice if the room safe work.  My friend swears the maid stole his mini alcohol bottles but I think it's more likely he drank or lost them.  The pool area was nice but far too many kids in the pool.  Not sure why the parents brought them.  Vegas is no place for kids.  The slide is a nice novelty but you really go down too fast to enjoy a view of the sharks.  Would definitely stay here again.  I enjoyed the Fremont experience but again this place is no place for kids and I probably wouldn't bring my wife here either.  Great place for the guys to party though.  On a final note I do not appreciate the fact that they charge you to use the internet.  Would have been nice to print my Southwest Airline tickets for free.I am a fan of this buffet.  It's been awhile, so when we were in the area and having a BOGO, how could we not go?

I had two things specifically that I knew in advance I wanted - Kalua pork and collard greens.  Both were as good as they always are.  They also had black bean chili made with pieces of beef rather than the usual hamburger.  I had a small amount of their spicy tofu.  It was good, but it wasn't spicy.  It needed a lot more kick.  Finally, I had one wrapped laulau.  It was seasoned well, but I didn't taste any fish.  There was some ground pork but no fish. Dessert was a piece of no sugar added Key lime pie. 

I'll be returning even if just to have kalua pork and the collard greens.I love Sam's Town.

I've stayed here three separate years for Punk Rock Bowling and whenever we're away, I miss it. 

The drinks are well-priced and I love the theme stuff. Plus, the staff have always seemed glad to have us back (which counts for a lot). 

The best thing about Sam's Town, by far, is the atrium. The rock bar was always a central place for you to meet with your friends and close out the night. Besides, where else can you find a bunch of punks singing along to patriotic sings and climbing on animatronic wolves and bears?

As gross as it sounds, I actually like that they have the little fast food section too. It's all together and if you just want something quick and disgusting, you know just where to go.

The bowling center is great until your lane breaks during the tournament but, honestly, that just added to the awesome crappiness of it all. 

So, Sam's Town, I miss you but at least we still have bowling."Finally the Rock has come to Sam's Town."  Last week he headlined the Main Event at the WWE Royal Rumble at Sam's Town Live. Once a month, Sam's Town turns into WWE town when they hold the monthly WWE pay-per-view.  Professional wrestling fans from all over Las Vegas travel to Sam's Town for the pay- per-view. Lately I have been one of them.

  Although professional wrestling is staged, the entertainment of the wrestling pay-per-views at Sam's Town is real. The $5 admission for a pay-per-view that costs $50 at your house is a bargain. The entertainment begins before Sam's Town Live opens the doors for the pay-per-view. The WWE fans get really into it. Some of the conversations I hear on line are entertaining. Especially from the fans that think it is real. At the group tables, the fans get into the anticipation of the pay-per-view. And they get into the beer and snacks.

  Eating and drinking at Sam's Town Live will not drain your wallet. A cup of Miller Draft beer is only $2.50. Yet people still complain because it was $1.50 a couple of pay-per-views ago. And let me write that nachos and cheese is $3 and a bag of popcorn is $2.50.

  Sam's Town is smart by holding the $5 WWE pay-per-views. When I go there I spend money. Food is a big part of it.

  Although I wouldn't give Sam's Town a Heavyweight Champion belt on food, it may be in the running for the Intercontinental belt for a Boulder Highway resort restaurant selection. They have a decent food court that features McDonald's, Sbarro, and Panda Express. The McDonald's makes for a nice late night snack. At the southeast entrance of the property is Subway, an ice cream parlor, and Dunkin Donuts. Whenever I visit Sam's Town it is nearly guaranteed that I pick up Dunkin Donut's coffee then drink it in Mystic Falls Park. They also have the Fireplace Buffet, TGI Friday's, a deli, and other restaurants. For the record the Fireplace Buffet ranges from okay to good.

   Entertainment is another factor that brings me to Sam's Town. I appreciate the job that Sam's Town did with their Mystic Falls Park. The menagerie of wildlife robots has a way of charming people. Their laser show is first-rate. Away from the wildlife robots, Century Theater has brought me into the casino. It was a great experience seeing "Avatar" there. If I was up to bowling, I am confident that I would like the bowling alley.

 While I am enjoying the WWE pay-per-views, eating out, and the entertainment; the one armed bandits are never far from the back of my mind. In the 2000's, Sam's Town has buried the majority of the one armed bandits. I enjoy playing Caveman Keno on their computerized machines. The machines are far from tight, and Lady Luck has sometimes visited Sam's Town when I played there. And, whether I win or not, I am content with the cocktail waitress service. 

  It is possible that The Rock may have visited Sam's Town for the last time. It is certain that I will visit Sam's Town another time. When it comes to WWE pay-per-view events in Las Vegas, Sam's Town is the Heavyweight Champion.Writing this review because there are so many debates about whether or not Las Vegas can serve up good Mexican food.

I was referred to La Palapa by a friend who hails from Mexico, and is picky about their food.  Especially mariscos!  I myself, having spent a significant number of years being part of a Mexican family, have a discerning pallet when it comes to Mexican fare.

I arrived at La Palapa with my friend and his family, and upon sitting down he was immediately greeted with a michelada 'preparada'.  This is one of the best inventions ever, so I quickly followed suit, while presented with several options of the cerveza to be used in the drink.  I'm a traditionalist....Modelo Especial is my standard.  I have to say, this preparada was unique to anything I've had elsewhere, including those in Mexico City.  It was much lighter in tomato than most, but had great spicey goodness!  The 2nd one was better than the 1st!

I split a tasting of shrimp and octopus ceviche cocktail and a combination shrimp and fish taco.  All was phenomenal.  I think there was a full pound of 21-25 shrimp in my ceviche, and the lightly fried goodness in the tacos was amazing.  Super fresh and awesome.  Even did a dozen raw oysters on the 1/2 shell as appetizer.  a) I wouldn't risk this at 90% of the restaurants in Vegas and b) I never thought sliders with lime juice and Tapatio would be awesome!  I was wrong!

Needless to say, this was worth the drive off the beaten path.  I'll definitely be back!So as I am learning the area a little better I stumbled on this place. I use to work in St Croix so defiantly use to the flavors. ordered the jerk chicken with rice and beans and came with stewed cabbage and fried banana, patties ( sort of like corn bread.) , and rum cake along with some cream soda. 

First off the chicken is good I did have a couple of top layers of the chicken that where a little dry however under was good also not raw or pink -- Great spice rub on the chicken. The rice and beans where good and stewed cabbage great. 

Patties are patties enough said lol 

Rum Cake. OMG RUM, This deff takes me back to St Croix's seeing the amount of rum on that island is insane. This is super moist not hard or store bought def. could tell homemade, I even think they soak the raisin's. This is a must. 

Also I got D&G sof drink not a spelling error there from Jamaica I tell you a blended drink with rum or tequila turned into a slushy with this would be soooo amazing. 

Strong menu items, Main's tend to be a bit pricey but you can also sides a little cheaper.Rum Cake is a deff mustI really like McMullan's Irish Pub.  The owner is actually Irish and it is not some chain bar, which I appreciate.  They are very open to working with charity groups to benefit their causes and the decor is excellent and authentic.  My boyfriend wanted me to give McMullan's 5 stars because he absolutely adores the food, but I had some so-so curry their once and it can be a bit pricey, but this is Vegas and I suppose that everywhere is like that... you always meet great people at this bar and it is a festive place to hang out with old friends and new.  On Sundays they have live Irish music and it's cool :)An organization I'm a member of held an event in their back room. I really liked the set up we had back there - plenty of room (seems 100 or so could fit?), our own bar, and tasty bar food was brought out pretty regularly. Definitely a place I'd keep in mind if I was hosting events - or just looking for an "authentic" Irish pub off the strip to visit.I've never had a bad experience here.

delivery, pickup, whatever, the food always turns out good, for me.

Yesterday they were my saving grace, when Papa John's let me down SEVERELY.

Pizza Hut quoted me an hour-ish wait time (which is fine when I know about it, not when i'm promised 30-40 minutes and it ends up being over an hour like PJ's was)...and they were there at my house with my piping hot, delicous pizza in about 25 minutes.

LOVE.Good go to place for basic groceries and liquor if you're staying at the Gold Coast, Rio or Palms.  The best thing about this place is that it's open 24 hours and has a little bit of a lot of things.  You can avoid paying the hotel priced beer, cigarettes, and snacks if you're willing to walk a couple of blocks.I never thought there would be full blown dim sum in Vegas, but this is it!  We stayed in Vegas for over a week and ended up going here twice for dim sum.  This place is pretty good!  They have practically everything you can imagine for dim sum (I'm not gonna go into everything they have because if you're here for dim sum, I assume you're a seasoned expert)

The food is about as good as what you'd find in a good Chinatown restaurant.  I really have no complaints about the quality.  My only gripe is they charge $1 per person for tea which is absurd.  And I feel the cart pushers are a little dopey.  More than once, they would push their carts right by you without announcing what they have or stopping at your table.  It got annoying but hey, there's no such thing as good customer service with the Chinese.  

They have enough parking for the size of the restaurant and each time we went there, there was no wait (we went with a party of 7).  If you love dim sum and you are in Vegas craving for it, definitely give this place a tryThey serve the best Dim Sum in Vegas.  The food is fresh, the service is warm, the choice is big, and the price is very reasonable.  I do not go to Vegas very often, but if I go, I always have my Dim Sum there.Good dim sum, decently priced, variety is not too extravagant, but the basics are covered and done well. Only a couple carts that keep coming around, but they are always restocked nicely.Yum! Love me some dim sum. We've been here a few times and their dim sum is always fresh and delicious. I don't remember all the names of the items, but some of the usual suspects are pork hash, char siu bau, shrimp balls, tripe, bean curd, taro puffs, scallop rolls...and many more. Everything I've had was tasty and nothing to complain about. 

The service is hit and miss though. You have to ask for refills and small things like utensils and hot sauce. Sometimes the staff can come off rude but I don't pay much attention unless someone is blatantly yelling in my face. The interior is a bit outdated and not the cleanest, and parking can be tough during the lunch rush. Overall I would visit again while vacationing in Vegas.3.75 Stars!

During our 3 night stay in Vegas, we decided to try Chang's HK Cuisine for their dim sum based on their Yelp reviews.  We were expecting a wait since it was a Sunday at lunch, but there wasn't a wait.

The restaurant was about 75% full when we arrived for lunch.  We were immediately seated and the women pushing the carts started coming by our table.  We got some of our favorites - BBQ pork bun, siu mai, shrimp rice noodle, and sesame balls.  All were fairly good, but the one dish they didn't have was my favorite - shrimp dumplings (har gow).  I really wanted to try har gow at Chang's, but every time I asked a woman, she said she didn't have it.  

Chang's goes on the tiered pricing model, so some dishes are more expensive than others.  Most places in Los Angeles are like this too, which is why I love Ocean Star because they have a flat pricing schedule.

The food was good at Chang's and about the same as other dim sum places I've tried in the Vegas Chinatown area.  The best thing about Chang's was we didn't have to wait for a table!

We got four dishes and the bill came out to around $16.00.  Please see my pictures.

Xie Xie!I went here with my photographer, Richard Faverty, who is a regular.  There were 7 of us and we ate family style so we could all taste the dishes.  My favorite was the duck.  The food was all very good and the service was excellent.  

The atmosphere was maybe a little too sedate for my tastes, but we didn't get the evil eye or anything for being the loudest group in the place (with 6 entertainers it can't be helped).  The prices are very reasonable.  We ordered 4 appetizers and then all had an entree and it was still about $25 a person.  

I'll definitely go here again when I want a good relaxed dinner with friends after a photo shoot.  Not the wildest place in Vegas but you don't always want that, right?this was our first time to metro, actually by default, we had tried to go to Sammys LA pastrami but were ignored by the worker there, So, we decided to check out Metro.  We had the garlic knots...YUMMY, garlic romano fries...my kids woofed those down in 2 seconds and the stuffed pizza Skyline version.  I would've liked to have had more meat in the pizza, but it was good, didn't have any leftovers so I know the kids liked it. We will def go back to try other pizzas for sure..All in all Metro saved our family nite out dinner!!!  Good customer service too.Really good food, service, atmosphere! Pricey.Definitely the dive bar to go to in Vegas.  Bartenders are friendly, drinks are cheap, and the food next door is pretty great!

Low pressure, wasn't loud.  Just make sure to order a water from the tap.  Otherwise you are paying $2 for 8oz of water!

Not touristy at all, not worth leaving the strip for, but if you end up around it, for sure worth the stop.  If I moved to Vegas it would be my local dive.I went to my first Wranglers Hockey game recently and I had an EXCELLENT time. We attended on a Tuesday night, the arena was clean and the staff was friendly. Food and beverage were decently priced for a casino arena. Seats were close! Prices were affordable. Attendance for the game...I couldn't say if this was normal or not because it was my first an only game, the place was "empty" in my opinion. BUT the people who did attend were good fans! Cheering, paying attention to the game (super important!), general hockey heckling. It was wonderful :)

I will certainly return for another game. I'm glad I had a chance to attend and find another fun local Sport to watch in Vegas.Its tough to theater hop in here.  But its conveniently located in vegas.  I will be back for sure.  The seats are plush and comfy for a large personGreat Mexican restaurant! We used to go for margaritas when it was a tiny hole in the wall restaurant that had a few tables and 5 bar stools! After moving to the big location in the Wal-Mart parking lot it lost a little bit of appeal as it's always packed and not quite as quaint.
Start you off with the traditional chips, salsa & bean dip. Traditional soup before your meal and then dig in! We've had multiple offerings here on multiple occasions and the one thing that always stand out above everything else is the INCREDIBLE customer service we receive from our server! I highly recommend going as we are tonight!Went for lunch and had a nice meal.  I wouldn't say it was the best I have ever had, but certainly not the worst either.  It was very busy, but the service was still good.  Good sized portions.I love Tropical Smoothie! Their food is delicious and healthy, and it's one of my favorite lunch spots. The employees at this particular location suck to put it politely. They are constantly screwing up my order, giving me the wrong thing, or they simply take forever to make a flipping salad when the place is empty. 

Favorites:
*Grilled Chicken Caesar salad (site claims it's 100 calories without dressing.. it's way too yummy to be only 100 calories!)
*Pineapple Delight Smoothie (under 200 calories)We trust our dogs being treated here. Very knowledgeable and friendly staff.This little thrift store is tucked away in a Plaza and easy to miss! (next to toys r us)

For such a tiny store, it's loaded with cheap knick knacks, clothing, quilts, books and much more. Definitely a hidden little gem of a thrift shop that's worth a trip!Good Stromboli! And my Dad really liked his Calzone. That said, it's pretty much a dive bar. Had our waitress not been so nice and attentive this might have been a 3 star review. The place is clean enough, but it is old and needs and update. The layout is kinda weird with the glassed-in bar area seperating the dining room. But then again you're not here for the ambience, you're here for the really good and inexpensive pizza pockets!I love this place!  I am only here for the aquatics and they are wonderful.  They have a fountain splash for the kids and a giant slide ala water park for them as well. I love the lap pool. 

Staff is amazing!  Hours are good as well.I really like this place. I get to tell everyone that I met celebrities and got to take pictures with them. And also I get to have the *&^^%^%$ scared out of me. 

They have loads of celebrities to take pictures with. You can take as many pictures as you want and you can touch the wax figures lightly. 

They also have this section called "scream" which interactive. They put you in this dark room and have you go in groups. You have to keep your hands on the other person's shoulder in front of you. And they have actual people come out and scare you. Scary, but fun as well. 

The only thing I didn't like about this place was that it was a little too short. And it gets crowded sometimes so you have to wait a while before getting to take a picture with the wax figure you want. 

Overall: I would recommend this place if you want to kill some time and you brought the tickets from Tix4Tonight because then it would be really cheap.You're walking down the Vegas strip in the blistering heat and you see all these people with gigantic frozen alcoholic drinks that look delicious! Of course now you want one too, but where to get it?
There are many places that offer these drinks, but hands down, Fat Tuesday is the best!
Ask for sampling before you order though - if you're going to be drinking that much of one or two flavors, you better make sure it's a good one. 
My favorite: Bellini! (peachy goodness)
There's not much alcohol in these, so don't be expecting a huge buzz. But they're a fun way to beat the heat while walking around the strip and taste pretty delicious. I recommend sharing a larger one - better for the price, and chances are, you won't want to drink the whole thing yourself anyway.If you're in the mood for tapas. Check out Firefly on Paradise next time you're in Las Vegas. Located off the strip and away from all the riff raff, Firefly offers yummy ceviche of red snapper, stuffed dates, roasted eggplant canneloni, tuna carpaccio, baked shrimp with roasted garlic cream, chorizo clams, empanadillas, skewer of beef, and so much more. 

I had a great experience here, much better than any of the overpriced fine dining restaurants in Vegas.

With excellent service and reasonable prices. Tourists, venture off of Las Vegas Blvd and onto Paradise Road!!This place is fun and has great food.  I had the Crispy duck roll, Firefly fries, Empanadas, and the Mac n Cheese.  Very tasty.

I will say that I prefer not to go when it's busy. A. The line gets long.  B. It's really loud.  This is the only reason for the 4 stars. :-)

Also, the service has also improved since the last time I was here.  Normally I have to ask for my drink to be refilled.  The buser was right on it this time, filling my drink 3 times.I stayed at Harrah's this week for one night and was surprised how nice it was compared to the price I paid.  There was a 10-12 min wait for check in, but that would be the biggest complaint. The room was clean and comfortable and even had a nice view of the volcano at the Mirage.  Parking was convenient (free!).     My friends on expense accounts stayed at Paris and Cesaers for 3-4 times what I paid and I didn't think they got 3-4x the value.Great location and they have a lot of Penny slots. The room was nice. Didn't like we were on a lower floor; however, we only used the room to catch some sleep and spent most of the time outside. The location and the price of the hotel is what got us to stay, and would come again. (Stayed on 03/14/13).Slots a plenty! I would give another star if they still had the Star Trek penny slot machine but since it's now gone I have to call it what it is. Still, there is a ton of gambling to be done here so get on with it!

I have never stayed in the rooms but from what I know about other Harrah's locations they are all pretty solid. Plus, the location of this joint is great - center strip and easy access to all the fun sights and sounds Vegas has to offer.

When it comes to gambling I'm definitely a slot kinda guy. They have so many here it's hard to decide which game to play. But, some of the fun interactive ones are great - LIFE, Star Wars, Gone Fishin', Dolly Parton even has her own machine so you gotta play that one.

I also found that the cocktail serves are really on top of getting those drinks out to people who are gambling. Unlike other casinos where you have to snare a waitress with a net Harrah's will keep keep you well lubricated.

It seems that every time I'm in Vegas we have to make a stop at Harrah's. It's got a great theme - Mardi Gras so laissez les bon temps rouler!I stopped by for lunch here and it was pretty good.  I sat over at the patio cafe part of the restaurant which was cool for people watching while I waited for my order.  Ordered the Shrimp Po' Boy Sandwich.  I can't really say it was the best Po' Boy sandwich I ever had, but it was pretty good.  Lots of shrimp.  Then ordered their creme brulee for dessert that looked great and tasted great.  I wished I had taken photos to show you guys, but that was the time when I lost my camera...ugh!!!!  Overall I think it was a little too overpriced for what I had for lunch, but the service was top notch for me and the "outdoor" cafe atmosphere justified the price.  I want to go back again to try out their dinner menu.it was good..i loved the calamari ..You MUST eat here if you visit The Venetian in Vegas. Looking back, I don't think that I've ever skipped lunch/dinner at this joint on any of my visits to Vegas since 2002. The most awesome part about dining here is the fact that you're eating delicious food and drinking bomb-azz sangria right next to the Grand Canal, serenaded by the gondola singers and getting that awesome water reflection off the roof and the lights surrounding the area.

I want to quote About.com's review on Taqueria Canonita (because this is exactly how I feel and couldn't describe it better):
"This inspired eatery takes the flavors of Old Mexico and serves them with an exciting, New American ambiance- all beside the gracefully flowing Grand Canal. Experience true "south of the border" taste and tradition with authentic Mexican offerings like chile rellenos, tacos al carbon or shrimp quesadillas. The taste of their hand-made corn tortillas alone is enough to transport you to another world. The dcor is as vivid as the menu with casual ambiance, high ceilings and bright, bold colors. Taqueria Caonita's lively exhibition kitchen is the restaurant's centerpiece. Enjoy your meal amidst the sculpted steel and wrought-iron gates, colorful Mexican tiles and authentic Mexican folk art. Even better, Taqueria Caonita's patio is set beside the Grand Canal, offering terrific views of our Venetian streetscapes and passing gondolas."

I would also like to add that 90% of the servers who work here are easy on the eyes and know what customer service is all about ;) which makes for an even better dining experience.Stayed here for 1 night recently to attend a trade show at the convention center and had a great experience.  We arrived 5 hours before check-in and took a chance that they'd have a room ready - they did!  Complimentary coffee in the lobby in the mornings; icy cold lemon water all day (a lifesaver after the short but desperately hot walk from the convention floor).  

All the rooms here are little 2-rm suites and super cute.  The bed was unbelievably comfy and I had the best night's sleep, I was sorry to leave it. Every time you re-enter the lobby, the staff at the front desk welcome you back - although they're clearly trained to do so, they delivered it in a way that seemed sincere and it felt nice. 

The rates were fantastic for a last minute Sat night stay; the pool is small but  - well, at least they have one, I don't know how people live in the heat out there!

Off the beaten path, but still well within walking distance to the strip (for the able-bodied or rascal-equipped) and a nice quite casino-free respite from it as well.

Definitely going back.The service will keep me coming back, the food was mixed.

My date and I were running behind and Circo staff kindly honored our reservation even though we were about 30 minutes late.  We had a great seat by the window which allowed us to catch some of the fountain show over dinner.  The ambiance was definitely bright and festive, and while it wasn't to my particular taste, it was fun and fit in with all the over-the-topness that Vegas is.

The cocktails were poured stiff which I enjoyed but is definitely a matter of taste.  As we were running a little late and were supposed to catch "O" later, we were prompt with our orders and our waitress was very accommodating and friendly given our time-crunch.

We started with the Beef Carpaccio and both enjoyed it.  It was a nice and light starter though slightly on the salty side.  Next up, was a Sausage and Vegetable Risotto for my date and Pan-seared Scallops with truffle for myself, both specials of the day.

My Pan-seared Scallops were mostly fantastic (one scallop was smaller and turned out a little rubbery and over-cooked), and the truffles were absolutely delicious as expected.  The green beans were simple and prepared aldente.

The Risotto on the other hand was pretty bad, as the rice was very noticeably undercooked.  In hindsight, given our time-crunch, perhaps Risotto wasn't the best selection we could have made, but there you go.  When the manager came by and asked how everything was, we let him know about the Risotto.  He apologized and asked if we would like a different entree instead, noting that he could have any pasta dish ready in five minutes.  We thanked him but declined as we were in a hurry.

When the bill came he let us know he removed the Risotto from the bill which was entirely unnecessary.  Every interaction we had with the staff of the restaurant (host, waitress, manager) stood out as exemplary in an era where I find service to generally be poor.  Hence I am giving Circo the benefit of the doubt with four-stars.  I simply docked one-star for a poor dish.  I will be back and update my review at that time.I stayed at New York - New York and went to a trade show at the convention center.  It was 100 degrees out and the monorail was nicer than walking and cheaper than a taxi.  But if you're staying anywhere near the MGM, NY-NY, Excalibur, etc., you have to wander through the maze that is the MGM Grand to get to the monorail station.  And when you get to the convention center, it's still a hike to the convention center's north halls.  I like the monorail, but I wish they had made it a little more convenient.  And if you're trying to get down to Mandalay Bay or Luxor, you're out of luck because the MGM is as far south as it goes.

It went where I needed to go and the A/C was working so I'm a fan.  But they could have done so much better.We visited this place for brunch and was seated at this booth in an alcove.  It was nice & intimate, but service was slow (thankfully we weren't in a rush to get anywhere).  I'm a huge fan of panini & immediately knew what I wanted - the Panini Di Melanzane (eggplant).  

When I received it, I was both disappointed & amazed.  It wasn't a grilled panini like I'm used to, but it was a large sandwich (possibly 10-12 in) that tasted delicious!Came here after the longest plane ride ever from Charlotte. Rode around and discovered Bahama Breeze. Me and my friend figured that since the parking lot was full at 2pm on a Friday afternoon...the food must be pretty good. We decided to order our food To-Go and the hostess was very helpful offering some recommendations. We order and we sit around chatting and people watching. After 15 minutes, our food is ready!

I ordered the Oak Grilled Chicken Sandwich with lettuce, tomato and goat cheese on Ciabatta bread....AMAZING! The chicken was tender and juicy and well seasoned. The cheese was slightly melted and the lettuce and tomato were fresh and tasty! I ordered the tomato, basil and balsamic vinegarette salad on the side. I ate that on the way back to the resort so fast..I couldnt really tell you how it tasted...so I assume it was good. After the sandwich and and ice cold beer, I slept for hours :) 

Bahama Breeze?? You have a satisfied customer here! Now...build a restaurant in Virginia/DC area please!!Macy's Tip - Visiting a Macy's out of town? Go to gift wrap and pick up a visitors pass that can save you an additional 11%.  If you find the good sales people they will combine coupons and do magical things. 

The Macy's Mens section at FSM is decent although it does not compare to Orange County, SF, or NYC.

Macy's has a great return policy for their card holders as well.Thank you yelpers , finally found some mabo tofu ramen , and it was exceptional.
      The noodles was cooked perfect, it had a nice bite and chew to it.  The mabo tofu was full of ground pork and soft tofu, it had jus the right amount of heat for me. 
               I also had the spicy tuna bowl, the tuna had little flavor or spice to it. The tuna did not look or taste like it was the freshest , it was not bad tuna jus not the best.    I would come back for the mabo tofu in a second  , it was almost perfection .Awesome old-school style & good food. Usually busy, but the wait isn't generally long. Great staff and you can expect to pay from about $30. to 50.00 / person, depending on what you want. The salad, bread, table wine & a cappuccino to top things off are included in the main course price. Worth the walk.Good, solid Italian food is what brings me back to Battista's when I'm in Vegas. The menu is posted on the wall and all meals include wine (your choice of red or white), salad and their amazing garlic bread. I recommend the egglpant parm which is baked with the right amounts of sauce and cheese. While the wine is nothing to write home about, its good enough and goes well with anything on the menu. If you're heading out for a night of drinking on the strip, Battista's is a good first stop for a hearty meal.We have come into this store probably a total of 5 times these past 6 months for either servicing for my man's watch, shopping for his wedding band or christmas shopping for my sister-in-law.  We have always been greeted warmly by each associate.  They are very helpful in showing us their selection in jewelry and don't at all make us feel pressured to buy anything.  Today, we even tried on a few more wedding bands and found one for the fiancé.

Conclusion:  Definitely better service and much better selection than the Fred Meyer inside the mall.Date: November 22, 2009
Good: Scenery & Nearby music along with the setting of Italy, service was excellent. 
Bad: Not many food selections and can be expensive Ex. Spaghetti $37, food above average but nothing great
Summary: Would recommended if your looking for a nice setting with great service.Great food and got seated right away on a Friday evening as long as you don't care that you are seated inside vs. out in the courtyard area. 

Service wasn't too bad and prices were better than some of the other restaurants surrounding the Venetian. Came here with my family and we certainly enjoyed ourselves! The bread selection with oil was quite tasty.

Ordered the rib-eye medium rare and it was cooked to perfection. Very juicy and melted in your mouth. It was plenty food for nearly two to share. Also had a glass of the 'blend 175' wine that went down nice and smooth with my meal. 

Tried some pasta as well which was cooked nicely with mushrooms, pork, and bacon. YUM! What a treat. 

4 people's meals plus a drink each and we escaped for around $180. Really not to shabby!I am writing this review from my room on the 58th floor.  With floor-to-ceiling windows in every room, request a room on as high a floor as possible to enjoy the panoramic view.  On the West side of the hotel (odd-numbered rooms), the view is of the majestic mountain range hiding Death Valley (some have snow on them today even though it is nearly 80 degrees on the Strip!) and the Red Rock Canyon National Preserve.  On the East side, you can catch the sunrise over Wynn's golf course and country club.

Mr. Wynn has been described as someone with an eye for every detail; as far as I can see, this appears to be true.  This hotel is beautiful, spacious and clean, with sumptuous amenities and lively character and decor.  It's an *almost* eccentric mix of flowers, curlicues and both feminine and masculine colors -- a bit odd, like Warhol meets Dr. Seuss, but it works.

For the business traveler, there is high-speed Internet connection for $12 / day and a (unbelievably costly to use) fax machine in each room.  As far as room prices go, I probably wouldn't put this on the weekend "value" list, but I would stay here in a heartbeat for midweek rates.The Wynn is absolutely beautiful.  The food, service, and the rooms was just fantastic. Rooms are huge, bathrooms are big w/ his and her sink, a soaking tub, a shower, toliet in a seperate room, and a freakin' TV in the bathroom. 

What I love about the Wynn is the Manolo Blahnik store! I came out w/ three pairs of shoes! Of course they have your standard LV ,Chanel, and Cartier Store, but I can never find a Manolo store in the bay area!!!

Le Reve is the show that plays at the Wynn. It's a-OK, nothing spectacular. Therefore I cannot comment anymore on the show.

Tryst was fun to hang out. The waterfall is pretty, but expect drinks and bottle service to very expensive. You can run up the bill to at least $600 for a night of partying alone at the Tryst. 

The Wynn Spa is surprisingly small. I did not feel relaxed at all at the spa. I felt like they packed us in like sardines and the facilities was just way too over crowded.I stayed a night at the Palazzo followed by a night at the Wynn, and I have to say - I was disappointed!  The Wynn is just not as nice.  Our rooms were smaller and less pretty, and there was entirely too much salmon-colored paint all around.  Still, a gorgeous hotel, and I might have gone with 5 stars had I not had the Palazzo to compare it with.  The casino is great, though don't bother looking for $5 blackjack.  (Don't judge.  $5 blackjack rules.)This really is a luxury hotel and the decor takes Vegas to a new level.. one that is less gawdy and tacky...  the decor is more modern and yet extremely whimsical.. take a tour, even if you are not staying at the hotel..  make it a point to do a walk through and stop at Parasol Up/Down for a drink..  Daniel Bouloud for a meal... or just enjoy the general casino area..  

The rooms are sweet..Is this my favorite venue for attending conventions?  Nah, but I still like the place.  It's in Vegas so that's always a plus.

Another positive fact is that it is located between the Palazzo Hotel and the Venetian Hotel.  So, if you get bored at the convention....then you can head on over to the casino!  Oh yeah!

Seriously, though, this convention center is very nice.  It's huge and clean.  Be prepared to walk to get to the meeting room or hall that you need to go to here.  It can be confusing at first because it is such a large place.  After the first time here, it's no problemo.Neat to walk threw but the merchandise is extremely high priced.  They are very talented.Hey not too shabby though our waitress was kinda cranky. But you probably would be too if you worked around cheapskates like me for the past 35 years. 

Definitely an adventure and worth the hike. No we did not get sick. Would go back again.they were the best, service was great, and the manager came around and ask how we was doing, that made it even better. keep up the great service we will be going back soon.I actually love this place. I have stayed here many times over the years. I will say some of the rooms are very old and in need of some repair. Old caulk in the bathrooms and older TV in the rooms, but who goes to Vegas to watch TV? The check-in is pretty slow and during peak times needs to have a few more people working the desk despite the check-in machines. The end of The Strip that The Riv is on is in need of serious CPR but everything is a short taxi ride away. I have never had bad service at this place. The valet remembered what car I rented 5 years ago. Cocktail service is fast . Nick at the Le Bistro bar makes great drinks and has great stories about Sinatra and because he knows the city like the back of his hand has always makes good recommendations on everything. Speaking of Sinatra...this is one of the few casinos left that Frank and Dino played. I say give it a try. When you are asleep you can't tell the difference between this old time gem and a 250.00 dollar a night cookie cutter casino further down the strip. Have and will continue to recommend this casino.We stayed here pretty cheap. We were in the Mediterranean Tower and it was vwery clean and nice. No smells or problems that I could see. There is no real view except the clown from Circus Circus. Room service was quick and efficient. I would definately stay here again and I have never stayed at the same place twice in Vegas. Thw casino itself is another story.Good place to go to after a night of partying.  Fast, yummy and perfect to eat when you don't want to feel like shit the next morning.  It's just a good and cheap alternative to the other places that vegas has."I'm fly at Fat Burger when I'm way out west" - Beastie Boys

And this spot on the Strip is the best.  It has a huge outdoor patio with a bar and tv's.  No other Fatburger that I've been to does it like this.  Fatburger isn't my favorite, but it is pretty good.  There is an indoor part of this Fatburger, but what's the point of that?

But really, everything tastes better outside, with a beer, and watching a game.This is one of those places that I really wanna hate but just can't!  In my heart, i don't believe any candy deserves its very own four story megastore in the heart of the Las Vegas strip.  And everything is so damn overpriced! 13 bucks for a pound of m&m's? I dont care what color they are, they're all gonna be the same color in the end =0

So why am I giving this place 4 stars? Look around......everyone has a smile on their face. At least we can drop a hundred bucks here and get something out of it, unlike the blackjack tables.  Hell, they even have a free 3-D show that aint that great but it will give you something to do after you blow all your money at Bills Gamblin' Hall. And if you're quick enough, you can take home a pair of souvenir 3-D glasses!I love the free 3D movie and the factory-themed area you walk through to get to it. The movie is pretty funny and enjoyable. 

Yes, the wall of M&Ms are overpriced. I still love that you can get exclusive colors, mixes and prints here. Last time I was there I stocked up on "Viva Las Vegas" candies with Green (the girl M&M) on the back of them.  I remember back in 2000 they had a special Millennium mix of black, white, silver and gray. It was awesome. 

It's a definite must-see, especially with the family. You don't have to buy the full $13 pound. You can just get a tiny bit if you can resist the temptation!== M & M's World==
M & M's MmmMmmLand.. This is purely for M&M fanatics and more. There is not one M&M item you can't find in this store. There's more than 3 floors of goodness for you. All the colors of the rainbow of M&M's to buy, M&M slot machine toys, magnets, mugs, dolls, and much much more. M&M Name tags? Sure they have it. M&M keychains? They got it! 

Located right across from New York New York. You'll bound to walk pass this. 

Very pricey, what do you expect in Vegas baby.holy shit why hasnt anyone told me about this place?  
have i died and gone to reno?
after a whole day of completely not winning we stumbled in here broke and defeated.
4 dollar roulette, 5 dollar blackjack and booze prices you can really sink your liver into.
im stoked i found out about this place because i will be back.
only next time more charlie......This casino is not upscale with great decor and fancy people - BUT the blackjack tables and dealers were so much FUN!  I played on a $5 table for hours and almost got drunk.  The drinks were nice, waitress and dealers very friendly and fun.  Not a stuffy place - won't stay at the hotel but I will definitely gamble here. I lost money but had a great time doing it!Yummmmmmmm  eeeeeeeee!  Taste eeeeeeee!You know you haven't truly lived until you've taken a cab from the airport and, while on route to the Bellagio, you ask the driver to stop somewhere so you can buy a 1.75 Liter of Stoli.   So he stops at the Office Bar and, sure enough, you can score booze by the bottle and they even sell ice, diet sprite, and they'll throw in some plastic cups.

And you truly haven't lived if you experience all this because, as you were waiting patiently in seat 34-A for your flight to take you home to Oakland, you got kicked off the flight because some of your friends were too fucking drunk to fly!!  Oh, and of course, it's these same friends that requested that we stop for the booze...

I swear somebody was channeling Hunter S. Thompson this weekend.I love Harley-Davidson products. I have the belts, boots, jackets, shirts and all sorts of stuff.  I just need a bike! LOL.
I liked this place.  The interior decor was amazing. Circulating thoughout the café were 6 or 7 classic HD motorbikes traveling on a conveyor belt system.
I'll go there again.I am a sucker for choreographed dancing, so I had to check this place out.

After a $10 cover, and a few $6 beers, I was ready to dance!  

This place is fun if you want to dance on the bar and get free shots.  I only danced on the bar for a few songs, and I got a lot of free shots, and I was very happy about that.  

Yes, I agree that the crowd is not that attractive.  However, on the plus side, if you are even a little cute and you've been to the gym in the past year, you'll feel like one of the most beautiful people in the bar.  And that is kind of fun.  :-)

The bartender/dancer girls work hard to make sure that everyone is drinking and having a good time.  Also, the bouncers are hilarious!  However, I wish that the bartenders would have done more of their choreographed dances...Been to this place once,
the steaks are good, the house
aged sirloin  was big, dry, hard
and tasted great, good flavor. But
again, it was hard and dry. I guess they
have not perfected their dry aging process.
Sides dishes were top notch and, big enough to
share. I also tried their ribeye, very good, but
it didn't make my jaw drop like the steaks at Strip steak, or the 9.Was not impressed with the bone in strip steak. Was really tough. Out of the 3 strip steaks 2 were done right and 1 was under done. The prime rib was out of this world however. Service was top notch as well. I would returnMy 5th visit to this place, and I still love it and with all the restaurant options in Vegas, it is still one of the top on my list.  I had lunch on this visit, which is a first for me.

The lunch menu is limited to 6-7 items.  Its great for me when menus are small and I don't have to really think.  I opted for the prime rib hoagie, which I believe is around $15.00.  It comes with chips and Au Ju sauce.

The sandwich is good, not great, but good enough for me to devour it quickly.  Considering this is a higher end place, the price was a pretty good deal and the portion was pretty large.

I also opted for a bloody mary.  The bartender handed me a menu and asked what I'd like in it.  Items range from bacon, slim jims, stuffed olives, and the rest of the standards.  Really good drink.  I believe the price is $8.00 for this meal in itself drink.

Next visit, I'm going back to my missed steak dinner.I've eaten at Kokomo several times and it has always been fantastic. Since the restaurant are in a rainforest can be a little cold, so remember to bring a sweater or jacket.

The food is very well prepared and the service is prompt and professional.I am basing my review only on the morning news... 

In the morning, you will hear the traffic report and basic weather info once every 10 minutes... on the 8s. That makes this the best news to listen to and/or watch in the mornings if you actually need to venture out of your house for work or anything else... 

I am a fan of keeping things simple, and that's what Channel 8 morning news does.A hidden gem of a steakhouse in one of the least impressive casino hotels on the Strip.  The Steakhouse oozes old school charm: red leather booths, dark wood paneling, and dim lighting.  Upon entering, we noted the dry age room with all sorts of cuts of beef.  We then saw the open kitchen in the middle of the restaurant -- a good sign.  This place doesn't have anything to hide!  

The meal: we started with the complimentary bread basket.  All were fresh and warm.  I particularly liked the raisin bread.  Hubby chose the caesar salad and I elected to opt out of choosing a salad.  :)  (N.B. This place is not à la carte!  Sides are included.)  My salmon filet was perfectly cooked and my accompanying mashed potatoes were creamy and buttery.  Hubby's porterhouse was tender and VERY GOOD.  I almost wished I ordered that myself.  The only less-than-stellar component of our dinners was the veg (that night, carrots).  No flavour.  Dessert was the chocolate mousse cake.  It's the only dessert not housemade, but it was still decadent and delicious.  Coffee was meh, happy hour wine was yay.

Good value for a steakhouse on the Strip, as you're paying for the meat/seafood AND sides.  Great place for a cozy dinner, romantic date, or splurge.  Service was very good.I am not much of a steakhouse fan, but I was cordially invited by Randal R. and his family to celebrate his graduation of dual masters degrees, an amazing feat!  The entire state of California seems to be related to him, so we had a sizable group in a private room.  Service was magnificent, and server Andrew knew this family well from its history with Del Frisco's.  This family racks up DF dining points like Eric R. obsesses over credit card points!

I enjoyed rose sparkling wine in the celebratory mode.  We started off with shrimp cocktail (which has this amazing shallot-butter sauce that was so yummy) and tuna tartare with toasts that had olive tapenade on them!  I believe there was a crudite tray but I did not seek it out.

Due to our large group, we had a set menu to choose from that was printed nicely at each place setting.  I started off with the house salad sans bacon, which came with avocado goddess dressing...yes!  Eric R. got the classic Caesar with anchovies.  Next, we both got filet (there were many entree options, but for steak 8 oz filet or 16 oz ribeye).  The filet was flavorful, perfectly tender, and cooked exactly like we wanted.  I ate my entire steak....yum!

The sides for the table included skillet potatoes (essentially house made chips) with caramelized onions on top (yes!) and green beans with garlic, also very good.  For dessert, a choice between strawberry cheesecake and chocolate mousse.  I had the mousse, and it was rather decadent.  I really enjoyed the experience, especially our visit to the James Bond table.

This restaurant is a labyrinth though, enormous and full of happy eaters.  When we got there it was early and quiet, but when I had to look for the restroom I got lost in a maze of people and hallways.  What a delicious way to celebrate educational success!Postrio is probably the 50 billionth Wolfgang Puck restaurant I've dined in but I have to say it has been my favorite. It is by far the best choice in the St. Mark's Square area of the Venetian. 

I was able to sample several of the dishes on my last trip to Vegas and the only disappointing part, as far as food is concerned, was the aioli that the pomme frites come with. I just wasn't into it. The shrimp cocktail was very filling, with incredibly jumbo shrimp, and a trip of dipping sauces. The pumpkin soup was fantastic, complete with pumpkin seeds. My husband ordered the fettuccine, which, despite what you may think is not in an alfredo sauce, and found it to be fantastic. I tried two of the salads (field greens and chef) and they were both very good and hearty enough to act as a lunch entree when paired with another appetizer or side. I loved the tapenade that came with the flatbread they serve to the table. 

They have a nice little wine by the glass list including a very good albarino. What I enjoyed the most was their diverse tea list. After selecting one I was most pleased to have the loose leaves steeped perfectly in a little cast iron tea pot delivered to my table. 

The one drawback here was service. During one of my lunch experiences here we waited nearly an hour for our food in a restaurant that was not very busy. However, slow service during lunch seems to be a hallmark of Wolfgang Puck restaurants so I should have known better.I  had a good lunch.  Located in the Venetian shoppes it was great for lunch.This is where my wife and I got married on 3/21/08.  Let me give you guys the rundown.

First, the price was pretty darn good--about half of what you would pay at one of the hotel/casinos on the Strip.  They don't have a casino, and that's fine for us.

The room was a two story unit with a jacuzzi tub halfway up the stairs.  It was like a little apartment and we really loved it.  Room service was fine, but one of the cleaning people took the top off of the complementary bottle of champagne that we were given for our wedding--this was disconcerting.  The hotel replaced it for no charge.

The one thing that I would not recommend is the restaurant in the lobby.  The menu was pretty monotonous and lacking in variety.  The steak I had was good but fairly fatty.  The vegetables were dry and flavorless, and the "jasmine rice" had no jasmine, only butter.  There was only one server, and service was pretty sparse despite the fact that there were few people in the restaurant at the time.

Overall, we had a wonderful experience at the Alexis Park and will go back.  I just recommend to all people going there:

1.  Watch your stuff

and

2.  Eat somewhere else.Let me start by saying, this was my first time having Indian food.  I was a little worried because I'm not too sure I like curry.  Didn't think I would like Indian food, but my mother-in-law wanted to do the lunch buffet for her birthday.  She and her husband spent a year and a half in India.

Wow!  With the exception of some chick pea salad thing, I liked everything on the buffet, and I basically tried everyting.  The Chicken tikka marsala or "butter chicken" was so yum.  My mom-in-law called around trying to find a lunch buffet with this dish and only India Palace had it, so score!  I also really liked the spinach.  Not sure what was in it, but it had a spicy kick.  There were also these vegetable fritter things which were great.  Sorry, I can't be more descriptive, but I was overwhelmed!

The service was great.  I believe the owner was waiting on us and he talked to the in-laws about India and really made it a good experience.  Cute decor.  Parking is tight.  Overall, I would definitely recommend this place.Food is very good, the owners are great,     but The Manager was unprofessional.  He may no longer be there..    We ordered a Groupon   and called in and explained that we had a groupon worth $30  and ordered  some food to go.  I clearly explained my groupon... and there was no problem with the TO Go order from the employee on the phone who was polite.

 After driving 20 Miles.... we arrived.  The manager said the Groupon is for dining in only.  I said... why did they not tell me that on the phone... as I told them I had a Groupon.... anyway... he did not want to  honor the promotion.. then I asked him his name... and he wouldn't tell me his name... He said they don't make any money on the Groupon...

 I said...then why do you offer it?   .... that is not my problem.... I bought it... ordered. and then drove 20 miles... and now he is not wanting to honor the promotion.   

Did you read the fine print ?  he asked..No I said.... instead, I called your restaurant and explained that I had a Groupon and they took my order.... and I in good faith came all this way expecting a smile and a thank you... and now I get a No.... and he was very  mean to me... disrespectful... not being considerate at all...

Of course this upset me..... and I began to raise my voice..... Then he was upset that I raised my voice in his restaurant.... I told him... I did not come here to raise my voice... I came here for some Tikka Masala... but I will never come here again... trust me.....

It is unfortunate... that they have such good food here....yet... the Manager is a hothead, and I feel sorry for the employees that have to work for him.  The poor guy that took my order... oh my.... he is going to get the wrath!

He did not want to listen to anything I said.... In spite of it all I still tipped him $3 just because I am someone that has worked in the Restaurant industry, and I follow the golden rule... but I will tell you, this Manager was a real jerk.

Now....there are  so many restaurants out there that would love to have a customer that drives 20 miles to come to them... and they will do everything in their power to make that customer feel special.  

This manager  threatened to call the Police on me... can you believe that?    Wow...
If he worked for me I would fire him so fast..... 

Anyway.... This is a good restaurant and they have good food... and I am sure the owners are good people..... They need to help their people understand the promotions, and then make sure that every customer interaction is  appreciated. 
  
I really like the food... It is unfortunate that I have had so much grief here....  I blame the Manager... No CS skills whatsoever.... :(

Anyway... I do think this is a good restaurant...

The owner call me up after this an apologized for the experience I had.  I thanked him for the call.   This is a lovely restaurant, and the food is fantastic.....I say go ahead and give them another chance....We came on a Friday night and ordered 
1. Vegetable samosa appetizer $4.50
2. Tandoori Chicken dinner $25.95
for $5 (Used the $15 groupon to get $30 credit, came out to $.49)

- Seated right away. Fancy restaurant. Dim-lighting. Wine style cup glasses. 
- Edwin was a friendly server! He seemed to appreciate that we came in to eat Indian food and made sure that our drinks were refilled and the food made to our liking
- They didn't have the lamb samosa tonight, which we were a bit disappointed so we ended up with the vegetable. Comes with 2. Cooked fresh and crispy. 
- You are given complimentary flat bread and 3 types of sauces, mild, med, hot. Flat bread tasted a bit burnt, but crispy. 
- Garlic naan was fluffy 
- chicken soup was watery but spicy. 
- Mango dessert was good. Tasted like Filipino fruit salad. 
- Fried vegetables were a bit smushy.
- Tandoori chicken was a slighly dry and the onoins were grilled inconsistently, undercooked or overcooked.  
- India Masala and Mint Bistro packs more flavor for my liking than India Palace, but nonetheless, still a good eat especially with the Groupon!I was bought here a while ago with a friend. I've never eaten Indian food. I'm hooked. This buffet style lets you check out other flavored and spices. I'd come here before 3:00 pm. The buffet starts going down hill. I've never ordered off the menu. Why? When you have so many great flavored at the buffet. I like this place. It's clean cheap and good. So many flavor hit you palette it's not even funny. I'd recommend this place to at least try it out. Olmoosedog out.Because the Groupon wasn't allowed to use for lunch buffet, we went for normal entree menus. And glad we did!

Items selected:

- Masala Dosa: Thin crispy rice crepes filled with deliciously spiced potatoes & onions
- Chicken Tikka Masala: Tandoori white chicken marinated in yogurt & spices, simmered in a creamy tomato sauce
- Mango Lassi: Check-in bonus!

For Dosa, my all time favorite has been http://www.dosasf.com in SF, but India Palace does it in a different way. More crispy and lighter, which was really good!

Chicken Tikka Masala was also very good, and the naan was tasty. For basic items, execution is everything and they did quite well. Fresh and hot, no stale leftovers we usually see in lunch buffet were observed.

I'll return for the dosa.Oh Vegas... how sinful you are.

I was here a couple of weeks again for my best guy friend's bachelor party, and yes, I am a girl. There were actually three girls in the party. We were the coolest ones.

But anyway, we hopped onto one of those free shuttle/party buses to the stripclub. There was a pole inside the bus... how classy!

We got there and I had no idea what to expect, but honestly it just looked like an upscale strip club with lots of couches and tables with a bar on the side and a few stages for the dancers.

I really didn't know how the system worked but apparently there are like about a hundred girls at any given time walking around in bikinis/lingerie trying to solicit lapdances. Some of them were really gorgeous, but most of them had fake boobs. As a girl, I'm not a huge fan of the plastic, but hey, whatever suits people's boats.

The music was pretty good, they played a lot of top 40s and Billboard hits. We all pitched in and got a booth area so we could sit and drink at. Bottle service was pretty good, our server lady was good about refilling our glasses with mixed drinks and asking us politely. That was appreciated!

Anyway, I heard Spearmint Rhino is a lot better, but this was a cool experience nonetheless.Great to find cheap food on the strip.  $6- for a burrito that's super filling.

The location is to be desired (under McDonalds (2nd floor) and shared dining area with Panda Express and some pizza place).

There's also always bums hanging around outside, but that didn't take away from not spending $$ on food.As good as always

and for its location a gold mine of savings.

I dont think they have their full menu there, mostly their regular burritos and salad; no kids menu

But its inside a food court with a panda express and pizza so you can please everyone :DI stayed here for a conference. After staying at the Imperial Palace (which I recommend everyone to avoid at all costs), I may be giving the Westin a nicer review than I would normally.

Overall, I thought this hotel was great. It's smoke free except for the casino area, which is pretty much impossible to find in Vegas. The standard room I stayed in was fairly large. The bathroom and beds were really nice and everything looked clean. The bed had one of the nicest comforters I've used at a hotel - it was fairly comfortable, and I definitely got a good night's sleep (probably because I was so tired from the weekend).

All in all, it's a great business hotel. I did a prepaid deal (no refund if I canceled), which gave me a great rate on the room. The internet was pretty ridiculous at $14 per day, but I guess that's to be expected.First of all they have, incredible customer service. The Fashion Show store in Las Vegas has an extensive collection of accessories, great salon shoes, and an amazing beauty counter. The staff is knowledgeable and friendly and willing to offer you help even if it's outside of Nordstrom.I had enough crappy cheap food during my Vegas trip and wanted some real Prime Rib. This is the place. It's not UDSA Choice (or lower) rib roast. It's Prime!

The service was outstanding and it shows that this is the standard. We had the spinning salad and the creamed spinach. Both were fantastic and loved the creamed spinach.

Yes, it's a bit pricey but the experience with something the family will rememberwe were recommended to this place by our friend.. its a big cafe like place.. affordable.. they had a special with a soup, half sandwich, and potato salad.. big portions... the sandwich was kind of plain i though.. just 2 pieces of bread with some cheese and a TON of meat..  the clam chowder soup was well worth the money... only $10I love this place for lunch, but wasn't a big fan of dinner. It's great for a lunch time rendezvous with that special someone, but for dinner there are other places i would recommend. Lunch offered great service, excellent bartender, fabulous bread offering, and reasonable prices for exceptional food. Dinner was crowded, our server seemed overburdened, the bread was mediocre, and the bill was twice as much. Definitely a lunch place.We stayed here list year (Nov 2011) my dad and I both really liked it.   The WiFi is a bit spotty, do bring a signal amplifier if you have one.  The restrooms are spectacular! I was dying to try out their salt water pool,  but sadly, it was closed.

Its a higher price at about $35Ishtar a night and is north of downtown Las Vegas.  It was really nice and is pet friendly with a tiny dog walk area.  The mini golf is not worth mentioning as it's smaller than the size of a super compact car. 

Totally recommend this park.  You can easily find cheaper if you look but this is one of the nicer resorts we have been to.Everyone is really nice here. The only issue I have is that they don't understand my order and when I get my food, I have missing items. But overall, they are still really nice.Fast. Friendly. Affordable. Located somewhat off the strip and open later than most garages, it's a good place to have your car towed to off the 15.  

Make sure to have your AAA card ready for a discount. The place is clean and open the two guys that run the place are really nice. They aren't the most technologically advanced fellows but they get the job done. 

If you are driving into Vegas and unexpectedly need work done, ask these guys first.I've been coming here ever since the place opened in the mid 90's.  I use to live a few blocks away.  Since I moved a couple of years ago, I've only been here once or twice a year.  Since I was in the area, I decided to stop by for lunch today.

I ordered the #1 Sandwich (Ham, Salami, Capicolla, Pepperoni & Provolone Cheese) and a bag of Jalapeno Chips.  The Sandwich was made fresh and tasted delicious!

Solid experience, just like I remember.

Will I return?  When I'm in the area, sure!This is my favorite 99 Cent Store in town because of its huge selection. They have things that the other 99 Cent Stores don't have. I know I'm semi-crazy for knowing that. The employees aren't always the friendliest, but I don't really mind as long as the line is moving. 

I purchased some chips here once, but didn't bother to look at the expiration date. They expired before I could eat 'em and I had only the chips for less than a month.  The best things to get here are school supplies, seasonal decorations, and gift bags.

But, if you don't find what you need here, there's a Dollar Tree in the same shopping center.If I had the money I'd enjoy coming here to find supplies to build all sorts of stuff. I built my raised garden beds and went through my carpentry phase at Home Depot stores. The stores are clean, aisles wide, and employees are friendly.  I came here looking for a certain type of tile and they were kind enough to refer me to a competitor when they couldn't help.Full disclosure: Sentimental favorite. We went to the original on Maryland Parkway when my wife and I were dating 15 years ago. It was a treat for us poor college kids. When we vacation in Vegas once a year or so, Paymon's is always a must do. 

The fried calamari appetizer is well done. Nothing to rave about, but it's good. The real draw, for us, is:

The "gyros in pita" is awesome. Lots of meat, plenty of veg, and a wonderful tzatziki sauce. Always pair it with Athens fries. 

Overall, the food here is fresh and clean, with nice Med flavors. There's something here for everyone, including vegetarians and carnivores. This place is just solid: Never had a bad experience here in over 15 years!I had seen this place for quite some time, but I had not tried it.  My mother in law and brother in law had and spoke highly of it, so tonight was our night to give it a try.

It was a bit busy, there were several big tables reserved and/or seated already, but we were able to get a table.  We started with a couple of apps, the first were the Athen's fries, it had been given many good reviews, but they were just well seasoned fries with a dipping sauce other than ketchup.  The second app was the a combination of hummus and baba ganosh, now these were both good!

For my entree I ordered Moussaka, it was a layered casserole of sliced eggplant, onions, potato, ground beef, fresh herbs and spices, covered with behamel sauce and served on basmati rice and vegetables.  I really enjoyed this.

Overall, a good experience, service was excellent, the food was flavorable and met my expectations, but a bit pricey .I love Mediterranean food and I have been looking forward to trying Paymon's.

My Persian friends tell me it is not authentic and there are better places, but we went anyway.

I booked using Open Table and as we got to the restaurant we were expected and warmly welcomed.

Or server was charming and she explained the menu and helped us pick a couple of plainer dishes for our coddled and spoiled unadventurous children.

Wifee and I ordered a selection of kebabs,gyros etc. It was fine not fantastic but we enjoyed. Also worthy of mention are the Athens Fries, great seasoning! 

Friendly place with above average food and very large portions in an easy location for us suburbanites .Charlies Lakeside is a great place. They have a quaint dining area with a fireplace that is romantic and cozy. The food is great and they have some unique items on the menu that I always know to go here for when I crave them. The service is great, I never wait and my drinks are always being refilled! Staff is fast and friendly with great dinner recommendations. Price is just right and specials are great deals. 
Love coming here to meet my family for dinner or a nice romantic night with my boyfriend. 
Highly recommended by me!!The salads here are very underrated!  I opt for the chicked ranch every time.  Add the homemade hot sauce with some fresh limes and wow not a bad lunch for like 6 bucks!

I'm a fan!I'd been to Sushi Fever many times in the past but had stopped for the last couple of years. Yesterday I had a meeting on that side of town and my friend Octavio P. and I decided to go to Sushi Fever for lunch. He has been here many times for lunch and had raved about their bento box. 

First off, it is 8.95, so already that's a good thing. You get to choose from two proteins, I chose fish tempura and yakitori and it also comes with miso soup, a spring roll, a California roll, gyoza, rice and salad. Wow, was I super impressed. Everything tasted great and the portions were decent as well. For that price you would expect lesser quality so I was stunned at how good everything was. Too bad it's on the other side of town otherwise I would be in here every week.Absolute delight. 

I was pleasantly surprised by the food they serve. From the outside, it is in a non-descript strip mall far removed from the lights and glitter of the Las Vegas Strip. It almost felt like going to a Hometown Buffet. But dont let the looks from the outside fool you.

Inside, you are greeted by a warm atmosphere - an elegant bar to the right, and a large dining area, with a view of the kitchen.

The food was delicious. Everyone there is professional. Excellent wine list.

Highly recommended.I dined here with a group of friends for our dinner club and enjoyed the experience.  The home cooking was delicious.  I had the house salad and grilled pork chops.  The salad was very fresh and the pork chopped was cooked medium which the waitress recommended.  I also sampled my friends arugula, endive & radicchio salad which looked like coleslaw and the combination blue cheese, pears, and hazelnuts went well together.   My portion of the bill was about $60 for appetizers, salad, pork chops.  The service was excellent and thought that it was a hidden local mom and pop gem.One in Italian for my fellows

Service is nice. Music is enjoyable. 
Nice atmosphere. 
Portions are really big and prices are reasonable. 
Free wifi is a pleasant surprise especially if you tare on your ownAwesome! Get the thin crust! Classic New York style. Stop off for happy hour, it's half off pizzas for dine in. Great bread.Not real quick but everyone was so damn friendly! This goes for all of the area Starbucks BTW but we frequented this one the most.Great place for an excellent lunch! After spending a little too long on the lazy river at Mandalay Beach and floating by the sign one too many times we decided that the Border Grill would be the perfect place for lunch!

To start the fresh chips and salsa were great although the salsa verde had a strange after taste that we couldn't place and made for a weird lingering on the palate. This salsa bad enough to take away a star!

We started with the Border Classics on suggestion from a fellow yelper that the Plantain Empanadas were a must. The Border Classic is a sampler platter consisting of 2 Plantain Empanadas, 2 Green Corn Tamales, and 2 Chicken Panuchos. The Plantain Empanadas were amazing both sweet and savory all at once and a hint of Queso Fresco in every bite. The Green Corn Tamales almost brought tears to my eyes because they were the first sweet corn tamale that has ever come close to the ones my Great Aunt used to make me when I was a kid! As for the Chicken Panuchos my wife Bogarted those because she hated the other two choices, but her loss was definitely my gain!

For a main dish we went with the Albacore Avocado Ceviche which did not disappoint! It was half an avocado pilled high with sushi-grade albacore and a decadent lime-salsa mixture! The only thing that was missing was a spicy kick to top of the flavor combinations.

To top it off the waitress we had was super attentive, knew the menu by heart, and even warned us not to over order when we tried to add another entree to our order before we had even seen the appetizers. We will definitely be back to the Border Grill!This restaurant wins the award for the best fish tacos I have ever eaten! 

Had lunch here. The prices are on the high side, but the food is worth it. Had the grilled fish tacos that are made with a cucumber citrus slaw on homemade corn tortillas and served with black beans and both red and green rice. So ridiculously yummy and very filling. Should have stopped after two tacos, but they were so good I had to eat all three. 

The Watermelon Mojito, on the other hand, was a different story - very disappointing. It didn't taste like watermelon. Maybe if you closed your eyes and tried really hard, you could taste a very faint hint of it, but otherwise not really.Was at the Mandalay Bay Convention Center and instead of eating at the food court, I wanted something a bit better.  Border Grill is actually in between the convention center and the casino so decided to check out Vegas's location.

The place was pretty packed, thanks to the convention crowds.  Originally I wanted to grab a seat at the bar since I was by myself, but Vegas was storming, so the end of the bar was actually wet from water leaking from the roof!  Mandalay Bay definitely was showing its age... but I was able to grab a small table at the bar area without waiting thanks to one of the really friendly waitress!

I've been the LA's Border Grill a few times, but only for happy hour so I was pretty excited to check out the regular menu.  Asked the waiter what his favorite was and went with the Carne Asada Quesedilla.  It's essentially their carne asada, with several types of cheeses.  It's not the best carne asada I've had, but the beef was good.  Quality's good and I like how the tortilla is crunchy.  I wish it was cheesier but the pico de gallo and the guac goes very well with the quesedilla!  If you want to add rice & beans, it's an additional $4 on top of the $18 for the quesedilla.  A little pricey for quesedilla, but the quality's good.

Food alone, it probably was a little average, but the service was great, from the waitress that helped me at the beginning, to my server.

They definitely need to fix the leaking problem though :PI had their brunch buffet ($30) and added the unlimited mimosas ($5).  
It was not like normal buffets.  The brunch buffet menu had 18 dishes.  You can order as many of those dishes you want for the brunch buffet.  I tried nine of the dishes.  The steak and eggs were pretty good.  I also like the Egg Benedict dish.Went here for lunch with coworkers and everyone really enjoyed it.  I think it is a great place for lunch and wouldn't mind going back for dinner.First of all I have to say that I was here a few weeks back as part of a company dinner event with clients, and we were seated in a private party room with a pre-fix menu, so this review is based on that.

Now, I have to admit that the food is quite good here, and worthy of the many glowing reviews being bandied about.

We started with a "Family Style Canoe" which featured crunchy golden style lobster potstickers, sesame seared shrimp, grilled Szechuan pork ribs, and blackened island ahi. Everything on this appetizer boat was very good, but the ribs were absolutely amazing! I pretty much scoffed down all four ribs that were on the plate - sorry everyone who didn't get one!

"Sweet Home Waimanato Salad was next. It came with a creamy herb dressing. As far as salads go it was just ok and pretty standard.
 
There were four plates offered as entrees. As a main entree I ordered the "Hibachi Grilled Salmon" which came with a Japanese citrus ponzu. The salmon was prepared perfectly, and was a great choice for one trying to eat healthy while on the road.

Of course, it's not all about having no fun, as I had to try the "Dessert Sampler Plate". Each plate came with three mini desserts. Yeah, I ate all three. Can't remember much of what they were, maybe a cheesecake thing, and a chocolate thing, but all were eaten happily.

The staff here is on-point. Everyone I encountered were more than helpful and highly courteous. Our room was nicely appointed and they even had a special menu printed up for our company event which added a personal touch. 

Must definitely book a meal here next time in Vegas on a vacation to check out what a regular dinner is like. Great spot off the strip!I go here with friends who eat here way too often (IMO). They know all the sushi chefs and have their favorite, Joon. He's the Bomb! And BTW... he likes to do Sake Bombs so buy him and yourself one. And if you're in a group... he does the Sake Bomb Domino.. totally KEWL! 

Anyways... for AYCE... this is the place. I've not head a bad experience yet and have been here on all different days for dinner... been here about 12 times in the past 2 years. 

My FAVE is the Sexy Salmon... meaty, salmon with a sliver of lemon and a small slice of avo and jalapeno. YUM! My mouth does a little dance. I usually get 2 orders just for me. :) 

Another FAVE... "Belly"... I think this is Toro... anyways... it's a specialty and I think it's extra and it's not always available. But WOW! It melts in your mouth and is the BEST piece of fish ever! Ask for it... You'll see what I mean. 

Their rolls are really good and can get a little crazy with the sauces so ask them to go light and it's not a problem. 

Did I mention the Sexy Salmon? Oh yea... I did... I actually crave it sometimes... but as this is not a close place to get to for me... I have to wait til the friends can get together... Speaking of which... I better e-mail them and see what they are up to. :)I'm from the east coast where there's not such thing as all you can eat sushi so I was ecstatic to go to this place. I went on a Friday night and there was a 50 minute wait to get seated. They do not take reservations so I could not have called in advance.

When we finally got seated, the ordering began. Our waiter was very helpful and knowledgeable about the menu. I quickly ordered all the rolls I've scoped down on the internet based on reviews here. The rolls looked delectable and the taste was good for the first few bites. After I wharfed down a roll though, the fun wore off and I realized the sushi was good but not THAT good. What I did not like was every roll was drizzled with a sweet mayonnaise or eel sauce. There was hardly a roll we ordered that did not contain some form of cloying rich sauce. For our final roll (as we were reaching our intake limit), we asked our waiter if there was a roll that was lighter and not drenched in sauces. He recommended the happy ending roll. This was a light salmon roll topped with sliced lemons and scallions..pretty light and refreshing.

There were plenty of other options on the all you can eat menu other than sushi. One dish I thoroughly enjoyed and got seconds and thirds of were the green shell mussels. I forgot what it was called but there were only 2 mussel dishes and one was battered. I'm talking about the non-battered cheaper mussel item. The desserts were also very good. I especially recommend the red bean ice cream!

I'm giving this place 4 stars because I'm sure there are better all you can eat sushi places out there that do not load their rolls with so much sauce, I couldn't even taste the fish in the rolls anymore.I met a few friends here for happy hour in the Hookah Lounge.  On Tuesdays, it's happy hour for locals from 5 p.m. - 1 a.m.  I got there at 5:30 and left by 7:30 because that is how I roll.  My soul is older than I appear.   

On to the important stuff!  This was my first time, so I got a little confused by the sign near the door I came in and ended up at the hostess stand.  She was kind enough to walk me over to the Hookah Lounge.  Very friendly and not bothered at all my general lack of direction.  

I had two very delicious mojitos.  Our server was apparently doubling as a bartender as well, because I saw her behind the bar.  There were several servers who stopped by to check on us and service was freaking fabulous.  Even better, we were that group with a crap ton of credit cards, and our server took care of it without any issues.  

I tried the Athens fries and Calamari.  I had the fries at Bite of Las Vegas which is why I wanted to come here in the first place.  It was NOT just the beer talking at Bite of LV.  These fries are good! Calamari was okay.  I had a bite of my friend's hummus and found it to be pretty bland and a little runny for my taste.  Overall, I loved the vibe of this place.  Will definitely come back!One of my favorite things about Paymon's is their wonderful selection of teas -- more than 20 from half a dozen different varieties (I'm partial to the Moroccan rose and mint). There's also Moroccan and Lebanese beers available, which is far more exciting than the usual Blue Moon/Newcastle offering. And they're only slightly more expensive than domestic beers. 

Food-wise, I've only ever had their chicken dishes (kabobs and the like) and I thought the meat was well seasoned, moist and tender. The rice is always a little bland; I find myself making vigorous use of the salt and pepper shakers. 

For night owls, the hookah lounge next door has a great late-night happy hour, perfect for that 2am mixed drink to top off your night (or your sobriety).Love this place for a nice date or small gathering of friends. The food is tastey, the setting a little on the intimate side. The food can also be served on the hookah lounge. All together it's an inspired take on Mediterranean cuisine and has a neat energy to it.It was time to replace my lost camera case and memory card and buy a new printer, so off we went to Best Buy.  A printer was starting to make clacking sounds, and for my online teaching, December is when I usually make electronic purchases (e.g., computers, printers, monitors) to derive year-end tax deductions.  A sales rep was very helpful in showing Diane and me the features of various models of printers.  Prices were reasonable (because money is made instead by the manufacturer on the required inks, which are now 4 in number).  So, we left with a new HP Officejet 4620 printer, memory card, and camera case.

We set the new printer aside, to begin to use it as soon as our old printer actually died.  But as luck would have it, that event occurred just hours before the writing of this review, and after running out of black ink, opening a new HP Black 901XL ink cartridge that will only work on our old printer, and printing out just 2 pages.  Well, at least we now know with certainty that we really needed a new printer!

This Best Buy store is spacious and well lit, well stocked with merchandise, and I enjoy shopping here.We arrived and sat in the very small bar area.  It was over 10 minutes until the first contact.  We almost left because of the lack of service.  Once we were helped, the service improved considerably as we were regularly checked on.  Anyway, we were there for happy hour which was a great deal.  The food was good quality and great value.Came in on the way to school and grabbed 3 dozen donuts for my classmates.  The gentleman behind the counter was really friendly and stuffed the boxes to the brim with a wonderful mix of donuts.  He explained the different kinds they had, all of which sounded absolutely delicious!  I noticed he was putting a few more than 12 in each box, to which he replied that he likes to throw in a few extra when people are ordering by the dozen.  Hey, the more donuts the merrier!

I had the apple pie doughnut.  It was a huge brown doughnut stuffed with yummy apple pie filling sprinkled with brown sugar and cinnamon.  It was surprisingly light and not overly sweet.  I didn't make it to try any of the other donuts as this one was super filling.  I received good feedback from my classmates about the other types of donuts.  If I was around the area and craving donuts, I'd go back to Al's to get my fix.Took my dog there for annual shots, fair prices... then she got yeast infection in ears, i expected a hefty bill for shots, vet appt and yeast infection meds. I was pleasantly suprised to have a [very] fair priced bill! Its hard to find places that wont make u pay an arm,and a leg for vet services... i got in there first thing in the morning to avoid any wait/line and was seen fairly quickly by the veterinarian. I would definitely reccomend this facility. Havent had to ever leave my dog overnight for treatment so i cant say anything about kenneling services or anythin like that. But they were definitely fair priced and had good customer service @ the front desk. They do accept debit too fyiI made my first, but hopefully not last, stop into the C&A Wednesday week whilst on business in LV.

It can be difficult at times in a big city to find local hangouts, however I fortunately have a UK mate living here who had already sussed the place out and found it up to his British pub standards. Better yet, as I was staying at the Embassy Suites by UNLV I could easily stroll over and avoid driving.

The C&R is basically everything you want in a local pub with an excellent pub atmosphere, a great selection of beers, imported and domestic and a decent pub menu. My friend went for the curry on chips and I played it safe w/ a curry on rice. Although the curry is not quite London or Adelaide fare, none-the-less the dish was more than adequate (I settled for chicken as lamb or seafood were not available), all things considered. 

I would also prefer to have optionally mild, medium, hot or flaming arse curries served rather than the rather less than mild version served. Additionally a variety of curries such as seafood, lamb and veggie would be a nice touch.

With UNLV so close by a curry night would not be out of the question. I was present for an Adelaide pub's (The Exeter) introduction of curry night in 2000, c.f. http://adelaide.citysearch.com.au/restaurants/viewContent/1119945819643/1137463277210, an event that remains wildly popular to this day.

Not to complain though, all-in-all a great evening of British pints, curry and chit chat. I shall be back.Recently enjoyed another dinner on their patio with my lovin' man. This time, we both were in a breakfast kind of mood, so went for the Gammon and Eggs. Gammon is similar to ham, but the British version is called gammon and is a bit milder than American ham, and the steaks are generally round in shape with a center bone. Eggs were cooked properly, although I wish our plates had been served a little hotter. Overall, another great meal at Crown & Anchor on Trop.

It was a great breakfast, and their great coffee worked beautifully with it to squelch our hankerin' for breakfast.In early July I selected this restaurant as the venue for a corporate event. We selected the Semi Private room that was supposed to seat 75 people for the dinner. After signing the contract I was notified the the room could in fact only seat 60 people because they had recently remodeled and now the chairs were bigger. This was definitely a problem as our RSVP list was growing. They could only accommodate  a larger group with an additional room which would increase the F&B minimum. On top of that, I was told that they could not do a standing reception and a dinner in the same area even though when I spoke to the banquet director initial I indicated that I wanted a cocktail reception prior to the dinner. The whole event was turning into a big mess as the F&B was going up and up. It was very frustrating working with the banquet team. 

However, when I got on site it was totally different experience. By that time our RSVP list had grown to 80+, way more than I had expected. Although we did expect a significant drop off, we could not count on it. I ended up meeting with the banquet sales manager and she was extremely helpful in solving the space problem. She provided me with several solutions without exceeding our budget too much. I am really glad I spoke to her before the event because everything turned out great. 

The staff was extremely helpful. After dinner one of the waiters even helped me carry something back to my room. My only comment would be on the food. Trattoria Del Lupo is a Wolf Gang Puck restaurant and I expected amazingness. All I got was typical. Nothing impressive. We were however, ordering from a fixed group menu so maybe I missed something. Their lemon drop martinis were great though.A coworker requested that we dine at Lupo during a work event held at the Vegas Conference Center since she has "always wanted to try a real Wolfgang Puck restaurant". So four of us girls piled up in a cab and headed over to Mandalay Bay.

Mandalay is big and showily sumptuous - emphasis on big, as we got a little disoriented trying to locate Lupo (note: I highly recommend reservations).

We were seated promptly, and I really don't remember much about the ambience (not as fancy or stuffy as I would have thought - we were all fine wearing our flip flops and shorts). Service was good, if a bit clingy and at times a teeny bit intrusive (between the server, his assistant, the manager, etc., it was a little annoying constantly being interrupted mid-conversation). However, I'll pick clingy service over indifferent or poor service any day!

The food was spot-on! One girl ordered tomato bruschetta, which wasn't the most exciting option for us other three (I didn't sample to try). However, the fried calamari and grilled zucchini with two sauces (marinara and gremolata aioli) was DELICIOUS: sweet, tender, and delicately breaded. Thin crispy breadsticks and a garlicky, herbed dipping oil were served gratis (the oil was addictive - I dunked my calamari in it). 

One girl had the Del Lupo pizza, and was a bit disappointed - she said it was extremely dry. Another girl ordered the ricotta gnocchi and loved it - she said the little dumplings literally melted in her mouth.

Being the obvious carnivore of the group, I went with the Braciola de Maiale Alla Griglia - essentially, meat with a side of meat. GOOD LORD. A carnivore's paradise. This ridiculously rich, succulent dish featured a gorgeous, perfectly grilled and juicy bone-in pork chop, literally served with a side of crispy and sweetly glazed pork belly, and then drizzled with more deliciously meaty au jus goodness. This dish didn't attempt to be virtuous with a side of veg, and I quite appreciated its lack of culinary pretentiousness: despite its fancy long name and beautiful presentation, it was a honkin' big caveman of a feast, and felt delightfully sinful just spearing a chunk of chop, skewering a piece of pork belly on a spare fork tine, skating it around the pool of au jus and gleefully chomping with no regard for your carbon footprint or arterial health. Ahhh Vegas you are wicked in your excess. I LOVED this dish, it was a perfect 5-stars.

We were full to bursting, but couldn't resisting splitting two desserts: cheesecake with fruit and some chocolate dessert. I recall that the desserts were phenomenal, especially the chocolate one, but at that point was in too much of a food coma to really have appreciated them.

Total bill for four entrees, two apps, who desserts, 2 beverages and 2 glasses of wine came to about $225 (before tip), not unreasonable at all for The Strip and for really great food.This is a really good used clothing store. The floor plan is quite large for both sexes. Providing ample space to browse and shop. I found a pair of hand crafted, leather, Mezlan shoes for $18! Florsheim loafers for $17! They have a good selection tees, pants, jackets, shirts, and outwear for dudes. Not sure about the ladies. 

They're a bit picky when you sell. You have to make sure it's stain and hole free, and current to retail trends. Duh.

For the most part, their prices are reasonable and service is friendly.Love their cuban sandwich. First time at the new, bigger location and it is still as good as the old spot.It's located right across from UNLV on Maryland Pkwy which makes it a prime spot to go to if you go to UNLV and are sick of the food choices at UNLV. 

They have some good deals for students! Gyro bowl with white or wheat pita and a drink or even the typical gyro wrapped in pita with fries and a drink both just for $10 for students! They have great fries!! (I love good fries)

The serving size is decent and I usually take about half of it to-go because I can never finish it. So it's almost like two meals for $10 which is a good deal for us students!

I haven't had anything bad so far, even the baklava was delicious! It was a check-in deal either on 4square or yelp (I don't remember) but I wanted to try it and now almost always get one when I order with them! 

They have a good seating area and the back has pretty comfy seats as opposed to the regular dining area with normal chairs. 

Free WiFi is always a plus!

It's not usually busy, but when they do get busy, the food comes out just as fast!

Always a good place for something quick and cheap if you're a student. I come here generally twice a month.The best indian restaurant Ive been to. I am not a big fan of Indian food.

This is the only Indian restaurant I ever enjoy. Ive been to 10 different Indian restaurant and do not like Indian food.

If your a vegetarian, this is the place and it is awesome for you.

I am not. 

I did enjoy there yellow curry and clossal shrimp dish.

The price is fair. Lunch deal is excellent.

The service is friendly and have excellent selection of beer and wine.I had planned on visiting this restaurant during our visit to LV Christmas 2012.  Took the bus off The Strip to the Atomic Research Museum across the street from the Mint Indian Bistro.  After the museum, we walked across to the restaurant and joined the line for the Sunday lunch buffet.  We added our name to the list, which was on a tablet (Ipad perhaps) with the help of another customer (this was a new experience for me).  The restaurant is only so big and we must of hit a popular time.  Polite host and waiters.  Waiter was great, especially for a buffet.  We were a bit out of place, as we are not Indian.  But I saw that as a good sign as we waited; it  must be really good Indian food.  It was great.  My wife thought it was too hot, but she likes very mild.  The flavors were wonderful.  I've been to Indian buffets before, but this was more extensive. This will be a repeat should we return to LV.This was my first Indian restaurant in Vegas.  Went with a friend and it was great....I'm looking forward to going back and maybe try the Inferno menu....I'll sign the waiver!!!  Everything we had was darn good.  I can not remember the actual name of the dish I had but it had Mango and Chicken but it was super.  My friend had a veggie dish based off of a butter chicken curry....and he said his too was good.  I've been telling my friends all about it.Had the 11.99 lunch buffet and was impressed with the quality and selection of offerings.  Fresh garlic naan was available as was unusual items such as Sambhar and Mixed Pickle.  Love the dishes that combined ginger, coconut and garlic and the Halal offering was just as tasty.  They have a good variety of beer choices too.Wow...if only CALI can have them! Amazing!

Their adobo fried rice was awesome. I got the spam and eggs with rice and yum! 

Fast service and definitely fattening...not for the healthy folks, but hey it's Vegas! 

Oh and it's cheap, so definitely the spot to regroup and save dinero!I joined Susan and a few others for my first Yelp event : an evening (roundtrip) limo ride to Casa di Amore.  The restaurant sends its own branded red limo to pick up customers on the Strip- more fun than a plain old taxi ride. The limo isn't all that big but I'd never been in one before so it was kind of cool playing with the buttons for the "mood lighting" and the A/C (and laughing as Susan accidentally found one that suddenly separated us from the driver with a metal partition!). :-)   

The restaurant definitely has an old school Vegas feel.  Photographs of Vegas line the walls of the dining room in a chronology, starting with Old Vegas and ending with modern, color photos of the Vegas we see today: gaudy, colorful and sparking! A lounge singer plays the piano and sings old hits such as "Copacabana" (he even had backup singers for that one- don't know where the background sound came from!)  

Some in our group had a vested interest in a football game. A section towards the back of the restaurant sports lounge seating and widescreen TVs showing at least a couple of football games, so they could easily walk back there for a closer look at the game from time to time.  

As a vegetarian/vegan (depends on my mood right now) I was surprised at the paltry salad offerings- I had hoped for a nice big salad for my dinner. Instead, I opted for the small, plain house salad that comes with your order. I chose the penne with greens as my entree (escarole cooked in olive oil). It was very tasty and a bit rich- made me wonder if there was a touch of cheese in it, but I forgot to ask.

Anyway, I had a good time with the charming and funny Yelp crew  (Myke, you are a blast) and enjoyed a nice meal as well.My wife and I had a great experience, they were able to get us a table even though we had no reservations and the place was packed! 

Our waiter Tony was very attentive and answered all your questions and provided us a few of his personal recommendations. 

I didn't realize that they are willing to pick you up from your Hotel in a limousine for free!  So next time were planning ahead and take advantage of the limo ride service so I can indulge in all the fine wines that they have available.We had a great time.  We got picked up promptly by the limo, the driver was nice and fun to talk to, we were seated quickly, the food was really good, the portions were good, the vibe was fun, the entertainment was great and we had a nice conversation with the drummer, and we really enjoyed ourselves.

For the price, I would not go often, but for a special treat, it was pretty perfect.Oh boy, finally! I have been searching Las Vegas for a yummy, NON-buffet Chinese restaurant for 2 years, and I finally found it!

Wo Fat's dining area looks just as I'd want it to look: cozy, simple, to-the-point. Immediately upon seating ourselves, we received waters and a complimentary pot of tea. The menu consists of all the Chinese staples, plus a few dishes with a Hawaiian spin. I, myself, opted for the dinner plate, which includes rice, an egg roll, your choice of egg flower, hot 'n sour, or won ton soup, and an entree, all for $7.25. I chose the curry chicken, my friend the chicken lo mein, and my other  friend went with the Mongolian beef. We all sampled each others dishes, which were absolutely YUM. I tried my hardest to save a little of my chicken and rice for lunch, which wasn't THAT hard to do, since the portions are gigantic.

I am so happy now. Wo Fat, you_complete_me.For a while before my dad passed, whenever he was on the eastside of town, he'd stop in at Wo Fat for lunch. So, after my dad's urn was entombed at the Veteran's Memorial Cemetery, the family ended up at Wo Fat for lunch - because that's what he would have done if he were still around. 

Inexpensive and decent food. 

That's why he liked it and that's what I experienced at lunch that day. Pretty good service as well. I'm not sure if it was because they recognized my mom who would have always been with my dad - or if it's the norm however, the server was attentive, friendly and overall, pretty good. 

As for the food - we basically just ordered the menu. One thing about my family is that we not only like to eat, but we CAN eat. I tried and didn't mind every dish we ordered with the exception of the egg drop soup. I wasn't a fan of the soup and I normally like hot soups when it's hot out. There was just a flavor that reminded me of a chemical taste that didn't quite sit well with me. Otherwise, I ate too much and NO, I wasn't hungry a few hours later.It's going to be hard to believe but they have the best damn burgers in Vegas!!!!Why hello there giant, delicious burger.  Hello indeed. 

Yeah, that's me flirtin' with a burger.  You would too if you were at Ichabod's.  I got a teriyaki burger there that was as big as my head (do you have ANY idea how huge that noggin is?) and much, much tastier, with fries and a soda for something like $8 all together.

Totally an awesome lunchtime activity if you're in the vicinity.  It was completely populated with older people, save us, and that was adorable.  They have a salad bar that I would be reticent to try, but for those who don't want to just hear "OMG MEATY BURGER" there is that option.  And if the salad bar does completely suck you won't have to go far to drink your sorrows away.

Oddly enough, I've lived down the street from here for over a year and I've yet to visit the bar.  I'll have to remedy that the next time I want a giant tasty burger.  Really, they're good.Nice big place. Everything under one roof. I love it when they have their sales. My only problem is they send me a coupon but I cannot use it for the things i want because the higher end products cannot be included in their coupon (. Why bother sending .I love Popeyes spicy chicken and biscut w. redbeans and rice!  Its crispy, and is just freaking good!  lolI'm here at least once a week, getting gas and grocery shop. Its clean, never crazy packed. The only downfall is the food area is really slow sometimes. The pizza is really tasty better than costco.Gas is consistently 10¢ cheaper here!  Today it's down to $3.41!  Love me some Sams Club!Domino's has delicious pizza, every time! It's always fast, then again we go in to the store to pick it up. I don't understand the negative feedback...honestly what all can you expect from a restaurant chain? I love it, they've got my vote!This is where I always wanna stop on my way home from the strip with the wee-hours munchies! I throw 20 bucks in the slot machine, get a couple free cocktails (or waters) and order the baked penne pasta.... so good!!! My friend got the breakfast pizza which was "featured on the Food Network" according to our bartender, but it literally just tasted like scrambled eggs on a piece of cheese pizza. Interesting, but i'll stick with the pasta!
One advantage that Vegas definitely has over my years in California is the late-night tipsy food spots. No more begging cab drivers to take me through a jack in the box drive-thru.....well maybe once in awhile. But baked penne in a classy joint beats curly fries in a taxi anyday!It's a hit or miss tore depending on where you're looking for. Especially on the rack, some of the shoes are cheaper than the price tag which is a good thing or bad thing. You'll be surprised when you get rung up. I bought a shoe thinking it was $54.99. Price was $33 after 25% off.I had Del Taco 13 years ago for the first time. I recall having thoroughly enjoyed that fluffy flatbread taco with grilled steak. So, it is a wonder I never made it back, until recently. Thanks to this location, I have delicious crispy chili cheddar fries at hand when the craving hits. Now, don't turn me into a liar, you must consume the fries immediately so they are crispy to the end. Of course, if you let them sit in the carton on your drive home, they will be a soggy disappointment. Oh, Joseph had me take a bite of his bacon double del and it is great, too.For a fast food Greek place it's not too shabby.  Food is delish and generous.  We ordered the Gyros sandwich and salads, both were generous with their meat and very tasty.  The staff is friendly and there indoor and outdoor seating.

They have nontraditional Greek sauces for your enjoyment as well as the usual tsatsiki sauce (yogurt).  There is always parking.I came in here to buy furniture once, and it was a terrible experience. I don't know if it was just the employee or the prices that I didn't agree with. 

Anyway, we were looking for a washer, dryer, and fridge for our new home and we decide to come here just because, even though we had a bad experience previously.

We were helped by Zach. He was so awesome. He was knowledgeable about the appliances and was able to give us some insight on the best products. He helped us without bothering us more than necessary. They had some great Black Friday deals that extended to the following week, so we were able to take advantage.

Somes pros include:
- Holding appliances until you need them delivered
- Price match policy
- Good appliance selection
- They set up the appliances when delivered

I would definitely recommend this store now!I like this place.A place where a lot of locals come to gamble,eat and probably go shopping.The bass pro shop is connected to the casino.They have a nice aquarium for the kids,the food is very reasonable and the dinner buffet is great considering that it is off the strip.But,there is a lot of the strip that people should venture to...not everything has to be high priced to be good in vegas..rooms clean,people nice,pool  medium size-small...but a good price to stay at...I like it.Okay, lets say you are wondering around Bass Pro Shop and decide you want to play some blackjack....you are in luck. Just mosey through the exit to Silverton and find a seat. First went there out of curiosity (took a wrong turn in Bass Pro) but have come to like the place. The have a very nice venue for concerts, they run promos for regulars and always have specials like $5 all you can drink or $1 draft/well drinks. (contact their website for details.) as with all the properties in LAS get a players club card to be "in the loop." 

Okay, the gambling, ahead in blackjack, fun dealers, cocktail servers come by often (they serve top shelf drinks) so all in all a good go. As they are off the strip you will see perhaps a lot of locals (mixed with people from Bass Pro looking for the exit.)Didn't stay here, but loved the aquarium and bass pro shops.  Kept the kiddos entertained for over an hour.   Great spot to take the whole fam.I just upgraded to 24's Super Sport and I was so impressed with this 24 Fitness club. I had heard that this club was recently remodeled and I was pleasantly surprised with what I saw. All the machines look brand new and you got to love the treadmills and ellipticals with the bulit in TVs. The locker rooms have a little changing cubicle in each aisle, for those who don't like changing in front of other people. Also, the club has towels in various spots, for the dummies like me who forget to bring a towel with them when they work out. Love this place!We really enjoyed our stay here!   The rooms was the largest non suite room I have ever stayed in.  The bathroom was large too!  The room was clean and the linens fresh.  The bed was standard hotel "hard" so that is the biggest negative for me.  The food was average and somewhat pricy for a more local place.  We could not get a bellman to save our lives tho. Overall great value for the money and we will be back!Love this store! They have a great selection of lunch box accessories and back packs as well as great beds and furniture for both boys and girls. You can find great unique birthday gifts for both girls and boys.The Catalog has even more selection than the store but I really like going into the store to get decorating inspiration for my girls rooms.I had the thai beef salad. I was expecting iceberg lttuce with a sour dressing. Instead, I was served a large square plate heaped with noodles with a sweet coconut flavor. Underneath was the lettuce with the sour dressing. It was topped with carrots and a few other vegetables, all very fresh and crispy. Surrounding the salad were 6 perfectly cooked medallions of steak. They were delicious!
The service was fine, and the restaurant is beautiful.My son and I know Chinese food.....being 4 months in....we finally found our Chinese food place.... Great food!!!Great service. This was the first time I ever had my car serviced and was not persuaded to get all sorts of unnecessary services. They made a few recommendations and I was out the door. I will definitely be back!This is the closest pizza joint to my house. Now there is a domino's  closer to my house, but you don't go to domino's and hang out to eat. BARF!

The food is really good here, I have eaten here about 10 times and I have not had a bad meal yet. The pizza here is New York style, hand-tossed and good thin crust. The best 2 things on the menu are the Italian Salads and the Chicken Fingers. 

The Chicken fingers are your standard fare restaurant fingers, nothing too special about them. What makes they really tasty is the buffalo sauce they use. Excellent.

The salads are really good, they remind me of some of the ones you find in high end Italian joints, but at a much more reasonable price point. 

Recommended!Pizzeria Bianco is an experience: it depends if it's going to be good or bad based on your attitude. 

I've eaten there twice, once in a group of three, the other time as a group of seven. I didn't mind the wait so much during the group of three (2.5 hours) because we found a comfy spot over at Bar Bianco (in the heat) and chatted away. The group of seven though was trying. A 4.5 hour wait that included an impatient 13-year-old, freezing temperatures, mud, and about eight bottles of wine for six people. Not a good idea. My sister eats at Pizzeria Bianco about once a month and knows the owners/staff through business and didn't want to piss them off through complaining about the wait. You'd think we'd get better service or have a faster wait thanks to the connection, but it didn't happen. Make reservations if you have a party of 6 or over. It will save your sanity.

I do have to say that the food is delicious once you trudge through the wait. My favorites are the Caprese salad and the Wiseguy (I'm a sucker for sausage and onions). I've had slices of the other pizzas (the Margherita is great and the Sonny Boy is good too if you like olives). The freshness of the ingredients and dough do shine through.

The killer though is the wait. If they had a bit more ambiance outside (perhaps more tables or entertainment or even passing out little samples of the pizza as an amuse bouche) or revamp Bar Bianco to accommodate more people, it would be better. 

If I get a craving for pizza though, I'll save my sanity and go to Grimaldi's.Who would wait 1.5 to 2.5 hours for a Pizza? in Phoenix? Apparently me and about 200+ others every night at this Downtown Phoenix Pizzeria. Chris Bianco has created an outpost that this food blogger couldn't leave Phoenix without trying. I first read about the place about a year ago but the acolades have been pouring in since 2002. Bianco has his flour milled just for him and uses as much locally grown/prepared ingredients as available. But again up to 2.5 hours wait? In comes Bar Bianco right next store. It is a limited bar, but the wine selections are sound and the local brews spot on. Besides what else are you going to do in the Arizona heat for that long? Cheers!!!

We hit the menu ordering Local Organic Greens and quickly on to the traditional MARGHERITA (Tomato Sauce, Basil & Mozarella), the MARINARA (no cheese - just Tomato sauce, oregano and garlic) and and 50/50 of the WISEGUY (Wood Roasted Onion, House Smoked Mozzarella, Fennel Sausage) and BIANCOVERDE (Fresh Mozzarella, Parmigiano Reggiano, Ricotta & Arugula) All cooked in a Wood Fired oven. All were outstanding with the MARINARA being my favorite. Just loved the garlic flavors running through out. 

We should have left and given our table to one of the many waiting to get a seat but we all needed just one more bite, so we ordered up a custom pie, with Tomato Sauce, Ricotta & Prosciutto di Parma. An unconventional mix but great flavors after the wood oven.

As we left, I happened to meet a couple from Cleveland sitting at the table next to us. We got into a quick conversation abouts great places to eat there, as I often struggle on my trips to Cleveland finding "real" food. B SPot and Bat Symon, here I come.Great food for a decent price that should easily get 5 stars if it wasn't for the insane amount of wait time.  My group showed up 15 minutes early for a group reservation and still had to wait 60 minutes, ridiculous!  

Everything I had was delicious and I think the spinach pizza was my favorite.Decided to come here based on a recommendation from a friend since all i had eaten while visiting the phoenix/scottsdale area was chain restaurant after chain restaurant.

Pizzeria bianco has thin crust pizza prepared in an old school brick oven. The waitstaff is friendly and you can tell that this place is definitely popular among the locals given that it was busy even at 2pm on a wednesday afternoon. The menu isn't extremely large, but it's the quality of the ingredients that count in this case.

Tried out the "Sonny Boy" and the "Wise Guy" pizzas and both tasted pretty good while coming straight out from the oven. This is NOT your typical pizza spot with supreme pizzas, but a place you go to enjoy the creativity and the craftmanship of someone's idea!

Note: Valet parking costs about $3We went here for some late lunch. I have heard of people waiting in line for hours to get into this place, (I can see why, food was great) but we were a party of 5 and we were able to walk right in, have our preference of a table. (We also went at 1pm on a Thursday) I love the Neapolitan style pizza, I recommend the Biancoverde. It is similar to a formaggio base, with arugula. The food was fabulous, I was a little disappointed with the service, I would have wished the server to be a little bit more knowledgeable about the menu, and be able to tell us about the pizza (such as if they made their own mozzarella, what type of products we were ordering, if they made their own crust, ect), other than that I would recommend this place to anyone!**This is a review of the bar only**

I am at least 15% cooler after having sipped on a vodka gimlet in the bar at Durant's. 

Sure I smelled like steak after I left and felt weird about walking through the kitchen to get in and out. But for the hour I was there, I was felt cool as shit.  And my drink wasn't half bad either.Trust the positive reviews...   This place is like no other.   When I travel for work to Phoenix, this is the first place I think about whether I get there or not.  I've been going here since 1988.

During the right time of the year they fly in stone crabs.  

You are not a true Arizonian if you haven't been here.....  What an institution....  I wish I had this place in Los Angeles.....I was taken here by a friend of mine who lives in Phoenix. He highly recommended it and after having lunch there, I have to agree. I had the steak sandwich (Filet Mignon) done medium (perfectly cooed). My soup was Minestrone but not done the way I am used to but I still enjoyed it. The service was very good. My only recommendation is the place needs a makeover. It's quite dated.The retractable roof is awesome.  The seats are reasonably priced.  There is a pool in the outfield.  Should you find yourself with Club level seats order the food in your seats despite the crazy prices - I cheaped out and went inside to stand in line.  Missed 1.5 Innings AND they were sold out of pretzels.  WHO SELLS OUT OF PRETZELS????What an awesome stadium, this place is so cool. There is a retractable roof on this joint- so when it gets so hot (Read 110 F) they can shield the crowd from the scorching sun/rain/occasional monsoon. I was lucky enough to enjoy the D-backs game from a suite- and I couldn't have asked for a better time. The staff was friendly, accommodating, and comfortable. Next time I am in Phoenix, I will have to visit Chase Field again.I love this baseball park. Last year I was a season ticket holder and before that I had come to baseball games pretty consistently, even by myself a few times. But this field is great, not just for baseball. I have seen two motor cross events there and a monster truck thing. It doesn't matter where you sit, you can see, hear and enjoy yourself! Of course...I have to admit the lower level seats behind home plate are AWESOME! The firework show they put on after some Friday night games is pretty fun, about a month ago they had a Michael Jackson tribute fireworks show and that was great! 

This is a great park to just go and enjoy an event with family, friends, or alone :D I've witnessed a few fan fights, I've seen some amazing plays, and of course I always have a great time!!Lux Coffee is a good cup of joe and even better place for creatives to run into each other.This is my go-to neighborhood place for 20 years. They get the food out quickly, and it is reasonably priced. They handle a lot of take-out orders, too.

The food is Americanized Chinese food, which is great with me. Examples: Chow mein, Chop suey, Egg foo yung...  They are glad to customize the dishes, for example if you want a spicy version of something, or you want to change the protein....

The owners are always there, and the servers are friendly.  I have gone early, late, and all times in between. They are closed on Mondays. 

The lunch menu is limited and offers some egg rolls and soup with a main dish for a special price.

My favorite dish is the lettuce wraps, which comes with any protein you like. I choose the tofu.  The rice noodles are crispy, and the lettuce is crunchy. They make the rolls tableside. Make sure to say "yes" when they offer the plum sauce. 

The only thing I don't like is that the booth seats are soft and lumpy.  If you have back issues, you might want to sit at a table.Definitely not for the faint of heart.  When you go make sure you have your knee and elbow pads on, keep your purse locked safely away in the car, wear your undies, and make sure your are in good shape.  You will be up against some crazy b**ches who will try and grab everything good in sight.  There are lots of crap items, but hang in there, and you will find an awesome pair of 7 jeans for $30, LAMB purses for $50 and millions of fantastic shoes.  If you are modest, you will be waiting in line for 20 minutes for a dressing room, but if you don't mind showing off your body and seeing the sagging boobs of grandmas, opt for the community room and save yourself a hell of a lot of time.  Also, plant someone in the check out line the moment you walk in - it always takes forever to checkout.  If you can tough it out and make it through your first visit, you will love this place and will be a lifetime shopper.Good basic Mexican Food.  Nothing fancy and sometimes that is a good thing.  Service is great, prices are reasonable, an the food is exactly what you expect.  Full drink menu that you would expect to get at a basic Mexican restaurant.  When your in the mood for good basic Mexican food this is the place.Margaritas by the pitcher were very good.  And strong.

The taco and enchilada combo were very solid.

The chips were never empty and oh so tasty.

I'm not sure why this place got bashed so hard either.

The Presidential table was just across the way from us, but didn't glow or anything.

The prices were reasonable, but everything in Phoenix was reasonably priced.

Then again, I was drinking for three hours straight at the baseball game right before coming here.  Nah, the food was good anyway.I have been to Tee Pee three times and keep going back. Its a little pricey and crowded but a good dive-like Mexican food place for dine-in. I am surprised how many low ratings they have on Yelp, maybe people were expecting something fancy? TRY THE CHEESEBURGER. I know, I know, why would you get a burger at a Mexican food joint? But it's HUGE and really good.My pops is from Canton, China & this is the place he wanted to go for his birthday.  So that's saying something. It's definitely good. Since migrating from China Doll when I was a little kid (30 something years ago), we've been all over. Did a long stint at C-Fu but now it's Tao Garden and China King for us.

We've had stellar meals in the past here and our most recent was good but not mind blowing. Still solid though.  Seems like a lot of places have fallen off recently which is a major bummer. 

Seafood tofu soup was great. Peking duck was good but just felt a bit clumsy (super thick pancakes, chunks of duck - made me pine for San Fran or even LA). Chinese fried chicken was good as always. Steamed fish was nice. Empty heart ? (some type of veg) was good. Beef chow fun was tasty but light on the beef. And beef & green beans w/XO sauce was good.

Service was uneven as usual but it's a Chinese restaurant so I expect such.

With some of the other stellar food we've eaten recently, I just wish we had a Phoenix Chinese spot that was fanatically committed to excellence as some of our other local faves are.I really like what they've done to the place.  It looks a lot better.  There's always a good crowd in the bar.  Fun place for happy hour or dinner.  Just went on Saturday night and the Sous Chef was so great! He was bringing out Pad Thai Tacos to another table. I had to have them.  SOOOOO good.  Try them.  I guess they're on the "lounge menu." I also had the shrimp stuffed with lobster. I was in heaven.Yes, I know this is corporate.  But it is pretty darn good and heaps of fun.  Especially if you are in the courtyard at night!  Food is yummy, deserts are terrific and huge.  Drinks are quite competent as well.What's a working girl gotta do to get her morning Cup o' Joe? I'm talking about just a regular cup of drip coffee--I don't need anything fancy in the mornings (although, I do enjoy my espresso-based drinks as well, don't get me wrong here).

Well, this place has got it! From light-roasts, to dark-roasts, to decaf, to toddies.

Pros: Local, nice variety of coffees and drinks, upbeat environment, yummy pastries, pretty decent food, nice staff, and quick service

Cons: I'm not a huge fan of their espresso-based drinks (lattes, mochas, etc.), unfortunately. Coffees and pastries (most specifically the blueberry scones) are the highlight of this shop for me.

My recommendation: I usually get a regular drip coffee with a splash of almond milk and a shot of the caramel syrup in my cup. The combo always goes well with the medium-dark roast that they prepare for the day! On a particularly hot day (which is most days in AZ), I'll get the iced-toddy (espresso beans brewed in cold water). I think I might like Cartel Coffee Lab's iced toddy better, but this does the trick!

Also, I think they do make a good iced chai/dirty chai as well. I like them here, and I don't usually prefer chai lattes when I go to coffee shops.

Overall, I wouldn't drive out of my way JUST to try the food/coffee here. But, if you're in the area, Village Coffee Roastery is definitely a great place to stop by to grab a snack and re-fill your coffee cup for the day.Eric was very informative and prompt with getting our questions answered.  Very helpful!!Some of the baristas here are not the most customer service oriented.  But some of them are really wonderful....and their chai is beyond delicious! Chocolate coconut macaroons are to die for.  And its a great place for a meeting or a quiet place to study.I remember this hotel when I came to Vegas with my papa them when I was 12. Didn't go in it then but did in our trip here. 
Awesome self parking connected to the hotel. (not a mile walk) 
Cool, old school feel walking around the Stratosphere. Lot of cheap minimum bet gambling tables which was perfect for a first time gambler. Their dealers at the blackjack table so so funny and inviting. Not like those foreign, grumpy ones at the higher class hotels. 
Would have been 5 stars if they didn't charge to go up to the tower. I can't complain, the view was phenomenal. I ain't afraid of heights but would have been cooler at night to see all the lights on the Strip.
Visited Aug 2011My second trip ever to the Stratosphere, and I still like it.  Sure, it's not a five star mega-casino a mile down the strip, but it's actually affordable.  The Deuce stops right outside the casino near the buffet and runs from Fremont Street to the Mandalay, with enough stops in between to get you where you want to go.  As for the surrounding area, you can actually walk outside and get a decent price on some food, or a bottle of liquor, for those looking to enjoy Vegas on a budget.  The rides were okay, the Big Shot being the only must do, but the views are awesome and the place is nowhere near as crowded as most of the strip casinos.  I highly recommend the strat, particularly the upgraded Select rooms.  My only negative applies to all of Vegas, as I am a non-smoker.  Nothing is more ridiculous than watching 50 people walk through a casino get irritated as they walk by one idiot chain smoking at a slot machine.  Eventually Vegas will realize most Americans do not indulge in this disgusting habit and ban it in public venues.  Until then though, we'll just have to suffer if we want to visit.perhaps i had high high expectations. It's hard not to when Jonathon Gold and all these other food critics are wetting their pants over this place.

Went there and we weren't quite sure of what to order so we got one staple to compare with other thai places (Pad See Euw) and a curry dish and a crispy rice appetizer. I regret not getting the more exotic dishes, cuz I think maybe that's why people come here but anyway,

all in all, it was mighty tasty and for three people, the bill came out to $37.

if i lived in vegas, this would be my go-to Thai place. Would i drive all they way there for this? hell no but it would definitely be a stop when I'm there and have a car.

see my picsBefore going to Las Vegas, i've followed some review on Yelp and it helped. My family and I are original Thai, we were expected to eat real Thai foods, and this restaurant was so awesome, Wines are great as well.pretty darn good.

the papaya salad, medium, was pretty good.  my coworkers thought it was too spicy but i liked it.

the green curry was good.  creamy.
the tom yum was really good too.  

expect spicy if you order medium. or maybe it was just that day.
willl go back.This super famous Thai restaurant has been called the best Thai restaurant in the country.  I've been here quite a few times and the most important advice I have is to skip the buffet (don't even look at it or you'll be tempted) and order off the Northern Thai menu.  I recently had the Nam Kao Tod as appetizer-crispy rice noodles with some kind of delicious meat mixed in with the noodles.  My entrée was Kho Soy  (Steak Tar Tar), which was flavorful and delicious.  My wife had the Kho Soi (Northern Thai egg noodles with Spare Ribs).  This restaurant is consistently delicious and there are many other items I am looking forward to trying on their Northern Thai menu.  The service is always helpful and the prices are reasonable.  My only complaint with Lotus of Siam is they recently quit accepting American Express, which is the only card I like to use in restaurants.  The ambiance is comfortable and inviting, but I've never eaten in the new seating area.  Food-5 stars, Service-4 stars, Ambiance-3 Stars, Value-5 stars.D E L I C I O U S

My only complaint is that I can't get my roommate to share spicy dishes with me, otherwise excellent everything!This is a great place.  The menu is huge so we asked the waiter (so helpful!) to recommend some of the restaurant's specialties.  What we were served was an array of food that you don't see at most Thai restaurants in the US.  Where's the Pad Thai?  Where's the chicken satay?  Yes, these are on the menu but they're not "special."  In fact, some of the dishes we were served are ones that I would never order on my own but I am so glad that the waiter picked them.  Sometimes you have to just go with it!

Highlights:
Beef short rib in Penang red curry (best Thai red curry ever)
Beef jerky (who would have thought?)
Nam Kao Tod (crispy fried rice - unique!)
Coconut ice cream (incredibly creamy and non-dairy too!)
Fried bananas (simple and outrageously good)

Also, the selection of German (!) wines is huge and we had two different Rieslings from J.J. Prum of the Mosel-Saar-Ruwer region.  Yummy.

BTW, the Pad Thai is pretty good too.We came here on the recommendation of someone who used to live in Vegas, who said this was THE place to get the best Thai food. We arrived about 30 minutes after the start of dinner service on a weekend with no reservation, and although there was already a line of people waiting for tables, we didn't have to wait long (Maybe 5-10 minutes).

The menu is quite extensive, and spans various regions of Thailand. The alcohol list is also equally as extensive, for those that choose to have some with their meal. After reading the great reviews about the drunken noodles, I decided on the seafood drunken noodles ($13). I had other people in my party get chicken pad Thai and chicken panang. 

The drunken noodles came in a flavorful brown sauce, cooked well. I wasn't too impressed with the seafood mixture though. It looked like it came out of one of those cheaper seafood mixes you get in the freezer section at the Asian grocery store. It had pre-cut slices of calamari, scallops, mussels, and imitation crab. The seafood itself tasted just OK. The calamari did taste a little tough though. 

I asked for the dish "medium" spice level, and I thought it was spot-on. It was spicy enough to give you some kick to your meal, but mild enough that you won't be drowning yourself in gallons of water to cool off from the heat. The person that had the chicken pad Thai was very satisfied with her meal, and the person that had the chicken panang thought it was good, albeit also a little pricy for what he got.

Service was excellent despite it being very busy. Plates were taken as needed and drinks were refilled fairly promptly.

I'd definitely like to come here again to try something different. I'd also like to try their lunch buffet sometime!Get the crispy duck. The crispy duck with basil/mint is the best of the crispy duck options.This local favorite has earned a national reputation for its great Thai food. Although I have ordered off the menu a few times, I usually go to Lotus for their lunch buffet, and that's what we did today.

At first glance, the buffet doesn't look like much -- especially when compared to other buffets offered on the Strip. But for $10.99, you get a pretty thorough representation of traditional Thai offerings. I'm not sure if the selections change daily, but today there was no beef or seafood; however, there were plenty of chicken, tofu, and vegetable dishes to go around. There was also a lot of fried fare, including egg rolls, shrimp and curry puffs, tempura vegetables, and fried banana (basically, a banana egg roll). 

I steered clear of the fried food and headed straight for the chicken noodle soup, which is one of my favorite things at Lotus. I don't think this is on the regular menu, and it's not what you would consider traditional chicken noodle soup, but I could eat this all day. It looks like a hot and sour soup with ground chicken and wide rice noodles, but it has a hint of spice (anise?) that's addictive. I've had this with duck on the buffet before and it was fantastic, but this is almost as good. My husband was not as pleased with the egg drop soup, which could more appropriately be called "cilantro soup with egg." (He has that weird gene where cilantro tastes like soap, so any cilantro at all is too much for him. I love cilantro, but it was a little overwhelming for me, too.)

The main courses included pad thai, pad woo sen, curry chicken, chow mein, and ginger tofu (listed in order of my preference). There are orange slices and cantaloupe for dessert along with the aforementioned banana egg roll. (I consider this last item a dessert option. Don't be like my husband and mistake it for a savory dish -- it sure tastes crappy with soy sauce on it!)

Newbies and foodies may want to order off the extensive menu, but for anyone in search of a quick and tasty Thai lunch, I suggest trying the buffet (if, for nothing else, one of the best soups in town).Me and my wife went to Emeril's in Orlando Florida a little disappointed.  However we decide to give it another try at the location in Las Vegas.  We both decide to go with a four course meal.  3 our of 4 course are great, one course is ok.  Service was always good.A return visit to Emeril's courtesy of Spring Restaurant Week 2013.  Their menu sounded interestingly enough as this one restaurant ended up being our only visit during RW.  What makes their RW menu a bit different from others is that they were offering a four course meal for $50.13 versus a three course.

We arrived on a Wednesday with reservations in hand.  This was a good thing because they were especially busy this night with lots of events going on at MGM.  We were advised that service would take longer than usual because of how busy things were.  We appreciated the upfront warning.

Our menu choices:

* Heirloom Tomato Salad "Spanish Blue Cheese, Red Onion, Basil and Aged Balsamic" - A bit disappointing.  The tomatoes were rather mushy, as in possibly overripe.  We usually love heirloom tomatoes, but we weren't loving this one.

* Cold Smoked Salmon Tartare "Crispy Flatbread, Whole Grain Mustard Aioli and Watercress" - I'm afraid to say this, but it was underseasoned.  Yes, that's right.  Even with the freshly ground pepper, it just was blah.  I had to add salt and more pepper to wake up the dish.  The aioli was minimal, so it didn't really do much to enhance the fish at all.

* Emeril's Fall River Clam Chowder "Apple Wood Smoked Bacon & Potato" - This soup was rich, hearty, and very flavorful.  It was one really good bowl of clam chowder soup.

* Chicken, Shrimp, & Andouille Gumbo "Long Grain Rice & Shaved Green Onion" - This was some pretty good gumbo.  It had so much going on in terms of yummy goodness and a deep developed flavor.  We were very impressed.  (We recently had gumbo at another fine dining establishment and let's say their version does not come close to Emeril's.)

* Grilled Double Cut Pork Chop "Chive & Potato Puree, Fresh Pea Tendrils and Toy Box Charm Tomatoes" - This was a very generous portion of protein after our first two dishes. It had a very tasty crust and probably should have been enjoyed during this seating.  It was just too much for myself and I had to take the rest to go.  The Husband made the mistake of eating the whole thing and couldn't eat much dessert after.  (His loss.)  The fresh pea tendrils literally looks like they just cut it from the garden.  It doesn't really do much to the dish beyond adding color.

* New Orleans Bread & Butter Bread Pudding - I normally don't  order bread pudding but theirs is pretty good.  I was already so stuffed but couldn't stop eating it.

* Emeril's Banana Cream Pie - Another dessert that I don't usually choose, but it's pretty good too!  It was fluffy and creamy, not overly chunky or heavy.  I think that's what we both liked - two desserts that we don't normally like but really enjoyed here.

Service was good overall.  Water glasses were filled and the staff were constantly moving.  Sure, there were some hit and misses throughout our meal, but it started off weak and built itself up and ended strong.  In the future, I know that their starters aren't their strongest suit.Strangely enough, even though I don't eat a lot of red meat, I still get cravings for burgers. And this place had the best gourmet burgers I have ever had! I haven't been in a few years...but I remember I tried the Kobe beef, medium rare with pepper jack and caramalized onions...soooo good! I had the zuchinni fries too...tasty! Yes, it can get pricey, but it's totally worth it. The place is really cool inside too....kind of a retro feel. The only reason I am giving this place 4 stars instead of 5....the service was kind of sheisty.

Rumour has it one of these is opening up in the HOB Casino that Mohegan is opening...I hope to god that is true! This is going to be one of my first stops on my upcoming trip back to Vegas...yum!For an "expensive" burger place, this place is very good.

We had three "create your own burgers" and one salad.  All of the burgers were cooked as requested and very good.  The Cobb salad, although a half order, was big enough for at least two people.

We had three "big" fries and one order of sweet potato fries - both were cooked perfectly.

Service was very prompt and friendly.

If you're looking for something a bit fancier than "In-n-Out," this is an excellent choice for a good burger.Burger Bar--two magical words; I'm weak just thinking about the concept. The image of this restaurant's name was too powerful to resist, so I walked and walked til' we found this majestic place. 

The hour wait seemed silly when there was seating at the bar. It is a Burger Bar after all! The sixty dollar burger sounded tempting, but I decided to build my own beast. 

Cibatta bread, provolone, blue cheese and caramelized onions. It was a hearty dose of yum! Add some buttermilk zucchini fries and a beverage and I almost passed out at the bar counter I was so happy. 

As Mike G. noted--awesome place to people watch. Watching the hour wait line from the bar is especially amusing!Excellent burgers & largest selection of beers out of any eatery on the strip..Waitress here was a hot asian with a great rump, the two hostesses weren't as friendly, they seemed to better suited to be working the register at Hot Topic. Avoid Drinking anything but beer here, pitcher runs about 22 bucks and will definitely help get you wacked. Stick to the Kobe or Bison Burger, both take a little longer to make but are well worth the wait.. If on the go this place will quickly rush your order and leave you satisfied. Definitely worth eating here daily if your staying in Mandalay Bay or the Luxor.

After dinner check out the scene at Fat Tuesday's further down the atrium.. Usually there will be two giant Aunt Jemima's camped out at the bar and the usual collection of  Red Lobster customers one would find, similiar to that of wet Willys in Miami, however there are always groups of 5+ hot and willing half drunk girls stopping by here to do some jello shots. Grab a diabetes inducing drink here and continue on your way.Went there because I'm a fan of Hubert Keller. My husband and I ate there on a Sunday afternoon during football season. The booths are great because they have TVs in them. The bar also has an adequate amount of TVs to watch any sporting event. 
The service was good considering how busy they were. Food was excellent.Okay, its a bit pricey but its VEGAS BABY!
Its fresh ground meat that has no soy additives, preservatives or filler.

I was recovering from an evening of WHOO HOO and needed some protein that wasn't covered in grease or had mystery "cheese food" on it.
Two people ordered the mini slider plates and said they were the best burgers they have ever had! I had the turkey burger with carmelized onions, cranberry sauce and blue cheese on an onion bun...and MAN, that was one hang-over cure!
Another friend who embraces the "stinky cheese", had the Hubert Keller Burger and his only complaint was there needed to be MORE of the blue cheese (but he's an over-the-top kind of guy anyway). 
The skinny fries and the sweet potatoe fries were just heavenly....I didn't order my own, but scrounged off other people b/c I didn't think they would be as wonderful as they were....my loss...
We were all full, but the Chocolate Burger sounded all kinds of yummy, so we just ordered one to have a little taste...I wish I had ordered my own....I am dedicated to now try making my own at home for a special b.b.q. party this summer! It was to die for chocolate-y and the presentation delightful.
The bill for five people, with a couple of alcoholic drinks each, tax and tip was a respectable $120. Being as it was a late lunch, i didn't need dinner later so it really was a good deal.
Some reviewers have said that its very noisy, but we found it just pub-like: a constant, gentle murmur with sudden peaks of laughter and clinking, but not obtrusive or a detriment to conversation. But that could have been b/c of the very cosy booth having such tall backs.
I would go there again in a flash. 
MacDonald's lovers please try some real burger for a change!I know this sounds a bit unbelievable, but until recently it has been rather difficult to find a good craft beer bar in Las Vegas.  Burger Bar was one of the first, and still one of the best.  

Great menu offering options for nearly anyone's tastes.  From a classic burger, to a lamb burger, to Herbert Keller's favorite with ground buffalo, caramelized onions, blue cheese, and baby spinach its hard to go wrong.  Build your own burger with an impressive number of choices.  Not sure I ever remember seeing sprouts as a burger topping option, much less pan seared foie gras.  The one that hit it out of the park for me - a fried egg.  If you have never tried it, do so!  Absolutely delicious.  Multiple fry options, fantastic shakes, and even a take on a dessert burger.  Who does this?  Obviously one place that lives up to their name - Burger Bar!

One fail - the fries.  I was surprised at how fantastic my burger was, but the fries were just not up to the same par.  Not cold, but not as hot as they should be. Sitting at the bar, I turned to look at the far end of the restaurant and watched the kitchen window.  Fries are made, stacked in absorbent recycled bowls and sit in the window until served.   10+ minutes is too long for fries to sit.  My one and only complaint, and loss of a perfect score.Enjoyed the Fry Sampler we tried--sweet potato fries, fried zucchini and onion rings.  Cinnamon honey mustard dip was amazing with sweet potato fries.  Peppercorn burger was nicely done.  Salted caramel milkshake was too rich for my taste and I was done after first try.I was never really into Mesa Grill because Flay is such a chode on TV. We'd awlays walk by this place and the first thing you see in the doorway are shelves of his books...greeeat

One day we were hungry and once again passing Mesa. Decided to give it a try. I was pleasantly surprised. 

I ordered the Yucatan tacos and they were great. I typically steer away from chicken when dining out because any idiot can make chicken at home, but not any idiot can make a good steak. I had to eat my words there. The chicken was extremely moist and flavorful.

Service was average...nothing special or over attentive.

I'd definitely eat here again.Reasonable for Vegas and very delicious. I have nothing to add that hasn't been stated but I advise skipping the shrimp appetizer.  According to our waiter, the shrimp dish has been on the menu since the restaurant's opening. The tables next to ours also ordered it and were raving about it. Although it was delicious, it wasn't that memorable or particularly great.  The shrimp was medium size and came with a sauce, which I'm struggling to remember.  We also ordered the chicken tacos which were a far superior appetizer.I did not go inside so this review is for the patio.  Great location.  Right by the capital and the bike renting kiosks :)  Genna's has a pretty big patio great for people watching at a busy intersection of town.  Good brews on tap! After a brew on Genna's patio, I recommend renting a bike for $10/day and seeing all the wonderful sites around Madison.  Cuz that is what I did and it was FUN!I had never been to this place but was pleasantly surprised by how good their food was! I had the vegetarian quesadilla and that was scrumptious. It was not just overloaded with cheese like most. My husband got the lamb burger and he really liked it. They gladly subbed out the English muffin for a regular bun with no issues. The sexy fries were awesome and would recommend the small up charge to get them. They are a cross between French fries and potato chips with a hint of truffle oil Parmesan and a few other flavors. 

One of the appetizers our friends got was a green chile with pork served with warm soft tortilla shells. We tried it and were blown away. Forgot what it was called on the menu but I don't think we will ever visit there again without ordering that. 

Highly recommend grabbing a drink and some grub here!My husband and I recently had our wedding reception at the Majestic. We are so pleased with the service they provided and the uniqueness of the venue.  We highly recommend them.  

During our reception, so many people commented how much they loved the setting. Although the venue is a music club, with a few white lights and votive candles it easily converts into a classy wedding reception setting.  

The staff were really wonderful to work with.  Jenni, the Majestic wedding coordinator, was extremely responsive to my questions and happy to work through the many questions I had.  The night of the wedding she was on top of every detail.  We took advantage of her "Helper Package," which meant for an extra fee she  picked up all our decorations and party favors, set them up before the reception, and delivered all decorations AND gifts to our friend's house the day after the wedding.  It was a huge relief to have her take care of these details!

If you are considering a wedding at the Majestic here are some things to consider- the upstairs seating is very non-traditional.  There are basically large benches with shared mini tables that people eat at.  Since this requires walking up a good number of stairs to get to, we only seated our friends and younger people up there.  It worked for our guests, who are all pretty laid-back, but it may not be ideal for all wedding guests.  

Also, the bathrooms definitely feel like you are in a music club, not a wedding venue.  In some ways it went with the whole vibe of the wedding, but they definitely could use a little updating. 

Overall, we had a perfect wedding reception and are so happy we chose the Majestic! We highly recommend them :)This is the first gym I've joined (and I joined before the New Year, so it's not just a flimsy "resolution" that I'll give up on in a week or so) since becoming a real adult, and it is one of the better options near downtown Madison.

It's a bit expensive (~$50/month for a half year's commitment and ~$40/month for a year's commitment) but you get some great perks.

First, the staff is incredibly nice and helpful. You can always expect a "hi, how are you doing" when you walk through the door.

Second, all the classes, except for TRX and personal training, are free. They offer an extensive list of classes, with some highly motivational and committed trainers. Some classes offered are spinning, body pump, piloxing, boot camp, zumba, yoga, etc...

The hours for the classes are either early morning (think 6/7am) or at night (5-7pm), which is fairly accommodating for anyone who works 9-5. 

Third, the locker rooms are extremely clean. However, there's a fair amount of naked dudes, so if you're like me and haven't been inside a locker room for a while, you might be thrown off at first. Oh and also the locker rooms also have steam rooms and saunas. 

Fourth, this place has a wide range of equipment. They've got free weights, kettlebells, machines, elliptical, stairmasters, etc... Most of their cardio machines also allow you to plug in your headphones to watch TV.

Finally, you receive a free $45 coupon for a massage just by signing up, though I believe that's only available if you sign up for a year.  

   
Only reason why this place doesn't get a 5 is because it's pretty crowded during peak hours (aka right after 5pm)Delicious, but kind of quiet atmosphere.Came here for Sunday brunch. Was immediately struck by the decor of the place, especially a painting of what looked to be a hipster Draco Malfoy. Ordered the steak and eggs, which was pretty solid. Flank steak, so nothing spectacular, but mine was cooked a perfect medium-rare, and was seasoned perfectly. Also came with toast and a fig preserve jam, which was great as well. Pico de gallo too, always a plus. Definitely plan on coming back.I have always been more than pleased eating at the Weary. There's a great atmosphere and great food. I was, however disappointed with the service for the first time ever on Friday, November 23, the day after Thanksgiving. I believe our waiter's name was Carl, and he was the most unenthused, unfriendly, bad waiter I've ever experienced next to high-schoolers at nasty chain restaurants, and that's giving high-schoolers a bad name. He messed up my brother and my drink order, which is hard to do since we were drinking the exact same thing, and it was very simple. He failed to bring us silverware before bringing our meals, and we had to wait at least five minutes for him to finally bring that to us. Never once did he come to check up on us to see how our meals were (and they were delicious, as usual, but that's besides the point). We both would have liked another drink, but he was nowhere to be found. When we finished our meals, it was another waitress, who was very friendly, who took our dishes away. To top it off, after waiting another five to ten minutes, he walked up to our table, sort of snapped the bill down, gave it a couple taps with his knuckles, and walked off, not saying a word. This was an opportunity to rectify his non-service, ask how things were, possibly ask if we needed anything else like another drink. No, he obviously wasn't interested in serving us any more, and obviously didn't care about his tip. The waitress who took our plates walked by shortly after we got our bill, and I told her she was a better waitress in just doing that than he had been the entire time we were there.

I've always had good to exceptional service at the Weary, and I've been there numerous times. The food has always been great, so no complaints there. It was the first time I've tried their Reuben, and it was phenomenal, made with the best pastrami I've ever had. I'm not one to write a lot of reviews here, but this instance warranted a review, and I hope the owners read this and take note. If I ever get this guy as a waiter again, I will immediately ask for someone else, or simply walk out.Omg. yum.  Love that their menu changes each day and they have interesting special!

They should consider getting with the plastic age and accommodating their customers by taking cards.My neighborhood home away from home! Spacious and not too undergrad-ish, I love its soft, melt in your mouth cranberry and blueberry muffins. Their iced chai is a perfect, never too sweet blend.Thumbs up for giving its employees a picture/bio board. Just wish it would stay open later.The City is underground and not so easy to find, but it's a neat, laid back place

+Trivia Night on Monday!  Be sure to check out their Twitter page beforehand to find out the bonus question ahead of time
- The City doesn't really have too many great drink specials, but does have an alright selection of beers.  I've always had fun and chatty bartenders there
+ Comfy lounge chairs, booths available, plenty of tvs

Overall, it's a nice, laid back place (especially on Trivia Night Mondays) with okay drink specials but good drinks nonethelessThe 'bou is what it is. It is nothing more. It is nothing less. I've never had food there. But as far as dive bars go its about as dive-y as one can get. It is freakin' tiny so don't bring a huge group of people. You will probably get split up. And you'd be lucky to get a place to sit. 
But as far as dives go, its perfect. SUPER cheap. Jukebox is one of those electronic ones where you pay a dollar to hear the song you want. But its a great place to have "that one last drink."This place was quite a nice atmosphere.  The bar gets about a 4.5 and the food about 3.5, so I ended up at 4 stars.  The bar has a good selection of drinks, and the food, while tasty, isn't anything super special.  I am in town on business and have gone to many places in Phoenix and Scottsdale and will likely return, but not before trying many more others first.  

The prices for food I felt were quite reasonable given the decor and vibe and much better than a chain like Chili's or something.  The staff was nice and friendly....the scene was very "cool" feeling, although the menu kind of made me wonder if this was a burger joint trying to feel upscale or an upscale place trying to offer reasonably priced food.  

All in all, I would definitely go back, as you can have a good meal and enjoy the atmosphere and decor without breaking the bank.3.5 I think this is more of a place to be seen then a place to go see. The place is cool as shit and really is decorated and set up perfectly. The bar looks amazing and I hear Joe is the best behind there. The DJ and the music was a nice touch. 

The servers were good but I was annoyed by one that did absolutely nothing.. funny I noticed but the manager or boss didn't. 

The food was reasonably priced especially for the portions. I had a forget-able burger and was a little bummed out too. The salads and side were all good. 

The place can get loud inside but heck, people watching is half the fun.I came here on a date one Friday night and loved it. 

All I have to suggest for drinks is the lemon drop martini. Hands down, the best I ever had. Service in here was amazing.

I do have to mention the ladies room because It was like being in some crazy fun house. The bathroom stall was all mirrors. 

The food here is very good. I highly recommend for apps to get their water chestnuts which are wrapped in bacon and the galettes which is like a flat bread pizza. 

I liked this place so much after my date, I decided to bring one of my friends here and she loved it too. What a fun gem to find!Great casual mainstay. Been coming for years. Satisfying martinis and consistently good comfort food. I was sad when Bar 89 closed last year (sister restaurant in NYC). It was always packed too and same consistent food and drinks.Big mall with all of the fashion stores I wanted to hit, minus maybe an H&M.  Even was able to get a few drinks at the Yard House after.  Love it.My favorite Mexican restaurant in Phoenix. Really nice atmosphere, nice little outdoor bar and the guacamole is to die for!!!! Their carne asada is an actual rib eye and is covered in a flavorful but not spicy red chile sauce. Service is very good, but beware they do not accept reservations.Great store! Not as much vinyl as I would have liked but they have every other type of media you could think of. Cool atmosphere. Open till midnight. Good vibes. Recommended.Nice mid range hotel/casino.  The room was big, with two queen size beds a sofa and couple of chairs.  We got to stay for free, Thursday and Friday by signing up online for their email notifications.  They do tack on a $5 a day resort fee costs, which I guess usually helps inflate the ridiculasly low prices.  It is on the other side of the freeway from the strip, but room prices are very low.  $7.99 lunch Buffet was pretty good, international, with some great collard greens, black eye peas, and hush puppies.  $5 blackjack.  The big rodeo was in town and all the rodeo beauty queens stayed at the hotel, I could tell by their sashes that said what state they were from.  Even though many casinos allowed dealers and cocktail waitresses to wear jeans and western shirts, here everyone wore their usual work clothes, cocktails waitresses wearing the usual bustier/almost tong bottom outfits, so I did not miss the jeans.  They have 18 movie theaters and 70 bowling alleys, so would be a good place to bring kids.I stayed here for one night on 7/3/11. The room rates are cheap...I loved the rooms. The rooms are like a studio apt. They are very clean...The casino was nice. Housekeeping was awesome. When you check in, they offer coupons for everything.  I will definitely stay here again.10 years ago, I went to the Orleans to either watch movies or play DDR with my other tween friends.

Today, I go to the Orleans for low table minimums, bowling & cheap drinks, or drunk food at 4AM.

$10 table minimums are right up my alley. If I'm not going downtown for the $5 roulette or blackjack tables, Orleans isn't too far and I'm comfortable gambling here. I'm a gambling newbie so impatient obnoxious dealers push my buttons.

The food at the Orleans isn't half bad either. The 24-hr cafe/restaurant is reasonably priced and the graveyard specials are awesome. $4.99 steak & eggs and its pretty darn good after a long night of clubbing and some desperately needed sobering up.

Its not luxurious but hey, who cares.Woot Woot!

Yeah it's far from the strip but whatever! Take a shuttle :) Now my friend treated us to the hotel room that was clean and neat with a little view of the Rio and part of the strip. Awesome awesome awesome. 

I'm here to compliment on the Casino itself! The dealers at the Pai Gow table, gosh i remembered all their names, were incredibly friendly. They taught me how to play and it is definitely a friendly game. I won a lot and lost a lot but had a great time sippin free dranks. I never had so many white russians, hot chocolates and mojitos in my life in a single sitting. 

They have a tiny little poker room and my boyfriend had a blast there. I'm really not sure how "comps" work there.

The buffet was eh. Sure we can eat a bunch of crab legs. Nothing in the buffet was spectacular, not even Easter brunch. I take that back. The mimosas were nice. Anyhow, it was a good getaway and actually kind of a cool experience not being on the strip. :)- I like coming here as the clientele tends to skew a little younger/more chic/single than most people on the Strip, indoor/outdoor parking is convenient (not a long walk from the casino), there's a nice movie theatre and the food court is open 24/7.Oh the Palms. I spent NYE here. The dinner was FABULOUS. Filet mignon, lobster tail, shrimp dumpling appetizer and absolutely incredible desserts. I'm talking extravagant, beautiful chocolates in a chocolate boat. They went all out. And let's not forget the free-flowing champagne and wine. The live band, the celebration...everything at that party was incredible. The Ghost Bar lounge was fun afterwards, too. 

I gambled in the Sports Book place on my college team and won, so that's always a plus. The employees were friendly, the suite was amazing and clean with a great view. I really enjoyed my stay here. 

The reason it lost a star is because two of my friends got banned for 6 months. Honestly, the whole thing was hilarious and made for a great story, and we're not mad. 

Condensed version of the story: Friend #1 threw a plastic cup off the ceiling at Ghost Bar. Not cool, I get it. Friend #2 was twirling his blinky necklace that they gave out at the dinner. It went flying backwards and over the roof. Whoops again. Friend #2 high fives Friend #3. Friend #4 is lecturing Friend #1 about throwing things off the roof. Did I mention everyone's pretty tipsy? Let's not forget that part. Security guards come and grab Friends #3 and 4 (if you've been keeping up, neither of those people actually contributed to the overboard items), took them away, roughed them up a bit and made them sign paperwork that they wouldn't come back for at least 6 months. 

Hilarious? Abso-freakin-lutely. The only thing that made me mad and caused them to lose a star is because they really didn't need to treat the guys that way. They kept them for about an hour and we were worried about our friends. Lecture them, send them back to their rooms, and go about your business. Not cool, Palms, not cool. You're not loan sharks, no need to beat on drunk people for pretty harmless actions. I mean, I don't know...maybe the plastic cup and blinky necklace did some serious damage to the bush they landed on, but c'mon.I'm feeling unappreciated. After reading the reviews recently I see nobody is taking my advice to ask for what you want. I guarantee you will receive. NO towels, bathrobes, slippers, etc. Ask, they will give them to you. Even free newspapers. Those are the remnants of what was once a real 5 star hotel. The point is that their genes still retain these things even though their current finances require stinginess. For the price, assuming you shop, you still can't beat this place. Do you really care about fat TVs? The place is an incredible value if you learn to take care of yourself..This is a five star hotel that gets 4 stars because the rent is just too damn high.I enjoyed my few days staying at the Bellagio. We had a lovely corner room that overlooked the pools. The recent remodel is fun and fresh with a comfortable bed. The bathroom is huge and nice appointed with marble and high end finishes.

I used the fitness center and men's spa. Both were more exceptionally clean and staffed with friendly, attentive staff. I am always happy when I can get in a real workout when on vacation.

The pool area was also very clean and inviting. As one person mentioned, you will have to dodge building shadows as the day progresses, but for me, that's okay because I like to be in the shade at times.

What impressed me most is that services like the gym, spa, valet, WiFi and more were included in the price of the basic room price and not charged per item. It makes for a welcoming stay where you can actually use the amenities and not feel like you're spending money at every corner.

Every staff member I encountered was helpful and genuinely friendly. That is worth a lot. I would visit again for sure.Yeah New York-New York is cheesy as hell but it ended up being one of the better hotels on my trip. At least for entertainment purposes, they have some HOT shows going on right now!! Zumanity (think Cirque du Soleil meets sex) and Rok your ass off (a hot new club) will really entertain you. There is plenty of things to do at NY-NY, ride the roller coaster (personally I think $14 is a scam), play in the arcade, or just gamble like everyone else. 

Hungry?? Grab a pretzel from NY Pretzel stand (personally I've had better pretzels in NY) or maybe get a sandwich at Greenberg's Deli. There are all kinds of places to grab a quick bite here. 

Thirsty?? Check out Nine Fine Irishmen a perfectly good Irish pub or Bar Times Square. The service is excellent at both. 

It has all the standards, pool, golf, shopping, and a spa like most of the strip hotels do. I don't know what makes this one any different but it did seem a lot busier then the others. I'd go back but not stay here, it's just too many people.My first time in LVH - Las Vegas Hotel & Casino the rooms are great; clean with a view of the South. Food prices in the hotel are a little pricey.Third time staying here and the staff did not disappoint once again. They actually took it up a notch. I was only in for two nights to celebrate my daughters 30th birthday. But the staff at check in managed to upgrade my room two bumps and hooked us up with a suite and compted the second day. The room usually went for 220 a night and I got the room for 130 for two night. Clean, Pool Level, Huge lots of space, slept 8 people not by choice but that's what it did. The Lounge bar tenders really can hook up a drink or two. Stong with some punch! I'll definately be coming back. Keep sending me those deals LVH. Cheers!I was a little worried at first but to my surprise it was great! We got upgraded to a suite by Abel at check in (he was great and professional and polite) and our room was clean and very pleasant with a great view. I will definitely stay here again!For some reason everytime I come to the strip I always end up visiting Paris I don't know why but I really like this Casino maybe cause it's much smaller than the majority of the Casinos on the strip, anyways another good thing is they are also part of the Total Rewards program so i was able to play and get points there too. I also went to the gift shop to get a tee they had a sale two for $20 or $12 each so I was happy with that.I usually stay next door at Planet Hollywood. This was the first time for me to stay at Paris next door. It was great. I would rate Planet Hollywood equal to that of Paris. The location is great across from City Center. I especially enjoyed my lunch at Mon Ami Gabi over looking the Las Vegas strip across from the Belagio water fountain display on a sunny day.In the past, I felt that Paris was dark, old and smoky, but that is absolutely not the experience I had when I stayed there most recently; I think they have cleaned up their act. The staff is friendly too. 

When I checked in, I told them it was my birthday and they upgraded us from a standard room to the Imperial Suite, which was quite large and had a great view. It had two beds, a living room, bar area, two bathrooms, jacuzzi and big marble entryway. Needless to say I was very happy with the front desk for offering this to me at no additional charge. 

Paris is not on the level of Caesars, The Bellagio, The Wynn, etc. I would consider it a tier two hotel for the strip, but definitely worth checking out if some of the higher-end options are unavailable or too pricy.I still could not forget the taste of their sashimi...
Great food...
good-looking waiters...
what more can I say?3 words Miso Marinated Cod!

OK so we decided to go to Las Vegas on my friends birthday during his quater life crisis (there is such a thing).  This was the first restaurant we chose to dine at.

First off it's at the Hard Rock Hotel.  I don't like this place one bit.  It's over rated and think Nobu doesn't fit in this environment of tacky rock n roll memoriabilia minus Nirvana.  

OK we go in and get drinks first at the bar.  Salty Dogs are great and they make it damn good at Nobu. 

We get seated 20 minutes later even with reservations, this place gets busy.  Our server comes and asks us what we would like to order.  We pretty much had the chef's tasting menu and we're glad we did.

First course- Spicy Tuna and I think Dragon Roll- it was good, but come on I can getthose rolls anywhere, give me something interesting!

Second course- Tempura Rock Shrimp with Spicy Aioli and Tempura Vegetables with Soy Glaze.  Very good and for how simple it looked the sauces made it very complex. 

Third Course- Yellowtail with Jalepeno and Citrus Ponzu- AMAZING!  So damn good I would have eaten just that and be satisfied.  Pepper Seared Rare Ahi with Chili Vinegar Sauce- Again give me a plate of this and I would die a happy man.

Fourth Course- Miso Marinated Cod- This is by far the best seafood dish I have ever tried.  The fish was so tender, and the skin was crisp and flavorful!  Simply heaven. 

Fifth Course- Trio of Sorbets

I must say the food was great minus the first course!  Spicy Tuna and Dragon Roll at a high end Japanese Restaurant?  I don't know for a tab of $400.00 for 4 people I think that Spicy Tuna is not needed!Great Hotel. Everyone said that it was just ok, but my wife and I loved it. Maybe we dont have high expectations of Vegas, but the room was perfect for us. The hotel is centraly located on the strip which is great for getting around to all the other places on the strip. There is a Monorail that goes to the Belagio, through the new Aria. We had a great time there and would definately stay again. Though i didnt pay attention to other peoples reviews about the Casino..it is true, the dealers are rude.**Casino review** 

It's funny how we end of playing here more than the hotels we are actually staying at. Bottom line is we always seem to win a bit, the dealers are friendlier than a lot of other casinos and the layout is super easy to navigate. Also, the Monte Carlo never seems to get as busy as some of the newer, swankier places.

I usually despise those paid girls who dance on the tables while people are playing their table games but at the Monte Carlo they seem less skank and more friendly (instead of shooting your husband "I wanna f* you" looks they actually smile at everyone). 

I've stayed here a couple of times in the past and always thought it was okay. Apparently they've upgraded since the last time we were here. Considering the amount of time we spend here maybe we should consider staying too. It would definitely make the trip from the blackjack table to bed a helluva lot quicker!We stayed here recently and got the Spa Suite. Monte Carlo is definitely a little smaller than some of the massive hotels like MGM and Caesar's, but that's a positive factor for me. You can walk in the door and there's a sign that points you where you need to go and it's not a giant tease!

The check-in line was huge and took absolutely forever to get in, but they let us check in a few hours early, so I can't complain about it too much.

The carpet everywhere seemed a little dated and in our room honestly looked like it needed to be replaced. The window was also really thin and didn't quite fit in the frame just right (it opens a couple inches and it took the both of us to lift it at just the right angle to get it fully closed). It also could use a little re-caulking.

But other than that the room was great. Bed was comfy and the jacuzzi tub filled up super quick. Water pressure was great and we never ran out of hot water, which is amazing.

We'd definitely stay again!I have no idea why this place isn't rated higher. I've stayed at the Rio, Treasure Island (first guest in a refurbished room a few years ago) and honestly, I love Monte Carlo. First and foremost, when it comes to social media, Monte Carlo is all over it. They're quick to respond to questions on Twitter, and are super helpful with recommendations. The staff at the resort itself is the same. We went to Vegas to do pool time and boozing. So our gambling consisted of $20 at the video poker machines at Ignite Bar (by Minus 5) and that included all we could drink. Bet 25 cents a hand, and you can really get your money's worth. And I won! Who actually wins on video poker? 

The pool is awesome. Lazy river, wave pool, huge hot tub and a regular pool give you plenty of options. We were there April 14-17 and we were never crowded when we were outside. 

Breakfast buffet is affordable and $4 extra gets you unlimited Mimosas. Seriously? Yes. And there are crab legs on the breakfast buffet. Amazing. 

Rooms were clean, had what we needed (because seriously, who spends a lot of time in their room in Vegas?), and when we needed more towels or whatever, they were quick to send those up. 

The Pub... Diablos... The watering holes at the Monte Carlo do not disappoint. Loved the chili garlic wings and sliders (AND HELLO BEER SELECTION) at the Pub, and Diablos is an awesome venue for some night time cocktails. 

Huge fan of the Monte Carlo. It's not a 5-star hotel, but they aren't claiming to be. Unpretentious Luxury is their thing, and it's perfect for me. I'll stay at the Monte Carlo again, for sure.Amazing Hotel with alot to see and do!very nice hotel. Lazy river pool is great for kids.BOW-CHICA-WOW-WOW

I'm not going to go though a play by play, but the show was very entertaining and it has a little bit of something for just about everybody, whether you might be straight, gay, or other. It was also really pretty funny.

I have to admit though, in terms of just pure sexiness, i have to say that this isn't the sexiest cirque that i've seen. Yeah, the chicks are naked, but i guess that leaving something to the imagination is sexier to me.This is the most fun and engaging out of all Circus-themed shows I have seen (O, Mystere, Totem, Zarkana, Le Reve) The other shows have more Technical and Theatrical Props. Zumanity is more on fun, fetish and the human body.

I used a NYNY Show Package for 190+ which includes 2 tickets on the balcony and a 1 Night stay. Not bad!

MINUS 4 Stars. The lady at the Box Office was flippant and and i felt that when she spoke to me that I was beneath her! I got that vibe from her. I think she either didn't want to be there that night or she didn't like my face. I felt this because the other 2 box office ladies next to her were pleasant. I really wished I got them instead. I'm usually not an angry person (as evidenced by my reviews). Lady from Honduras.. you were just UGH angry. Yelpers, if you ever come across her.. if you can help it.. go to the next lady.

Plus 4 Stars for Edie, "the Mistress of Sensuality". She was just fabulous.I've been here a couple of times and both times I loved it.  Well decorated and what a great convenience for shopping and having dinner.  Valentino's is a great restaurant if you want something a little more upscale than Grand Luxe.  If you\re an avid gambler and you have a member card the perks are GREAT!

One thing that I wish would change is that to get to the other tower is a little confusing.This review is for the casino only*
For some reason , out of all the casinos in Vegas , I love gambling here the most . I really like the ambiance and atmosphere here .The suite was comfortable, great TV's and bed, could use a paint job as the banister was peeling. Room service was fabulous both food and service. Pool area was beautiful but disappointed with not opening until 9 (which was 9:05) tons of people waiting. The sundry area for lotion didn't open until 10:45 and you could not get food service at your chair. You might want to consider as there are many other hotels to choose from.For being over 20 years old, The Mirage is not a bad place to stay in Vegas.  Sure, you'll smell like a chain smoker when you immediately walk in, but I smelled like a chain smoker when I walked into the brand new Aria too.  It doesn't make a damn difference.

The location is impeccable.  The Venetian (with it's offspring hotels), Caesar's, TI, Wynn, Encore, Paris Paris, and Belagio are all around you.  

The rooms are renovated.  Mine had a walk in shower, new LCD HD TV, super comfortable bed, and great strip and poolside view.  In fact, my view featured the topless pool, which wasn't so bad at all.

There are many pools besides the topless one and they serve behemoth and fruity tropical drinks ready for you to spike even more.
The Mirage has a diner open all night, tattoo parlor, a booji club and bar, and a celebrity restaurant.

Unfortunately, they don't sell a bloody t-shirt featuring a magician and a tiger.  (Ooooh...to soon?)  I would have bought that, only if the money went to a wildlife organization.  

The corporate owners of The Mirage kept the place up.  It's a little below The Mandalay Bay but much higher than the MGM.Definitely a good deal for a hotel on the strip. I did not eat at the restaurants there but the salon was excellent! Overall the hotel was clean and the staff were very friendly. I would stay here if you are looking for a room without all the bells and whistles (and price tag) and want to stay on the strip.I go to Vegas quite often, and the Mirage is definitely my choice for when I'm on a budget. They have reasonable room rates (especially once you've joined MLife - it's free!), and are much nicer than resorts in the same star and price level. Plus, I like this side of the strip! Lots to do in the general vicinity!

The rooms are chic and stylish and the beds are oh-so-comfortable. I've never been to the buffet here, but I do like the casino, even though it can get a bit smoky. 

I'd definitely recommend staying here if you are looking to spend less than $75 on a hotel room in Vegas. It's probably the nicest of the lower end casinos.The price was good for the strip and the location was centrally located. The free valet was a nice relief. The staff was friendly and the room was clean.

Definitely pay the extra money to upgrade and get a view of the strip and volcano from your room if you have the option!First time visit. The staff was excellent, room is very clean, gave us an free upgrade because of my birthday. The room was fantastic, very spaces and very clean too bad it does not have a in room safe, and not allow to store drinks in in-room mini fridge.  Would have given a 5 stars if did not charge for using room's fridgeGreat restaurant in the tradition of great steakhouses.  Loved the understated decor.  Food was excellent, staff great.  Another definite must in Vegas - it's getting harder and harder to figure out where to go with so many great choices.  Expensive - of course.Great old school, NYC style servers.  Our favorite lump crab meat cocktail and bread basket!  We always order this for lunch at the bar to get our crab meat fix while in Vegas!This is probably one of the better gentleman clubs in vegas. Always lots of girls on the floor but can get a bit crowded. So i try to stop by every once in awhile...Stayed here with the girls after we turned in our keys (we're teachers) and headed for a few transition-to-summer days in Vegas.  We were given renovated rooms which were nicely done and near the elevators.    It is an enormous hotel and and that shorter trek down the hallway was nice when dragging in from the pool and nighttime activities.  Speaking of the pool, we rented a cabana for the day and I highly recommend it.  Well worth the money!  I recommend cabana #13 or #14 as they seemed to have the most shade.  They are also right by the lazy river, which was great since it was 106.  The food and drink service was great and delicious.  My only complaint about the room was the shower was either really hot water or lukewarm water. The bed was absolute heaven and super comfy.  It has a monorail station, but the cabs are cheaper, so if you have a party of four or more, the cab is the way to go.  We went from MGM to Caesar's for $8.  The monorail is $5 per person each way.  The only restaurant we ate at in the MGM was the cafe, and it should be avoided.  We waited 45 minutes for our breakfast, and it had clearly been sitting in the kitchen for a while.  Oh, and this was on a Friday morning and the place was not full.We stayed in this casino last year & I remember loving their beds.  The comforter and pillows were made of down - making it the most comfortable bed ever.  I know this because I checked & contemplated stealing a pillow (which I didn't!) - haha.

The hotel and the casino are both great.  The only thing I don't like about this place is the location.  It's a smidgen too far from the other hotels (Bellagio, Caesar Palace, Venetian, Wynn).This place holds a lot of events and we enjoyed the luxury huge reception halls that they have.
   This is a wonderful place and always packed with people....but you do have to do a lot of footwork to get where you have to go...
    I like to go on the tours of Grand Canyon...etc...I always choose to stay here at the MGM Grand when I do my twice yearly Vegas run.. Heres the thing.. Its central.. Its got all that you need... late night craving for McD's.. or Haagen Dazs.. its here.. Upscale dining.. yep., that too.. Awesome night clubs.. and always alot going on.. 
This time we stayed in the West Wing rooms.. They had a very "W Hotels" feel to them.. nice, retro meets modern feel. Not crazy about the layout of the shower, watercloset.. But thats because Im super private! EVEN with my best :-), I still need a bit of my space not invaded.. but a tv over my vanity.. loved that.. 

Not crazy about the buffet...but it was a promo we had.. so we went, we feasted and not liking buffets anyway.. Ill pass next time. 
The bell boy.. he was rude.. point blank.. he actually rolled his eyes and huffed.. bc he was a different guy then who valet'd and took our bags downstairs.. we tipped all of our cash to him.. YES we looked and felt like losers.. but come on.. a tip is that.. its a tip for great service.. okay.. i write this feeling egg in my face! 
Ill go back to the suites.. or the Grand Tower rooms.. the 'basic' room at the MGM now that the Emerald Tower is no more.. and yes.. I will continue to say here.. love the MGM:-)Always a good choice.  Beautiful women, beuatiful property and awesome pool.  A great place to catch a concert or grab a bite.  Tables pay out too.  Always worth a stop... if you can find a spot in the parking garage.  Try to avoid during any major event, gets too busy!Booked 2 rooms in March for July, still couldn't be accommodated to have them connecting. Check In was a nightmare, even as an M Life rewards member. Room nice, beds comfortable, showers shower. It was an overall dry experience staying at the MGM, luckily my travel companions made the trip fun and exciting because nothing at the MGM really impressed meWe loved this place. Great view fron the 21th floor. Big room, very clean. We went to David Copperfield show in this hotel, the show was amazing. Every services are very expensive, included the most expensive water bottle the intire trip.I loved my stay at the Treasure Island.  Heck, with the mall next to TI, you basically do not have to leave the hotel.  TI has everything for you...restaurants, stores, bars, casinos, theatre (Mystere), Starbucks and many more.

TI is somewhere in the middle of the Strip, so everything is within a reasonable distance.  (The last time I was at Vegas, I stayed at the Stratosphere, which was at the end of the Strip.)

Anyways, had a great room on the 24th floor.  The bathroom was big.  My only complaints are that it was hot in the room even when the thermostat was on cool.  Also, the maids didn't restock sufficient supplies in the bathroom.   Also, TI doesn't offer free wi-fi.  You have to pay $13/day.  

Other than that, I had a great time at TI with everything available.I booked this hotel online as a total rewards customer and got an awesome deal!  We checked in on a Sunday afternoon (line is always long) and was given a room in tower 5.  Hallways were rundown and dirty which made me nervous about what our room would look like.  To my surprise it wasn't that bad.  It wasn't till the next morning I realized that the bed was hard like a rock and the tub wouldn't drain.  On top of that, my husband ironed his shirt using the hotel iron and it ruined his nice shirt.  
We called the front desk and voiced our frustrations and was immediately moved to tower 1 in a Roman tub suite.  This room was newer and so much better.  Slept like a baby on the comfy bed and enjoyed the huge tub.  

I would recommend getting the suites at this hotel.  Rooms are better maintained and cleaner.  After making the switch in rooms my short vacation was that much better!!Grated, this was one of the most dilapitated establishments on the strip...but although The Boardwalk Hotel & Casino is closed, it still holds a special place in my heart.  A review is in store for providing a memory that will be stamped in my head forever.

New Years 2006

Three Bottles of Moet:     $90

5 Girls under 21 wishing they were of age to attend 
all the clubbing, gambling and other fun during one 
of the craziest nights & and getting plastered beyond 
oblivion instead:      ***PRICELE$$***I've been to a lot of restaurants in LV.  At one point, the experiences can get all clouded (and no, it's not because I've had one too many).  But I really enjoyed Mon Ami Gabi.  Expect to pay a bit more than what you may have wanted to, but whatever.

It opened at 11, we got there at 11:20 and there was a 40-minute wait to sit outside!!  That sounds ridiculous, but my mom really wouldn't have it any other way, so we opted to wait.  Yes, they give you those shiny, shaky pagers so you can keep on gambling while you wait.  The decor was really pretty inside.  They have a Bloody Mary Bar!!!  Always a hit!  Of course by sitting outside, you've got prime views of the Bellagio fountains--so lunch and a show, always nice.

I ordered the cheese plate.  Everytime I go to the Paris Hotel, I  must have me a cheese plate.  They've got the good stuff.  My plate came with brie, gorgonzola, and goat cheese.  It was accompanied by apple slices, grapes, and candied dates---the pairings were really good.  It also comes with a couple different breads to choose from.  The coffee was really good, too.  Always a plus.

My mom and sister split a fish and chips.  The fish was high class.  This ain't pub food.  It was lightly battered and fried---it looked like the entire fillet of halbut on the plate.  The chips are a bit different.  They're more like homemade potato crunchies than chips or fries.  That was a bit of a disappointment.  Other than that, can't complain.The service wasn't great, but the food, my god..... was.

I had the Filet with Merlot butter and I have been dreaming of it ever since. The wine selection is extensive and for that- I like as well. The pricing was decent for the quality and amount. I will for sure be back!

Tip: if you pass up the Mashed Cauliflower... there is seriously something wrong with you. It was heaven on a plate. Mmmmm...Very good salmon
Nice ambience
Nice view 
Good serviceCame here last year in September for my 21st bday wknd with my boyfriend. Had lunch here before leaving for the airport for our flight. Forgot what we ordered, but whatever it was- it was pretty great. We sat outside so we had a lovely view of the Bellagio. Service was good. I think this was the first time I tried escargot.We decided to eat here rather than at an equal to lower rated restaurant where the meal would cost 2-3x more. There are so many restaurants where it's easily $100/person, and who knows if it's really going to be worth it. Coming from SF bay area we get plenty of good eats, and I hate forking out a ton of money for average food and a "me too" environment. 

This place was oozing cuteness, and personality. Like a vibrant french cafe.  The service was very good, attentive, helpful. The food was great.  We had the english pea soup special which was absolutely great, and I had the scallops, hubby had the skate wing. Both were delish but the scallops were best. You get 5 huge scallops and lots of veggies for like $20. The quality of the food ingredients and freshness of the seafood was apparent, and it was such a good value. We each had 2 glasses of wine and were out of there for like $100 or so.  Would definitely recommend this place for dinner (and I bet brunch would be great too!).4.5 stars.

This place is awesome.  We booked a reservation at 8 PM, with the intention of waiting an extra hour to secure outside seating.  I can understand how this may be annoying to those not in the know.  We planned for it so we didn't really mind waiting around.

When we finally made it outside, it was perfect.  Absolutely perfect.  Nice warm evening, table for 2 right on the street with a beautiful view of the Bellagio fountains.  So romantic!

Extremely nice service, although maybe a bit too hands-off for some.  We didn't mind being left alone but we did have to flag our waitress down for the check.  The carrot soup was pretty good and the filet mignon with merlot butter was great.  For dessert, we couldn't decide between the warm berry crumble and the creme brulee so of course we had to order both.  The crumble was massive and very good.  Judging from the bits of creme brulee I was able to wrangle away from the husband when he wasn't looking - yeah, he's a fan - it was just ok.  

Fabulous coffee.

Plus, after staring at $15 glasses of wine and $25 appetizers in the face all weekend, it was nice to have a great moderately priced meal without sacrificing taste and ambiance.Had breakfast here. It was good. Crepe was good and eggs benedict.After reading about this place from Michelle T. and Carol L.'s reviews, I've decided to bookmarked this place to try when I'm back in Vegas.   I remember driving by this restaurant on Las Vegas Blvd. and  wondered if it was any good.  I made a reservation through open table for 10:30am. and asked for a patio seating.  My mom decided that it would be too cold to sit outside in a 57 degree weather so we decided to sit indoors right next to their patio seating area.  Even at this time, the restaurant was pretty much filled up.

It's a pretty long walk from the self parking lot at the Paris hotel to this restaurant.  We were getting lost trying to figure out where it was.  You have to pass all the shops and the casino lobby area to the very front of the hotel.  Don't wear heels.  The food here is definitely worth trying out for brunch/breakfast.  

Strawberry waffles---5 stars!  Very crunchy made with buttermilk batter and topped with fresh strawberries.  Goes well with their warm maple syrup.  Very light and not heavy.  

Ham and Cheese omelette with gruyere cheese--4 stars.  My mom ordered this and she seemed to be happy with her dish.  Came with bread (5 stars) I just can't seem to remember the type of bread but it was delish!  The hash browns were flaky and excellent.

Crepes- BF ordered this dish but we were both not too pleased with the texture and overall taste.  I'd skip on their crepes.  2 stars.

French onion soup-  Yeah, it's $9 for a big cup of soup.  BUT, it's worth every sip!  We ended up fighting for the cheeeeeeeese!  Not too salt unlike other soups I've tried.  This is one soup I'd come back and order again!  Must order as an appetizer. Big enough to share with two people.  5+stars!


Coffee--Very good coffee.   They are very good about offering refills whenever your cup is half way done.  5 stars


Service--Top notch!  5 stars!  Outstanding service from the minute you walk into the restaurant.   

Ambience--LOVE it!  Wish they had a location in LA because I'd be a frequent customer!While it could be a challenge to be an early riser in Vegas, breakfast here (7 a.m. to 11 a.m.) was well worth the trade on sleeping in. So much, in fact, I started my day here twice on my last visit to Vegas.

Part un: a rather large croissant sandwich with egg, tomato, avocado, turkey and just the right amount of mayo. Though I barely had room left, I also tried the fruit salad--delicious with mango, pineapple and grape, and yogurt and brown sugar on the side. While it set me back another $10 or so, it was hard not to indulge in a mimosa while enjoying the Bellagio fountain view and the bustling Strip just off the patio (they also offered Bloody Marys and a rolling wine cart among other morning libations).

Part deux: quiche Lorraine, light and savory with bacon, cheese and chive. (It was hard to say no to the mimosa this time.)

In both cases, service was prompt, friendly and seemed effortless.

It looks like dinner here would be a hit as well, and the ambience offered in the evening is lure enough next time I'm in town.Very good. Stoked on this place. Great atmosphere and the food was delightful.BLUEBERRY FRENCH TOAST

BLUEBERRY FRENCH TOAST

Come here for this and only this!! I've been here twice and have found that everything else pales in comparison to the BLUEBERRY FRENCH TOAST. I asked the waiter how they make it taste so good and he said "I'll have our chef send you the recipe!" I thought he was kidding but he wasn't! Filled out a form and I just got the chef's email yesterday with this recipe.  I thought that was pretty awesome! Oh and the view is great too...But remember, order the BLUEBERRY FRENCH TOASTI went to Mon Ami Gabi for dinner with my boyfriend. We didn't have a reservation and the hostess told us it would be a 45-60 minute wait, but we got in after only 20 minutes. We had a great seat outdoors with a great view of the Bellagio Fountains.

Service: Our waitress was very friendly and attentive.

Food: The bread we got at the beginning of the meal was not warm and was so hard that we couldn't eat it. We received a small plate "compliments of the chef" with two small quail eggs topped with caviar. SO DELICIOUS! Not sure if it was on the menu, but I would've loved to have more.

We shared the filet mignon. It was perfectly cooked and extremely tender! The pommes frites were seasoned nicely and complemented the dish. We also ordered a side of garlic spinach. It had just the right amount of garlic flavor without overpowering the spinach. My Shirley Temple was one of the best I've ever had at ANY restaurant!

Overall, we had an exceptional dining experience filled with delicious food and great service!You must eat outside when you come to Mon Ami for the view of Bellagio's fountain. The pancakes are delicious. The omelettes are excellent. I've never been here for dinner so I can't comment on their steaks.Probably some of the best service I've ever had - from the hostesses to the manager, and our server. We made a reservation for 1pm right on the rail of the patio for 7 people, showed up with 9 people, and they still were able to accommodate graciously. Service was formal, extremely attentive, personable, and very professional. World-class staff. 

Food was very good. I would stop just a bit short of calling it an excellent French restaurant - it's a very very good French-ish restaurant with a focus on seafood and the grill. 

Highlights
- All the food, really
- French onion soup
- Baked goat cheese
- Bone-in rib eyes were near-perfect
- Actual Caesars (not bloody marys). Being Canadian, this is almost a must when recovering from a night of booze

Lowlights (only a few)
- Wasn't blown away by the quality of the seafood on the platter
- Sauces that came with the steaks were gross looking and too oily
- I know what they're trying to do with the fries, but they end up as a bit of an oversalted oily clump
- Caesar salad was drenched in dressing, but that's what you get for ordering a caesar salad at a French restaurant

As many reviews note, the patio provides some of the best people watching in the city, as well as a great view of the Bellagio fountain show. 

One caution - men must wear sleeved shirts, a problem for one particular show-off on our team.

TL;DR version: Nearly a must-do when in Vegas for a brunch or late lunch, especially if you like to sit in the sun. I'm sure can be just as good for dinner. Most locals we spoke to say that M.A.G. is excellent, so that's reassuring. Top-quality service, great patio, and very very good food.I'm not sure who our waitress was, but she was awesome, made the meal that much better! Seafood platter was the main dish, salmon tartar was exceptional. Also I got a ginger vodka cocktail that was AWESOME. No complaints here, French onion soup was good...most are toooo salty --good food, good service, awesome atmosphere!It's on the strip, there's plenty of storefront parking and it's open 24 hours.  If you're on a budget and you want good, plentiful food, this is the place for you. There's even a cool bar inside the restaurant so you can have that extra cocktail while you wait for your grub.

The menu is huge and I believe you'll find something you'll like, I eye jacked other peoples plates as I walked in and everything looked good.Every time I visit LV I have to have at least one late night breakfast here.  2 years ago I asked one of the local taxi stand workers where to go and get something to eat after leaving the club.  He named a few places and then I asked, "where would you go?" He said to the Peppermill and I've been sold every since.  
The service has always been nice, quick and courteous.   I can't suggest too much from the menu because I'm always ordering the steak and egg breakfast. Very good for the price.
I would highly recommend this place.Awesome place for breakfast!   We got there around 9:00am and it was busy but they sat us immediarely.  I had the veggie omlette with home fries, delicious and huge.   If you're into Bloody Mary's, try theirs.   Its only $9, it's made fresh and it was really good.The only place I stay in Vegas. Great prices. I don't need a fancy room since I only use it to sleep 3 hours. 

The pool is nice. I love the slide. I love the drinks. I love Vegas!For all its faults Flamingo is a fantastic hotel. You couldn't ask to be in a better location on the strip, directy across from Cesaer's at the center of the city, the Flamingo is Las Vegas. Sure it is not as modern or as flashy as some of the newer hotels, but you can't beat the price. Valentine's weekend I paid $75 a night and they upgraded us to an executive suite, the room was very modern too except for the bathroom. The view was breathtaking (see photos), alone well worth the money.Great deal in a prime location. Bearing in mind that this isn't one of the newer hotels, but if you request a renovated room you'll be pleasantly surprised. 
We arrived at 130 am, so the check in line wasn't huge, yet it still took us 30 minutes to check in (the kiosk couldn't check us in). The put us on the executive floor (28) since the wait was extreme, the only catch being that it was a king bed, not usually a big deal except that it was a male friend , not my wife this trip.  We expressed our displeasure and they assured us that they would move us in morning to a two bed option on the same floor. Since neither of us intending on sleeping it worked out just fine. 
The staff were fantastic. The room was clean with faux wood floors. The bathroom needed a makeover, but all in all very nice.  
Check out couldn't have been easier, just drop the express check-out form and keys into the slot and PAU off to the airport. 
Someone does need to take some brasso to the elevators though. 

I would DEFINITELY stay here again.As over the top as Donald's combover.

I didn't know the Egyptians had casinos in their pyramids! Very much a theme place. Send the less casino-excited to this destination to at least experience the various theme-based activities. Ride down the Nile. Explore a tomb...My bestie, another chick and I stayed here for 5 days and 4 nights. It was cool. They had the basic stuff, towels, comfy beds. I loved the pillows, but my bestie wouldnt let me steal them lol. We never had a problem with anything. Well, the pool isnt open 24/7, so we had to go somewhere else if we wanted to swim at like 3AM. Theres a little food court, which was ok. More, the buffet place they have, was ok. Fresh food and a pretty good selection. We went there for the champangne (I cant spell) brunch and enjoyed unlimited mimosas and champangne. Oh, watch out for the old lady cashier, she was a bit of a biotch. Oh, we stayed on the 20th floor and the elevator moves side to side, or something. Its pretty dope. 

Overall, I would stay there again.My first "adult trip" to Vegas involved a stay at the Excalibur so I was definitely hoping for a better hotel this time around. Thankfully the Luxor didn't disappoint. For the price, we got a nice room, decent bathrooms, and the room was relatively large (we got a free upgrade to a tower room, so I didn't get to witness the awesome of the Inclinator). 

The breakfast buffet was good (I had a wicked hangover and was in dire need of a decent breakfast and was very happy with what I got). Didn't have the other food options though. Also, there's a walkway to Excalibur and Mandalay Bay if you don't feel like taking the Tram (it's also a good way to get onto the strip and avoid those extra 10 minutes of heat walking outside).

The only downside is how far down the Strip Luxor is...cabs are sooo not cheap. I'll do a review of LAX separately.I have gambled at the Luxor but this was my first time staying here.  I must say, I was impressed.  Yes, it is a bit confusing to get to the pyramid rooms, but once you get there, the rooms are immaculate and nice.  Also, liked the view of the pool and Las Vegas skyline. Not to mention, service was really good, at least for us, we never had a bad experience with the staff.

Okay, so MAYBE I am impartial by the fact that I kicked ass on the Pai Gow poker tables here, but in all honesty, I really liked our room and the amenities. My only point of contention was why isn't the pool open past 6 p.m.?  We plan to stay here again on our next visit.I've stayed at the Luxor for over a month in the pyramid. It is one of the coolest hotels and every experience was great.More like a 4.5 stars

We found a great deal on orbitz and stayed there. We were impressed! The design is awesome, we got a room in the tower, but taking the elevator in luxor was too good. The room service / valet guys were also nice and polite. We had to check-in late due to a medical thing and they were more than happy to accommodate us. 

They had given some coupons for breakfast but we did not use them, but they have a starbucks downstairs which was pretty cool.Room service is very expensive (like 9$ for a bagel!) - so the coupons they gave us were not useful at all

The rooms/bathrooms were clean.i really like mandalay bay. It was my home for 3 days and 2 nights and it gave me lots of memorable memories! very clean, room service is friendly and check in and check out is quick and easy. The view from our room was also spectacular! I definitely wouldnt mind staying here again when i visit vegas~ ^_^pros:
1. close to the airport. transport in and out is quick.
2. the 'beach', wave pool and lazy river are super family friendly and fun. my kids had a blast there.  the beachside grill and to-go food stand are priced well and offer pretty decent food.  if you're looking for a basic breakfast (sausage mcmuffin, ham mcmuffin, muffins, for about $6) i'd recommend eating here even if you don't plan on going into the water. some of the breakfast restaurants inside the hotel are a rip-off.
3. great prices on rooms.  i got a room for $65 (before tax and resort fee) through priceline.com
4. great, clean buffet (bayside cafe)
5. free tram to luxor of excalibur. then you can walk further north to the rest of the strip
6. foundation room lounge was very chill and had great views.

cons:
1. very far southern end of the strip.  if you're trying to get to the main part of the strip you'll have to cab or it's going to be a long walk
2. nightlife options are kinda weak. but if you don't care, who cares.Consider The Gun Store if you NEED to get a CCW Class ASAP.

It totally slipped my mind that my permit was up for renewal this month. I was able to reserve my slot in The Gun Store's free (you pay for range qualification ammo) NV/FL CCW class online, two days before the class. There are three CCWclasses a week. 

*Now, I have had issues with sales and range personnel in the past, so I had reservations returning, but The Gun Store offered the quickest and easiest solution to renewing my permit before I leave town on business.

My instructor this time around was the infamous Tony Dee aka The Godfather. He is a former lawman from NY, a regular firearms and training expert, and a guest from time to time on Pawnstars. This guy is hilarious! The class of about 20+ students was in good spirits thanks to Uncle Tony's sense of humor. Uncle Tony has a way of diluting the intimidation or nervousness one may have regarding the topic of carrying a firearm to protect your life, and the lives of your loved ones. Everything Tony taught was either backed up by the Nevada Revised Statutes, and/or his personal Law Enforcement experience.  The class was supplied with free coffee, air conditioning, and restrooms in close proximity. Bob Irwin, the owner of The Gun Store, even poked his head in. 

The course is mainly about legal issues regarding use of force, a brief presentation on modes of carry, and where you can and can't carry. You also get a book written by Bob Irwin on the subject of Concealed Carry in NV which includes many laws covered in class. I wish there would have been a bit more covered regarding tactics during a firefight, (moving off the x, cover vs concealment etc).  There is a pass/fail range qualifier following a 40 question test. The qualifier is not much of a sweat if you are proficient. For a novice, I suggest you spend time practicing strong side/support side single handed shooting from 3, 7, and 15 yards, first.

If you are taking the CCW course at The Gun Store for the first time...do yourself a favor and pre-qualify on the range a day or two before...the earlier the better! The initial class goes until approx 6PM (2PM for renewal), and you will be waiting in line for the range with the other students, plus tourists.

***I cannot stress this point enough...The NV approved CCW Course is not a replacement for defensive/tactical handgun training!!! This course is the bare minimum you need for the State of NV to legally be able to sign off on your permit. If you are going to carry a firearm to protect innocent life, you need regular quality training! I make this statement as a NRA certified firearms instructor with 10yrs military/LE and firearms experience.***

In summary, I rate 4 stars due to the class not being truly free (ammo) The class leaves you with the feeling that "heck, I don't want to shoot anyone!" which is in a way good, and exactly what Tony is going for. But when you need to shoot to live, you must feel confident in your decision to use justifiable deadly force to preserve life, without hesitation. I truly think the curriculum needs more real world drills/tactics discussed and exercised, which is totally possible considering the Instructor's extensive experience and knowledge.Boa... 
     What can I say? I was in Vegas for New Year's and on NYE (New Year's Eve) a friend called around and got our party a table there. Boa originally set a 6 course prix-fixe dinner for $150+ per person (I can't remember exactly but it was somewhere around there), but luckily he convince them to let our party dine there. The only requirement was that each member of our party had to spend at least $50, which was not difficult at a place like Boa. 
     To make things a little easier on our waiter our party of 12 people asked for 3 separate checks. My boyfriend and I ended up ordering a Porterhouse steak $45 and Lobster (MP - Market Price=$99) and a side order of asparagus $9 because all entrees are a la carte. When the host first seated our party, the waiter brought a round of complimentary shots for everyone. It was a shot of their famous drink "405" and a raspberry one which was less memorable. 
     I can't remember what time we had arrived at the restaurant, but our food arrived shortly before the big countdown to the New Year. The steak and lobster looked deceptively delicious on a porcelain plate, but I asked the waiter to keep the food warm while we went to the 2nd floor balcony for the countdown. It was a chilly evening in Vegas with a huge crowd on the streets. Boa supplied the guest with a champagne toast at 12. As everyone kissed and cheered in the cold, the fireworks were going off in the background at Rio and all I can think of is the food. After all that we went back inside to our hot food waiting for us to devour it. The Porterhouse steak was cooked to perfection (Medium) and the portion was big. The lobster was delicious as well, I didn't expect it to be as big as it was. My boyfriend and I are pretty big eaters and once we finished our food we were full, but of course I still wanted to indulge in their dessert. The only dessert available that evening was the Opera cake $16 on their prix-fixe menu. I must say it was definitely not worth the $16. The presentation was breathtaking, but once I cut into the cake and had a bite- I was not impressed. I would not order the Opera cake again. 

The food was great! The ambiance is really romantic and intimate with the dim lighting and lounge type dinning area where we sat.My party of five dined at BOA on 9/17/11.  We read many reviews and decided to try this place since we all love steaks.  We were not disappointed in the food, but we could not rate it above CUT at the Palazzo or Stripsteak in Mandalay Bay.  

That night's off the menu appetizer were escargot and French onion soup.  We tried the escargot.  The dish came with toasted bread and it was very good.  

We ordered the bone-in ribeye, petite filet, and bone-in filet.  All came out perfectly cooked, but we expected nothing less from a fine establishment such as BOA.  I really like the side dishes-the chipotle lime corn was fantastic with just the right amount of heat and tartness. Asparagus dish was grilled nicely, not overcooked and dried out like some restaurants. The mac-n-cheese with truffle oil was excellent-much better than the one at CUT.  We also ordered the fries, but the ones at Stripsteak were by far better than these.

The wait staff was very experienced.  They were courteous, prompt, and polite, couldn't ask for more.

Overall, it was a good experience, but nothing screamed WOW for us.  

If I had to rate the three top steakhouses in Las Vegas, it would be Stripsteak, then CUT, then BOA.I was in Vegas for a bachelorette party and we decided to do a nice dinner here before heading out on the town.  loved the ambiance and the staff were so incredibly nice. our table of six girls made up about 90% of the female clientele in the restaurant since many of the other tables looked like they were full of business men and guys out for their bachelor party. since we were planning on a long night out we didn't want to cut it short by eating ourselves into a food stupor. the staff were so nice and accommodating about us sharing our food since they said they usually serve family style.  Here's the food breakdown:

Oysters on the half shell: fresh, crisp, tasted like they were straight from the ocean.  No complaints there.

Frisee Salad: Basic salad. good nothing amazing, but I enjoyed it. 

Porterhouse (shared 3 ways): Meat was definitely high quality and delicious! I like my meat cooked rare, but since I was sharing with 2 other people we went medium rare so the meat was a bit more done than I care for.  The meat was still flavorful and super juicy. We actually didn't even finish the porterhouse even among 3 girls with very healthy appetites!

Sides: We ordered asparagus, yukon gold puree, and hen of the woods mushrooms.  At a steakhouse I'm really all about the meat so quality of the sides are important, but not my main focus. I enjoyed the asparagus and the yukon gold puree.  I usually enjoy any and all foods, but I have to admit the hen of the woods mushrooms were new to me and definitely had a taste that I found peculiar and just didn't work for me, but everyone else seemed to enjoy them. 

Dessert:  Table of 7 girls shared a chocolate souffle. IT WAS AMAZING.  Enough said... I'm not that big on chocolate but that souffle made me feel some feelings. ;)  

Overall, food was consistently good and the offerings were fairly basic steakhouse fare. Staff was wonderfully attentive and nice. I would have appreciated a better $50-$75/bottle selection of wines.  I know it's a finer dining experience, but after dropping all that money on food a decent affordable bottle of wine would have made it that much better. :)We had a work dinner on St. Paddy's day - it was wonderful.  Everything was served family style and everything was just plain old delicious.  We started with organic greens, and a plate of prosciutto - both were awesome: well seasoned and well executed.  The mains were rib eye, salmon, chicken with a side of risotto, mushrooms and asparagus.  Everything was just great esp the rib eye (as it should be since it's a steak house afterall).  But the best part of the meal was the dessert - the chocolate banana bread cake was to die for (in fact, I had an extra one to-go!).  But so was the awesome cinnabon-like glazed doughnut - it was just too die for!  I'd come back here just for that.4.5 stars. Had the bone-in ribeye.
It was cooked perfectly to medium rare as I had requested. TASTY! - Not quite Mastros but very close. 
Decent wine list with bottles starting at $60.
Great service with comfortable atmosphere, not too fancy. 
Got out of there for $300 including tip. (2 steaks + 2 sides + bottle of Malbec)You know, it's not the best food i've ever had...but it's pretty darn good.  Certainly in the top 10%.  Prices are reasonable considering the type of restaurant it is, service is very good.  I go there everytime i hit Vegas, and it never disappoints.  it's not the bite-size entrees that you get in some high-brow French restaurants.  This stuff fills you up.  i had the pate and the port short rib.  excellent.   it's kinda pain being inside Venetian--takes a while to find it.  But it's worth the trouble.A bright french restaurant inside the Venetian.  Its a verhy nice bustling place that is full of energy.  The waiters were very knowledgable and friendly.  

I tried the Chicken and waffles which I found  interesting.  The chicken was very soft and tender.  It just peeled off from the bones.  The waffles were a little salty with herbs and I want to say its with chives and/or onions so (interesting and not what I expected).  The Bread butter and jam were very good too.  It was an enjoyable experience.When I think of Paris I think of great food and wine. So when we went to Bouchon I had to go with a classic  -  Steak Frites and a nice red to wash it down.

The room decor was classic Paris, not over done with a nice open feel.  The steak was a filet cut, well seasoned, and cooked perfectly at medium rare. The shoe string fries were crunchy and plentiful.

The service was good with only a couple glitches. One it took forever to get a steak knife. The other was it took a while to get my wine.  However, I do take part of the blame having steak and wine at 10AM with the morning staff in full waffles, eggs, coffee, and juice mode.  It is Vegas though and I've got to keep them on their toes because I'm sure that's not the strangest request of the day!Oh the few times I eat fancy.

4.5/5 on Food. Came here for dinner on Friday night and the wait wasn't too bad. They over-exaggerated the wait time so it was speedy. I ordered the Steak Frites with macaroni gratin. Two other's in my party ordered the Steak Frites and our waitress was helpful to let us know that it comes with ALOT of fries and told us that we can substitute the frites for sweet corn or spinach. My friend got the sweet corn which was awesome and I totally loved it while I got the spinach. The spinach was not too bad, reminded me of the stir-fried chinese spinach but cooked with olive oil and a tad saltier. Totally random but all this can go with some rice haha. Moving on to the steak, I ordered a medium rare one which was FLAWLESS; I had to savor each bite because it was just that good. I also tried the ratatouille for the first time and I have to say it also blew my mind away because when I went to Wicked Spoon to try their's, it tasted like crap. The Gigot d'Agneau was pretty good too, just seemed a bit small of a portion but oh well. Also the frites? Not too sure what to say but they were legit French fries and were excellent as well!

Service was what made me drop it to 4 stars. Waitress and a server seemed to not be paying attention at times and our server didn't really appear to have a good mood on his face. What was also weird was another party came later than us but got their food a lot faster than we did.

All in all the bill wasn't too bad and literally satisfied. So down to come back here again or the Beverly Hills location since it's closer to me.Just can not wait to return to Sin City for another visit to Bouchon. Granted there is a Bouchon here in L.A., the service just doesn't match that here in Vegas. The service we received was very professional. Some highlights were the Sourdough Waffles with fresh strawberries, scrambled eggs which were so rich in flavor, and the sausage.  Obvious, started with the Bellini, could have had like six of those, and finished with espresso. I really recommend dining al fresco. Especially in the middle of summer, in the morning. It is so peaceful. A truly pleasant way to start the day. The only disappointment is that the chicken and waffles I was so looking forward to, ( thanks for all the teasing Yelp!) is only served on the weekends. Unfortunately we were there on a Monday morning. Would love to try a dinner here also! Can be a challenge to locate if your are unfamiliar with the layout of Palazzo/Venetian properties.Fantastic service; great wine and food.  Ask to sit on veranda or by windows for view of the fountains.mOk, this type of place really is not my cup of tea.....usually. The crowds of polished people drinking cocktails and dry humping on the dance floor usually will be overlooked for a beer and a football match at a pub.

however, Rumjungle made me shake my bum like it was my last day on earth. the drums were exciting to watch as well as the go-go dancers in cages, but after an hour i got a headache. this may be due to the shots of patron we had to celebrate our first night in vegas or possibly the dj who kept switching from one song to another after one verse. that got old fast. 
also, there was some idiot on his cell phone, on the dance floor, yelling to his pals back home that this place was "off the hizook". he said it like 5 times before they heard him. thanks dude.

patron shots.....oh god.
mojitos.....the best
dancers....mesmerizing
music.....ok for 30 second intervals
drums.....rad
atmosphere.....trendyWas dem einen Freud ist des anderen Leid. So empfinde ich es hier als sehr angenehm, dass diese Outlettmall, ausser die einzelnen Shops, nicht überdacht ist und man zwischen den einzelnen Shops im Freien wandeln kann.


 Sehr angenehm dagegen, dass hier anstelle eines großen Parkplatzes zwei Parkhäuser vorhanden sind. Somit stehen die Fahrzeuge überdacht und im Schatten.


 Die einzelnen Marken die ich hier vermisse, finden sich dann im Las Vegas Outlet Center (http://www.qype.com/place/1827323-Las-Vegas-Outlet-Center-Las-Vegas) am Las Vegas Blvd. südlich des Flughafens.Mr. Lucky's is really good! I've eaten here a few times, but have only gotten the $7.77 deal. It's sooo good! The steak is pretty delicious, along with the mashed potatoes and the buttery shrimp! The service is super friendly and very accommodating. The dessert is also realllly good! Definitely recommended!Huh, a lot of negative reviews lately.  We must be going at the wrong time because we've always been very happy with the food and atmosphere at the Bungalow. 

As long as some self-centered douchebag's not out there smoking a cigar, the patio's a great place to relax with some friends, a beer and some very decently priced grub.

P.S. They have a pretty good steak sandwich.Pretty good macaroni and cheese as well as the tomato panzanella salad. They make their own beer as well as soda (red cream soda, ginger ale, and cola maybe?). The service is pretty good. It can get really loud here, but they are accommodating of larger groups.With the Roman Candle, you get what you pay for.  It's pricey for the average college student or grad student in this town, but gives you real bang for your buck with all of their pies.  Also, they do have some monthly deals that make eating there more worth it (like free icecream with your purchase, or garlic bread, or even 25% off offers).  I wasn't as impressed by their salads, but that's not really why you go to a pizza place anyway...  Their interior has a warm and friendly atmosphere that's good for families and others. Best pizza I've had in Madison.I also didn't have a problem with the atmosphere. I found it warm and welcoming and our waitress was very friendly. As a Bostonian, I'm used to being ignored by waitstaff, pricey yet boring food, being deafened by awful music and squawking fellow patrons time and time again.

But Nat Spil treated me very well- no pretension- and I will return!i hate clubs...
but i liked pure.

drinks were way to much.. but it's vegas.
drink of the night? Jack on the Rocks (ps. don't drink this after eating a NICE steak dinner with red wine)

hot dancers.
great DJs
rolled up with 6 girls and i still had trouble getting in... go diamond card!

all n' all... one of the best clubs i've seen in vegas.

OH! and they have a coat check... 
and the best bathroom selection of smokes i've ever seen in my life! (upstairs)Definitely authentic.  Definitely saw tourists get spanked.  Definitely paid 16 bucks for a beer.  I've been to Germany and this is as close to a real Hofbrauhaus as I've seen in the states which explains why they can be a bit overpriced.  I recommend going at least once for the experience.The attitude here is a little too elite for my taste. 

However, I love that it is open late and they also happen to have the best damn sweet potato fries in town (think aioli!). The burgers are the only way to go here, I've had the tuna sandwich and the fish was horribly dry. As well as the veggie wrap. The salads are mediocre for their price. 

Def stick with the burgers.Modern, "yuppie" atmosphere but the food is consistently good, and the craft beer selection is among the very best in Phoenix.  Open late.  Service is usually good.  Clean restrooms too, which seems to be the exception to the norm in Phoenix.

Highly recommend sweet potato fries.

I prefer weeknights early in the week to avoid the crowd.Like Joanne said, I love vintage, old school and etc. It's just so classic, so well Vegas. Watching this show feels like you'd travel back in the early show days of Vegas. The music, costumes and everything just feel so classic. I watched the topless show, hey why not? I went with my girlfriend and we enjoyed this show. The guy who flew around with the piece of fabric is amazing. He did it very smooth and elegant. It was a one man show at the time and lasted for about a few minutes. 

There were so many different acts and people were just dancing and running around singing and all that. We had to keep looking everywhere cause people will appear everywhere. The mexican group? That did the rope with some piece of rock? that hit the floor was funny. Haha I had a great laugh when he was doing his show. 

I got good prices for front seat dead center in the middle and we got to  see everything. I think if you are far away you won't be too disappointed but just pay a little more to see all the detail the show had to offer. I had a great time watching this.Seriously one of the best eggs benedict that I have ever had from a buffet. Rich, buttery perfected hollandaise sauce.We had breakfast here during the week. It was a hybrid brunch with a few lunch type items. We arrived shortly after 8 am and only waited about 10 minutes before we paid and were seated. My husband loved the omelet station and the bacon was perfectly crispy. Service was very good and even the decaf coffee was really good.

The cost of the buffet was about the same as the "sit down" breakfast we had at Cafe Bellagio and we had many more choices and fuller bellies!

Take the time to get an M Life card before you go and you'll save yourself some time getting in. Also get there early for breakfast and you won't be waiting with a rumbling stomach!I would give this more of a 3.5 star rating. Went here since it was listed on the top 10 buffets in Vegas multiple times. It was about $35 for  lunch here. Thankfully, the line was not awfully long and we got seated right away. The decor here could use a serious facelift. It feels like a pretty old space. With the right decor, I think more people would enjoy their dining experience! 

The variety was just OK. I guess they did hit on a lot of different types of cuisines, but a lot of the dishes were average and not memorable in both presentation and appeal. A lot of things I just looked at and passed on because they looked messy. 

Some highlights: calamari Greek salad (really tender and tasty!), carving station (prime rib), 2 different types of crab (snow and king, but both super frozen), pesto mashed potatoes, herbed polenta, and chocolate covered strawberries! They had spicy tuna hand rolls which were made-to-order. They were ok, a little on the spicy end. I wish they had more custom sushi roll options. 

Service was really good--they came back a lot for refills and to clear our plates. A decent option if in the area.great buffet. ate here twice (we stayed at the planet hollywood) and got coupons so we ended up paying around $15 dollars a head.

great selection of food but, like others have stated, the quality of the food is incredible. they had dolmas and hummus in their middle eastern section and it was just as tasty as my favorite persian restaurant.

seafood section was bomb, as well as the ribs from their american section.

overall great buffet.One of the best buffets that I have been to in Vegas. Not very crowded. All of the food is very fresh. They have salad, soup, american, french, mexican, asian, italian, dessert and (most importantly) a badass seafood station. Go here! You won't regret it. Also, alcoholic drinks are very well priced. $5 for a red bull and skyy vodka. Not too shabby,This has to be one of my new favorite buffet's on the strip.  I ended up getting the 24hour buffet pass which was $39.99.  Planet Hollywood  was the first buffet that we went to and we liked it so much we went back again. 

The line was minimal compared to my other favorite buffets (Mandalay Bay and The Wynn).  They do have crab legs for dinner but they are served cold.

Worth the money!!!the club itself is beautiful and because a porn convention was going on this weekend, there were tons of industry people around.  our group didn't have a table but we were able to sit with some guys who were talking to some of the girls so that was good luck  i don't think i would go again if i didn't have a table. 

the music was ok, nothing amazing, and ordering drinks at the bar took forever but the guy who was taking care of the table was really attentive and good about getting us to stay in a certain area without being rude so i thought the service was good overall.  

it was hard to dance because it was so crowded and if i'm drinking at a club, i need to dance it off.  in the end, a good club is a good club but i guess it was a typical vegas experience and it was fun but not something i'd hurry back for.Probably one of the largest and the most popular club in Vegas, even though its 4-5 years old. I always seem to enjoy myself when I'm here..The drinks are pretty expensive, which is expected since we're in Vegas! The club is always packed and the ambience and decor is pretty nice. The dance floor is ALWAYS pack so good luck making way through that dark hole we all call a dance floor. Good place to people watch or watch the dancers in the bathtubs with only pasties on...It's good to be a girl in Vegas.  It's even better to be a group of 3 girls, with no guys to hold you back.  We walked up to Tao on Friday night and saw a huge line snaking around.  A promoter saw us, walked over, and asked if we were on a guest list.  My friend pouted and said, "No...is there anything you can do for us?"  5 seconds later we had his business card, 3 bracelets that got us an open bar until 11pm, and free entry.  10 seconds later we were walking past that pesky line, right in.  

When you walk in the first thing you notice are the stone bathtubs lining the walls, with multi-colored rose petals and candles floating on top of the water.  Very beautiful.  The place is HUGE inside...there is a big downstairs with a bar area, and a really small, packed dance floor.  Upstairs has multiple rooms coming off a huge hallway where you can walk by and see pretty girls wearing pasties and bikini bottoms sitting in tubs together, or massaging each other.  (Kind of weird, but I get what they're going for.)  Aside from all that, there was a hip hop room up there with some of the best music I have heard in years.  

If you go upstairs yet again, up a pretty long flight at that, you will get to Tao Beach, which is on the roof.  By the time I made it up here I had had quite a few vodka-sodas so...it didn't make much of an impression on me.  It was more of a "chill" scene, which wasn't what we were looking for.

The crowd was okay...mostly young, white and Asian, and lots of people smoking.TAO - it's packed with lots of people, some on the prowl, some looking for a place to stand, some looking to dance.

Huge space with multiple bars and rooms, so I guess something for everyone. Avoid the main lines if you can, guestlist line is better. Maybe dining in would make things smoother. 

That night, the tunes were good, the bars had lines too long but the people were having a good time. I'd come back if the hassle is low. VIP tables seemed useless.

The line of people at 1:30AM still paying cover to get in was baffling.The restaurants food definately wasnt the greatest, in fact it was really shitty. Lol But our main purpose of coming here wasnt for the food., it was the Line Pass stamp u get for the Tao night club. The staff and the service from our server and a floor supervisor was surperb ! made up for the crappy food. they offered us a new entree since I didnt even touch mines. but there was just nothing appetizing on the menu ! so I didnt bother to get anything else. but they were kind enuff not to charge me for it and sent over a great complimentry dessert platter at the end. The bus boi how ever were really rude. he spilt soy a sauce on my friend and wasnt very apologetic at all. but like i said the other ppl made up for the lack of service from the bus bois.

The Line Pass gave us comp entry into the night club. and we were intructed to come in around 10:30 so that we didnt have to wait in line. We finished dinner at 9:30 and there was a HUGE massive line up outside already. crazie. went to grab a few a drinks. came back at 10:30 walked right in and had a great time.  Club is packed as hell. So we stayed in our cozy corner and didnt explore much. there was just too much ppl.

If I recommened this restaurant for anything its to come here and eat something and get urself a line pass stamp for the club. abasaloeutly worth it. dun expect too much from the food though =)

oh and a plus. when we left around..i forgot the time lol  but  they gave us little black Tao flip flops which I thought was  a nice touch cuz everywhere u look u see beautiful girls walkin around bare feet and holding onto thier heels. =)Get on the roof! This is where the fun/action is! Came here for Dash/ATB during EDC weekend and had one of my most fun clubbing experiences ever.

Make sure to pre-purchase your tickets though, or you'll be waiting in a line forever.Contemporary trend in design, it seemed to fit the up-and-coming and ever-changing Las Vegas.  I love the way the room looked as well as the flat panel tvs that came with it.  Actually, all of TheHotel's room are considered suites.  The simple but yet tasteful designs of the suites made me want to remodel my own room to look like it..  Our room was clean as I expect every Vegas hotel rooms to be, and we were well accomodated whenever we requested of housekeeping.  The best part, their pool; it was big and it comes with man-made tide which gave it a beach feel.  It was amazing to say the least not to mention the people you see there whether sun-bathing or 'catching the wave'.

Unfortunately, despite of overall positive feel, I couldn't give it a 5-star rating.  First of all, the distance of the pool to the hotel rooms was pretty far compared to other Vegas hotels.  Second, tv signal feeding the flat panel were horrible.  It's one thing when it's not HD signal, but it's another when the signal were worse than my basic cable.  Yes I didn't stay in the room much aside from just sleeping, and most of the time I am out at the pool side, the casino, on the Strip, etc., but that doesn't mean the quality of tv shows I potentially would watch can be sub par.

So far this summer I have stayed there twice already, and would still stay there in the future when get the chance.  I highly recommend the stay just because of the pool.., but do consider the fact that because this hotel is the furthest south of the strip compared to other major hotels, depending on where you want to go, it would require either driving yourself or hailing a cab / limo.Decent place to stay in Vegas considering the price was only 100 bucks a night.  I'm told all the rooms are suites and since we brought the kids a suite sounded better than two regular rooms.  The room had two double beds, a spacious bathroom with separate tub and shower and a sitting room with a separate toilet.  I don't know if the sofa had a bed in it but since my wife ordered a roll away mattress I'm thinking not.  Too bad because they charge extra for the roll away.  The room rate was still pretty good thanks to a shitty economy.  Perhaps the price goes up on weekends or in the summer?

The place is kind of dark and has a funky, sweet smell to it.  I'm thinking they must continually spray something to cover up the cigarette stench.  There is a wave pool and lazy river for the kids and a nice aquarium you can pay to take the kids to.  Next door is the Luxor with a nice Titanic exhibit and adjacent Bodies exhibit.  Packages are available with discount tickets for all three attractions.  Right now, The Lion King is playing at the Mandalay Bay Hotel but tickets are kind of steep.  For people so inclined there are kiosks all over the place with steeply discounted tickets if you are willing to listen to a timeshare pitch for 2 hours.all suite hotel
very  "W" type
Parking lot right in front of lobby
no casinoI haven't been to Vegas in years and I was very excited that I was going to re-visit my old stomping grounds.  A friend of mine recommended to stay at the Mandalay Bay because they had a great wave pool for sonny boy.

We arrived at the Mandalay Bay and were attempting to check in as follows:  
*  10:20 am - Hubby informed Mandalay desk person that we were checking in.  
*  Mandalay inhospitable staff person states, "You cannot check in until 10:30 am.  
*  Hubby replies, "That's in 10 minutes...can't you get my information now?" 
*  Mandalay inhospitable staff person replies, "NO".

So, we get step aside and wait 10 minutes to check in for the 2nd time.  We are fortunate that we did not get that inhospitable desk person again and dealt with a more pleasant and properly trained staff person who informs us that we actually have reservations for TheHotel which was around the corner from the Mandalay Bay reservations desk.

We check into TheHotel at the Mandalay Bay but were informed that our room would not be ready for an hour.  We were told that they would call us when the room was available.  So, off we went to grab something to eat at the Mandalay Bay Cafe.  We received the call that our room was ready half way through our meal.  We arrive to our room and the Mandalay amenities and I was pleasantly surprised with the following:  

(1)  Separate Living Room 
Couch, chair, desk, tv, wet bar, and floor to ceiling windows in a separate living room area.  Roomy, clean, modern and nicely decorated.

(2)  Powder Room and Full Bathroom
Separate powder room located in the foyer.  In addition, full bathroom with separate shower, bathtub, and toilet room.  Plus, a big twin vanity area with a lil flat screen tv.  Very Nice!

(3)  Separate Bedroom
Separate bedroom with 2 queen beds, tv, lots of storage area, and floor to ceiling 
windows.  Beds were comfy.... =)

(4)  Free Wi-Fi & Smoke Free Rooms
Makes your stay so enjoyable!

(5)  Mandalay Bayside Buffet
Buffet dinner for $29 per person including unlimited champagne, white & red wine, or beer.  A great value!

(6)  Various Restaurants In The Mandalay Bay 
A big plus to have a variety of restaurants in the resort area because you get sick of the buffet quickly!

(7)  Starbucks
Located on the ground floor of TheHotel....wonderful!

(8)  Wave Pool
There's a height limit that kids need to meet to enter the wave pool....fantastic!  The waves don't come that often so it's more like a huge pool which is very relaxing and refreshing when it's 107 degrees outside.

Some of the negatives of TheHotel:  
-  The staff are not very friendly and seem unhappy to be working at the resort. 
-  The resort is far from the other hotels and shopping areas.  Not very convenient and there wasn't much action in the casino.
-  One day, we left our room at 7:00 am and returned at 4:30 pm to find out that our room was not cleaned.
-  Besides the wave pool, there is no other place to escape from the heat.  The lazy river is so tiny and was filthy at 9:00 am in the morning.  

I enjoyed my stay at TheHotel at the Mandalay Bay Resort.  I luved my roomy 2 room suite with 1 1/2 bathrooms.  I would return again.  4 Stars!great great steak..
this was my first time staying in the wynn/encore and we are so glad we chose SW for our first meal. we were all in a rush to hit up the nightlife so we skipped appetizers and went right to the porter houses. there were 8 of us and most of us split a couple of porter houses. The meat was cooked perfect and i sware everyone got a steak knife but me and i just used the butter knife to cut my steak. it was so tender and had SO much flavor. probably my second best steak i ever had. Kean's NY and Luger's NY are at my top. the sides were tiny but all were so very good especially the potatoes. we used to make charlie Palmer's our Vegas steak place but now it will have to be SW... good job Steve now just get rid of Sinatra's at encore...Not too bad crepe place in the Paris hotel & casino. I'm not a big fan of the food type crepes but the dessert crepes were pretty good.Soooooooooooooo good! Cheeeeeeeeeessssse...don't know what else to say 'cept this hit the spot when I was staying at The Paris and it was a bargain for the size compared to some meals in sin city. Vege options of course ; )Being in San Diego, I don't really get that many opportunities to get good crepes so I always make an effort to stop by this place whenever I go to Las Vegas.  Crepes in Paris?  Seems idealistic, right?  The crepes here are a bit pricey but are well worth the money.

I usually come here after getting some sort of alcoholic drink served in a big plastic Eiffel Tower.  I've tried the Nutella crepe and the peanut butter crepe.  Both of which I consider are EXCELLENT.  The Nutella has a nice flavor to it.  The Nutella compliments the warm crepe will.  Top it off with whipped cream and this one is a winner.  

The peanut butter crepe is probably my favorite of them all.  It's filled with peanut butter and banana.  The creaminess of the peanut butter coupled with the warm crepe makes for an excellent dessert.  It's definitely one of my favorite guilty pleasures when coming to Vegas.Convenient location for a quick meal between conference sessions. I actually visited La Creperie twice during the week I was in Vegas, and got to try 3 different crepes by sharing with friends. I tried the fresh berry, caramel apple, and roasted chicken crepes. I highly recommend all three, but my favorite was the caramel apple. Oh my goodness... tart green apples with tons of gooey caramel... soooo yummy :) All crepes were about $10-12 dollars, and one of the days I visited they were running a special so I got a crepe and a fountain soda for $10- cheaper than the crepe alone! 

Side note: This is one of the few locations in the shops that you will find a bathroom and open seating... take advantage.Once you've seen one Cirque du Soleil, you've kinda just seen them all.  The only things that change is the stage/background/storyline. The acrobatics, contortionists, performances are pretty much the same.

This is a great show, because people are swimming and performing in the water! The synchronized swimming is so interesting and fun to watch. There is a sense of wonder...... underwater exits and entrances? breathing tubes? You will see if you watch the show yourself and all your questions will be answered. 

I sat...... fourth row from the stage in the 3rd seat from the aisle. It wasn't that bad to be sitting up close.... the only time I didn't enjoy my seat was when performers ran up and down the stairs and across the center aisle (which wasn't that often). 

The best seats would be in the back center, or right by the railing in the front center of the balcony.O was the second Cirque show that I have seen. Mystere was the first. Although O is the more elaborate production, I still prefer Mystere. Can't really say why, sorry. O really is a spectacular show. The staging is very complex. One second someone is walking in a couple of inches of water, and all of a sudden someone dives into the same spot and it's a deep pool. I guess you can say they really mess with your mind. I recommend getting a couple of drinks into you in order to take full advantage of the insane staging of this show.  

As far as the "good for kids", I checked off not sure. Everyone knows their own kids, so you need to determine their maturity level. This show is more adult than Mystere or Love, so if you have kids along and are not sure, you might want to go for one of those. (you can read my reviews on both).My first Cirque du Soleil show and if their shows are like KA, then I need to watch more Cirque du Soleil shows because they bring some talented people to perform for them.  The performers were on beat and the set up was great with the boat and the underwater scene.  Their is no bad seat since its a good view to watch from the cheap seats where we sat at.  Now its onto "O"I enjoyed KA. I was supposed to get tickets years ago (timing didn't work out) and my husband surprised me with them for our anniversary. 
I wasn't blown away like I expected (probably because the story was iffy...), but it was still really good, pretty much everything you'd expect from Cirque Du Soleil. I loved the people jumping and swinging over the audience, I couldn't take my eyes off them! The ticket folk in full costume and makeup-very fun! It all got to be very interactive at times and I like that sort of thing. 
Tip- you want seats far in the back so you can take it all in. I was in the back end of the mid-section and those 2 tickets still cost $120+.Yes, it was a little disappointing that the Battle scene wasn't live.  I understand the circumstances and that you can't just simply change the ending, but I was waiting for a big finish!  But, the show really impressed me.  The story was followable and the acts were great.  This was my first Cirque experience and I wasn't too sure what to expect - the stage and theater were really impressive to me! I don't think you'll find a stage like this anywhere else.  I walked out of the show wishing it was longer and wanting to go see some of the other ones!

Just an FYI: I booked my tickets through a Living Social promo that redirected me to the MGM ticket site.  The tickets were only like $65 a piece. The map on the website showed that our seats were in the first row of the 200s sections, near the middle of the theater.  However, when we picked them up, our tickets were completely backwards and instead of being in the middle, we were on the very end which made it difficult to see.  So, next time, I would call to make sure the seats were actually as advertised.What a great performance! They must have had to practice a lot to get their acts right. 

Every single act was nicely done. I was so sleepy due to lack of sleep (why sleep when you are in Vegas?) but I was fully awake throughout the show.As it was "Restaurant Week" in Las Vegas, RM Seafood offered a prix fixe for $30.09. The second course of this prix fixe was the signature "RM Cioppino" which normally runs around $33 by itself. We had the prix fixe. 

The host was professional and friendly. A bit too handsome though, I prefer my fine dining host to be an attractive-yet-seemingly-sexually-accessible female, or an eager-to-please eunuch.

The wait staff were all attentive and quick, hustling about without looking as though they were rushing. If I worked at this restaurant, they would have to hide my sweaty fumbling in a back refrigerator.

The ambiance was pleasant. The lighting was just dim enough for the candles to add a visual warmth. The sounds from the kitchen and surrounding conversations held at soothing levels.

The biscuits and cornbread were tasty.

We each ordered an appetizer. (three of us)

I got the Top Chef Masters Moondoggies. Basically a seafood corndog, but not basic at all!  Absolutely delicious. Since a series of superlatives won't do this deep-fried-wonder-on-a-stick justice, I will attempt a play-by-play of my mouth:

8:32pm
Waiter arrives with Moondoggies. Two "moondoggies", each roughly the size of a C-cell battery, accompanied by a small mound of slaw. I pick up a moondoggie.

Heat radiates from the dog as my teeth break though outer crust of cornmeal, which cracks in a manner similar to a deep-fried spring roll wrapper.

My teeth cleave through the steaming mantle of cornmeal and firm "dog" flesh, and the fried shell touches my tongue. Its surface feels glassy, as if made up of thousands of smooth, tiny pebbles.

I chew, as the umami-rich juice of the dog fills my mouth. Once solid flesh of the dog breaks into its components, a chunk of shrimp here, a scallion disk there, a bit of cilantro, a sliver of garlic.

I continue to chew, the savory dog mixes with the light sweetness of the cornmeal. Bits of the crispy cornmeal shell sporadically crackle.

I sip water

I lick a bit of the green cilantro mayonnaise squiggle they have squirted upon the dog. It's nice, but a little too mild to factor heavily in the flavor play. Maybe if I had a little bowl to dip the dog in?
8:33-5pm
More biting and chewing with similar results.
8:36pm
Moondoggie named lightweight champion of my mouth.

The other appetizers were a shrimp cocktail (very good, but nothing worth writing about) and a Beef Tartar (well spiced and tender, with great flavor, but again, not a champion.)

One friend ordered a glass of wine, so we all did. I can't tell you how ignorant I am about wine, so let me show you: The wine comes to the table. I take a sip, and I damn-near hear music it is so good. They must have stolen this stuff from God's own cellar, from the door with the lock on it.

I ask "what is this?".

My friend, who eats at fine dining establishments about as often as I eat at Arby's (about once a week, *sob*), says, "I'm not sure, but it's a pinot noir".

I think to myself, "but this is a 'White' wine. 'Noir' means 'Black' in the French language." Luckily, I didn't reveal how stupid I am by uttering any of that out loud. I just said, "Really?" and made a puzzled face.

So the wine was really good, and now I'm beginning to wonder why my two best friends put up with my ignorant ass.

On to the Prix Fixe:

1st Course
Iceberg BLT
Bacon, Sweet 100's, Buttermilk Ranch Dressing

Yuck! This was the worst part of the meal. A wedge of iceberg lettuce, two cherry tomatos, some bacon, and crumbled bleu cheese. I really think someone forgot the rest of the buttermilk dressing. I ate it all anyway. Fat bastard.

2nd Course
RM Cioppino

This is what a great recipe properly executed tastes like. Mussels, clams, prawns, seasonal fish, and calamarata pasta tied together by a light, mouthwateringly memorable, tomato broth/sauce. Mussels and clams popped lightly when bitten, the flesh tender when chewed. The pasta, cooked to bull's eye perfection, was a wonderful foil for the broth and it's tiny chunks of tomato. To be honest, the prawns were the slightest bit overcooked when compared to the mussels and clams (where was the pop and give? the tenderness?). The small cubes of seasonal fish, like the pasta, seemed to accentuate the savory broth rather than standing on its own. The dish was accompanied by two pieces of heavy-fat garlic bread. Yet another vehicle for that incredible broth. 

It's a substantial course. Imagine a globe the size of a basketball. Slice through this basketball/globe at the arctic circle, from the arctic circle up to the north pole is around the amount of deliciousness you get.

3rd Course
Blueberry Cobbler

Bellys full, our dining experience requirements soundly met, and fearing disappointment, we considered asking for the check and exiting at this most excellent moment.

Could a desert synonymous with shoe repair provide a satisfying coda to this nourishing sonata?

Absolutely. Definitely stick around for this bad boy.We loved the art and the whole abiance of the place - it will give you a good LV experience, especially if this is your first time in LV.. We've been always meaning to have dinner here, but felt it would be too much of a tourist trap, so finally we tried it.  I thought the main course and appetizers were better then deserts, but overall, we had a good experience and would certainly come again.. There're definitely other 5 star places in LV, slighly off the beaten path, but this restarant is definitely in the top 10 in my experience (for Vegas and taking the fact that Bellagio has TOn of foot traffic, tourists, etc, Picasso managed to not turn into a revolving door of just eaters.. if you know what i mean).The ladies and I came here for some bachelorette celebrating on Saturday night at 11:30pm. A coworker of ours put us on the guest list, so not sure how hard/expensive that would have been to get in. I was a little put off at first by the crowd... wasn't expecting an older, 40ish type crowd, and the area seemed small since there were a few private tables/sections that took up half the space. The view from the balcony was amazing, but too cold for us to stay out there to hang out. Claudeen worked her charm and we were able to walk around and get a tour of the back/VIP rooms thanks also to our boy Ralph. During the tour, we proceeded to meet some friendly brothers and their friends that just wanted to dance and have fun. So of course, we obliged and had a great time... lots of hilarious pictures ensued. We also randomly met Dean Roland from Collective Soul, nice guy and his friends were funny and just enjoying themselves. Unfortunately, I'm not a social butterfly, so I couldn't keep up.

The other nice thing was that the place was carpeted, so wearing heels all night wasn't as painful with the padding. Music was okay, we usually prefer hip hop, but we had a great time either way and got to request a few songs. Most of the guys we met that night were super nice and gentlemenly. I noticed though it seemed like there were more guys than girls. And at least it didn't feel like they were staring. Luckily also, our bachelorette didn't get too weirded out with all the crazy stuff we made her do with them. =P We even had a few cuties help us pick our club for the next night too. Too bad they didn't join us, though. ;)Amazing view, nice place to see a show. I was blown away by the view as you can see the entire Vegas Valley from atop Mandalay Bay. We were there for the Jake Owens show and I was impressed with how close we were to the artist. Its like having top musicians come to your house and play in your living room. I can't wait until the next event I am fortunate enough to be invited to here.Much nicer hotel than the price would indicate...definitely recommend it if you are going to stay off the strip.  The staff in the hotel, spa and casino were all incredibly helplful.Great area...nice casino but it seems that not a lot a people come hereNice hotel. Beds soft. Rooms awesome. Overall layout was weird though. Had to take two different sets of elevators to find my room. Pool is cool. They have a sand area for kids to play in. Expensive drinks. Super nice bartenders.Hotel is nice. The pool is closed during construction and In the winter. The spa pool and steam room is available to hotel guests. It is worth it and amazing. Favorite part of the trip for sure! We stayed in the resort the entire trip, no need to go to the strip. There's no dancing or night life but the happy hour at Hank's was great. Dirty and pear martini's were excellent and strong. The staff their do not crack smiles not even a little bit. We would go back for sure!This hotel was absolutely fantastic! My room was beautiful, the hot tub was open all night. The front desk (especially Marques) were outstanding. I ate at the buffet it was very good also.I went to the one at the Venetian... 

It had a nice ambiance, and I was seated on the patio so it had sort of an outdoor-cafe feel, even though I was facing the slot machines. Nice for people watching. I went at lunch and had a really nice server named Adam L. (at least that's what the receipt said). I recommend the WARM baked-to-order chocolate chip pecan cookies. You can eat some and take home some to eat later. The smell is so rich, and they bring them right out of the oven already nicely packed in a box. I brought some back to my hotel, but the cookie monster ate my leftovers the next day. :( I was sooooo sad... a little consideration would've been nice. I guess the cookie monster really liked them. I was SOOOO looking forward to eating one the next day.

Only gave them 4 stars because I'd have to go back to try something else off the menu worth raving about besides the cookies. Oh yeah, their cafe latte is EXCELLENT with the cookies. No sugar needed if you have the latte w/ the cookies. It's a nice balance.I love this place! Always open and always reliable! Everything we ordered was good. My favorites are the salads because their HUGE. I usually get the Ahi tuna salad, but when its a weekend, I get the breakfast buffet. Waffles, sausage, ham, eggs, danish, and fresh fruit for $15.Grand Lux Cafe... 
     Thank you Grand Lux Cafe or I would have not survived Vegas for a week. My boyfriend and I stayed at the Venetian on our New Year's Vegas trip. I ate here at least 3 times; the first time was at 3 AM on our arrival night. I ordered a club sandwich, which was pretty good on an empty stomach from my 5.5 hrs drive from LA to Vegas. I ordered the sandwich from the bakery because the line was long for the restaurant itself due to club goers. I was disappointed when the guy at the register told me that the wait time will be 40 mins. 40 mins for a sandwich! He was lucky I was hungry! 

     A few days later I grabbed some lunch from the bakery, I had ordered a BBQ chicken pizza and a Caesar salad. The pizza was really good and satisfying. The salad was fresh and the dressing was tasty. My friends had ate some lunch from the cafe about 30 mins earlier, when my boyfriend and I arrived at the suite we were luckily to have some of their calamari. The calamari is to die for!! It comes with an array of dipping sauces and in the mix of calamari - there are some pieces of zucchini. After bites and bites of calamari, it's refreshing to take a bite of the soft zucchini. It helps balances the taste of the calamari. Especially with fried foods, after a handful I'm usually sick of the greasy taste in my mouth. The calamari at Grand Lux is fried perfectly and keeps you wanting more. The portions of the food is pretty good too. 

     On my next Vegas trip, Venetian and Grand Lux are definitely on my hit list.Ah, grand lux is gonna forever remind me of some good times in vegas. Me and my friends came here at 2am-ish friday night (or saturday morning i should say) after a long drunken night out. I really like that it's open all the time, that its right next to the elevators up to the rooms and that we didn't have to wait very long for seating. We ordered the calamari, some kind of sandwich and spinach artichoke dip. The calamari tasted soooo gooood, spinach artichoke dip was really good, and I dont remember much about the sandwich but I'm sure it was fine. 

We came here saturday night too, also after a long night out. This time we came with 12 girls so we had to wait a little longer for seating but it was still pretty fast (also probably because it was 2-3am in the morning). Our table split chicken and waffles, calamari (yes again because it was so good) , some kind of pizza and some other dish with egg or something but I didn't get to try it. Everything was pretty good from what I can remember. I think we ordered maybe 7 dishes in total and the bill came out to 100 something dollars.

If you do go there, I'd say get calamari for sure because its really delicious (cant go wrong with fried stuff). Spinach artichoke dip was also really good but I think its usually good no matter where you get it. Chicken and waffle (one big waffle) were just eh. Grand Lux is affiliated with cheesecake factory and I can see why, it really does remind me of a more expensive cheesecake factory. But still, if youre staying at the venetian, its a great convenient place to go after a night out.Can I just say never would I have imagined I would fall in love with a "MUSHROOM BURGER" and I'm not talking about a portabello slapped between 2 pieces of bread.

If you've seen ground turkey or veggie patty, that's how this burger was made.  And whatever was used to keep it altogether, was awesome!  My friend had the pasta dish but it was a bit dry.  Perhaps eating at 330am would be one of the reasons for dry pasa?  I don't know...but I would stick with the burgers at those times.

I even had breakfast and was happy to see that their food was consistently good overall and went back to have another burger the next day.

At a casino cafe, don't expect great service nor fast.  However, the staff at this location was efficient, quick, and tried to get to all customers as quick as possible.

This location has a better setup than the Palazzo so if you were like me and stayed at the Palazzo, perhaps stay at the Venetian (shorter walk) and open 24/7.  

I ate at the Palazzo location and the mushroom burger is the same at both but as for the rest of the food, you'll have to be the judge.

I plan to try the LA location of this establishment.  Hopefully the food is up to par like in Vegas.3.5 stars! 
My sister ordered the chicken and waffles. The chicken was really dry and unseasoned, but the honey pecan sauce that came with it was very yum-o. It was the only thing that could save the dryness of the chicken. 

I ordered the egg white omelette with ham, spinach, onions, mushroom with English muffin. But they got my order completely wrong and gave me some omelette with cheese and wheat toast. But I forgave them because they were gracious about it and the adowobo manager apologized to me. It was $12.95, but the $16.95 buffet would have been more worth the price since that included custom omelettes as well. When my order came again, there was too much ham, but barely any spinach. Booo. 

They had typical but delicious buffet items. I will come back!This is basically a 24-hour Cheesecake Factory, but better, by virtue of it being IN THE VENETIAN.

We kicked off our Vegas trip here, after arriving around 11. Definitely started the trip off right with some surprisingly tasty cocktails - the Pineapple Smash was so awesomely summer, and the Shoot The Moon beer cocktail was really great as well. 

For food, the waiter accidentally brought me the Spicy Buffalo Chicken Sandwich, instead of the Spicy Flat Bread Chicken Sandwich I ordered. BUT IT'S OKAY, because he apologized profusely and gave us a complimentary dessert at the end. The buffalo chicken sando itself was spicy and friend and huge and perfect, and I am certainly glad about his mistake. I also tried my friend's kobe burger and it was really, REALLY tasty. One note, though: don't come here when you're counting calories.

For (free!) dessert, the waiter brought out a Warm Butter Cake, which was, frankly, THE BEST. It tasted sort of like a waffle not in a waffley shape, and the ice cream and strawberries just really completed it.

Overall, definitely an choice place for some late night dining, if you can excuse having deja vu of your local Cheesecake Factory.We had lunch here. I had half a chicken salad sandwich, with mixed green salad, and chicken corn potato soup. Everything was delicious.  I just didn't like the cigarette smoke coming from the casino, but I got used to the smell. lolI wouldn't go here to eat, but I ate here anyway to get the Front of the Line Pass you can get to enter the music venue earlier than everybody else. At other House of Blues locations, you can buy merchandise to get the pass, but here you have to order at least one entree. My meal was so forgettable, but the service was great all around.

The venue seems bigger to me than other HOBs because they've got a balcony with at least four or five rows of theater style chairs. The floor area is about as big as other HOBs. What made my experience at this HOB better than any of the other HOB locations was the staff there. They were so helpful with asking any questions and the security staff was the nicest I've ever encountered. Really cool security dude helped me get the lead singer's guitar pick. :) I'd give this five stars if they dropped the no-cameras policy.Staff was great. They went above and beyond. Originally booked the foundation room for my wedding reception but upon review of my needs and guestlist the wedding coordinator closed the House of Blues restaurant for us to meet our needs. Food was great. Setting was awesome. Loved everything about this venue!Music is a good mixture. Love the waterfall scenery. It has been quite entertaining everytime I go there. Only complaint I have for this place is the line for guys to get in.Saturday night. 12AM. There's a bit of a line, but the doorman Andy let us in as his guests free.  (Thanks man!)  Inside, the music was great (top 40's), and the crowd was fun!  It's quite nice inside, pretty waterfall/pool area outside.  The bartenders are OK - though we did run into one extremely dumb bartender who could not multitask and stood there looking very confused for 10 minutes when she couldn't find who a credit card belonged to - and also kept giving the wrong drinks to the wrong people.  Otherwise, in comparison to some of the other clubs Tryst is much nicer, has a better crowd, great music - pretty much guaranteed a good time here!  The space inside is beautiful - and people are friendly and fun!A high-class luxury nightclub with a circular dancefloor and stunning waterfall trickling from behind the DJ, located in the Wynn, Vegas. It's very similar to XS, just a smaller version of it.

Last Sunday, rockin' the house by surprise was Flo Rida! We closed up the club with Arenbe Williams back stage. What a night!We got a nice hookup for bottle service on a Friday night mid June. Club opened at 10:30pm and we were escorted to our table
We were on the upper level, not near the dance floor but had plenty of room to dance around the table. This was my second time getting a table at a club so I know how it goes. 
Bouncer was super nice and looked after our stuff, there was no place to put our things so we stuck it in a corner. The waitress' job is to serve our drinks and check on us every 10-15 min. We ended up pouring our own drinks every time, I feel she didn't come by because it was five girls no guys. 

The club itself looked a lot like xs but behind the dj is a huge waterfall and trees so he's technically outside. That was the best part and the music was off the hook!! It was a great mix throughout the entire night. 

Don't know about the waitresses but If you can't get into XS try Tryst...very cool and totally worth it.This ranch style restaurant is beautiful with flowering plants and potted shrubs all around giving one the feeling that you are going over to a very wealthy friends oversized house for a festive occasion. Once inside the atmosphere is very much the same and quite pleasing. You could easily just walk about and look at all the cool decorations sprinkled throughout the restaurant or hanging on the walls. The back patio is where we chose to sit and was very cozy with the sound of a romantic water feature in the background. Nice.

Free chips and both red and green salsas were brought to the table as soon as we were seated. The chips were pleasantly fresh and tasty as well as the salsas. We shared an Adobo Shrimp Cocktail served in a fancy glass with a layer of cocktail sauce on top of a pleasant mixture of greens. I ordered the Seafood Tacos which came with a Shrimp Taco with a delicious Pineapple Salsa and a Grilled Salmon Taco with an Orange Mango Salsa. It also came with a side of your choice. My friend ordered a really large Chicken Salad with Mango and all sorts of other fresh goodies on top. It was so big she took half of it home for later.

Service was both friendly and prompt. If the weather permits choose the outdoor back patio vs the inside main section for the extra ambience or you can visit their smaller Taqueria restaurant next door when in a hurry or wish to get some great takeout. Enjoy!Located inside the Wynn Hotel, lies a Japanese restaurant with great views of the waterfall and a wonderful ambiance.  Decided to give the $49.99 prix fixe a try.  Tried the wagyu carpaccio and the chilean seabass.  The Wagyu carpaccio was wonderful, as was the chilean seabass.  The wagyu melts in your mouth! The sashimi was also very fresh.  Service was very attentive, always refilling cups of water and checking up on us to see if we needed anything.  The bill can run up, especially if ordering alcohol and other small appetizers, but it was worth it.Let me start by saying how much I hate Las Vegas but am forced to attend an annual conference there. In this city of waste, it is hard to get past worrying that by the time you get home, all of the natural resources of the planet will have been used up. 

One of the few bright spots is Babareeba. I was introduced to this fun spot by a friend a few years ago and keep going back. Crazy for their white sangria. The bits of fruit are a delicious touch. The small plates are great and really enough to share. The food is tasty and delivered quickly. My favorite this time around was an empanada with goat cheese and raisins. Fantastic! 

A nice pairing of this cafe is to visit the Guggenheim exhibit across the street inside the Venetian. You can almost forget it is Vegas...What a great restaurant!  The service was great, the atmosphere was nice and the food and drinks were fantastic!  All of the salsas and the cheese dip were amazing and the enchiladas and burritos were great too!  The prices are very reasonable...hard to find anymore in Vegas!I've only hiked Camelback once, but I felt so accomplished (albeit winded, and mere minutes away from passing out).

We started the hike at 6 in the morning, and got to watch the sunrise while we made our way up the trail.  I thought it wasn't going to be a bad hike, but things get tougher about two-thirds up.  Things starting getting vertical at some points, and I wasn't really prepared for that.

It was totally worth it once we got to the top, though - gorgeous, 360 view of the Phoenix metro area (and really, much more than that).  And watching the sunrise with someone special is pretty awesome too.I was here again for their Margarita Brunch...I still have to say - how can this be legal?!?!?

It's great - the buffet itself is actually pretty good...my favorite items were the Chimichangas and Green Chile Pork Stew.  The Huevos Rancheros were also very good.  There are plenty of other options as well as an Omelet Station.

The margaritas here are very good and very strong...be careful!

They have a very friendly staff as well.So I am beginnin to think that there is something better about restaurants in Phoenix.  Yeah, I'm a Scottsdale girl, I admit it, but I  tend to think Scottsdale is a pretty beige place a lot of the time.  Not a lot of character see?  And that is what some restaurants in Phoenix have  - character.  And I think that is one of the things I like about Cibo.  First off, it is in this weird little neighborhood in downtown Phoenix and a little hard to get to if you don't figure out the one way street thing and wind up going down a street the wrong way.  Not too good an idea.  Then there is the fact that ya kinda wonder if your car will be up on blocks when you come out because of the neighborhood.  But Cibo is in a little 1920s bungalow and absolutely charming.  Another great date place!  Shrubs with those little white Xmas lights in them all around the old brick patio, cool old trees outside and the inside is pretty vintage-y too (I made that word up).. I have never eaten inside as the weather has been so darn great everytime I have been there that the patio is where I have wound up.  Anyhoo, on to the food- I think it is great.  I was suggested that I have their white pizza and add red sauce and it was amazing.  Lotsa cheese, gooey, and you could tell that the crust was made there, not prepacked and frozen or something like that. Seriously, that is the only kind I have had there so far and I have been there about 4 x.  Pretty sad...I should try other stuff but once I find something good... 'nuf said.  Their salad with fresh figs was great too.  Add a glass (ok, a bottle) of red wine and you are set.  Oh, and I think that it is the owner who hangs by the door outside and helps with the seating, which btw I think is a great touch.  Whenever an owner cares enough to be there and watch out for the place and assist, I think that is always a good sign.  Obviously the kitchen is doing good without her being back there! :)


Only one thing that I wish they would change/add:  different desserts?  I like Nutella but in everything?  There has gotta be something else you can do?  Buy?  Import? Just a thought....

I just wish that they would move that little house up north so that I can actually enjoy the evening without worrying about the looonggg drive back to Scottsdale..but I guess that is my problem!Everyone loves this spot!  It was packed on a Friday and I understand why.  A family run place with a warm home like ambiance.  Rustico Italiano...  I've tried the salsiccia pizza with a house salad and antipasto salad, shared with friends and it was perfect.  Washed everything down with a lemon cielo which is a great digestion catalyst and gives you a crisp buzz. Great Italian, and I grew up eatin italian.....I just had such a good lunch.... mmmmmm   I had Eggs Benedict, Fez style.  Their version has french bread, ham, poached egg, hollandaise and sun dried tomatoes.  They serve a salad on the side and I substituted their sweet potato fries instead of fried red potatoes that usually come with. It was excellent.   I couldn't have had a better first visit to Fez.

Fez during the day is bright, airy and beautiful.  The bar is comfortable, and the tables looked good too.  I look forward to being there in the evening.... and after the construction is done. For now, while the road is still a construction zone, don't let the black and yellow signs scare you away.  It isn't that hard to access, and the food and atmosphere are worth it.Damn Fez on Central.. It's like, my dream restaurant come true! (Pinch me!) The parking lot has various entrances, plenty of space and is clean. The inside of Fez is remarkable, from cool lighting fixtures to fresh color palettes all around. The food is mouth watering and almost perfect. The menu is a bit on the pricey side I must admit which means I cannot visit this glorious place more often. I gave Fez four stars because 1.) The last time I visited them it took FOREVER (40 minutes) to get our main courses which were SALADS.. are you serious? How long does it take to make a meatless SALAD?! 2.) Our waitress wasn't all that great, my throat was about to croak from a need of a refill after 30 minutes. She was also very unapologetic after we waited so long for our food.  So, once Fez gets a QUICKER staff, it will get my five stars :)Been there a few times. First time was during a pub crawl. We ended up eating a lot from here and killing the buzz :) The food and service are great!This is the place we get take-out from, more than any other.  The reasons are numerous, but some favorites include the broccoli with peanut sauce, pineapple curry, their soups, their fresh spring rolls with either shrimp or tofu, and don't forget to add on the cucumber salad (something like $1.50).  If dining in, the soup is a double treat because of the presentation.  If you like spice, they'll accommodate!  And kids (at least our little kid) always love eating here (or from here).Grilled Salmon, angel hair pasta bolognese entree fantastic. We adored the bruschetta appetizer.  Live music in the upstairs lounge but you can hear it from any seat. We really  loved the atmosphere.Went to Bobby's just recently with a group of people from work, we all had a great time.  We sat at the romantically decorated lounge located upstairs and drank a few drinks while we talked and listened to the pianist.  Everyone ordered food and everyone had great things to say about it.  Food presentation was well, food tasted great, and the service was wonderful.  I am definitely taking another trip back to Bobby's when in Scottsdale.  I highly recommend this place!This is more of an incomplete grade since we only stayed for happy hour. But man, that was a happpppppy hour, let me tell ya.

$1/ea oysters - salty and fresh, tasted like a gooey bite of ocean. Typically, I'm pretty hesitant about raw oysters on the half shell, but given Sea Blue's reputation with fresh seafood, felt like this was a worthwhile risk. I was rewarded justly.

$1/ea shrimp - I was definitely hesitant with this thinking that these would likely be more in the 26-30 count size. maybe 16-20, if we were lucky. Well, its VEGAS BABY! These were some big ole tiger prawn looking bad boys. They were tender and sweet. Worth every penny.

$5 calamari - This was a healthy sized portion, especially for happy hour. Good, but not exceptional. The fried slice of lime was surprising.

I'm sure we would've enjoyed the full meal as well, but without having tried the full gamut of offerings, its truly difficult to give it a 5-star rating.The Nachos is really good!!! And it is so so Big good for 2 people try it out. I go back all the time to get the Nachos it is  the bestStopped by here on a Friday night to catch the tail end of their HH and had a great time!  Their happy hour lasts until 7 PM which is nice for us folks who don't get off work until 6 PM and included some great rolls and appetizers like a crispy spicy tuna and Las Vegas Roll as well as a Sapporo Tall Boy Saki Bomber for $5.  The regular priced specialty rolls were a nice change from the same old same old rolls you see at other sushi joints, I ordered the original tootsie pop which came on sticks and were rolled in thin sliced cucumber.  I would like to see their specialty roll prices be a little more affordable as most of their specialty rolls range from $13-25 but the quality of the food is definitely A+.

Bobby, the manager stopped by our table to introduce himself and check on our evening.  He was very friendly and joked with us for a while which was a nice touch instead of just a generic table flyby of "hey I'm the manager how are we doing."  He even remembered all of our names when he said goodbye to us when we were walking out the door.

My only gripe was our waitress got a little salty when we asked to have separate checks but after explaining they don't offer that service, she would make an exception this time.  

My plea to all sushi restaurants, please Please PLEASE put Escolar (Shiro Maguro) on your menu.  For some reason Valley sushi restaurants over look this fish which makes my heart sad :(I stopped in here with the owner's girlfriend after she cut my hair. She kindly treated me to anything I wanted to eat and drink. wooo hoo! I ordered a Grey Goose and cranberry and a Las Vegas roll (my all time favorite sushi- even if it is fried). Both were delicious. Thank you!!In a world dominated with consoles and online gaming, the arcade and pinball machine have become endangered species. However, here is a place where you can find such rare species herded together. 

For 50 cents to 1.00$ you can play an assortment of pinball machines - from fairly new ones such as iron man and xmen to oldies such as space jam and the terminator. There is a pinball machine for everyone! As a gamer, I would definitely visit this place again on my next visit to Vegas.

Overall: Yes, pressing buttons to control bumpers and finding your rhythm with a falling pinball is considered old school. However, there's something nostalgic about it that mirrors that of indie video games. Furthermore, the proceeds of these machines go to various charities. Gamers should definitely pay ode to the pinball machine hall of fame.everytime we go to vegas we make it a point 2 eat here.  i especially like the tuna here and they even give u 1 time orders of the high end stuff l ike - fatty tune, sweet shrimp and et cetera.  worth checking out if u're in the area... but it gets crowded so be prepared for a long line.All you can eat. WOW!!! I really liked this place. Probably better than the one on Maryland Parkway and Silverado ranch. My favorites: the salmon sushi, ama ebi, fried shrimp heads and pretty much everything. They do not mess around here. You can order as much as you want...as long as you eat it all. Which I always do. You can order half rolls which is great because you can try a lot of different variations. This place has now become one of my favorites.Good sushi but a bit expensive all you can eat is $ 30
BI am in LOVE with the vendor who sells several types of popcorn (red, black, white...I had NO idea you could pop the other colors!)  And they even deliver, so I now I plan to order my popcorn from Wisconsin even though I'm in Chicago.  Hey, it's worth it!

Very nice farmer's market.I just found a dark chocolate peanut bar in my handbag...sweet surprise!  The peanut filling was delicious, more salty than sweet, which was the perfect complement to JP's melt-in-your-mouth dark chocolate.  I have been spoiled, and will never be able to touch a regular old Reese's peanut butter cup again.Double Cappuccino

Stay tuned...This review is based on the nutella brioches alone. I've had some of the other items before but these are really want keep me coming back.

A must whenever I'm in Vegas. I'm addicted to the nutella brioches here! They sell out of the nuttela brioches by 4pm so try to swing by before 2pm. They also open early at 6am so I sometimes just stop by after clubbing all night at Marquee and just get them fresh out of the oven and do my walk of shame back to my hotel room. Hey, at least that walk is slightly less shameful when you have the scent of fresh patries wafting around you.This is my favorite location in the valley!I've been going to Friday's for 35 years. The food is always good as is the service. The menu has changed over the years but it never disappoints. I recommend the whiskey cake for dessert.The Wynn buffet represents what Vegas is today.  Expensive, Time consuming, frustrating, but in the end we all end up going back.  

The wait on the weekends for this place is ridiculous.  Prepare for an hour wait at least.  Being a young stupid guy, I usually starve myself for a couple of days when I know I'm going here.  Waiting in that damn line is borderline torture.  

The actual buffet looks very nice.  Seating is roomy, everything is very well laid out.  The selection is ridiculous.  Typical buffet fa ire with some unique choices.  

After the 2 hour wait and shelling out almost $50 that you can otherwise place on black, the food is pretty good and selection is awesome.  

I usually try to gorge myself on the things i think are the most expensive. I usually end up eating a stupid amount of lychee's, rack of lamb, and lobster.

The best part and little known secret of the Wynn Buffet is the Candy Apples.  they are really really good.  I usually eat like 3 of them..and end up having red teeth for about a day or two.I wouldn't mind coming here every time I visit Vegas.

$34.95 for Easter Sunday brunch with a 30-minute wait.  Worth it, in my opinion.  If only they had crab legs during brunch!

I ate sushi, huevos rancheros, pork buns, enchiladas, quiche, kung pao chicken and the world's best lamb risotto (according to me), all on one plate.  Next, French toast and potatoes au gratin followed by a plate and a half of various sugar bombs.  Delicious AND disgusting all at the same time.

I forced my boyfriend to walk for an hour afterwards.  Strangely, I felt more full an hour later.  Uuuuggghhhh....Great service and foods.  My orange Juice taste so much better  than my last 2 buffet from Harrah and Planet Hollywood casino.  Desserts FTW.  

Nothing much to say but i would come back for Wynn buffet on my next visit.So we got here on a Sunday for dinner. Total price was $37 including tax. 

Pros: Prime Rib!!! It tastes like heaven seriously. The meat melts in your mouth and is so flavorful and tender. 

Fish. Cooked to perfection. Flavorful and flaky and buttery. 

Great dessert bar. Creme brulee, strawberry shortcake, pistachio cake...even a crepe station with a very friendly server. 

Atmosphere and layout is very nice, clean, and gives off that feeling of being a high roller. 

Cons: Maybe it was a sunday night, but the snow crab legs were less than I expected. They had a slight yellow tinge in the meat and didn't taste very fresh. Probably left out during the whole day. Disappointed in that. 

Ceviche. Probably cuz Im not used to it but it didn't taste good. 

So everything was super fresh except for the snow crab legs. The place has less variety than at Bellagio so it only gets a 4. I would come back on a weekday and see what they have to offer.Normally I avoid buffets like a bad plague, but whenever I'm in Vegas, I try to stop here at least once, for one thing... the creme brulee.  I love it here, it's unlimited. It's not overly sweet, yet, has a nice caramelized top hiding a liquid creamy center.  I've eaten 8 in one sitting... in addition to prime rib, roast lamb, cocktail shrimp, easy split king crab legs.... you get the idea.  To mitigate the saltiness of crab legs, I peel a pile of them first and let it soak in lemon juice.  I love how the crab is so easy to peel!

Clarified butter, great salad selection, in clean colorful surroundings.  I'd give this place 5-stars, but it's just a bit too expensive compared to the other buffets around.  

Dessert has a grand selection, though half are bit too sweet for me.  But again, creme brulee is great, and I love the ice cream.  I get the coffee flavor with sliced almonds.  

You get lots of choices.  I'd avoid the Asian stuff... none of it was to my liking at all.  

My friends also enjoy coming here, but it might be wasted on a girl with a small appetite.Came here for the breakfast buffet and since it's still the holidays, we ended up with the holiday brunch buffet. It was $35.95 and for that price, we were able to get the best of both worlds: breakfast and lunch. Oh wait, and a third world: DESSERTS. 

Breakfast: skip the eggs benedict, hit up the omelet station and the pork sausages. YUM.

Lunch: wasn't the biggest fan of any of their fish entrees or their sushi, the pastas were all right, ALL the potatoes (mashed, sweet potato + marshmallows, and roasted) were amazeballs, the prime rib and the bacon were very flavorful and didn't even need any extra sauces 

Dessert: die for the rocky road, pecan pie, and the key lime pie mousse, cheesecake was allright, bread pudding was not too shabsters, and I wasn't the biggest fan of the ice cream (but maybe you'll have better luck)... there's also a ton of pastries that I skipped out on but you'll find anything from croissants to danishes. 

We got here around 9:30 am so we didn't really have a wait but about an hour after we got there, there was a huge line. I'd definitely keep that in mind when planning out your time.

I'm not sure if you can expect the same (or a similar) spread during their regular breakfast buffets but based on my experience, I think the lunch may be more worth your money. I think I'll definitely be back -- but maybe for lunch or dinner the next time around!Great! Just like every other restaurant in the Wynn. Tons of selections and the best crab legs I have ever had in my life. The only reason I stopped piling them on my plate is because people started to look at me funny. Obviously, you serve yourself and the wait staff brings you drinks. It can get pretty loud in here as this is where families to tend to hang out during meal time. Lots of seating. it can be easy to get lost. Look for landmarks : )Good food, but I was a little disappointed at the spread.  I was really excited to come here because some people had told me that this buffet was better than the Wicked Spoon, which is my current favorite, but the Wicked Spoon is still my personal fav.  

With that being said, however, everything I had here was good.  It's a bit pricy, at $40 a plate for dinner, but I feel like I got my money's worth.  Had a couple servings of medium rare prime rib, some pasta (their papardelle pasta was really good, especially with some meatballs thrown in), and a whole bunch of other stuff I can't remember off of the top of my head.  

Overall, the food quality here was pretty darn good for a buffet, but I guess I was just expecting more after all of the hype.

Because of timing issues, I had to come in clubbing attire, which was SUPER awkward, and there were some creepy employees working behind the counters, so fyi - don't come here decked out in clubwear!  But that's probably common sense for most folk...Went here with a bunch of my co-workers on a random trip to Vegas. We figured going to an AYCE buffet instead of a regular sit-down would be easier to go to with a large group. I've always wanted to try the Buffet here at the Wynn from word of mouth. For a Saturday night (7pm), we were seated fairly quickly. 

There are many different types of food here, from crab legs to prime rib. Their meats are great. They didn't have much of a sushi selection though and no sashimi. The other items I tried were good too. Dessert is great too, but I only a few samples because I was already too full. 

However, even though it was good, I didn't feel it was the best buffet I've been to in Vegas. I've gone to a few that are just as good, but are cheaper as well. I'm glad I got to try it, but I probably won't make it back here in favor of the other Vegas AYCE buffets.Went today with friend for the Brunch Buffet, the food was real good very fresh and service was good too.  My only item was the the lady taking the payment at the check counter was grumpy and had the wrost attitude.  It wasn't busy it was rather slow and there was no one in line and she barked at us and was down right rude!  We will go back for the food, beward of the mean lady in her sixy's with the glass, she will chew your head off, make sure you have correct change or you have you stations card out and ready because she will chew your head off!Line is long, but the food is good and the service is great. There is an overwhelming amount of food options, so you won't leave hungry. The small center dining area is very beautiful, so try to get in there. The best area was the dessert section of course ;)Very upscale cigar bar.  Great sprits but it comes with a price but all good things do.I'm a little surprised to see that Red 8 only gets 3 stars I ate their last night and really enjoyed it. The quality of food and service was just fine. I had the Mongolian chicken and Andy had Sweet and Sour Chicken both were large portions and very good. we shared Dim Sum Pork and Shrimp that was really well made. it was a little expensive but what isn't in Vegas.Definitely overpriced, but what isn't at the Wynn? The food itself is good, the dim sum especially. What I like about Red 8 is you can expect each dish to be made with quality ingredients and prepared in a "Grade A" environment. I've been to dim sum places around town that make my tummy cringe in fear; however, at Red 8, these fears are gone. 

Wondering why the restaurant is named Red 8? Well, once you go there, you'll know why. From the red walls to the red place mats to the red roses, there's a lot of red going on. I'm sure there's a lot of Feng shui going on as well, as Steve Wynn opened Red 8 to cater specifically to the Asian clientele visiting the casino (I think I learned that from a Wynn video that plays on repeat on the room TVs). 

Our server was friendly and helpful in choosing the best dim sum to order:
Shrimp Har Gow- 4 pieces
Pork Dumplings- 3 pieces, The dumplings were bursting with flavor and juice
Steamed BBQ Pork Buns- Soft, pillowy buns filled with sweet BBQ pork

We also ordered two Red 8 Signature Dishes:
Combination Fried Rice- Shrimp, chicken, beef. 
A Pan-Fried Noodle Dish- Wide rice noodles and tender pieces of beef pan-fried in soya sauce

I enjoyed all the dim sum, especially when dipped in the vinegar and mustard. However, for the main dishes, I preferred the noodles over the fried rice. In conclusion, the food was good and the service was nice. If price wasn't a factor, I would go back again to try their other dim sum choices.We chose Michael Mina as our fourth Restaurant Week 2010 meal. We had a 7 o'clock reservation. We were seated in the farthest corner of the restaurant, there is a small room next to the main dining room, we were in there. It was peaceful, you'd never guess you were a couple hundred feet from the craziness in the Conservatory.

We were started with an amuse-bouche of watermelon topped with red onion, feta and balsamic vinegar. It was clean and refreshing.

Then, we were offered breads: Italian and sourdough, both were warm and fresh. I preferred the Italian. After noshing on breads, we were brought our appetizers. My husband had bibb lettuce salad with Maytag Blue Cheese, Summer Corn, Bacon, Red Wine Vinaigrette. It was fresh and delicious, the vinaigrette was fantastic. I had the Heirloom Tomatoes Gazpacho with Spiced Crab Salad, Avocado, Summer Herbs. It was like biting into a fresh tomato only I was slurping it off a spoon. Yum. The crab salad was excellent, too.

When it came to the entree I was torn, I planned to order the halibut which sounded fantastic, but the Lobster Pot Pie that Michael Mina is famous for was included on the Restaurant Week menu for a $30 supplement. Regular price for this dish is $78, this meant I'd get it plus a starter and dessert for $80.10. It sounds like a no brainer, but I've never been a fan of lobster. I tend to find the chewy texture off-putting, but on the other hand there was no better place for me to try it. My husband left it to the fate of eenie meenie miney mo and the winner was the lobster pot pie. I did not regret it. It was superb. I prefer the lobster claw to the rest of it, but overall it was very tasty. The brandied cream sauce was lush and velvety. It's really a beautifully composed dish, I'm happy I experienced it. 

My husband ordered a filet that was splendidly prepared it was one of the tastiest I've had in quite sometime, it was served with a short rib cottage pie, like shepards pie, with short rib, carmelized onions and whipped mashed potatoes. It was warm and comforting, not too mention delicious.

By some miracle we still had room for dessert. He had Michael's Root Beer Float with Sassafras Ice Cream, Root Beer Sorbet, and Warm Chocolate Chip Pecan Cookies. The float was pretty good, but the cookies, oh! the sweet heavenly cookies were the star. They would've been perfect served with a glass of cold milk for dipping. I had the Summer Blackberries over Caramelized Brioche and Cinnamon Toast Ice Cream. Eh, it wasn't very special. Neither the brioche or ice cream were a success. Thankfully, I have a dear husband who kindly shared his heavenly cookies.

After dinner, the manager came by to check on us. We chatted a bit, mainly gushing how much we love Michael Mina's restaurants. He returned and poured us each a glass of a nice dessert wine. I don't recall what it was, but it was not cloyingly sweet like most dessert wines. We both really enjoyed it. Then, finally to end the meal our server delivered a plate of small treats with the check. The coconut macaroons and shortbread cookies were simply wonderful, as was the entire meal. The food, the service, it was all excellent. After three no-so=great meals, Michael Mina saved Restaurant Week.Ate here on two different trips and had different experiences.  The first time, we were not so wowed. Perhaps we ordered the wrong thing, went too early, etc.
We like Boulud; after seeing him so much on After Hours, and being whores for Michelin stars, we tried again.  Glad we did. Much better.

Ordered the seafood tower. 2nd best oysters-after Providence in L.A. Really good. Great lamb special and veal. Service was excellent and a pretty big wine list.

On our second night in the hotel, after a pre-dinner snack at Carne Vino, stopped by for a dozen oysters and champagne. Sat in the bar-cute and cozy. Still great service and still great oysters. 

Glad we gave it a second try!This was a great show, kids will love it.This place was amazing for breakfast...sitting outside near the pool  was cool also they have a nice inside area. Looking forward to visiting again if I stay at the Encore again.Their Darkness cocktail is to die for! And even at $12, I think it's totally worth it. It is, hands down, the best tasting cocktail I've ever had. 

This is great place to sit down and spend a couple hours between whatever it is you do in Vegas. Their tables have the cool surfaces that let you watch Youtube videos all night, play pinball, spy  and chat with other tables (bet the shy guys are all over that,) and among other things you can mix and order cocktails from the interactive surface. 

Most bars in Vegas only offer video poker and TV, so this place is def top notch.In Bellagion, near shops, downstairs next to Picasso. 
-Men need to wear jackets as indicated but they won't say anything if you don't. 
-Nice views of the Fountains, steaks were cooked very well as they cut up pieces as serve you. Sides were also good. Had to skip dessert cause the meal was a good size and was going to Mystere and Tao afterwards. 
-Lady comes by to take very good pics but its at a very good price for her
-Met Carolos Santana 
-Overall good experienceI love the ambiance here, and sometimes if you want the Vegas Strip, but not the feeling of chaos, this is the place to be. Lunch on the patio is fantastic, and is quite a unique people watching scene. I love their salads, wine menu and chicken marsala.  Usually, the service is great and the kitchen is consistent.

Be careful of the following:Their salads are spot on, but their house dressing  is on the sweeter side.  I personally prefer the italian which is homemade but not nearly as sweet.  Also, if you are not a fan of shaved chicken breast, then you should avoid adding chicken to your salads. It is not your usual chunky  breast. 

This establishment is way better than your typical Italian chain, and has incredible  family portions. Salute' to Maggiano's-you keep me coming back for more.Very good food. Nothing mind blowing, but a solid Italian meal. Kind of similar in quality to Bucca di Beppo.

We would go back.Very very good food, only tried a couple dishes butt they were outstanding and very fresh. The pasta seems to be made from scratch which is always a plus and the sauces are not overwhelming. Very goodeven the pickiest eaters will find something yum to appease their hunger at this never ending buffet.  anything and everything from Chinese, Japanese, Mexican, Italian, and Jamaican to country cooking and good ol fashion *American* favorites span at least a half block.

i was surprised the desserts were limited, but i'm assuming the dinner selection is more expansive (we came straight from airport for lunch).  don't pass up the gelato, especially vanilla bean and cookies n cream- mmm pure decadence for a buffet off the strip.One of the better LV buffets I've eaten at for a few reasons: 1) great service during champagne brunch -- unlimited mimosas! 2) reasonable price seeing as how many buffets can be upward of $40 per person. I would go here again.I have been here a few times, usually for lunch. I always get the cheeseburger and fries. At first, i couldn't imagine paying $12 for a hamburger, but once i tried it, i discovered it was well worth it. This is one of the best burgers in town and thats why I get it everytime. The woodfired grill gives the lean meat great flavor, and the handcut fries are fresh and delicious. Try them in ranch dressing. This place is real trendy and always crowded. Sit on the patio, it is a great atmosphere. I had the pumkin pie and it was amazing, even though it was $8, but the slice was huge. Well worth it. For an upscale dinning experience go here and enjoy the fresh, natural food and professional service.Chelsea's is a welcome addition to Central Phoenix. They serve delicious takes of Comfort Food. I had been there several times and always wondered why anyone would pay so much for the tacos. Everything else seemed fair though their portions are small for most things. I didn't get that it was more like fajitas. I had the Lobster Tacos that were the nightly special (around $35.) Let me tell you it was worth it. The Lobster meat was huge chunks and very fresh. They make their tortillas in house. I have honestly liked everything I have ever had here. The only negative is the Valet Parking, otherwise it would be 5 stars. I personally can't stand Valet and especially where there is plenty of room. This place is a regular for me.First of all, moderators, can you correct the name of the restaurant? It's really Tamba Indian Cuisine/Lounge. I see that the right URL is provided, so let's make it easier for other people to find this Indian gem.

Since this was my first time out as a Las Vegas resident, I was extremely pleased to discover that Las Vegas does indeed have stellar Indian cuisine. I read the first review carefully and already knew it was considered excellent by Indian natives.

But when I arrived and saw that virtually everyone in the restaurant was Indian, I knew it was going to be superb and it was. My perennial favorite, Lamb Vindaloo, was as spicy as it should be. The lamb was tender, although I've tasted superior lamb, namely in Paris.

As a starter I ordered Onion Kulcha. The waiter brought out the nan accompanied by a plate of tomatoes, onions, jalapenos and pickled vegetables. I knew then and there that I would be in for a treat.

The rice was excellent although I prefer mine laced with peas and authentic cardamom seeds, but for most food lovers this is probably adventurous enough. ;)

In all, a great find in Las Vegas. Don't let the Hawaiian Marketplace surroundings fool you, this is truly outstanding Indian food and Las Vegas deserves it.Well Sauce hits the "spot" for me. I was amazed how quick the service is and how fast we get our pizza (well their  pizza does follow the laws of physics, THIN PIES COOK QUICK!). So if your're looking for deep dish....this is not spot. But if you like it thin, it's great. I tend to order the same item time and time again and it's the sausage with carmelized onions. Sandra K likes their salads, so it's a pizza and salad and we share. She likes a glass of red wine with her dinner. We share the pizza and salad (she won't let me drink her wine though) and I gotta tell you, it's plenty of food and I feel like I got real value for my money. Kudo's to Sauce!

This guy, Sam Fox, has a magic touch with most of his restaurantsl He is truly gifted by bringing his concepts to the greater Phoenix area.went here for dinner Saturday night - was the least crowded I've ever seen it and got right in for a late bite. Delicious trout. That's right - trout. It was yummy and healthy.the food was really tasty, good service, got seated right away. The fries are really good.Le Reve, means "The Dream" in french.  It's everything you would expect from Steve Wynn.

Remember he's brought us such titillating delights such as "O" at the Bellagio (still my fave cirque show) the pyrotechnic spectacular at TI and the Mirage and now he brings us his latest water show in Le Reve.

The show itself is a montage of imperfect dreams after a girl has a strife with her lover, the dreams in a sense bring her back to her love (wayne).

One of the most powerful scenes in "Le Reve" evokes a cold, winter night. As snow falls, Wayne searches a city park for a friendly face, only to find nightmarish figures at every turn. Another scene celebrates the strength of the human body, as men begin climbing an enormous tree, swinging from branch to branch and launching themselves high into the air before falling back into the water.

The theater itself lends itself to the intimacy of the show.  It is shown in "theater in the round" and unless you are sitting in the "splash zone" there really isn't a bad seat in the house.

Tickets range from $99 for splash zone tickets to $149 for regular seats and if you want to be a true baller, you can go for the $179 VIP experience with larger seats (in increments of 2 only) a split of champagne and chocolate covered strawberries.

The show is dark on Tuesdays and Wednesdays and it's like I said, a must see.This show was amazingly entertaining. We had great seats that were about $90/each (not expensive for a Vegas show.) I don't think there's a bad seat in the house UNLESS you're right up close. Although this show has a very basic storyline about love/heartbreak you're still entertained by the acrobatics/dancing/music and lights! The Wynn theater/hotel is beautiful too. If you're staying here it would be a shame to miss this show.Been there a couple of times when we've been down to visit. Great food and we love the patio. Dos is good too and last time we were there they still had their amazing appetizer platter, which the original does not have. Atmostphere at Dos is not as nice though.Cafe Zuzu is comfort food at it's best... 
french fries + banana spilt = satisfaction!We went for the happy hour and were NOT disappointed. The appetizers were delicious and cheap (highly recommend the grilled cheese appetizers... brie, fig jam and apples? Yes, please) and the drinks were more booze than filler, a great deal for $3 a pop. I left with a wonderful buzz and a full stomach for a mere $18, which is unheard of. The service was friendly and the atmosphere was laid back but fun.I stayed the harrah's room and i decide to try their brunch buffet.
The place is not so big but all food looks yammy.
They have toast, coffee, packed milk, smoked salmon, desserts and  very good deal too. If u want to get best quality food in Vegas hotel, dont stay. There are many buffet nearby, if you are ready to spend money for brunch.Unfortunately as mentioned, there was a huge line up to get in here for breakfast but it is definitely worth the wait.  They do provide a $10pp VIP line-bypass as well which we opted for since we were wanting to go about our day rather than wait an hour in line. 

Overall the buffet was excellent with plenty of selection.  Most noteable would definitely by the brandy-apple crepe that I split with my wife.  They had an almost overwhelming selection of breakfast meats, including about 5-6 different types of sausage alone, with the andouille being my favourite.  

Overall, a great meal for a reasonable price.  The service unfortunately is atrocious, which I wouldn't have expected, especially with "VIP" entrance.  We waited for 15 minutes before we actually had to walk up to a waitress to order our beverages.The food is so good here! I love French food, and fresh food! That is hard to find at a Buffet. Everything was so good, to bad my stomache was not as big as my eyes, I wanted more but I wa so full! I am very picky when it comes to food,  I am from Europe and hard to please!pluses:
easy access when driving in to town, don't have to fight traffic on the strip
easy access to monorail - prefer the monorail over the Deuce

no free wifi? 
small poolWe had NO expectation with their food when we walked in here. We were just tired, hungry, and wanted some Asian food to fill us up. We thought their food cannot be compared with the authentic Asian food in NYC. 

However, it was SO YUMMY! 

First thing that impressed us was their beef noodles soup. Beef was tender, soup was tasty, not too salty. 

We ended up almost going there every day during our stay in Vegas. And we figured the best dish was still beef noodles soup after trying other dishes. 


Must order: Beef Noodles Soup with a little spice!We really enjoyed this meal. I started out with a salad and the main course was the linguini with prawns.  The pasta is homemade and you can taste the difference.  My wife had a ravioli dish that she loved.  It was a success.Did you say you wanted rich, creamy and flavorful?  Well here's a little extra dose!

Fiamma is one of those restaurants that I am not really quite sure how I feel about since I left so incredibly stuffed that I thought I would die, but I ate so many wonderful foods that it was almost worth the pain.  The risotto was amazing (if you read my reviews you know by now that I HEART risotto) and the cucumber martini (another fave) was delicious.  

I was not incredibly impressed with the veal ravioli, but the gnocchi was pretty damn impressive.  Everything here is smothered in some type of butter or creamy Italian sauce, which my colleagues loved.  I am a bit biased as I don't go for those foods too often.  If you like creamy and you like savory, this place is for you. 

Why the four stars?  I am biased because my favorite Italian restaurant is in New York...this one did not live up to it but I am not sure which others can!We parked ourselves here at 5am after losing all our cash at the tables. Luckily, they accepted credit card. 

I also had the vanilla bean french toast with bacon and poached eggs. I don't remember it being especially delicious, but it had to have been pretty decent because I actually finished ALL of my meal, which is a feat in itself. 

All in all, this is a nice place to recover and chill out a bit. I really do enjoy the faux-outdoor setting. Of course the price wasn't all that great, but for a 24-hour eatery on the strip we can't complain.This library is amazing.  Even if you don't read, its worth coming in and checking out just for its amazing architecture and views.  I mean, how many libraries do you know with a waterfall/pool inside? It is very tranquil if you are looking for somewhere to get away from it all and just enjoy your book.  (Or do your homework).  Location is excellent, being that it's right on the light-rail as well.  I don't know how anyone cannot enjoy a library.

All that being said, I do have one criticism.  The people at the help desks are not the most friendly or helpful.  On more than one occasion I have asked for help, and received a  really sub-par answer, or felt like I'm being sneered at.  So as long are you not planning on talking to the help desk, you are in for quite a treat.We were in search of breakfast and saw that this place had a $4.99 egg special. Unfortunately it was 10am and the deal doesn't start until the night time. We still decided to eat here since we were hungryyyy.

We ordered the skillet with ham. ham grilled cheese, and an egg combo breakfast. I didn't want green peppers in my skillet, but the waitress said it comes as is. Uhh weird? I've always been able to remove something from a skillet if I didn't want it. The food arrived within about 10 minutes. I really liked my skillet. The potatoes were so soft and tasty. My friend raved about her grilled cheese. The portion size was big for me. I had to take the rest to go.

One problem I had was with the service. When we sat down my friend ordered coffee. No coffee came. When we ordered the food she ordered coffee again. When we got the food still no coffee. She told her one last time and finally got her coffee. After we finished eating we waited for a good 10 minutes until our waitress came by. 

The food was good, but the service was pretty slow.Service was exquisite and the food was amazing. Had the steak at scallops and they were all amazing.I found this restaurant while I was waiting for Cirque de Soleil show to start.  This place opened at 17:00.

As a starter, they serve free bacon and cheese warm bread which was delicious. I had pepper seared salmon and I loved every bite of it-it was delicious. 

Staff is friendly and overall I had good experience, but I think that their menu is little overpriced.Exceptional restaurant by Top Chef Hubert Keller. Took my bf here for his birthday a couple of weeks ago. The food and service was superb. 
 
What we ordered: 
Three out of the four of us ordered the three course elegance prix fixed menu which included 4 courses. My bf ordered ala carte. 
 
BREAD BASKET: Good selection of bread. My faves were the focaccia and the pretzel bread. 

SALAD:  Fresh and tasted great. 

TRUFFLE ONION SOUP-Braised Duck Crêpe, Red Wine Shallot Purée, Black Truffle. This was definitely very good...tasted very decadent and hearty. 

AHI TUNA TARTARE:  The ahi tuna tasted fresh and the ginger ponzu sauce added a little kick to the dish.

CHORIZO WRAPPED SUZUKI SEA BASS:  This was a superb dish. Sea bass was cooked very well, melted in your mouth.

BRAISED VEAL AND YUKON GOLD POTATO RAVIOLI: The last time I had veal, I didn't really like it. But this time it was actually pretty good. 

STOUT BRAISED BEEF SHORT RIBS: Soft and tender. Very good but I must say my bf and two other friends ordered the prime filet and that was definitely the better of the two dishes. 

PRIME FILET MIGNON TOPPED WITH SAUTÉED FOIE GRAS: This was definitely the best dish of the night. The meat just melted in your mouth and the foie gras was superb!!! The dish also had truffle in it which was an added bonus. 

Dessert Trio of Peanut Butter Milkshake + Chocolate Fondant Cake + Canal of Bailey's ice-cream with crushed peanut butter brittle: My friend wasn't too impressed with this dish..tried a little bit and thought it was ok,nothing spectacular. 

Chocolate souffle: This was actually really good. Decadent and was perfect with the ice cream.

Carrot cake with a pineapple sorbet: Carrot cake was moist and the sorbet was not too tart. 

Since it was my bf's bday they brought out a dessert dish that had happy birthday on it with a candle..yay happy birthday bf!!! They also gave us 4 small dishes of appetizers; complimentary of the chef  and was pretty good. Unfortunately I forgot what its called though. 

Dog Point Pinot Noir: This was a very good Pinot from New Zealand. Soft bodied and a little more fruity in taste. 

Overall the experience was great. Deducted a point just for the affordability factor. We got $50 deducted from our bill because we used a certificate I got from restaurant.com. Total for 4 people 650 including tip and the $50 deduction. Definitely not cheap and will take a chunk out of your wallet but I have to say it was well worth a try. Also, plan on staying for a least two hours for dinner. Our reservation was at 7pm and we didn't leave till 9PM, that's with us rushing our server a bit because we had a show to attend at 930. So word of advice, plan accordingly if you have something planned after dinner.Came here tonight with a few co-workers and I must say that every dish that came out was amazing. They brought out this BBQ octopus and I have never ate octopus before it taste like chicken. The flat bread was good, the chicken was amazing. The service was amazing. Thank you Fleur for the amazing food.Yelp 365 Challenge: 45/365 

The city of sin has come a long way from the days of $0.99 hotdogs and cheapo buffets. There was a time when chefs scoffed at opening a restaurant in Vegas. Disgusted by the unsophisticated palates of the hordes of visitors ingrained with the American mentality of quantity over quality. 

However, today there is a new dawn in the culinary revolution of the 9th island of Hawaii. Every brand name chef has an outpost of their culinary empire proudly found along the neon lit "Strip" of Las Vegas. Names like Flay, Emeril, Batali, Colicchio, Bartolotta, and even Robuchon are now staples on the dining scene. 

This new reality works perfectly into my Vegas agenda. Win money, eat good food, and drank (not necessarily in that order!). As luck would have it, I had the pleasure of dining at L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon during my last trip to Vegas. L'Atelier is the modern and chic outpost of Robuchon, found just next door to the "full service" Robuchon in the MGM Grand. Let me tell you, this was a dining experience I will never forget. 

The evening started out as every other evening did... Pre-gaming in our room at the Palazzo. Grey Goose on the rocks with lime. Getting fresh and looking good. My partner in crime for the evening was a good friend from way back in the day. Funny thing is, she doesn't gamble, drink, or have a taste for fine dining... I know, I know, wtf was I doing in Vegas with her?!? We were on our way to see KA and I really wanted to check out L'Atelier. So it was my treat, grand degustation all the way. 

You know it's going to be a special evening from the moment you walk in. The vibe of the restaurant is chic, sexy, and edgy. The color scheme is black, red, accented with hints of chrome. This is dining with an extremely sexy lounge vibe combined with the pedigree of Joel Robuchon. Seating at L'Atelier is predominantly counter style mixed with a few tables surrounding the bar. You want to sit at the bar, trust me. The orchestrated dinner show is a sight worth seeing. The legions of kitchen staff all work with such incredible precision and timing. It's a sure sign of the awesome evening to follow. 

Our server delivers a basket of freshly made in house bread and confirms our dining and beverage selection for the evening. Grand Degustation and a half bottle of Cake Bread Chardonnay. The bottle arrives and the food starts cranking... 

I've attached a few pictures of the menu we enjoyed and I'll describe the dishes that really stood out - good & bad. For the most part, everything was good to incredible. But there's only so much room for the review.. 

The amuse bouche is a foie gras parfait with port wine and parmesan foam. The presentation is simple and the taste is incredible. The interplay between sweet & salty provided by the foam is a great addition to the rich foie gras. 

The white onion tart with smoked bacon and asparagus hit the spot for bold flavor mixed with french buttery & fatty goodness. 

The egg cocotte topped with light mushroom cream was one of the best dishes of the evening. It was the perfect example of the french understanding of umami. Lucious egg with mushroom cream. 

The foie stuffed quail with truffled mash was surprisingly good, but not slap yo mama good as I thought it'd be. The flavor profile of the foie slightly masked the natural flavor of the quail. The truffled mash however was to die for. 

The mojito was a bit tough to eat. The white rum granite was extremely strong and the taste of alcohol over powered the other flavors. 

Overall, an astonishing evening. A great opportunity to enjoy the works of one the highest rated french chefs in America. Even my friend said she enjoyed herself more than she thought she would. If you don't have the time or money to enjoy the "full service" Robuchon, L'Atelier is the perfect venue for you.Outstanding. I'm reading some other reviews and scratching my head... I guess any place can have an off night but I can't imagine how you get Il Mulino to one star. A decidedly different experience than the typical LV restaurant in that it's quiet and refined. The service was impeccable and friendly; not condescending in any way shape or form. The food was outstanding in every way, from the appetizers they put on the table before you even look at the menu to the main course and awesome desert. If you think Olive Garden or Carraba's is Italian, don't waste your money here. If you want first rate house made food with awesome service, Il Mulino is for you.I come here quite often since it's close to work and not too expensive.

I love this place for a couple or reasons.  Consistency and a decent cheese steak.  I'm born and raised in AZ so I don't know what a "true" Philly cheese steak tastes like so for me this place is pretty darn good.  The bread is always nice and soft and the steak is great with the whiz and onions.  Their fries are always perfectly crispy and soft on the inside every time.  

They have pizza as well but I don't ever seem to be in a pizza mood when I go here so I've yet to try it.  I'm deducing a star on this because the chairs and tables are in some serious need of replacing and there is a lot of dust on the walls and upper ledges above the booth seating.  I've seen enough episodes of cooking shows to know this isn't acceptable.  

Great food though and I will continue to come back!A friend invited me over for dinner at this place with his family and friends.  I am glad I took his invitation.  The waiting and serving staff were excellent, they were very helpful.  I ordered a large bowl of jambalaya, it was mouth watering and delicious. Bread rolls were made fresh, peach tea is excellent.  Recommend this place to anyone.  I rate this place a four star because I didn't try there ribs.The Yard House -- what happened to your yarders man!  You used to be cool, but now you submit to the man!  Darn you!  Anyways, Yard House has always been my favorite spot to try new beer.  I really do miss the yarders.  Now they have the footers (yah....)  It'll still get you whacked up for sure.  I like this Yard House for one thing - the nice rides parked in front.  Feel like a kid every time I walk by (Oh that's my car!)  Reverse Happy Hour at this place used to be the place to be, but with Kona Grill stealing all the attraction it's hard to compete.  However, if there's a game on; forget about it! :)  Appetizers here are the best order a few and share with your friends - (spicy wings are really spicy - youch!)  If you don't have friends to share with -- well that's why I miss the yarders :) - enjoy!Decided to try this place with a girlfriend and have some dinner and drinks. I've heard a lot about the place and I work really close to it, although I didn't know exactly where it was. 
It is really confusing getting there when looking at GPS. You kind of already have to know where this place is to go there. Whichever, we found it. 
I had the spicy chicken breast sandwich. It was really good. My french fries were cold when they came out. A bit disappointing for how pricey a sandwich is. I told my server and he ran straight back and got me some hot fries. My girlfriend had the chicken tortilla soup. I tried a bite. Oh, the flavors in this were amazing. So good. She also had an asada street taco. Smallest taco with the biggest price! It was too spicy for her until she took the peppers off. But otherwise, she thought it was pretty tasty. 
The beer, oh the beer. I love beer. The beer menu and the beers on tap is the amazing part of this place. Over 130 beers on tap! Love it. I was feeling fruity so I tried a Four Peaks Arizona Peach and a Sea Dog Bluepaw Wild Bluberry. Both were very good. My girlfriend got a House Honey Blonde and a House Belgian Amber Tripel. Both of those were delicious as well. That is the best part of this place. 
They did have sports going on, but I'm not into basketball, so that didn't do it for me at the moment. Maybe if it was some hockey going, I would have been into staying longer. 
The service was excellent. Our server was always there asking if we needed anything else. Totally on top of it. 
Too highly priced. A sandwich and 2 beers for over $30 with tip is too rich for my blood. I'm sure I will visit again. It was a pleasant experience. Great beers, good food and great service, just way too expensive.One of my favorite places to go for reverse happy hour! They have good food (ahi poke, wings, sliders) for a great price and a LOT of beer on tap.I love this mongolian bbq...its my favorite one in arizona.  I have tried others and they never have the good variety of veggies, proteins or sauces like this place has...I do the combination everytime...I have tried other sauce combos and I always go back to my original way...I love to add the chili oil because I love spice...then I get some of the wontons.and dip them in siracha and hot mustard...yum yum yum...dont forget to use the wheat noodles they are the best!!! Always put extra sauce because your meal will come out dry if you dont.  They have rice and soup too, but I never get it because you get so much food! You get to have frozen yogurt after and its perfect because you get a little sweet at the end.  I love it...i just wish it were closer to my house but I will make the drive...Since we were 6 girls and staying at the Bellagio, we got in free on a Fri night. The outside area was the usual club scene, not real uniform line, just a bunch of people looking like they are outside Studio 54 trying to get picked. You just have to keep your eyes and ears open. After waiting 5 mins, this lady came up and told us to wait over there and within 5 mins, we had our hand stamped and were in the club. You take one of 2 escalators going up and there are pretty lit up chandeliers, as if you are going on a cool version of the haunted mansion tour in an adult Disneyworld. Then you walk through a warmly colored lit room that is wall to wall stacked with Cristal bottles, ballas! Then you enter the main room with VIP areas all along the outskirts and descend some stairs to the main dancefloor where more VIP tables await. While getting your groove on, there are 2 balconies where OneRepublic was setting up I guess and the DJ is in the center above you, getting a feel for the crowd. 

It's a fairly new club and we had a ball! We danced for 3 hours straight. We aren't heavy drinkers so we didn't get a VIP booth. We just stayed on the crowded dancefloor and danced with well behaved men. It was great! No seedy guys here. At times, I think dry ice snowflakes would snow down onto the dance floor which was cool cause it helped cool the temp down as well as for the dancers. Then, last Fri night, OneRepublic showed up and performed their hit song as well as a new song for the group and that was awesome!!! They just showed up and played. Everyone was so amped on the dancefloor. They played the normal mashup music which hits all types of music genres. I had a great time there! So walk around the Bellagio come sun down and bouncers and other people employed by The Bank are handing out there black business cards that get you in for free. And if you are a girl, evern better and easier to get in!I'm sorry, but anyone that complains about not being able to get a seat at a nightclub on a friday/saturday is delusional. 

If you're going to one of the great sit down, casual bars like maybe Commonwealth in Fullerton, or Basement in LB. Then yeah, not being able to find a seat may be an issue.

But if you're in the Heartbeat of Las Vegas, or Downtown Los Angeles, Gaslamp San Diego, State Street Santa Barbara, Coronado San Fransisco, The Levy Cincinatti, Manhattan New York...(are you getting my point?) or any other metropolitan big city, you will NOT find readily available lounges. 

High end clubs must be gauged by specific standards. Quality of service, crowd, music, layout, amenities, ambiance. The Bank should be considered a prestige club. That if you do not A) have the money to burn [whether you're rich, or like the rest of us, you just saved up enough money to treat yourself to a great night in Vegas] B) Are super pretty with a bunch of super pretty friends or C) have any combination of A and B, then you will not have fun here. You don't HAVE TO BE RICH, but I think it's important to understand that a club like this requires preparation and an understanding of the pretense which surrounds such an establishment. Am I over-the-top-wealthy, hot shit? no, but Do I know how to prepare myself for a great night in Vegas? YES.

Generally the Bank attracts great crowds, has great hosts and bartenders, high quality and attractive staff, GREAT Hip-Hop/Top 40 DJs (i will admit, for electronica heads this is NOT your place), and has an overall care for quality. I love the Bank. I've gotten bottle service here and thought the experience was top notch. I've been here and NOT gotten bottle service and still had an amazing time. 

But in the big clubs, the prestige clubs, the name of the game is pretense. it's unavoidable and must be understood, prepared for, and manipulated before you go. Play the game, and you'll have a great time.
Be caught unaware and this place will eat you up, spit you out, and charge you 40 bucks in the process.12 guys and a table of straight up man food.

Not saying that women would not enjoy their time and the food here as well.  I'm just saying that if you're a dude, and you enjoy typical dude food with hot hostesses/bar wenches, this place will rock your world.

The aforementioned hot hostess spotted our bachelor party from a mile away and the customer service began.  She sexily seduced (okay, she goaded us) into taking jager shots with her.  She had one of my boys wrapped around her little finger just by saying he's the cutest one out of us (he's so not).  Because of that, he went back to the bar and bought drinks from her TWICE throughout out meal.  Chumps you say?  Maybe.  But it was FUN.

I must admit that I had VERY low expectations from this place.  I mean, it's not celebrity chef endorsed, never seen it on any Food Channel or Travel Channel shows, never even HEARD of this place until we decided to eat here.  Stack blew my expectations out of the water!

Food:  30oz steak advertised in front for $60 for 2 people.  Some of us got that.  Some of us (ok, me) got the 24oz cowboy steak which was just a smaller version of the special.  The steak was cooked perfectly.  The two types of sauces (peppercorn and red wine) was insanely flavorful.  Adult tater tots were good.  But the highlight for me was the kobe chili that came with the chili cheese fries.  I think I must have had half of that by myself.  One guy got the sea bass and risotto dish and loved it.  Everyone else got meat and enjoyed it.

Service during dinner was prompt and polite.  Everything came together (as it should) and piping hot.  And since they are owned by the same people, our waiter brought us line passes and VIP entry cards to Jet, the club at Mirage.  

Overall, the food was classic with modern twist done right, service impeccable, and priced decently for what you get.Friendly service and quick to get you to your car. The free bottled water is a nice touch and I would definitely rent from them again. We decided to pass on the upgrade for a few dollars more, but ended up getting upgraded anyway for free. I guess that is what winning feels like!For folks who like to cocktail, this place is awesome.  Everyone talks about how great the juke box is, how there are good movies playing in the background, how sometimes a food truck is located conveniently in the parking lot.  I write because the bartenders are awesome.  These are guys who make their own mix for Tom and Jerry's.  They will make a hot buttered rum from scratch.  They pour a mean Manhatten and something called a flying squirrel that will sneak up behind you with an order of protection.  In short, this place is heaven and hopefully not too many places rush over there displacing my place at the bar.If you've ever read my reviews or know me in real life, you would know that I value consistency. And it's exactly this that saves Orchid Garden from all of its downfalls.

Weak tea and decent food. Sometimes the carts take forever to make it back to you but some carts seem to stop by every 5 minutes. It's always the ones we want that never seem to come around.

The service is pretty good though, and the hosts and cart ladies are always attentive and err on the friendly side, despite the fact that I am Chinese and cannot speak it (which is apparently a sin). Prices are also attractive, especially for a light lunch or for those who don't prefer to stuff themselves senseless.

Any dishes with noodles (such as the big fat ones with shrimp inside) are okay - not the softest but still satisfies my craving. Harkow and shumai is decent as well. I always like getting beef tendon, egg tarts, and this crispy fluffy taro bun.

I've never had to wait but the majority of tables in the wide-open eating space is occupied. Of course, my favorite aspect of Orchids is the consistency. Every time I've been there, I know what to expect and it's great for when I crave dim sum that won't hurt my wallet. Good location and ample parking as well.Not too familiar with dim sum, but overall I tought it was worthy of 4 stars.  It's a good value proposition, felt authentic, but the quality of the food could be a little better.
Four of us are plenty withy left overs for $55.I really enjoyed the Shark Reef aquarium. I was pleasantly surprised by the alligator they had near the entrance, as well as the monitor lizard. Some very interesting fish as well. The shark exhibit is very well done. As you pass through the exhibit, you are surrounded by aquarium walls and sharks, which is very neat. On the down side, I was disappointed that you couldn't see the shark exhibit from the top. Also, the much hyped turtle exhibit was being remodeled so we couldn't see any sea turtles.This was our first visit, me and my wife got the oven baked omlettes, I got the mushroom which was very good I thought and she got the corned beef hash which was good but a little skimpy on the CBH I thought. These omlettes were massive (probably enough for two) and she couldn't finish hers so I helped but gave up because I was so full. My daughter got the lasagna which she liked, I tried it and thought it was good as well. The restaurant itself is very upscale looking and has flat screen TVs and I think ESPN was on, as far as ambience goes it blows IHOP out of the water. As far as the menu goes it wasn't very extensive compared to IHOP, the complete dining experience (service/food/atmosphere) is good enough to recommend OPH. I actually was least impressed with their pancakes, they were okay but quite small, with a name like OPH I expected some big honkin flapjacks like I've seen on Food Networks "Man vs Food" or "Diners, Drive Ins and Dives".  Oh, if you're on a budget look for their coupon in the Valu Pak which comes periodically in the mail. Even with the coupon we nearly spent $40 including the tip. Although next time we'll save some money by ordering just one omlette.Place for gays.  Friendly staff walking around with drink specials, fun mix of music but not heavy techno. Average price drinks around $10. Good dancers on platforms throughout. Don't get there too early. Find someone on the main a corners handing out 2 passes so you don't have to pay a cover to get in.I'm a proud Egg and I supporter, I own a bright purple Eggeriffic shirt to rep my new local breakfast jam. I wasn't always that way. I'll explain my Egg & I experience.

I wanted to run away when we pulled into the shopping center, located past that road where the palms hotel is. Its like a used car dealership wasteland on this street. That is how I found this place, while doing some car shopping all morning and finally getting so desperate for food we ventured down the road. Not somewhere you think you find a great breakfast place. Or so I thought.

You walk into what feels like a family style diner greeted by a cute older woman who reminded me of my own grandma. Always a plus.

Get seated and scope out the menu, 
lots of great options for omelets. We loved Canadian bacon or what my boyfriend likes to call bacon from Canada, ordered that. Preferred the waffles over the pancakes. (Learned that from my first trip there.) Order two orders of skillet potatoes (one for me and one for Adam.) They are literally that good. Each bite is a perfectly seasoned little bite of french fry / hash brown combination. Fruit platter with your choice of three berries. Lots of orange juice because I'm a sucker for pulp and vitamin c to start out my day. 

After 5 times here I've realized, it's really great for what it is. A alternative for some Denny's or Ihop because I'd rather support a local business owner. This place has breakfast down and I plan on eating here whenever I'm craving those skillet potatoes. Chya Boy!The bacon avacado omlete was delicious. The food came out quick and hot. Great service too.absolutely delicious . I am glad I came here early in my vacation ,so I can go there again . I had the cheesy omelette ranch potatoes and a banana nut muffin.  I was looking at the stuffed strawberry French toast, no really I literally was staring at it, the lady probably thought I was a creeper, but I am getting that sometime this week, with a side of ranch potatoes.  However, the chicken salad sandwich sounds good too...I did not get to stare at it to report back...sorry.  Whatever you do...order those ranch potatoes!!While on a family vaca, we decided to hit a spot off the strip for breakfast, and man this was a jackpot. Great for the kids.  They greeted us with balloons, and where extremely friendly.  I had the Chorizo skillet and it was the bomb!!  Super crispy potatoes.  Grubby mixture of everything else.  Also comes with a very good banana nut muffin on the side.  They leave the carafe of coffee at the table.  

Hit the spot and wish they had one near me in So Cal.Z Pizza is great! I used to go here for lunch all the time with my co-workers (we went through a phase when we were going there at least once a week). They have a great variety of pizza and almost every slice I've tried has been very good. The guys who work at the Tatum location are awesome - super friendly and great service!Having had the pot pie before, I was craving another experience at a Michael Mina restaurant.  I read on Yelp that they were having a daily late night happy hour (10am-12am).

So we headed over for a 9:30pm restaurant and were seated in a private booth in the bar.  Of course, we had a lobster pot pie and it was just as amazing as I remembered it.  Next we tried several of the happy hour food and drink items.

Overall, it was another memorable experience and I would definately suggest this restaurant (especially for their late night happy hour!).Had a nice decadent Vegas dinner at this joint over the weekend.  We sat in the separated booths behind the bar, which was probably a good thing since the dining room looked packed.  Our table was quiet and intimate so we got a little break from Vegas.  The sommelier was awesome.  He recommended a frech white that paired very well with the lobster pot pie.  I have to give the sommelier props for reading us correctly and suggesting wines at a wide variety of pricepoints.    

We did the appetizer sampler which was a fun way to get a variety of tastes, I liked everything on the plate.  In retrospect the lobster roll before the lobster pot pie was a bit much.  

The lobster pot pie itself was good, but this is where I'm taking the fifth star away.  One of the best parts of a pot pie is the pastry crust, in this case the pie crust was a little dense and hard for my liking.  I wasn't too upset because I was too full to eat it and the items in the pie were amazing.  

After taking a break we couldn't resist the marscapone cheesecake, it was so good.  I've been inspired to go home and start practiciing my cheesecake because I have been inspired to take it to the next level.  Very simple, but well executed cheesecake.

Overall this was a great dining experience and  I would go back, it was very similar to the Stonehill Tavern in Laguna Beach, CA.I should only order enchiladas @ Carolina's, I guess, because I am always disappointed when I order them anywhere else.  One star for excellent service, one star for awesome beans, one star for serving Pepsi, and one star for plentiful bike racks along Mill Ave.  Found the popular American music an odd choice...Stevie Nicks is not what I expect to hear while I'm noshing on chips and salsa.  The chips and salsa are complimentary.  And the salsa has a slight bite and is very flavorful.This has always been one of my favorite lazy places to eat in Las Vegas. By "lazy" I mean that I don't have to do any thinking to get there or eat there - they're always open, always casual, service is always good, and food is always tasty and large. This is a diner-type restaurant that gives you a good spectrum of choices, from pancakes and omelettes to huge salads to dinner items. I have noticed recently that the menu seems to have shrunk a bit and the prices have increased by a couple o' bucks, and for that, I'm docking a star. But Studio Cafe is still a safe place to eat, especially late at night or during hung over afternoons with a group of friends - there's something on the menu for everyone and service always comes with a smile.If you're at The Flamingo, I highly recommend this place.  Excellent atmosphere, a very subdued but classy dark wooden appearance with a very quiet feel, a nice break from the lights and noise of the casino.  I had the bone-in ribeye, which excelled in texture and taste.  My friend had the scallops which were well-presented and also delicious.  Our waiter, Francisco, was very attentive and made an excellent wine suggestion to compliment my dish. The only thing that keeps me from giving a 5th star is my opinion that the serving sizes were just a hair small compared to other ala-carte style steakhouses at the same price level.Pretty interesting stuff here. It was neat to see how this important time in our history affected how the nation is today. I didn't do the area 51 exibit because of all the negative reviews here on YelpThis local Coffee shop is just a few blocks from where I live. I'm not that hard to please. I simply want good service and fabulous coffee. I get both at this place. Love the free wifi. Sometimes I go here just to get away and catch up with online stuff/emails. Give it try. ~X~So, the boy and I were dissapointed that they were out of the St. Louis AND Baby Back ribs. Bummer. When he then stated that he wanted steak, I acquiesced and ordered the Ribeye to share (even though I really wanted some bbq!) with mashed potatoes and roasted corn. When our food arrived, I was delighted by the tender, flavorful piece of beef. The sides were bountiful and oh so tasty too. I don't know how I managed to get a few tastes of the mac n cheese, cornbread, french fries & the warm doughnuts - but I did. Everything I tried was on point! I think my son enjoyed it too. (He thanked me repeatedly as we walked back to the car for taking him here.) Will mos def make it back to Bobby Q when I'm back in town.Bobby Q's has excellent barbeque with a great atmosphere, service, and happy hour specials.  I went with a large party (18) co-workers from all over the country and everyone was extremely satisfied with their selections. The ribs and slow cooked brisket and pork were delicious and the selection excellent.  Their desserts were delectable as well (I had the chocolate cake).I used to drive past this place daily and have always heard great things about their food.  I remember going there when it was Bobby McGee's.  They still have the club ambiance late night and it looks pretty popping if you are into that.  We just went for the food.

I was stoked after checking in to see that they offered a first Yelp check in for 10% off your check, score.  The food was great.  My wife had the rib platter, very tasty, juicy and the BBQ sauce was delicious.  I had a Catfish Po'Boy along with a side of Mac n' Cheese, both were great.  They have plenty of drinks and a nice selection of beer on tap.

Thank you Bobby Q's, when I am in the need of BBQ I will be back.Important lesson learned today.. Sometimes traffic can lead to good things? Leaving La Purisima Bakery and on my way to the Esplanade to pick up a few things. I needed to turn left but it was not going to happen anytime this century so right it was. Trying to find a place to turn around I spot this place out of the corner of my eye. I pull one of those jackass right turn from the middle lane moves and come hurdling into the parking lot.. Food emergency! I should have a siren or something.

Walked in the door and the first thing I notice is one of the display cases is filled with ritter sports bars... ALL OF THE RITTER SPORTS BARS! Most of these had to be imported as they are not available in the US. Some of them I had never even heard of. It also appeared they had most if not all of the Milka bars. Under that was a huge selection of Lindt choclate bars.

My eyes continued to wonder up the case as I notice.. oh cool they have the dark and light Niederegger Marzipan.. and OHHH MYYY GOD! is that what I think it is?? Niederegger Weissbrot Marzipan.. This is THE stuff. There are few things in this world that cannot be made better by adding chocolate and this is one of them. Niederegger makes some of the best marzipan and I've always been upset that I can only find the chocolate covered stuff. It only takes away from their superior product. I am unaware of anyone else who carries the weirssbrot in the valley. You can order it online, *sometimes*, by the case and that's just not safe for me. This was turning out to be one of the best Saturdays ever ;) I would go into the differences between American/European marzipan but am trying to cut down on babble in my reviews.. like this.. *fail* http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marzipan

I asked the nice lady at the counter if there was anything else "that I should not go without" she said sadly they had sold out of most of what they made that day but that they had some fresh coconut macaroons. Again.. I thought maybe I had died crossing traffic like that and ended up in my own personal happy place. Although far from a regional specialty of the bakeries decent I had to get one. It was flat, which was very strange, and half of it had been dipped into dark chocolate. All I knew was that I was glad there were 4+ people coming to dinner to help me eat all of this stuff or I WOULD eat it all by myself and get sick.

If nothing else make a trip here to treat yourself to some chocolate you won't find anywhere else. Everything else is just a bonus :)Decent Hawaiian food on my side of town.  Love their chicken katsu curry!The beasts love to come here to socialize, be seen and see. Kelly B. is right on the money...this park is pretty basic so don't come here expecting fountains, play pools, etc. Bring your water and some toys and prepare for your dogs to be tired out.Having been to the Chicago location, I knew I was in for a treat.  

While the steak (Delmonico 22oz)  was amazing as usual, what really stood out were the appetizers of Prosciutto Wrapped Mozzarella with Vine Ripe Tomatoes, the Lobster/Crab Cakes  and the side of Lobster Mac 'N' Cheese. I would go back for these items alone.  

The only problem we encountered was the empty hostess station when we arrived. Even though we made a reservation, between waiting for the hostess to appear and sitting at the bar, we had to wait about 15min for them to "put our table together". I was disappointed to see that when we were finally taken to the dinning room we had been seated at a booth. For a group of four guys, this isn't an ideal seating situation. 

In the end, the food and wine made it easy to overlook the poor service at the hostess station. If you're out there celebrating an important event, I recommend The Capital Grille.I booked a reservation for four on Wednesday night and ended up having a fifth join our party. We arrived on time but the fifth person and the window seat request caused a slight delay. Corey the manager was gracious and kept us informed on the status of our table, he even bought us three appetizers because of the delay. As for the meal it was as awesome as ever. The food was cooked properly and was delicious. My guests were very impressed with the level of service and attention. Don't hesitate to dine here but know you get what you pay for and make sure you make reservations in advance, the wait at 7:00 on a Wednesday can be two hours or more.Good  food, but.....There can't be 4 oz of meat on the Texas Manhandler for $9.00...The Great American meal looks must better in the picture than on the plate...The place is so noisy with all the help sliding chairs around and slamming tables together you have a headache by the time you leave...The lunch buffet is really good.  Several different chutneys, two kinds of soup, and peas ( i have no idea what the name of the dish is) that are fantastic.  I come here a lot as it is taste, inexpensive and uncrowded at lunch time.I have to go IKEA? - shit....

Let me break it down for you. I love IKEA, I think they have a lot of great items, and are priced nicely. I also dig Scandinavian style, and profess a minimalist attitude towards all things.  So I get it, IKEA is cool for the most part, and I have a lot of stuff from this mega-store. What I don't like about IKEA is their physical store setup. I hate being forced into the "showroom" I don't want to walk Odin's path, or travel the way of the great Vikings Consumers of the past. I just want a curtain rod, and a curtain. THAT IS IT.  After fighting my way through the hordes of people and peasants alike, I fought my way through to the "marketplace" 

checklist out....(written in blood on a dried deer skin.)

1. curtain rod.
2. curtain rod attachments for the wall
3. oh.... don't forget the curtain

As I make my way past screaming kids, couples arguing over a Faux-Painting, and through the warehouse full of prefabricated, assemble required, plan about 4 hours on a Saturday to complete, furniture.I go to self checkout...Yes I am Free!! (1.5 hours later)

I did it!!!!!  I have my curtain I need. I will "install" this now as "hang" sounds gay. So I  install my curtain I realize, "wow this helps to reduce the sun's infiltration into my soul, and think my other room would benefit from a curtain as well.  This means (insert Darth Vader March music here) another trip to IKEA....

This time however, I have a plan. I will go through the checkout area, through the warehouse, and totally bypass the showroom. Fuck IKEA, I am not a lemming easily led through a retail smorgasbord. Even if they had aquavit and salmon gravlax waiting for me, I'd still go through the Swedish "backdoor" 

I make my way in and repeat  the above 3 steps and I am out in 20 minutes. I have to say this must be some sort of world record. 

All in all, you can defeat IKEA, you just need to be sneaky and quick, you have to focus, and avoid any contact with people once in the store. Upon arriving home, I go to "install" this other curtain, and to really man-ify the situation, and to de-gay the whole weekend experience of shopping for "window trimmings" I put the Redsox   game on, (they won in 13 innings) and make it as "tough" of experience as installing a curtain can be.

 Not that there is anything wrong with that....IKEA isn't high end ultra lux materials but the place is indeed an amusing conglomerate of interior goods. We knew what we wanted tonite and for those that have been, if you wanna avoid the two hour walk around, stick with entering on the first floor thru the returns entrance and go straight to the stock isles in the back. 

We quickly spotted our item as the store prominently ornaments the most best selling items in the center aisles. Then on to the register where the staff is usually quite efficient and quick. We even had time for a $1 yorgurt and was in and out in 15min, gotta love the Scandinavians!Cafe Wasabi is great place to go get some great sushi at reasonable prices.  The atmosphere is nothing special. Quite simple really.  The sushi is great though.  They have same unique rolls and the price is very reasonable. The Wasabi roll is my favorite and only $6. They don't have a happy that i'm aware which is a bit of a bummer.  I  highly recommend Cafe Wasabi.Always a fan and love their food.  The 14th Street pizza is my favie but this time it tasted different.  It was good but it was not GREAT!!!  =(  The service was great.I love this place - definitely one of my favs in Phoenix area. Pizza is great, sandwiches wonderful, burger - I would skip. Today I had the green chile cheese burger on a recommendation of someone I met at Postino's. I don't think he is from New Mexico. 

I got the burger and it was huge, with a pile a shredded cheese on top. Not melted shredded cheese just shredded cheese on the burger and chile. On the other side was nice looking pickles, purple raw onion and slices of tomato. I hurriedly smashed the burger sides together in hopes of melting some of the cheese(didn't work). Sliced the burger in half and took a bite. Unfortunately I bit right into the strongest onion I've eaten in years. After that I couldn't taste anything. Especially the green chile, it looked beautiful but I couldn't get any flavor out of it. When I added the sea salt provided on the table it tasted better. The fries were great though. I had a Mirror Pond on tap! That was delicious. 

The other thing that I found highly annoying was I needed utensils, napkins and plates so I went to a table in the corner where there was wrapped utensils in white cloth napkins and small plates. I asked the service person if I could get these to take to the table. She said no get them from the other side of the restaurant. Where I found cheap utensils, paper napkins and no plates. I took a large amount of napkins (I have two boys eating pizza) and utensils. My boys didn't enjoy eating off of the wooden board the pizza comes on so my husband got up and just took two plates. 

Not FIVE minutes later the woman I spoke to started placing the same wrapped utensils and plates onto the empty tables where the next guests sat. HUH? I understand they were transitioning to dinner but really? You couldn't just hand them to me? 

Other than that it's a wonderful place we will be back again and again.It was 10pm on a Friday night, NEEDED to eat sushi and didn't want to travel off the strip to get it.  

So Social House it is.  

Warning:  If you are a big eater, you will need to spend a fortune to get full!

With that said, we ordered: Crispy Pata, Angry Tuna, Teriyaki Veg, Deep fried Tofu, Salmon Sashimi, Veggie roll.  Everything was delicious!  Service is really friendly with out being cheesy.  Being Filipinos, of course the Crispy Pata could of used more pork skin on it but oh well, we are in Vegas and not everyone appreciates pork skin like we do.

Honestly, I was stuffed by the end of our meal, no room for desert. Shucks!!I stayed at the Bellagio during my last trip to Vegas and me and my friends all agreed this was our favorite casual eating option in the hotel.  The service was very friendly, slow at times, but we were never in a hurry anywhere.  The food was delicious -- one of the best turkey burgers I've ever had.... and they had pretzel rolls in the bread basket!!!!!  We also liked that they had a $40 bottle of champagne on the menu which allowed us to toast to our reunion in Sin City without breaking the bank.I actually have to disagree with a lot of yelpers reviews for Cafe Bellagio!

On the last day of guys trip to Vegas, we made our way to the Cafe Bellagio for a last Vegas breakfast!  We had decided that we weren't going to do another buffet b/c of the lack of time, and wasn't willing to spend too much money.

One of the pure benefits of being a member of the mLife, with Gold Status, is the fact that there's no waiting in line; rather, just go up to the front, and get priority service!  

Our waitress was very friendly, and no mistakes were made to our order.  Our food came out quite quickly, and the breakfast was quite delicious--the Denver omelet.  The coffee was freshly brewed, and best of all, the prices weren't too bad!  

Service was quite prompt, given the fact that Sunday mornings are quite crowded, with many grabbing a quick breakfast before checking out, or heading back home.  A definite repeat will re-occur again~!

Overall grade: AI've never been to Dim Sum in Vegas, but we tried this place based on online reviews.  It's hidden in the back area of the Gold Coast casino and when we walked up to it, there was a line of about 20 people in line which was a good sign.  We were a large party (12 people) and it took about 30 minutes to get seated.  There were lots of chinese people here which again was a good sign.  Once we sat down, it was on.

The quality of the dim sum was pretty high.  The dim sum dishes were all fresh.  I would consider them to be in the upper echelon if we moved this place to the Bay Area.  Would I go back?  Probably.  Prices were reasonable, food was good and it was authentic.this is by far my favorite Macy's the selection is by far better then the others, even fashion square seems to fall flat on my fancy. the fragrance selection is good, and they have my favorite brands of clothing and the clearance racks have always saved me some money.

Yelp.Great quick service and fresh salads!Two visits in a very short period of time gave me two sides to the story- one was five star, one four minus.  The atmosphere with the resident artist painting onsite is five star without a doubt.

First of all- MOJITO HEAVEN!!!!  Amaze.  Period.  Order them if you like mojitos or not because you haven't had them like this.

First experience was with a girlfriend and we ordered tapas style.  FIVE STAR.  Million dollar tacos, chevche, and some shrimp heaven dish.  And the rice.  Unbelivable service.

Second night was two weeks later for business.  The service was awful and the chef was out of town.  My tiger shrimp were excellent but my guests lamb was slightly over done.  The bad service tainted it really.

I really can't wait to come back though... Million dollar tacos and Mojitos will always be a top culinary trip for me now.  Gracias.It is what it is... a hotel cafe but it has so much going for it. Keep in mind I went here twice and both times around 3am (plus I had a few to drink ya know). 

+ 
Open 24 hours and will serve you unlike the idiots at the hotel bars. 
Food is actually ok. 
You can order one single pancake, how cool is that! 
Drinks are cheaper then most places. 
Cashier up front so you leave when you want. 

- 
Service can be a little slow pending the waitress but that's everywhere right. 
The lights are really bright I'm guessing so you can see all the scary people there. 

Overall if I ever stay at the Excalibur again I'm going here to grab a late night drink or bite.Great service.  Nice ambiance.

So glad they have kids meals now.  Last time I was there (long time ago) they didn't.  So your child can eat for between $2.95 and $4.95, including a drink.

The happy hour is decent.  I had a coconut lemon drop (YUM) for $6, hubby had a large sake for $4.  Plus I shared the edamamme and tofu potstickers with my girls.  There are three small ones for $3.25 but they are GOOD.

One child had the lo mein with tofu, one had buhdda's feast with tofu.  The buhdda's feast was just steamed carrot, broccoli and sugar snap peas.  The rice and sauce (she got sweet & sour) was on the side.

My birthday boy ordered off the gluten free menu and had the mongolian beef.  He scarfed it down.  Hubby had gluten free spicy chicken.  It wasn't hot enough for him so he added more pepper sauce but he did enjoy it.

I had the vegetarian spicy eggplant.  It was DELICIOUS.  $7.95 and I couldn't even finish it.

For my son's birthday they brought him a free mini dessert.  He chose triple chocolate mousse.  Usually they are $2.25 each.

Total bill was $70.This is a very good production of Phantom with the following characteristics for fans who have seen multiple productions.

The Phantoms in Las Vegas are pretty good with Crivello a shade better than Barrett but Christine is a tad worse than Phantom compared to elsewhere such as NY and London.

Production values and the theater are the best.  If you are familiar with NY theatres and have a wide rear end, you can be somewhat uncomfortable.  Seats were built for smaller people back then and it can affect your overall enjoyment.

No problem for Vegas.  The theatre, seating, staging, special effects, etc. are the best I have seen although other productions are not bad.  

As for the cut in the time, I think it does take away a little bit.  It's a trade-off of a punchier production that gets you back on the slot machines faster versus a perceived value for your money for the length of the show.  However, if a show is noticeably too long then it detracts from the experience.

You should never pay full price for this show.  If you gamble enough you might get it comped but there are often tickets at the half price outlets and online.  Overall, with a discount, this is a very good entertainment value unless you need to be blown away by Christine.If you have a artistic bone in your body you will really appreciate the theater. There is so much detail put into the decor you can't help but love it ....(pay close attention to the chandelier). Even though Phantom tours big cities, it's way better to see it in Vegas because the theatre was built just for this show! 

Oh and do not go and see the show hungover or on 2 hrs of sleep like I did, you will not enjoy it as much as you should!!Heard of this place and was finally able to check it out. Was hard to find, as there is no sign above the door and the actual restaurant probably only seats 15 people total, really is a hideaway!!  Anyways, I ordered the enchiladas and got to watch from my seat as they cooked my meal. They were really good if not a bit spicy ( I'm a wuss and never eat spicy foods). I highly recommend this spot if you are looking for something a little different.I luv this place. Clean, roomy, plenty of choices, fresh fruit, self-serve items... mangos, arugula, tofu, blue corn chips, assortment of creme sodas, hard to find cheeses, great fish counter.... Unlike those big chains there are actual choices for customers, and No McDonalds, Starbucks, uninspired employees, etc etc.Taco shop style mexican food. Perfect for late night munchies, especially after you've had a few drinks. Greasy and delicious! The bean n cheese, and breakfast burritos take the cake! Also there's a salsa bar with spicy carrots, salsa, and green onions too. The salsas need a little work though.Pretty quick and decent tasting. Your typical Roberto's, nothing great but nothing bad either.long line but the ox tail soup was well worth it.dinner last night here was very filling. it was my very first time here and i am sure to be a returning customer. i had no cravings last night so my boyfriend decided he was craving some pei wei. once he knew i never been it was for sure we were going. for the two of us with two entrees, crab wontons (4), and cups of water the total was right under $20.00. I had the tofu and veggie teriyaki bowl with steamed brown rice. It came out in a huge bowl overflowing of colorful veggies. The tofu was thinly sliced and reminded me of mushrooms covered in some addicting sauce. the veggies cookies just right with huge pieces of bright green broccoli and an overload of green snap peas. the steamed brown rice was so soft and went just right with the mix of everything. I stole a crab wonton and was surprised with how much crab was actually stuffed in that little pastry. the spicy sweet sauce they were sat up on went perfect with it enough to make me want to eat all 4 of them, but i know i had to share with Dan T. I couldn't be greedy.
I was pleased with my first time pei wei dine. I did wish they had the heat on though because it was very chilly inside. chilly enough i didn't want to drink my water. that was the only downside for dining in there. I loved the food though and am pleased to have leftovers for days now in my little take out box.Went to Half Moon to watch the UFC fights and thought it was a great set up. Rather than seating you in a random place they ask what event you're watching so they can place you with the same fans and sporting event. The food was bar food, but their burgers are half priced $4 on Saturday and Sunday all day so not bad. It's a huge establishment but fills up quick so get there early.Great place in the Biltmore area to grab a beer and watch a game!  Friendly bartenders, nice atmosphere and good drink selection.Always good avacado eggrolls, ice tea, and chicken teryaki. A good choice everytime. This location is busy but you can walk around after a meal.which is a plus.This restaurant really lives up to previous reviews. The restaurant is huge, and there are a ton of staff. The menu is a bit too big, but everyone will find something they like. I had the chicken bellagio, and it was delicious. My husband had the chicken madeira, and he loved it too. The portions were gigantic though, and it feels like such a waste. I only managed to eat about half. We shared the chocolate mousse cheesecake and the chocolate tuxedo cream cheesecake, and both were amazing. I'm always impressed when such a big and busy (and afforable) restaurant can produce food this good. 

Be warned the location can be a bit noisy, and I definetly recommend being seated inside. It's a busy place as well, but we only had to wait 15 minutes to be seated when we came on a Monday night.Been here 3 years in a row and it starts to feel the same to me now, but it's definitely interesting and there is a lot of stuff to take in. It takes me about 2 hours for each South, Central, and maybe North hall too, but I go fast and I only stop at the stuff I care about. Otherwise you should be ready to spend days here and walk for miles. Yes, I'll get a curved phone and maybe a curved TV (I'll read this post in a year or to and laugh probably), and also some wifi enabled LED bulbs (those are here to stay). It's fun to try so many gadgets and talk to so many people, get here if you can - it's for industry affiliates only.Great place for seafood and fish lovers.  The crab cakes are to die for!The restaurant is beautiful and although it is quite a big place we did not find it too noisy.Starbucks just never disappoints me! I am a full on starbucks fan! Tonight, I was actually lucky. There was some sort of glitch with the system so I got a dollar discount on my green tea latte! =) But back to the service and its product- service was golden! Although there was problems with the system, the workers still gave off a friendly attitude and made up the time spent with the register, with their fast customer service and in making the drinks in a flash!Huge freakin' portions! Damn... it's one of the few places that I was challenged to finish all of my plate! I usually have no trouble knocking off "large" plates, but this one was definitely a challenge... The steak I had was a good 24 oz. and all the side dishes were enough to feed the starving children in Africa, and then some. I saw so many people sitting around our table, just in awe of the portions that were being served at their (and others') tables... Aside from the huge portions, the variety of dishes here were surprisingly nice. They even offer breakfast dishes during dinner hours, so that's a plus for anyone that craves pancakes at 10pm... Beware of the pancakes though... they are about the size of a pizza, and enough to definitely make the hungriest of people full. So, if you enjoy large portions, and a challenge... or an opportunity to impress your friends by finishing off a freakin' cow-sized steak.... this is the place! The service was also quite nice here the few times I've eaten here... and parking has been no trouble as well... I'm not sure it's all that family-friendly though... the place is set up more like a trendy, late-night place for adults...I was in town and since everyone on yelp screams about this place i wanted to check it out.  I got there early afternoon around 12 30pm and noticed that it was packed already with people waiting to be seated and some were even baking outside waiting to be seated.  The cute girls up front stated it would take an hour to an hour 15 minutes to be seated so i was like maybe i shouldnt wait but decided to stick around since there isnt much to do in vegas in the morning.  it took about 40 minutes and we were seated.  Ok i am getting to the important part the FOOD.  I ordered hamburgers for kids from the kid's menu and boy i was wrong to get each one their own burgers.  The burgers were so big that kids couldnt even manage to eat half of it.  So my advice get one burger per two children :).. Flapjack i ordered was huge as well i would say 3-4 people could easily eat this and i am a big guy with apetite.  Verdict fun to see such huge portions atmosphere was nice definitely worth going and checking it out.  I cant say the taste of breakfast was the best i have had though, but i enjoyed the experience.Ok to be honest, Everyone was raving about the chicken and waffles so I said why not let's give it a go.  When I bit into the meal I was a little disappointed because it wasn't what I expected it to be.  The bacon waffles was something different, I liked that part.  The chicken on the other hand I wasn't too much of a fan, the breading was a little off to me and the sauce that was on the plate did not go well with the meal, it tasted like soy sauce.  I'd rate it a 3 but I gave it a 4 because you definitely get what you pay for! Roscoe's chicken and waffles in long beach, ca still holds the reigning champ title for chicken and waffles for me.

Girlfriend had the tracker combo with the banana french toast, and she loved it kept raving on about it so I'm sure that was a must :PWife and I went to the Sahara location this past weekend 6/9/12; I had been to this location several times, this was her first time at any HHaGG.  I have learned to stick with the chicken and waffles, as I always tend to regret ordering other things on the menu.  Not that the other items aren't good, it's just that the sandwiches, skillets, etc. are on par with other breakfast places.  The chicken and waffles here are IMO the best item on the menu, and the best I've had in town (compared to M&M, Gritz).  

As previously stated by everyone else, the portions are HUGE. We knew this, and decided to share this dish, and ordered a side of biscuits and gravy (actually, only 1 biscuit). The menu suggests a $2.50 split plate charge, but the waitress just brought us an empty plate, and we did it ourselves for free!  Good times.

The biscuits and gravy are VERY good, but VERY rich, with chunks of meat and creamy goodness that fills the little bowl.  The biscuit is soft, flaky, and resists soaking from the gravy well, giving you a nice consistent texture, without mushiness.  I dare say the FLAVOR of the biscuit and gravy is now my favorite thing at HHaGG. The problem is it so rich, I would find it hard to make a full meal out of it.  Sharing a side is the way to go for this gutbomb!  Even splitting, we still left a waffle (sans bacon, of course) behind.Huge portions, way too much to eat.Wow. Now me and my wife went to las vegas in the summer of 2012 and we made a special trip to hash house a go go becuse of the man vs food tv program. We spent 7 days in vegas and it was the only restaurant that we attended twice in a week. I must admit the portion sizes are ridiculously huge. I mean people have said to me American portions are big; but I have never been over faced too much. Hash house blew the size competition out of the water.  What about the food? I hear you ask. Well my Sarah had the blue cheese salad with extra fried chicken on top and we both agreed that it was the best salad we both had ever tasted.  Yes the best combinations ever. The salad was heavenly. 10 out of 10. Now to my dish; the famous fried sage chicken with waffles and bacon. It was good but not the best because the saltiness of the bacon just doesn't gel with the sweet pancakes. Dont get me wrong but I still highly recommend it to anyone. The fried chicken itself was very good but not the best in the world. Service was friendly but felt like it was all about the tip. Also the waiting on staff told us that food will just arrive on our table not together cause the chefs doesnt like leaving food hanging around on the hot pass. More like the chefs cant get their timing right!!!!. Conclusion: very good food. Huge portions and let your hair down and stuff your face. Will go back.Be prepared for a wait unless you're here at the crack of opening. Huge portions, somewhat overpriced. Food was pretty good. Vegetarian here though, so can't say much for everything on the menu. They have some creative things on the menu, definitely a place to stop at for breakfast if you're a vegas first timer.Quantity= bang for your buck
Quality= eh, better than buffet but not as good as specialized places, like Metro Pizza or Naked City or Bachi Burger.Ok I love the entrees here. The scenery is really amazing at night or during the day. However my head couldn't deal with going around in circles. Lol.. But really romantic! Can be used for a great pick up line "baby how would you like me to take you to the top of the world" hahaI made the mistake of thinking that this place was a walkable distance from our hotel (Mirage). Man was I wrong! We were walking, more like running (me in heels) for a good 15mns. When we got to our appointment, more than an hour late, all sweaty, we were greeted with all smiles and great service. Still seated right away. For that we were thankful. 


View is stunning. For someone with a fear of heights, I was afraid of feeling ill from the tower rotations every 20mns. Totally wasn't the case. In reality, you could barely feel them. Food was delicious. Steak and lobster combo is a real winner. It's definitely one of those restaurant worth visiting in your lifetime.The hotel and building really need to be remodeled. Nothing was noticeable from the dining table, but the carpet and walls were clearly aged all along the route one must take from valet to tower entrance. There is a brief security check before ascending the tower. They also say - and have a sign saying - business casual strictly enforced however while there were folks dressed up beyond business casual there were also people in jeans and athletic wear. The servers were all friendly and all the food we were served was good, if only a bit salty. There is a photographer who comes by and takes your picture several ways. She really did a brilliant job and I actually bought one of the $45 displays featuring one of our solo portraits and our pic together. 2 wallets with holder sold for something in the 20s. This restaurant does revolve and we got around about 1.5 times - and saw one sky jumper fly by our window during dinner. I actually do recommend this place. I know a lot of places that are iconic (e.g., have height or revolve) get lazy in making good food but this wasn't one of those places. From the looks of the area though and my brief experience in town this is not a section of the strip worth hanging out much in. Drive down here for dinner but then go back south on Las Vegas Blvd for more fun on the strip.good bang for the buck.  cannot compare any buffet to sushi bar quality sushi ever but this place is good for a buffet.  lots of variety on the cooked foods side as well as dessert. they even have a chocolate fountain too. located where the shopping outlets are.Had lunch with friends here on last Sunday (5/15/11). This is the best Japanese Buffet I 've ever had. Sushi rolls are so pretty and quality is very good too. Price is very decent. I recommand everyone come here to try during visit in Las Vegas .Stumbled into the America around 4am after a night out which lead to morning at Marquee. I was staying at NYNY so finding a decent place to eat a real meal was key for me and my friend. We were seated right away... Of course, the restaurant was hardly busy. Only a few tables were occupied. Our waiter brought us water right away before we could ask so it was perfect. I'm sure he's seen it hundreds of times... The need to hydrate in Vegas is of the absolute importance. Ha!

I opted for the bagel mania which is a grilled NY style bagel sandwich with bacon, eggs, ham and good ol' american cheese. It was delicious not only cause I was starving at the moment but the combination of ingredients was perfect. The cheese topped off the bacon, eggs and ham. And all those things were encapsulated in a perfectly crisp on the outside, soft on the inside grilled bagel. Delicious... It was just what i needed. It came with country style potatoes. That was pretty good too.

My friend got a rib eye steak and eggs. Loved it and scarfed it like it was the last meal on earth.... Satisfied customer.

Our waiter was real cool. Bill was under $25 with tip. Yes, please... Thank you America, I luh you.I was very hesitant to go to the Secret Garden because I'm normally against supporting places where animals are held in captivity, but it was obvious from the moment I saw the dolphins and other animals that they were very well taken care of and treated properly by the Garden's care staff. The animals at the Secret Garden, including the dolphins, are not forced to do tricks or shows. Instead, they get to swim around, do what they want, and are not bothered by visitors. The dolphins are very majestic to look at, and so are the lions, tigers, and leopards. I was very pleased to see these beautiful animals, and was even more appreciative that they seemed to be treated well and taken care of.I enjoyed my first dinner here.  While I do like most of Toby Keith's songs, and even went to one of his concerts at The Pearl, neither circumstance has any bearing on my rating of his namesake restaurant.  I rate a restaurant on the quality of its food, service, and ambiance--nothing more and nothing less.  Based solely on those criteria, I enjoyed the whole experience here.

When our order was taken we had only one hour remaining before a ticketed show.  Hearing this, our waitress, Felicia M., did a great job getting the food out to us in a timely fashion, and later quickly presenting us with our bill, so that we had enough time to eat before hastening off to The Quad next door.            

I began with Fried Pickles, which were interesting warm lengths of pickle encased in slightly salty beer batter, that proved to be quite tasty dipped in an intriguing Southwest Ranch Dressing or joined with a few dollops of ketchup.  A Dinner Salad composed chiefly of Romaine Lettuce, cut tomato pieces, and a very smooth and mellow Honey Mustard Dressing was a nice prelude to my entree of moist and toothsome Homemade Honky Tonk Meatloaf with rich dark Brown Gravy that was accompanied by good skin-on Mashed Potatoes and creamy Coleslaw.  Buttered Cornbread rounded out a fine meal, which was enhanced by piped in country rock music which gave way to live country rock music by a small band at 9:00 p.m. sharp.   

I will be back to try the highly vaunted Fried Bologna Sandwich with Miracle Whip on Texas Toast!Ok - I know this place is crowded but it's not half bad if you have a table. I like this place and no...I did not end up getting thrown out of it. Following my review from the Luxor - the limo had brought us here and when they dropped us off escorted us straight to the elevator leading up to the club. I pissed off a lot of people doing that. ;D

Inside is nice from what I could see. Love those flame throwers...woohooooo! I didn't really drink because I was already gone by then - and I also had a little something in my pocket to keep the buzz going (thank gawd hidden flask). It was good times but from what I heard from the ladies - I would advise against the open toe and settle for some steel toe combat boots. It is that crowded........but then again would you go there if it were empty???? I didn't think so. Yeah I think it would have been better if it was a different crowd - this is my time to plug house music because not specifically because it's my genre of preference but the crowd is less stuck up and more into having a good time which this place could be more of.the good:
uber comfortable beds
the flor carpeting
the rooms are very large
aveda products
very friendly/accommodating front desk staff
cool artwork

the bad:
nothing in walking distance from the hotel (but i guess phoenix IS a car-town)

the ugly:
service in the restaurant ... granted we ate in the bar area but you would expect the waiter to have some clue on proper service (the food ain't cheap) ... no clue  what the specials were / dropped [and i mean 'dropped'] entrees off w/o bussing app plates that had been sitting on the table / had to flag him down a bunch of times for things / etc.the clarendon has one of the best happy hour restaurants we've eaten in. great fish tacos!

we spent our new years eve hosted by the clarendon. it was very inexpensive, at only 25 bucks. they hosted a Gatsby theme and luckily, most everyone showed up dressed to the 9's!

the party was held at their pool lounge area which had plenty of heat lamps and lots of room to move. or you could head up to their roof top patio which has amazing city views. there were heat lamps also. 

cash bar and a DJ for the party. it was nice to be able to move about so freely without constantly bumping into other party goers. 

a couple of things to consider: the rooftop patio is floored with wooden planks with gaps in them. didn't bother me, but i noticed several women in their high heels get caught up several times in the gaps. 
the DJ was ok i guess, but i did not care for his music. only towards midnight did people start dancing and he didn't interact with the crowd at all. all of a sudden, we just hear "10, 9, 8,...." and that was it. 
lastly, the wine pours. very inconsistent. i believe a drink is 5oz, but the bartender only served us 3oz. later that night, i got a completely full glass. good for me?

but that's nitpicking. fun night and lots of taxis lined up outside to take you home!Stayed in the Junior suites which were connected with each other. Had 11 people staying and I have to say it suited us perfectly. Like most Vegas trips we didnt spend much time in our rooms but if thats what you wanted to do these rooms would work just fine. We used the pool which had its own bar and wasn't crowded at all - but still had enough people there to make it fun. Didnt feel it was too far from the MGM and having stayed there previously, I would definitely choose the Signatures.
Viva Las Vegas!We had the best lentil soup I've tasted along with two shwarmas that were fresh and tasty.  The owners were very friendly, we will go back.I've been here twice, and as I am not a huge German food fan, I was a tad skeptical at first.  However, I was greeted by warm service.  They have a very authentic menu, and it tastes similar to some of the food that I had in Germany.  My family also loved their selection of beer and dessert.  While the food isn't to die for, it is authentic and pretty good.There's nothing better than escaping sub-zero temperatures for the toasty climes of Phoenix. I was lucky enough to do this last week (pre-Snowpacolypse), and there was no better way to enjoy the sun than sitting by the fountain on the patio at Olive and Ivy.

At first glance, I thought this spot was going to be a bit stuffy since it's located in a pseudo strip mall area. However, the second I stepped inside my opinion changed. It can only be described as lofty, with eye-catching light fixtures and decor. Although I didn't notice it until my way out, I am totally enamored with the white room just off the front door - it features a large round table for 12 (I think) with high-backed chairs, ethereal curtains and a to-die-for white glass chandelier. Very intimate and would be fun for a brunch party, methinks.

Don't pass up the bread and pesto here, my friends. It will put a smile on your face, as will the mushroom and asparagus truffle pizza. We tried several flatbreads, but that was definitely the standout. I enjoyed a few sips of the house sangria and am a fan of the sugared rim, and quite enjoyed my chicken curry salad, too. Just an observation - it seems like their salads are heavy on the dressing, so if you're picky about that, order yours on the side. 

Stellar service here (our server was a life coach and I just wanted to hug her), and their bathroom is going on my Arizona top 10 list. Think oversized doors, floor to ceiling mirrors, and a trough-style sink. On second thought, can I hire their decorator to re-do my apartment??

As you can see, I'm a fan. It looks like they also have a little market area complete with a gelato counter in case you want to get your foodies to go. Thumbs up!The pesto!!!! So good. The place has a good atmosphere and delicious food. I could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine. Everything I've tried on the menu from the three times I've gone has been delicious. Slightly pricy but not terrible for Scottsdale.This is the only place in Vegas where you can get Hawaiian Cake Noodle and Malasadas!  I love getting the Seafood Cake Noodle or the Beef Cake noodle.  If you don't know what malasadas are, they are hawaiian donuts, very similar in flavor to the New Orleans beignets; just a little heavier.  A nice fried ball of dough, light and fluffy on the inside with a wonderful crisp outside dusted with powder sugar.  

Noodle palace has excellent lunch specials that start at $4.50 whether you want a hot bowl of wonton noodles, dumplings in soup, some fried rice, or chow fun.  You can't go wrong with chow fun for $4.50, especially when it comes out good and tasty.  

If you like roasted pork (the stuff with the nice crispy skin), this is the place to order some.  Forget the specialty chinese BBQ places like Sam Woo or BBQ King, at this place, the chef always gives you the best part of the pig.  A nice hunk of pork skin, minimal fat, no bone or bone chips like those other cheap chinese places, and some tasty meat.  Eat it with the hoisin sauce, and you will order it every time.  

Other dishes to try is the Salt and Pepper squid (chinese calamari), Salt and Pepper pork chop, Clams with black bean sauce, any vegetable with XO (don't really know what it means) sauce, or if you are craving noodles on a hot or cold day, the wonton egg noodles are delicious.  
Portions are a generous size, and the wait staff is always friendly, with quick service.  They are smart enough to take your order in english and help you decide what you want.

Overall, this is a nice cheap alternative to eating on the strip with good chinese food, good service, and always leaving with a doggy bag.The East side of Madison and Atwood Ave. have an eclectic blend of restaurant offerings. Dothan has a nice menu offering that will fit anyone's desired tastes. From Vegetarian to meat they offer multiple choices in each category. Our food was excellent, the wait staff was personable, the service was very good and we'll continue to go to Dobhan. They didn't get 5 stars cuz no one gets five stars from me unless you blow me off my chair.I had this yesterday right after I checked out.  Arrived a little before 12PM.  I thought I was going to a restaurant and was a little dissapointed because I wanted to be alone and not bugged because of my hangover.  It actually was a bar as if you were going to grab a drink.  Anyways, arrived there and got seated right away, fortunately. This place is amazing..that's all I have to say.  I'm on a venture right now to find this somewhere in the Los Angeles/Orange County area.  I recommend going there early because by the time I was done with my meal, there was a long long line with people looking very miserable.  Anyways, go early and you have to order the Pacific Pan Roast, the one that is at the top of the pan roast menu.  This is right up there with my cravings for either Boiling Crab (crawfish) or Indian Food (chicken tika masala).  So much flavor.  I most definitely will go back here, every time I'm in Vegas.  Now where can I go to find this in Los Angeles? hmm... :/  Thanks to my girlfriend showing this, I am now at work ..yelping while i should actually be working on this very gloomy Monday back from Vegas. sigh..What!!!... First timer here and I'm an instant fan. Yes, you'll have to wait unless you get lucky and seats open up when you arrive. But it's worth the wait! You have 24hr in a day to try it. 

Really cool, hole-in-the-wall kinda place. Right in the middle of a low-mid range hotel/casino way off the strip, the Palace Station. 

The food was excellent. As my first time here, my family recommended the Combo Pan Roast w/ shrimp, crab and lobster. I ordered mine with medium (#5) spiciness and included a scoop of white rice on top (you can ask for it on the side if you like). Also had shrimp cocktail and the dozen oysters in the half shell. Both were really tasty. The clam linguini my sis got looked amazing as well. Will have to try that one time. My friend got the manhattan clam chowder and mentioned that it was ok and a little salty for his taste. 

They also offer clams on the half shell, gumbo, jambalaya, clam chowder and more! Drool. Check out the specials on beer and drinks. An oyster shooter menu looked too good. 

Service was friendly and attentive. The chef had the process down. It was entertaining watching him work as he prepared the meals in front of you. They also didn't rush you through your meal, as seeing there are only 18 seats. I don't recommend large parties, as it may be tough to get everyone seated at one time.

I'm eager to go back and try more dishes. If you like seafood, this is a must-go-to.Nice atmosphere and pretty decent food.  The place was packed and we opted to sit at one of the booths surrounding the bar.  We still got very good service, though our server was clearly overmatched by the throngs.  Nonetheless, she was very attentive and probably earned this place its fourth star.  I sampled a couple of pints of their house hefeweizen and really enjoyed it.

We skipped appetizers and I went for a simple house salad and then had an 8 oz. filet entree.  The salad was good and the ranch dressing was mixed in nicely.  The filet was the best part of the meal (real shocker there, eh?), perfectly cooked to medium-rare and topped with an herb butter.  I got the Loaded Baked Potato side and it was not very "loaded."  We took home some tremendously huge piece of chocolate cake and ate it later.  It was ok.

Again, three stars for the food and a bonus star for our server and the overall experience.I was here a couple weekends ago for the Phoenix Rock n' Roll Marathon & Half-Marathon, and we had a ex-local recommend this place as a great pre-race carbo-loading spot.  We made a reservation for 6:30p Saturday night.

It turned out to be totally worth the drive from our hotel in Tempe (which really wasn't that far, but still)!  Soon after we arrived and were promptly seated, the crowd around the front door increased exponentially with every passing minute.  The wait must have been really long - thank goodness for the reservation!  Definitely follow suit, especially if you plan to come on a Friday or Saturday night.

To start, our party of 3 ordered one of the flatbreads.  These are not on the menu online for whatever reason, but I'd suggest we all take it as a sign to not order it.  Really.  It was pretty pricey, tiny, and not particularly impressive.  You'd be better off just asking for another basket of bread they bring, because the focaccia was just as good (and free).

We all ended up getting the same thing - the rigatoni al forno.  It came with a salad, which was actually really good.  But then came the main attraction itself, and ,oly moly was that delicious!  I ate every single last little piece of rigatoni, and then sopped up the sauce with more (free) bread.  Don't judge - I ran it all off the next day. :o)

If you are in the area, I'd definitely recommend checking this place out.  It was pretty reasonably priced, considering the portion sizes (for everything except the flatbread), and super tasty.A couple of weeks ago, I had dinner here with friends. I ordered a French dip, without the melted cheese, and a side of fries. The sandwich was excellent. The beef was lean and tender, and the au jus sauce was very good. If I have one suggestion, it would be that they offer a couple of vegetarian options, as I was actually interested in ordering something meatless that day and was not in the mood for pasta. How about a good spicy black bean burger and/or a good lentil loaf entree? These would be two vegetarian options that could fit in well with the menu's comfort food theme. Other than this, I had a good dining experience at Mac's and would come here again. I also love its convenient location near Changing Hands Bookstore. What could be better?If you are going to the Phoenix/Scottsdale area and are going to be out and about (meaning you are not going for golf and spas) this is a great choice.  It has a great location in Scottsdale, a block from Old Towne Scottsdale and a short drive from the Fashion Square, other great restaurants, Phoenix and Tempe. We did have some troubles with check in- we arrived around noon on a flight from Boston very tired and in need of a good nap.  They informed us that they had not even one open room to let us into which, after a quick glance around the lobby, we didn't really believe.  We waited 10 minutes in the very nice lobby and they magically found us a room!

The rooms themselves are new and quite nice with separate sitting and sleeping areas.  There is a huge flat screen tv that straddles the two sides of the room so you can swivel it in the direction it needs to be swiveled in.  

There is a club right next door but we went chose to go to a different place.  The hotel has a shuttle that they run to the local area so check to see if its going where you want to go.  (Provided you don't want to drive)I spent 1 week in Scottsdale for the San Francisco Giants Fantasy Camp and we stayed at the Hyatt.  Nice amenities and the service was spot on.  We didn't have a lot of requests, but it was nice to have free internet, continental breakfast in the morning, and comfy beds.  The layout of the rooms are a bit weird because the flat screen TV is in an odd place but other than that, had a great experience.  One of the employees mentioned that the quiet area is to the left.  On the right, there are a few nightclubs and if you are looking for peace and quiet, you won't find that in your room on that side.First off, I have to admit most of the times I have been here is on First Fridays, which is why it gets four stars. Not that it is their fault that it is so ridiculously crowded that you can hardly walk through the place and not be in someones way, but, maybe they could make it more accommodating.
If I could enjoy their drinks and food without having to worm my way through way too many people and stalk a table or counter or any place to sit and enjoy my food, it would be perfect.
The ambiance is nice, a little dark, hardwood floors, the refurbished house is hip and well-done. Music is piped into every room and the volume is just a little too high. There is a wooden deck out back if you want to smoke.
The beer and wine list is great. I have yet to have something I didn't like. The micro-brew and local beers are rich and tasty, served ice cold. The food is absolutely amazing, possibly the best grilled cheese and tomato soup on the planet and the honeymooner is incredible, as is the cheese plate.
So if you don' mind being elbow to elbow with the psuedo-hip artsy fartsy new bohemians, The Roosevelt is well worth it. Better yet, go on an off day, like a Tuesday for better luck. The beer, wine and food will not disappoint.Don't go on 1st Friday unless you want it to be super crowded!  Hipster vibe with good food and drinks on tap.  Slightly uptight staff.  No hard booze though.  Seating encourages canoodling couples or mixing with strangers.  Try the grilled cheese and tomato soup.  I know, it's expensive, but so yummy!  They have a pasta special, but I can' remember if it is on Wed or Thurs.  Come early, as they sell out.I'm a huge fan of French macaroons and was so excited when I found Essence Bakery!  I was craving the lemon macaroons I normally get when I lived in L.A. and had despaired of finding a bakery in Phoenix that offers these treats.  

I've only tried Essence's macaroons and eclairs, so can't attest to their other menu items.  However, their macaroons are TO-DIE-FOR!  (see pics)

Although a bit pricey at $3.25 each (large), I feel the price is worth it as the baking process is a bit complex.  I've tried all the flavors (French chocolate, caramel cream, espresso, raspberry, pumpkin spice, and lemon) and must say my favorites are the the espresso and caramel cream.  The fillings are a bit on the too sweet side, so I usually scrape a bit off.

The macaroons are made up rich and creamy filling sandwiched between dense and chewy almond paste cookies.  Don't mistake these for the coconut-flake based macaroons...not the same thing!  

The place is small and seating each time I went was full, but I normally just order to go anyway.  It sucks that Essence Bakery is only open until 3pm Mon-Sat, but maybe it's a blessing in disguise as too much of a good thing will ruin my womanly figure.  ;-P

If you're craving French macaroons and Essence happens to be closed, Trader Joes have mini-macaroons in their frozen food aisle...theirs is also good!

If you want a coffee fix, Starbucks is in the same lot...and there's a drive-thru!Great local cafe, their eggs are always cooked to perfection and the staff is always friendlyDelicious find in what looks like a chain.We visited two nights in a row on our recent trip to the Boulders Resort. The first night we sat on the outdoor patio and enjoyed margaritas with chips and salsa. The cactus heart cocktail is delicious, and the alcohol content is perfect- not too weak, not too boozy. Both nights I ordered the signature shrimp tacos because they were so yummy. The second night we also shared a bowl of the tortilla soup, delicious with greens and tortilla strips.

The decor inside is fun and festive, with pretty light fixtures and wall hangings. Service is friendly and timely.Even though this place is a good 20 minute drive from downtown Scottsdale, it's well worth it once you get there.  My wife and I dined there last year while in town for a wedding at the nearby Boulders resort (Excellent btw).  After one trip to Spotted Donkey, we were already planning our next trip back to Scottsdale just to go back.  Well, the golf and spa were other factors but I will travel for good food.  So our next trip was about a month ago and our two visits did not disappoint.

Be sure to try the guacamole.  Although it's $10.50, it's really good.  HINT: order it without one of the ingredients like onions and they will make a fresh batch.  The second time we went, we forgot to order it without onions and it didn't taste as good.  My favorite dish is the pork tenderloin, which is served over a bed of mac and cheeese and green chiles.  It's delicious and large enough for two meals.  

Even if you think it's too far to drive for dinner, the beautiful town of Carefree will give you that Arizona experience you know you want and get you away from the urban feel of Scottsdale.Finally decided to check this place out a few days ago, and what a pleasant surprise!  I NEVER go out for Italian food because A) I'm Italian and prefer my Italian food the way I prepare it and B) lived in Italy for several years and usually find myself disappointed. Now I won't say that the meal we had was comparable to anything I was used to in Italy, but the food was good. 

We split the Calamari Fritti and the Gnocchi with Pesto Cream Sauce. The Calamari was cooked to perfection, and the batter nice and thin (the way it's SUPPOSED to be). the Gnocchi was more dense than it's supposed to be, which makes it gummy. The sauce was good though, I'll just order something else nexxt time. 

They have a pretty good wine menu, and I was able to sit and have a glass in the bar while I was waiting for my takeout. Overall what a cool little spot, glad to have an Italian spot to eat here in Cen Phowent for brunch on saturday morning. the place looks cool, it's clean and well-decorated. good service, never in need of a mimosa refill, she was right on top of it.

the crab and shrimp were rockin, the prime rib excellent, the gyro delicious, omelette lovely, good lox, really good pizza for a buffet....

and lots and lots more food that i couldn't possibly try all of. sushi not so good, some at the table weren't thrilled with the mexican selections... but i don't think i've ever seen a good taco bar at a vegas buffet, nor had good sushi, so it's to be expected methinks.

all in all, all good. maybe not as good as the rio buffet.To review Las Vegas buffets I've broken it down into 4 sections.

Appetizers:
Nice selection.  Cravings claim to fame is their new sections of global cuisine.  You can have some nice appetizers to entrees from each section. 

Salads:
Very nice salad section.  They will make custom salads to your order.

Main Entree:
They have many worldly selections representing from China, Mexico, Japan, Italy and more..   Some are better than others but the variety is good and quality is above average. 

Desserts:
Since Cravings breaks everything out into their own sections, they have a decent dessert section as well.  Most are mass manufactured goods and some are custom, like the gelato.

I was torn to give them 3.5 or 4 stars, but decided to round it off to 4 stars since they deserve something better than a 3.  So if you have any "Cravings" for worldly cuisine, this is a good place to go.


Decor: 4 Stars (its been refreshed since the original opening)
Service: 3 Stars (decent staff)
Atmosphere: 3 Stars (its okay)
Food Quality: 4 Stars (good quality)
Quantity of Food: 5 Stars (its all you can eat)
Price: 4 Stars (almost worth the high price)

For a Grand Total of 4 Stars.CRAVINGS BUFFET
This is a decent buffet in the Mirage at Las Vegas. It's definitely improved over the years. I recall going there as a kid in the early 90's, where I met tennis star, Michael Chang, and got his autograph. Wide variety of foods here, but fast forward to 2008 and beyond, where the Cravings Buffet has expanded and vastly improved. There is quite an international feel to the buffet, ranging from Americano to Mexicano to Asian (Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese). Lots of cut meats to choose from and plenty of soups to try! Desserts included cakes, tarts, bread pudding, and a gelato bar! Drinks are free, so drink up if you're into fruit juices: orange, cranberry, apple, etc. Service was great too, as they servers regularly cleaned our tables and refilled our drinks. The food is arrayed around the the dining area in a wide circular arc, making you walk a bit to find your favorite foods (a little exercise within the buffet compound). Not a bad buffet in Las Vegas. Not the best, but hey, it's not Bellagio!Solid buffet. As my usual at a buffet, I was looking for prime rib and shrimp and got both. Crab legs were a great bonus. The sushi rolls were "meh." Lots of good choices and I never got anything that did not taste good. Would go back for sure.Really great buffet!

Of course there were some things that weren't as good as others - like the Mac N Cheese: my husband and I both thought it looked way better than it was. It just was too watered down and didn't taste like much of anything even though it looked very cheesy and yum.

Everything else was pretty fantastic that we tried-- prime rib was AMAZING. First cut we had was medium, and it was good but not what we were craving. Then they brought out a more rare cut and it was SO good. You know it's good prime rib though when even the more cooked pieces are still flavorful and easy to chew. 

The sushi was yummy as were the soups- the wonton soup was probably our favorite but the scallop chowder was great. The pizza was pretty good as well and the crab legs and shrimp were on point.

The dessert was fantastic!!! Almost didn't have room for it. The chocolate gelato was yummy as well as the creme brûlée-- I mean really all of the dessert we had as absolutely delicious.  

For $37 a person on Memorial Day weekend AND FREE HOUSE WINE AND BEER!!!!

It was a GREAT deal!A lounge in Vegas dedicated to the psychedelic music of the Beatles? No thanks. Free vodka drinks for ladies 10-12am. Uh...sure!! I'm Chinese, I can't turn down free!!

Don't get me wrong I'm no Beatles hater, but having to listen to 'Yellow Submarine' and 'I Wanna Hold Your Hand' sounded like less than party-hyphy-fun on a Friday night on my sister's Bachelorette weekend in Vegas. But boy, was I wrong!

The front of the lounge accommodated a mini "pre"-lounge complete with a full bar and humongous neon pink letters spelling 'Revolution' in which you could actually sit in, I nested on the 'o'. Very comfy. I was actually not aware of the real lounge till about 20 minutes after I arrived. When people started sifting in and out of a doorway to the left of the bar I started to think the party existed in there. I was right...so the rest of the dopey Bachelorette party I was with trudged through the doorway to discover a way bigger lounge with a way bigger full bar, a dance floor and a DJ.

When we got there at 10:30, the joint was not crowded, but it was packed by 11pm. The walls projected images of walking, silhouetted hands with faces traipsing about the club amongst cartoon flowers and trippy, spinning swirls. Go-go dancers in skin baring ultra-minis and bikini tops danced on the table and bar tops. The music was very good; mixing in a huge serving of modern hits, several tablespoons of  Michael Jackson, a shot of Soft Cell (...tainted love...), a wisp of Journey and half a dash of Beatles songs. 

The drinks were a bit weak and smiley cocktail waitresses kept hocking these sugary-sweet lemon drop shots that were pretty worthless with alcohol content - but they were free so my gratitude keeps me from griping too much. All in all, I loved the diverse, laid back crowd and the hybrid club-lounge vibe.

The next time I'm Vegas, even if they're not offering free drinks, I'm there...because this place is groovy, baby! (Trite, I know, but I couldn't help myself.)Very good steak - nicely seasoned ribeye and cooked perfectly medium rare.  

The service was interesting.  As mentioned in a previous review, they try hard.  But there is something just not right - the service felt too coached.  It was if the waiter was just regurgitating perfectly scripted lines.  However I felt like he really didn't care.  

Very swanky decor - especially for Madison.  Prices were high - glad I was not paying!

My 4 star rating is based solely on the quality of my steak.4 stars based on value, otherwise probably closer to 3 stars. First off, get the drink ticket special everyone's talking about. At first I listened to other Yelpers and tried looking for someone handing them out, but didn't have any luck. Then I went to the theater and simply asked an attendant there if he knew about them and he directed to the casino cashier, where I found them sitting on the counter. Ended up about $13/pp after taxes and that includes an alcoholic (or not) drink. Awesome value for an hour of entertainment, especially in Vegas. Also, this may just be a temporary offer, but Mac King was telling us at the end of his show that the show tickets offered free admission to a show at the Flamingo called Battle of the Dance as well. We didn't take advantage of that offer, but what a deal. 

Anyway, onto the show. As long as you know you're not getting into a big budget epileptic light show production with scantily clad assistants, I think you will enjoy the show. It's small stage, no soundtrack or real sound effects, and the magic tricks are fairly low tech (ropes, cards, sleight of hand appear/disappear, etc...). However, Mac King is pretty funny, has a great attitude and does the tricks well. If you don't enjoy magic, this probably isn't going to change your mind. But the show keeps up the pace with magic one after another for the full hour. I don't know what the normal crowd is usually like, but that day probably only a third of the theater was filled, so it doesn't have the energy of a full crowd, but at the same time it didn't detract from Mac King's performance at all. This is probably one of the best values in entertainment in Las Vegas (if you go the discount route). This may be good or bad for you too, but the shows are at 1 and 3pm in the afternoon, so it doesn't interfere with other nightly activities.Hilarious.  Great slight of hand magic and he is very funny and great magician.The Beauty Bar is located in the new art bar district of downtown Las Vegas. That area is kind of an anomaly to me. I mean, its the old school Strip. Before The Bellagio and Ceasar's, it was Fremont and The Nugget. Its still a really touristy area. But then there are little gems more east on Fremont like the Beauty Bar, The Griffin, and The Downtown Cocktail Lounge. As Bf says, its "culturally away from casino culture." It gives me hope for this city. Keep your eyes peeled for some galleries opening up in that area. 

This Beauty Bar is part of the same conglomo in LA, SF, NY, SD, and Austin. I think its the closest thing to LA grunge-hip we've got here. 

For dudes, wear skin tight jeans. Ladies, pick up something from the Buffalo Exchange. Tattoos and piercings are encouraged. Be prepared to dance like a funky robot. I love it. 

I've only been to La Salon de Beauty on First Fridays. I have to get there early (like 10p) and get my drinks. Otherwise it gets so crowded. I seriously contemplated elbowing a guy in the throat at the bar one night because he was being a moron. I hate you, morons. 

There are two music sections. Inside there's an electro-clash DJ and outside there's a funky funk DJ who attracts the funkiest break dancers. Its funky. I like the inside and outside. I can never pick. 

On other nights, they have live bands in the back yard. Go down and support up and coming artists, indie, and unsigned bands. 

Drinks aren't badly overpriced for a night club in Vegas. $5 for a Stella? 

Ladies, forget about using the bathroom after midnight. 

Park in the big red garage, east of Fitzgerald's. We average $5 on parking. 

Cover is $5 for local ladies and $10 for local boys. 

* off the strip, non-casino3.5 stars.  Very nice "upper-crust" Italian place.  Pastas were typically $12-15 and Special entrees were typically $15-$30.  I visited on a Thursday night, no waiting, and few people there.  Very nice, comfy decor with red velvet drapes, dim lighting, white table-cloths, and picasso-like paintings all around.  Service was ok...the water-boy was good, but the waiter sporadically came by my table...always a bit late, and two waiters actually waited on me.  The menu had too much cream and pink sauce for me.   No whole wheat pastas.  One waiter actually helped me design my own meal which was nice.  I asked for a small side of arrabbiata  sauce expecting a hot red sauce, but made a cheesy, creamy mushroom sauce for me instead.  The complimentary bread was a bit stale and came with a cheesy stiff buttery kinda sauce...I had to ask for olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  They have a dining room and a separate lounge with a live jazzy band.  I think there's a private conference room too.T-bones is one of the many steak house that Station Casino has to offer. I would probably have to rank this up there with the best. 

Located at Red Rock Station Casinos off Charleston and 215. It may be a long drive but well worth the view. Red Rock itself is a very nice place, but focusing on T-bones, the restaurant is amazing on its own. The place was very roomy and very well decorated. Got lots of room to move around, and nice seating arrangements. Not to crowded is how I like it. 

Arriving to T-bones, we're greeted by the receptionist who checked us in and our Host Dave was nice enough to direct us to our booth. He helped us be seated. He was very informative and entertaining as well. A few seconds later we were greeted by Ricardo, who offered to get us some drinks. Shortly afterward we were greeted by Darlene, who took our order. They were all very informative and entertaining as well. This being our first time at the restaurant, Darlene gave us a lot of inside scoop on what they have regarding the view of the pool, to what they do at catering parties and holidays. Over all, the staff was very excellent on helping us out. One thing that did get to me is the refills on drinks, was a bit on the slow side. Then again, I understand it was beginning of the dinner rush, so they got busy in the end of our visit. 

The food itself, was amazing. The wife and I got Fillet Mignon, she got the 8 ounce and I got the 12 ounce, both medium.  We also got the shrimp for starters, then sweet potato fries and macaroni for our sides.  The presentation was very well done, and taste was really great.  The Fillet Mignon itself was very well cooked just the way I like it.  I understand others may not get their food prepared the way they want. But I for one, like the way it was cooked and presented.  

Dessert, I had the Fried Oreo, which was very good and tasty.  It had ice cream on the side, so it made it more wonderful to eat.  The wife had a banana split, and to be honest, its like any other banana split out there, but very good.  

Over all, I really did enjoy myself and highly recommended when looking for a steakhouse.  The pricing might be up there, I would probably say 60-80 bucks per person.  But I believe its well worth it.  The view of the restaurant, and Red Rock itself.  With the informative waiters and the energy they bring.  To the presentation of your food and the quality of it.  I believe its very well priced.Love the decor. Happy Hour was not crowded on the Monday I went at 5. The bar started filling up shortly after 5. A side note on happy hour- it started out with awesome deals such as $5 speciality cocktails and food. Now the menu includes no $5 speciality cocktails but $5 beer, including a 22 oz. Arrogant Bastard. Deal!
The least expensive food item is the $6 chicken and waffles. It's a really yummy dish and the only happy hour food I've had here. 
I used a $5 off any Stations restaurant coupon from the paycheck promo. It took them a while to take the $5 off my bill. Typical!This place has a fun atmosphere with a variety of people for those of us who enjoy people watching.  More of a lounge feel.  It was happy hour and busy so we went to the bar for a drink, standing, but immediately got an outside patio table.  The patio is nice, the misters felt great.  The bottled beer was nice and cold but my friend thought the tap beer was not nearly cold enough. We switched to wine and others were having wine as well.  The wines by the glass had a nice variety of choices.  We tried a few and liked them all.  The trio of sliders were cooked perfectly, nice toppings, good bread.  The shoestring fries needed some flavor.  I love the style of fries but the cajun spice was flavorless.  A little salt and pepper and we were good.  The smoked salmon was very good - capers, red onion, greens, toast, etc.  I didn't have any artichoke dip but the others really liked it.  Overall, a fun place to hang out and have a drink.  Nice atmosphere and popular.  Go there, you'll like it.We ate dinner here New Year's Eve with a small group and I was excited after hearing such good things. It was around 7pm but we didn't have to wait for a booth at all which made me happy! Our waitress came out and was a bit quiet and somber, maybe she wasn't happy about working that night I don't know. I liked the inside of the place, I'm not sure if they usually keep it that dark there or if it was just for the occasion, I didn't mind at all but I know some people like normal lighting at least to read their menu. They had a bunch of balloons hanging everywhere which I thought was cute.

We started with the chicken nacho appetizer to share and it wasn't my favorite. The chicken wasn't bite size, more like two inch shredded strips and some ends were very tough. The tortilla chips were super salty and thin so the ones under any toppings got soggy fast. The flavor of the whole thing was nice overall but needs some work in the details.

I ordered the turkey sandwich with sweet potato fries and I was just a tiny bit sad I couldn't get a side of the mac and cheese for an upcharge! My boyfriend got the carne asada dish that also sounded tasty.

Throughout the night we had maybe three or four men and women come to the table bringing food, drinks, refills, etc. Our actual waitress I think came three times total. I don't like this style of dining especially when the waiter or waitress doesn't even try to make an effort of being friendly or happy to serve you. Some of the gentleman bringing refills were smiling at us more than she was, and they weren't even getting tipped. This is where they lost a star from me. 

But, it would have been 5 stars because the food was awesome. My sandwich was probably the best I've ever had. The pretzel roll was soft and slightly chewy, the cranberry chutney bursting with flavor, and the coleslaw was tangy and really brought the whole thing together. The turkey was good but hard to mess up as long as it's not taken out of a plastic grocery package. I don't remember what type of cheese was used but it was also great. I had to take half of it home and even cold the next day as leftovers it was still delicious. 

The sweet potato fries were pretty good as well, hard to care about with such a great sandwich. I tried my boyfriend's carne asada dish and I liked it, there was too much tomato in my opinion and it gave it a steak and spaghetti type of flavor.

After dinner we ventured outside to take a peak at the patio. I loved everything about it, and the cat sleeping quietly on a couch cushion under the heat lamp even with all the party commotion going on was such a sweet sight. I would love to come back in the Spring maybe near sunset and have some cocktails outside.Put on your shiniest shirt, spiffiest shoes and get ready to shell out the bones if you're headed to N9NE.  I think this steakhouse is quite good and found my fillet to be delicious.  I had lobster as well, but it was more like a sliver of lobster...better yet, a sliver of a memory of a lobster that once existed during a prehistoric era.  Welcome to fine dining!

The decor is more like a club where cocaine suppliers hold high level meetings with their dealers while professional athletes attempt to outdo each other and win over the airhead of the night by seeing who can order the most bottles of Cristal.  Actually, that's exactly what this place is!

This place is fun, but at the same time, it's quite possibly the most fake setting I've been in since my short stint on TV news.  Seriously, I've never been in a movie or on the set of one, but I can at least say that I've eaten at N9NE.

Food good.

Pompousness bad.I really enjoyed the N9NE steakhouse at the Palms! The ambiance was very trendy (more like a club setting) with a caviar/champagne bar, private dining room, and a bar/lounge. Bachelor and bachlorette parties were thrown the night I was there, so you may want to consider having a private party there. The waiter we had was very attentive. I ordered their surf and turf, and it was delicious! Many of the items on their menu could be very pricey. Also, please be wary that you should get your steaks a litlte bit more rare than you're used to. Don't try to get it well-done if you like your steaks that way. Your steak might end up being very dry. 

It is one of the better steakhouses I've been to in Vegas. Go try it for yourself!Jackrabbit was the perfect place to host tryouts for the Lingerie Bowl last Saturday.  My first time in there, my 20 closest friends and I had a great time until it got so ridiculously, insanely packed.  ASU is now back in session so I'm thinking thats why literally ever bar I set foot in that night was a madhouse.  But if Jackrabbit is always this full, I dont see myself going back.  

Drinks seemed par for Scottsdale ($10+ each), as was the bar in general.  Set up a lot like PCL, its basically a big room where everyone stands around playing grab-ass with flirty co-eds.  Want to pick the people who grab your ass?  Opt for one of the VIP booths on the sides of the dance floor and you'll feel less like youre in a meat market.  But not entirely.

Cover was a pricey $20 for guys the night I went and ladies are free always I believe.  The burlesque dancers every hour were a night change from the amatures on platforms at Devils or the go-go girls at Axis.Service impeccable, staff very friendly, everything you would expect from a 5 star except.... the gym.  I'm sure most peeps could care less but the equipment is so outdated it's really a shame. The cardio equipment is from at least 10 years ago and the weight machines don't all work. Other then that it's an amazing place with 5 pools and several outstanding restaurants.  Extremely family friendly, kids have their own check in where they get to pick out a stuffed animal, the kids pool with the two slides is awesome, therE is water around every corner to keep hydrated in this100+ degrees weather. I would give it 4.5 stars if possible but it's not!The scenery was so romantic. The booth we got was cozy. The food was delicious. I wouldn't recommend any sushi though because it was too expensive for the amount and the quality you get. But their food was great. We got the chicken robata, which is grilled on a skewer, and it was yummy. Their crab cakes were so tender & tasty. We ordered ahi tuna & the salmon for our entrees. Both were delectable. We shared a pumpkin cheesecake dessert. It was the perfect finish to a fantastic meal.The Rock was a hit.  Cooking your own NY strips on a hot rock.  Yum!  The seasoning was a little too salty but good.  

The sushi rolls, the lobster roll, and the beef sliders were all good picks.It ain't fast.....but if you aren't in a hurry (as in you aren't trying to get from Fremont Street to Manadalay Bay in under 50 minutes to get the last shuttle to your hotel located in BFE so that you don't have to shell out yet another $30 for cab fare but the Deuce is so slow you arrive with 2 minutes to go and have to race down the street in 4 inch heels knocking fanny-pack wearing grandmas carrying 3-foot tall margaritas out of your way in order to make it just as the shuttle is pulling away) then it's great. 

$2 one way, $5 all day, takes about an hour to get from one end of the strip to Fremont Street in even the slightest bit of traffic. The people can be crazy, it makes a lot of stops and there is a great chance you will have the best bus driver ever, who, after yelling at people for infractions like eating, standing before the bus has come to a full and complete stop, and using the wrong door, says something awesome like: 

"Watch your step out there and remember, I care about you!"Consistently great dining. Inventive, seasonal specials with a reliable menu of favorites. I can always count on a great meal, nicely crafted cocktails and desserts worth a splurge. Can we say fresh peach pie??? Table 34's ambience is perfect after a tough day at the office. Soft lighting, smooth service and a nice local crowd. I need to remember this gem on Warm Springs and the 215..I love this perfectly cooked thin pizza.  It's light but has good flavor.  The crust is cooked really well.  The toppings also taste fresh compared to other places.  The price is a bit above average for the amount of food you get, but sometimes it's worth it.  If like pizza, and i fyou're not a fan of  Dominoes, Pizza Hut, Little Caesar's, and etc...  then you probably won't be disappointed by this place.This is a very good neighborhood bar.  Definite Irish feel to it.  The food is decent, and the drinks are great.  It can get pretty crowded on the weekends.  They have a pretty great party on St. Patrick's day, take up the entire parking lot of the shopping mall they are in... pretty good time...$24 steak and lobster special on a quiet night. The lobster tails were delish but the steak was pretty tough.. Even TGI's steak was nicer but for the price of $24 for 2 lobster tails and steak..  you can't really expect a great piece of meat. The service was good. 

It is nicer than it looks on the outside and I saw they do prime rib.. I think we will have to come back another time to try it!  

Just an affordable enjoyable meal out.Scene here echoes forties + version of the 90210 set. Good looking old and new people. Bar scene was a riot for people watching.
Food and service are very solid. Server doesn't even blink to recommend the lobster mash potatoes ($33) or the alaskan crab truffled gnocchi.
Oddly enough everyone ordered their prime steaks in our party and they were good- served a la carte, broiled at extremely high heat to the point that it  actually burned my mouth to eat my ribeye at a perfect med rare.
Giving a star off due to Fleming putting out a better broiled bone in ribeye, 
but overall a really good and interesting dining experience.
Make sure to get a after dinner beverage in their bar and watch how things unravel.I went here on a Saturday evening. What a bad choice. I sat at the bar and oh my goodness!!! What a pick up scene. Marley and band was playing that night. The music was great. The constant Casanovas slithering by was ridiculous. This is a great establishment to take a date to, but single women sitting at the bar beware. 

I had the shrimp martini and the chopped salad which were both very enjoyable. The Ketel One and cran was to my liking.  Not a fan of being picked up on while I eat. But hey, you can't blame a man for trying, right?Salt and pepper wings are f'n amazing. Mahi fish tacos for $2 on Tuesday's are one of the best deals in Scottsdale period. 

The Mexican food was enjoyable as well but I come here for the wings and the tacos.Have been to numerous Las Vegas Wrangler hockey games as well as other events at the Orleans Arena. I'll cut to the chase, the arena would have earned five stars, but the box office is at the front of the Orleans Hotel and is no where near where it should be. Other than that, this arena has super comfortable, larger than normal seats. On my last visit to a Wranglers game, there is a new system where you can order food at your seat and it will be delivered to you.

I have been to the owners box areas at the top of the arena and the view is still good. They have a separate concession stand setup and entrance. The personal escort to the seating area is a good plus and they have been friendly each time.

Exiting the arena is always easy and there is plenty of parking. I'll definitely be returning to see future events at the Orleans Arena.I've been here twice, and it has such a sleek look and great lighting that it's kind of impressive at first glance.

Great waiters and a very nice selection of specialty dishes and Sushi ( Ngiri and Roll ) My favorite was the Tuna Poki salad.  Tuna Poki is always a ME pleaser.  If you've never had it....it's chunks of Tuna Sashimi served on top of seaweed, usually in a sesame or ponzu dressing.  I do like it best when it's served the way they do it at Fukuda which is a salad style. Yum-eeeee!

It also has a Teppanyaki grill which makes it more of a family atmosphere.  So, not a recommendation for a quiet date night, but swell for a group of friends and maybe first time sushi eaters.Michael Mina has exploded.  Before you know it, he is going to have a restaurant in every major city in the country.  I've eating at several of his other restaurants so I had a good idea of what to expect.  However, this was the first time I've visited his steakhouses.  From a culinary aspect, I've always enjoyed his food.  However, the price you pay for his work tends to eclipse a reasonable number.  I've always left his place enjoying the food but never wanting to go back because I feel like it cost a little more than its worth.  The amount of add-ons you get exceed reasonable.  With that being said, having an expensive restaurant in Vegas is the norm and almost should be expected.  So, with that in mind, my concerns with cost went out the door and that left my taste buds to enjoy every savory bite.  

At a steakhouse, its a standard that I get the bone-in rib eye.  We went to StripSteak on a Thursday night and they sat us close to 11pm, which was great (we arrived at 9:45pm).  I ordered the American Kobe Tartare and it was delicious.  Very flavorful, not to overwhelming and the steak just melted in your mouth.  An excellent appetizer that was prepared table side.  The steak I ordered was medium-rare and it was spot on.  The thickness of the cut is slightly smaller than say a rib eye cut at Delmonico's.  So the edges of the cut were closer to medium than the center which was closer to medium-rare.  The tenderness of the steak was excellent.  An excellent steak that was grilled perfectly.  

A steakhouse should be able to make great steak.  That is the norm.  To make great appetizers at a steakhouse, that isn't necessarily a given.  I think one of the best steakhouses for appetizers and "other" parts of the meal I've experienced was at David Burke's Primehouse in Chicago.  At that steakhouse, it is more than just the steak.  StripSteak is pretty close but still a distant second to David Burke's.  The thing that separates this steakhouse and makes it a four-star on yelp is the scotch selection.  The selection of scotch is extensive and is well worth the visit for any aficionado.  On this night, I visited with a friend that knew scotch more than me and he was surprised at the selection.  

Lastly, this is one of the few steakhouses on the strip that actually serves true Japanese A5 wagyu.  They have two choices, filet and ribeye.  Both Bradley Ogden's in Caesar's Palace and SW steakhouse in the Wynn have a version of the filet and CUT in the Palazzo actually has two choices as well (filet and ribeye).  So this is one of the few amongst many traditional steakhouses.  It does provide more options.

Cons: 
The wine selection by the glass was okay at the time of this review (9/13/09-ish).  I was really hoping that they had some really good bold cabs by the glass but everything that I wanted was by the bottle and the bottle selection, although expansive, was expensive.  As usual, the markup on some of these bottles are way too much.  

I've only been here once so far but I look forward to eating here again.  Nice work Michael, now maybe you can fix your original namesake in Union Square---but I digress.So me and the bf checked this out on our recent Vegas trip.  Food was excellent!  The complimentary French fry trio was amazing, each type of French Fry comes with it's own sauce.  The bf had a steak and I had the Salmon.  I don't eat meat but his steak looked pretty good, he certainly seemed to be enjoying it.  My salmon was excellent and the roasted lemon that came with it was perfect to squeeze on the fish.  StripSteak has several side dishes to choose from and we ordered the Mac and Cheese based on our waiters recommendation.  The waiter said this was enough for 2 people, I'd have to say it was enough for at least 4 since we had the fries and entrees.  Dinner was amazing and unfortunatly we skipped dessert.  However we managed to roll back to our room a few places down and recover from our Food Comas.

Also this place is currently has gift certificates on Restaurant.com.  I got a $50 gc a while back when they were doing a 80% off promo and had no problem using this for our meal.Complimentary trio of duck fat fries (delicious!)
Filet (kobe) tartare with flatbread (awesome!)
Kobe burger with fries (good)
Kobe filet with a few veggies and side of potato-scallion cakes (so so)
Creme brûlée beignets (good)This place is kinda like a cross between Hooters and The Library, only with better food.  The servers are 9 times out of 10 very attractive, friendly, and attentive, plus only wearing little short skirts and skimpy tops.  Plenty of beer choices, and lots of options for food that are quite good.  I'm a big nacho fan, and these do not disappoint.  Their buffalo chicken wrap is a solid choice as well.  This place gets pretty crowded at lunch times and can get packed after work as well.  They have plenty of big screen TVs for watching the game, and a very large covered  patio area as well.  Aside from the servers, this place is pretty much a sausage fest (just full of dudes), so if you are looking for a place that has girls there too, you might steer clear of here.Great food, strong drinks, good atmosphere and I love the kilt/skirt thing. They are almost school girls outfits. We went at the heart of lunch today and we seated right away. The servers were confused as to whos table it was but "that is cute right" It must be rough being a cute girl. 

We have been to all of the T.K in AZ, they are all consistant and employ good looking and nice waitresses.Look, I understand people being upset because a burrito may cost you $15 or even that Agave's food is a tad more Americanized than the super authentic Mexican food you were expecting but to give them 1 or 2 stars for those reasons alone is quite absurd. 

I've been here twice so far and while I haven't been able to try everything on the menu yet, the few items I have eaten were simply delish! I too was there on Xmas and when I was there it was full of people and they were actually understaffed so service was a little slow but they still managed pretty well - food was on our table within 30 minutes. That just gave me more time to drink some of their swell Tequila offerings. Yes, it's also a fabulous Tequila bar that goes far beyond the standard bottle of Patron. While they do carry around 30 brands of Tequila I wish they would expand this even more to include some boutique brands, some newer brands, and even a few well established brands that they don't carry. That would really complete the full Tequila experience. Some of those brands I mention would be Scorpion Mezcal, El Agave Artesanal, Fina Estampa, 3 Amigos, Nocaut, Crotalo, Fidencio Mezcal, Karma, and Tres Agaves among others. Sorry, I'm a bit of a Tequila snob. 

All in all I've found this to be a great restaurant with good food, drinks, and service but can be a little on the pricey side but definitely worth more than 1 star.Good food... Great service... Small place thoughBig fan of this place! The food it so good and the people who work there are super nice. The Tempe location can get pretty crowded and there aren't that many tables but  still highly recommend it.Competitive prices and prime location. The gas prices are cheap, the pharmacy is nice, and it is easy to get in and out real quick.Came here for my bday dinner and was very pleased.  We had a lot of sushi and it was extremely fresh.  Also dabbled in soy black cod, which was very tender and flaky. The albacore in ponzu was also fantastic.  We could have done without the beef sukiyaki and beef skewers.  This restaurant is about a 10 min. drive from the strip, but it's definitely worth the trip.Great food at off strip location, which can be a nice change of pace.  The space itself is hip, dark and contemporary, with good ambience.

The food was delicious and beautifully presented.  Everyone at the table had the 7 course Omakase, highlights which included a sashimi salad, black cod miso, foie gras with tender wagyu beef, lobster, assorted sushi, and house made soufflé and green tea ice cream.  All the dishes were spot on, super fresh, well sauced.  My only issue was that the portions seemed a bit small, even for a "tasting menu".  Still, was worth the price.  Although for a $30 difference for the 6 course Omakase is probably an even better value at $55.

The service was attentive, friendly and competent.  Would definitely go back, especially compared to some of the Strip's sushi options (and prices).This place was amazing! Great music, open roof, view of the entire strip, plenty of beautiful people. The only downside was the $9 beers and the $20 cover (but you can get into the Playboy Club (boring) and Rain as well), but oh well. It was very worth it. This is a can't miss in vegas.Let me start off by saying that I love sandwiches.  I love the fact that you can take one bite and get a little bit of everything.  Sandwiches provide the perfect bite every time!

'wichcraft does an amazing job of mixing great flavors.  My favorite sandwich is the roasted turkey.  Thick cuts of turkey meat, bacon, avocado and the kicker... carmalized onions.  It is sooooo delicious!!!! Dangit... My mouth is watering...

Anyways, it may be a on the pricey side, but let's face it... Everything is a little pricey in Vegas on the strip.OMG the protien pancakes get 5 stars. They are amazing. I also like that they have healthy menu options and totally sinful menu options too.

The rest of the food is pretty good. 4 stars.A sign of a good breakfast joint is a long wait to sit down. This place is pretty standard and basic - giant lofty room with wooden benches, glass plates, cheap flatware, chipped coffee mugs and your own coffee themos carafe to pour your own coffee. This place is standard and generic in every way - and that's a good thing. They take a formula that works everywhere and they run with it. 

The food is fantastic - some of the fluffiest scrambled eggs I've ever eaten actually... tasty bacon... yummy protein pancakes. 

The staff is great too - chipper and polite and cute. This place is a well-oiled machine doing one thing very well. The prices are pretty reasonable and even though we were 7th down on the list to wait - we were told it would only be 10 minutes and it was. Efficient, tasty, and reliable.

As a side note - perhaps one of the best parts about this place is that it's not the Breakfast Club and you don't have to look like you just went to the club... non-pretentious breakfast. Yum.You will walk away stuffed.  And since the food tastes pretty darn good, it'll make sense as you drive away barely able to breathe.

I have never seen so many egg-based dishes.  There must be something like 3,000 to the 8th power dishes to choose from.

Service is very friendly and responsive.  I wish there was a U.S. Egg in the bay area...oh man, that protein pancake is ah-mazing...i am not huge on pancakes in general, nor sweet items for breakfast, but this dish I would gladly order again and again.  it's perfectly balanced and delicious.

the group shared a protein pancake bc apparently we haven't lived if we do not know it's greatness...SO glad we got one.  in addition to trying the pancake, we all ordered regular/traditional breakfast food.  i had the california benedict, and it was pretty average/standard.  

definitely give the protein pancake a whirl if you're curious... i am going to attempt to recreate those pancakes for sure.  fellow Yelpers, any tips/recipes are welcome!This has become a favorite breakfast place of our little hiking group and my very good friend after yoga..=)

US Egg has always been our number one choice to have good breakfast especially after a good workout when your body just needs more fuel for energy. This place has always people waiting outside for tables because it's always packed..which is a good sign especially for first timers that the food most especially is worth waiting for..=) 
My good friend and I, more often than not, always get our breakfast fix here with the good old American pancakes, well protein ones for my friend, crisp bacons, eggs, crispy hash brown as we like it, coffee and tea, or occasionally some corned beef hash. We also like their most recent addition, the Cornhuskers, consisting of two pancakes, two toasted bread, 2 eggs, 4 bacons, which is big enough for two people! =) Price is great for the amount of food you shell out for..This is our little spot after working out in the morning and we will never get tired of going here. So happy that we have this locally owned restaurant that serves good food! =)Love coming here. The service is always good, the menu has standard and adventurous items and they don't judge you if you're clearly hung over. I'd recommend to friends.Went to Canter's for a simple meal one evening. You order and pay at the front counter and they bring your food out to you. I had a pastrami sandwich combo that came with fries and a soda. The sandwich was piled high with thinly sliced pastrami on nice fresh rye bread. You have your choice of mustard at the table to use along with other condiments. It tasted quite good and I downed every bite of it. The fries that came with were quite thin and piled high on the plate. I usually like nice thick steak fries the best, but these thin ones were some of the best I've ever had. You WILL be full if you clean your plate. My wife had the same combo with corned beef that was pretty tasty too. At $15.50 for a combo I'd say it was a pretty good value for the a big Strip casino too. I'll be back to try some of their other sandwiches.FYI for the women out there working out like me and my new personal training regimen...
Whole Foods has the best selection of Luna protein and nutrition bars.  The protein line is new, and I get the cookie dough!  The nutrition bars - they have like 10+ flavors, everything but chai which surprised me since it is whole foods.  Just really impressed with the selection!!!I have gone here a couple of times in the last few weeks and have to say we had great service each time.  We went for lunch on a Saturday afternoon and they only had one waitress working but she was attentive, personable and our drinks were always full.  

I think the food here is good albeit a dollar or so overpriced.  I have had quite a few items but I can recommend the Red Chili Pork Tacos over everything I have tried so far.  The food is good quality and the salsa is reliably tasty.  These are two requirements for my Mexican dining needs.

Another plus about this place is its sizable patio.  Nothing beats eating outside during our awesome  AZ winter.The food is great and the drinks are strong, two drinks and you are feeling happy.It was actually kind of hard to spot the place at night not a lot of light but there's a big water pot, I believe, outside in front and at the end of the building.  Next to the future Church's Chickens and across the street from Von's.

My picture shows what we ate.  There was actually more food in our plates but before I could snap a shot my parents had already attacked the plates. LOL

Chow Mein with Chicken was OK.  Nothing special but not bad just OK.

Black Bean Shrimp was really good. Sauteed shrimp, onion, baby corn, green bell peppers, mushrooms all in their black been sauce. OOH YEAH!!!

I love curry I'm no expert but the Masaman Curry with pork, potatoes, and coconut milk was very very delicious. I didn't have to pick out partially cooked veggies like another curry place I've been to.

Spicy Egg Plant with Chicken was really good. Lots of large tasty pieces of egg plant and chicken.  Looked the special sauce.

The Po-Tak soup which was some mix of seafood and lemongrass soup was pretty good, a bit pricey $15.95. It was served in a metal container with flames coming out from the center, visually appealing and it also kept the soup hot. There were mussels, mushrooms, and some other seafood pieces.

The only thing I would recommend is not ordering the stuffed chicken wings. For the price $8.95 you get two stuffed chicken wings with some garnish, you could pay the same price for the entire entree dish with rice. The chicken wasn't that good too.

I like all of their decorations throughout the restaurant, very nice. It looked like there was only one small TV and hard to see from the dinning area.

Customer service was good.  Only bad part was that when one of the persons from my party came a few minutes after we sat it took a long time for them to come by. But other then that it was good.Good Thai place. I've had better but this is definitely worth going if you're in the area.We love this place. The staff is usually very friendly and helpful and the sushi is always good. I recommend the "las vegas roll"!!!I lived at DJ's for the entirety of 2005. Seriously.  I was there everyday.  Doc and Mikey are great guys, as are all the other servers. 

They make the drinks strong here. One or two will knock you on your ass. Ask Mikey for "that purple thing" he makes. We called it a 'Grimace'.

It is a good place to meet someone at 1:45 AM.

Once I was there right before they had to 'bomb" the place for roaches, (don't worry they covered all the glasses with a plastic tarp.) 

This is not a place to take a date. This is not a place to grab a bite to eat. You cannot have an intimate conversation. This is a place to get drunk and make out in the ladies room.A group of three of us went on a Wednesday night for the first time.  I ordered the salisbury steak (one of the Wednesday $10 specials) and it was fantastic.  It was thick and juicy and topped with a wonderful mushroom gravy.  The mashed potatoes were homemade and very, very good.  The meal came with the salad bar which was nicely stocked with fresh items.  It wasn't a large salad bar, but it was perfect for a pre-meal salad.

Our waitress was friendly and attentive.  She had a lovely accent (Russian maybe?) and made sure we never ran out of beer.

Overall, it was a fun experience and we'll definitely be going back.Came here for the Indian festival, and it was great to walk around the area. Beautiful place and you can't beat free parking nearby. Definitely would come here again when we're on this side of town.Had the pleasure of coming back this past Friday and I absolutely adore this place. Everything about the  rich decor, music, and art give off a hip, but welcoming vibe. We took some friends there who had only experienced the Vegas dance clubs (aka stand in line for hours and pay too much for crappy drinks) and they also love it. Downtown plays the best house music, and it is definitely where the art of the cocktail and conversation rule.What a gem on Freemont St.  I honestly forgot where I was for awhile, and this time not because of the alcohol!

The Griffin is comfortably adorned and reminds me of some combination of a romantic cabin and English pub.  But then there's the jukebox and hipster crowd that brings it all back to Vegas.

My friends and I had no problem finding seats at the bar on a Friday night, ordering drinks, and sitting down by one of the fireplaces.  It wasn't too crowded, which I loved.  While it's very dimly lit in the bar, it creates an intimate atmosphere.

The Moscow mule, vodka & ginger ale & lime, was bomb.  The drink menu looked expansive enough, but I'll have to go back to verify that.  And I will definitely be going back.In my opinion, it's one of the better bars on Fremont St. Good vibes, good people, and good times. Not overly priced like many of the other bars in this town. Decently sized selection of booze. A lot of hipsters. Very similar to their Los Angeles counterpart. 

One of my favorite places to end up at on the weekend.I really like this Einstein's.  Maybe it's because they work inside a hotel, but the staff here is so much more competent than some other locations.  My order is always correct and I never leave disappointed.  The breakfast bagels are good here and are a pretty decent value.  They are pretty consistent here, but sometimes I get a little shafted on the amount of cream cheese I get and sometimes my bagel is less toasted than I think it should be.  Otherwise, great location!After my third visit to Fuego, I am finally writing a review! I was early for my hair appt (Veez, next door) and my stylist was still with her previous client, so I went next door for a happy hour drink.  After perusing the hh menu, I decided on a margarita and the pork nachos. I wasn't hungry, but i am a sucker for pork and nachos... Put em together and seems like a winning combination, right?  Well, it is!! Wow, that pork is so incredibly tasty. It was all I could do not to moan at the bar while I ate them. The chips are good and thick (girth is important ;) ) There was perfect amount of melted cheese, black bean salsa and a nice pile of guacamole on top. I put a serious hurting on them nachos. And my margarita you ask? Fantastic! With salt, on the rocks... Classic. Delish. Perfect accompaniment to the nachos. 

I honestly can't remember what I ate on the two previous visits, as they were sometime last year, but I've not been disappointed in the food. On one visit last year, the service was a little slacking, but not enough to keep me from wanting to go back. I think I'll always plan to be early for hair appts now...Wow, what a turn around this airline has had.  The aircraft are in great shape and they consistently get me where I am headed in a timely manner.

Looking forward to the first class seats on their regional jets (this is a MUCH needed upgrade)

Keep up the good work!Fun, classy local stuff! I was drawn in by the metal sculptures outside, but do not think they were for sale.Wonderful service, excellent food!

I ate here as a business traveller, alone, but instead of being ignored or rushed by the wait staff (a common problem), I had excellent service.   The meal was very well timed, and it was probably the most relaxing enjoyable meal I have had in a while.

I had the Pink Lady apple and fennel salad, and the Kobe beef with chimichurri sauce.   The roasted potatoes were exceptionally crisp and flavorful, and the steak was perfect.    The only low spot of the evening was the cabernet that I had with dinner, which was OK but not worth the $14 per glass.   They should expand their wine list...We just had dinner at Wolfgang Puck's last night and thought their pizza's were outstanding.  Thin crust, great flavors, had both an italian sausage pizza and cheese pizza.  We started with the potato chips drizzled with truffle oil and sprikled with cheese, these are not to be missed it you try this place.

zzbirdLove this place and the late night menu is great and affordable.  One of the best burgers I've ever had at this place plus truffle chips are great.  I've eaten at this place 3-4 times over the past few years and never been disappointed.I really enjoy the Yard House.  Excellent selection of beer to say the least.  Big menu with lots of interesting choices including some great vegetarian selections.  

What I've had so far:

Pear and blue cheese salad - outstanding
Spicy salad - awesome
Veggie burger sliders with Bearnaise to dip them in - delicious
Edamame - great 
Chips and guac - excellent
Grilled artichoke w/fresh made chips - THE BEST!

My husband has tried a few varieties of their boneless wings and he's hooked as well.  Very busy and loud, they crank classic rock and have a million TV's going but it's good for lunch or if you have a group that wants to go out and have a good loud time.  Service can be slow but it's always so jammed I can't really blame them.Good service.  Enjoyed the Jambalaya !What a clean and family friendly casino! There are great food choices, bowling lanes and theater inside of this place too. You can't go wrong coming here to get away from the strip and the crowd. This is definitely a locals spot. Added bonus is $1 beers and $1 hot dogs.Beautiful venue with lots of friendly employees.  The food service while attending a company meeting here was amazing and unusually good for a Casino hotel.

Only things I did not like: the casino floor has a nasty reek of smoke smell.  Really really bad.

Oh, and everywhere you go (with the exception of the convention center and your rooms) they blast music.  And I mean blast it....

The parking lot, check.  They blast it.
The casino floor, check.  They blast the tunes.
The pool, yep, you guessed it.
Elevators, check.
Restrooms, check.

I mean cmon man,  enough with the music already!I love the style anthropologie offers. The dresses and cardigans are the cutest. They even offer a variety of home items that are just as adorable. One downside is the items in this shop are pretty pricey. So if you aren't into paying full price, head straight to the back of the store. Tucked in a back room are all the sale items. If you are wiling to wait, after some time you can probably find that dress you were eyeing for less.2 for 1 drinks! Great service from a very friendly and fun bartender last time we were there! Been here many times before and we'll continue to go back. We like it when school's out so you don't have all the college kids crowded into the place.Yeah... I did it. I was in the Phoenix area and could not resist checking out the Iron Chef competitor and toppled Cat Cora. So with taste buds set for battle and stomach ready to receive I ventured in.

The restaurant is quaint. The waitress was incredibly helpful. I am one of those "tapas" eaters...yup I enjoy a little bite of everything and especially if it comes in the form of outside my comfort zone. Granted, the items on the menue here are fairly standard fair, but done exceptionally well. 

I had the swordfish and beef carpaccio. Both were absolutely excellent. The service was top notch, it did get a bit noises (but the noise was fun energetic chatter...which was nice). Visually the food was average...but probably better than most restaurants. What I apprecaited was visually it was still manageable and you didn't feel as you didn't know what your next step was...take a picture, poke it, smell it...stare at it. 

Anyways, good stuff, I will be back!My dad came to town for a visit and when he's in town I always take the opportunity to try a restaurant usually out of my price range. For this visit I booked a reservation at Tarbell's and was excited to head there for a nice dinner. We were not disappointed! We arrived and were promptly seated. While perusing the menu we each ordered a gin martini; with a twist for me and dirty for my dad. They were both very good, but not outstanding. A group next to us ordered a variety of things on the appetizer menu and made the task of choosing one quite difficult, but we decided to go with the pommes frites. It's probably blasphemy to say that these reminded me of Steak and Shake fries, but they did, only 10x better. Somehow they are able to keep these thin fries piping hot for more than 2 minutes. We also shared the soup of the day, tomato bisque, and the bacon candy salad, both of which were delightful. For our entrees my Dad went with the Scotch beef and I picked salmon. We thought both were good, but the Scotch beef was the winner. For dessert it was again the table next to us who ordered a variety and made it difficult to pick, but we went with the bread pudding. I like bread pudding and this was good, but not great. 

Overall, we enjoyed this dinner very much. It isn't very often that we go all out and indulge ourselves and Tarbell's was a good choice to do so. The service was well-timed and we never felt rushed. The waitress did a good job of checking up, but not being overly attentive. There are quite a few places to spend a nice evening in Phoenix and this is a good choice, but I wouldn't be clamoring to come back, either. I do like that Tarbell's is a nice change of pace from most of the upscale restaurants in town that specialize in steak.For a girl who's trying to maintain her size 4, this place's corned beef hash makes it down right hard.  Their corned beef hash is the best in town.  It's homemade.  Their jams are also homemade and very yummy.  I've been going here for years and the owners are just the sweetest things.  It's a cozy family restaurant and you can taste the love in their corned beef and homemade jams.  

I do agree with some of the other reviewers regarding service.  It's a hit or miss.  It really depends if they are busy or not.  But don't let it discourage you from going.  This is place is a total find.

But if I only had $20 and I had to choose a breakfast spot.... sorry Hash House, I truly like your corned beef hash but that darn Cracked House, um I mean Cracked Eggs wins.This place is kind of foreboding to enter... it just looks like a dimly lit house. But I had heard good things and went a few nights ago and it was adorable! It's like a bar in your living room. They have endless selections of beer and it's a fun environment. I definitely want to go back when there is a show going on as well. My only complaint is that there's no beer on tap!I had to try this place after reading all these fantastic reviews. 

Be sure to make reservations if you are heading there on a weekend, I had 8pm reservations and probably didn't get sat until 8:15pm, but it was well worth wait! 

We started with the sautéed mushrooms, which I could have ordered three more servings off,  they were cooked to perfection and filled with flavor, but not over done garlic flavor that so often ruins sautéed mushrooms. 

We also ordered edamame which is my favorite, but I was quite disappointed here, they tasted stale :O(

For the main course we had Chicken Katsu (white meat), if you haven't had Katsu you haven't lived! Its lightly fried chicken breast served with cabbage, rice and the oh so delicious Katsu sauce. 

The Completely Naked roll (don't quote me on name) was recommended to us by our lively server Wanda as a signature dish. It had spicy kick to it, that kept you wanting more.

Next time I go back I want to try the "Fo Shizzle my Nizzle" appetizer not only because it is fried jalapeños stuffed with cream cheese (yum), but because I love the D-O double G.I love this place! We always bring out of town/state visitors here because the food is great, the people are nice, and since there's a huge vacant lot across the street, there's an awesome view of the strip :) The only complaint I have is the service is kind of slow. Usually at sushi places, we order a couple rolls and if we're still hungry, order a couple more. At this place, we have to order everything at once or we'll be there all night... which isn't always a bad thing! I love the happy hour, some of the rolls are normally $12 but during the happy hour they're $8. The fish tastes fresh, the price is fair, and the selection is varied. There's really something for everyone. I love sushi, and have tried many places around Las Vegas. To me, The Naked Fish is the best fish for your buck!Very tasty food but they changed my all time favorite meat dish ever - the Iskender Doner. Its a good dish now but it used to be superb dish. Dont know what happened. The soup is really good.I finally got a chance to come here! I came with 2 friends and only one of them had ayce sushi with me. The other friend ordered a la carte. 

Upon entry, our waitresses were nice and friendly. It was a good start. Ambiance is nice and quiet, but dark inside. If you're like me and really love to take pictures of food it'll be hard without flash cause it's very dim in here. 

We got served by 3 different servers. The waitress taking our order had issues with her pen not working twice and it felt slow. We were told we were not able to order half rolls unless it's for our last orders. Weird. 

Ice cream is only limited to one kind per person. So if you want both the tempura and mochi ice cream, you can only pick one. :( Sad face here. 

We ended with a waiter named JooSun (spelling?) and he seemed distant/apathetic but he was also nice. He let my a la carte friend get ice cream anyway. He gave me this bonus card when I asked for the stamp cards.. not sure if they have those stamp cards now. I'll find out soon enough. 

All in all, it was a pretty good experience. There was this halibut that I tried which I could not for the life of me finish it nor swallow it. :(

Next time I'm back would most likely be in June for a birthday celebration. I'll update then. :)Gets 4 Stars from me because the staff was super cool & dope! The set up is a little different than the traditional sushi spots, the vibe of the place is laid back, not uptight feeling & comfortable for conversations & sharing sushi rolls. I went during lunch & it wasn't busy, maybe it's a different atmosphere at night or the weekends. I like these types of personally & the atmosphere/ vibe speaks a lot to me. 

The food was good, mussels were on point as I'm a huge fan of mussels from sushi restaurants for some odd reason. We shared about 6 rolls & a few appetizers with green tea and we definitely plan on returning. The staff helped out with any information we has about the rolls which was cool too. I'd recommend this place to a few friends.I would have never discovered this place if it weren't for me going to downtown phoenix ASU.  I absolutely love it and every Wednesday night and Saturday morning, they have the farmers come out and set up in their parking lot.  This store has yummy raw food, great coffee, and groceries that are a must  for my home.  

Their coffee shop has seating and a great ambiance to set up shop with your lab top and/or read.  It is very convenient for students or business professionals. 

I really enjoy shopping there because they have great food but also, I love to support local businesses!!Places like this are why I love living downtown.  The food is great and the staff friendly.  I really like the seating and how it can help bring people together that may not otherwise meet.  

If the food and atmosphere aren't enough you can also come back on Friday for the food trucks or saturday morning for the market.Very good and attentive service here. The dolsot bibimbap and chapchae are tasty, authentic and worth a return visit. Nice complimentary miso soup as well. All in all, as good as it gets.Awesome sushi and great experience. Came here for my birthday with friends. We sat at the sushi bar and Kasper was the best. He was very friendly and explained anything I asked. My food was amazing. 

Service from Kasper was great. Took a while to get drinks, but overall awesome. We will return for sure!!!If I had to choose from every single bar in Surprise (excluding restaurant bars) to just chill out, relax and have a beer or to tear it up on a weekend night, this would be my first pick. Im really on the verge of saying its kind of the dive bar of Surprise. Its nothing fancy, dont expect a bunch of "decor". This is your average simple laid back bar. Ive always liked it here. Good service and good drinks. Horse betting and pool tables. Best choice of music on the juke box. Always a fun crowd. I have nothing bad to say about this place. Always have had Good Times!YUM!  :)
I had their Chocolate Croissant and Chai Tea. Perfect breakfast that was enjoyed watching the gondolas pass on the Venetian canal. 
I didn't have the macaroons or other dessert items because I previously tried them at their NYC location. But next time I am in Vegas, I will come back to taste more yummy treats :)Today, I had the honor of trying the macarons--chocolate and vanilla!! 

First bite of vanilla: chewy and SWEET! 
Second bite of vanilla: mmmm! the outside is crispy and the amount of almond in it is just right.
Third bite of vanilla: i guess the buttercream is a little too much for me.

Onto the chocolate ...  LOVE IT! Definitely not over-the-top sweet like the vanilla flavor.FYE has always had a movie i'm looking for. last semester i had a professor who assigned watching movies as homework, FYE had them all, Blockbuster didn't and you know you arn't going to find 90's movie in a vending machine.I was impressed with the building both inside and out with its nice decor.  We were seated promptly and our waitress was over with menus and took our drink order immediately (and it was relatively busy).  I ordered the spinach enchilada while my wife went with the cheese enchiladas.  The chips were good but the salsa lacked any kick at all but I did like the way they had the salsa in a pitcher and just came around and poured you more when they saw you running low.  The meal was very good and I very rarely eat the rice as I just don't care for it but the rice was very flavorful so that was a nice surprise.  The service though was excellent as they refilled our drinks before we had to ask and were there for the extra napkins I asked for, etc. Often, you order, you get your order and maybe once during your meal you will see your waitress but here, they were very attentive.  I took the one star off for the lack of 'pep' in the salsa although it was good just needed at least a little kick!This place is good.  Try it.Sprouts is a great place to stop in for lunch during the week.  Really affordable sandwiches / wraps and an abundance of nuts / other healthy snack foods available so that you can fill up without feeling lethargic or guilty for the remainder of the work day.  

Generally they have great sales on select produce and for a grocer - they have a fairly impressive beer selection.  They've recently opened another location next to my house, so I do expect to be a regular at both locations in due order.I forgot to review this (but I'm forgetting ALOT of places I've eaten at before I got on Yelping). Been a few times, normally go after work as sometimes I just dont want to deal with Ichiza madness and want a quiet meal. 

Theres some really good stuff here and the staff is sweet. 


Last  few visits- 

okonomiyaki which is one of my fave street snacks is pretty good here and big for the price. Its like a egg pancake filled and theirs has green onion, bacon and shrimps and has a mayo sauce and takoyaki sauce and bonito flakes on it..some places go really crazy but I think I'm glad they went more basic..I've also had takoyaki, but it was a little undercooked in the middle. Have had grilled mackerel and robata skewers and all been very nice. Gotten salty fish fried rice and udon and both were alright. Corn croquettes were good but I burned my tongue! Haha. Gotten a tonkatsu oyako don too...comfort and filling. I love egg on tonkatsu...for a while as a kid I refused to eat nothing but that. 

Service is alright. Most late nights its pretty quiet. They're very sweet, but occasionally takes a while. Still not too shabby. 

Overall though this is a solid little place. Most people dont know its in that little corner, but they should.OK. First...I frickin love peanut butter. Not just because its a tasty treat. Not because the taste stays with you for at least 15 minutes as you lick it off the roof of your mouth. No, I don't even love it because of its special places in American history (George Washington Carver, Jimmy Carter, anyone?)

I love the old PB for one simple reason: It was damned-near my only source of protein for 18 months of my life. Peace Corps taught me that sometimes meat is hard to get, the chickens aren't always laying, and beans aren't always in season. So what was a man to do? Well, after I was tired of chicken feet and beef tripe, I rediscovered peanut butter. It's calorie rich. It travels pretty well. And praise the lord, you don't have to refrigerate it!!!

Pretty soon, I was throwing PB in my rice, and I'll be damned if it wasn't the best ghetto Thai food I've ever tasted. And when I moved to a bigger town, and bought a second-hand fridge, I kept up my peanut butter habit. That habit has stayed with me to this day. While I don't eat rice quite so often anymore, I still like a big glob of PB in my oatmeal.

That being said, PB Loco was to me like an Italian cobbler's shop to a Scottsdale fashionista: so many opportunities for exquisiteness. My GF and I did the sampler and I indulged in three fantastic ways to dress up the old crema de mani. The sandwiches looked so-so, but the sampler was a pretty good way to experience the new wonderfulness. And I even walked away with two jars.

Oh, and the staff was courteous if disinterested. The design was OK; seems more aimed at kiddo's than adults. I'm going to go back for the savory flavors; I think there is some great cooking possibilities in the curry and sun-dried tomato varieties.I like this park. I just played tennis there yesterday with some friends. The courts are very nice. The park is really big for doing just about anything. The grass isnt green everywhere, mostly bron, but that's ok consiering that it's las vegas. And to keep grass green in this town is nearly impossible, especially in such a big park. All in all it's a nice park.Delicious Burgers!!!!

I would totally recommend the Hangover Burger with bacon on a potato bun. It's like a gourmet breakfast burger with the bacon and fried egg... Yumm!!!!

And beer selections are amazing! Tons of beers on tap so you can get just about anything you feel like :)We came here to catch some Spring Training games for our home team, the Oakland A's (vs. Rangers and our other bay area favorite, the Giants). My boyfriend had never been to spring training, or any other stadium other than the d-backs one with me here, and he thought it was great. We got great seats, closer than we could ever sit to see the A's back home for $20, and if you get there early enough, you can catch batting practice and the players are pretty cool about signing autographs for extended periods of time for fans. 

The ballpark has decent priced food, two thumbs up for the footlong hotdog! And the souvenir soda cup is only $5, and there are water fountains around the bathrooms, so you can just get your water there. You can bring food into the ballpark too which is nice. They had a decent selection of beer and bbq area to get a lot of variety of food. It's definitely lacking in shade, so come prepped with a hat and plenty of sunblock because you can heat up pretty quickly just roasting in the sun. 

Parking is great, plenty across the street for only $5. They even have a ramp that goes over the main road for handicap access (closer parking also available for the diabled) so it's really safe and convenient for all the little ones that come to watch baseball. Considering it's the oldest ballpark in the area, it was still in good shape, and watching your favorite team is always an enjoyable pasttime!New favorite salad! I had eaten here once before and I guess I was happy enough to go back a second time. Though the first time was not mind-blowing or anything along those lines, the food was filling and fresh, but it still remained non-drive-thru fast food. Today's evaluation? I had an emotional connection to 'The Tossed Greek'. I think salads are often underrated (most likely due to their common unimpressiveness). That being said, I often do not order salads at restaurants unless I've found a good one- then that's ALL I order. 

Getting to the point, this one had layers of fresh lettuce, feta, tomatoes (halved and sun-dried), pasta salad, onions, chicken, etc. I will definitely be going back to Zoë's kitchen, and probably will not venture too far from this delicious meal.First time I came here for $5 steak and eggs it was bomb. 
2nd time it was good, but the first time was better. 

$5 steak and eggs though. 
Eggs, steak, buttery toast, hash browns, 67 sauce. 

Vegas: Drink, party, clubs...4 AM....Steak and eggs.Another one of Vegas' hidden gems. 

This one is off the Strip inside the Tuscany Suites and Casino on East Flamingo Rd. It's just located around the corner from Ellis Island Hotel & Casino, another gem of a place for good and bargain eats. 

Marilyn's Cafe is open for 24 hours and they have a daily special from 4PM - 10PM ranging in price from $7.99 to $18.99. Check out their menu here: http://www.tuscanylv.com/d/tuscany/media/PDF/marilyn_menu/marilynmenu.pdf

However...there's another special menu from midnight to 5AM. Yes, the special and staple that's ubiquitous of Vegas - The Steak & Eggs. 

How much? $4.99

That's more than a bargain; that's a Willie Mays steal of 2nd base without a throw from the Catcher kind of steal. You get an 8 oz. of juicy, delicious steak and eggs cooked to order. These steaks ain't the cheap kind they serve in Reno for the same price. It's a good-sized piece of steak that's tender, meaty and flavorful. Don't expect a cheap steak for a cheap price, but it was pretty decent quality for the right price. 

They also have an All-You-Can-Eat pancake for $3.99 for their midnight special. I'd have to say that's a lot of carbs for me, but it's there should you get the munchies. 

And I have to add that service was impeccable. I forgot our server's name, but he was a nice gentleman that was well seasoned. By that I mean experience and class. Servers from other fine-dining establishments could learn a thing or two from him. He made us feel at home, comfortable and relaxed. 

So the next time your in Vegas and hungry and starvin' like a broke-ass college student, don't run to the border or any closest fast food joint on every corner. Get some quality instead and your stomach and wallet will thank me for it.I go to this location a few times a week to pick up coffee for my coworkers. I usually have a large order and am in a hurry. The employees here always take care of me. There is almost always a line in the drive thru but I never feel like it takes too long. The employees are super friendly and fast. Watch out for people trying to steal your spot in the drive thru line!I've been to Sushi Ken a countless number of times during the time I've resided in Ahwatukee. It's a great value and an excellent option if you're looking for good Japanese cuisine.

To be honest, I rarely have sushi when I come here -- I usually get one of the Donburi bowls (whether it be chicken, beef, or pork). The rice bowls contain tremendously hearty portions and always fill me up. The food is flavorful and the setting is perfect for a group of people. When I've had sushi here, it's been delicious as well.

If you're looking for a well-rounded meal, I'd recommend Sushi Ken over Mido Sushi, Teharu, and Sushi Eye. This place is great.One of our favorite all-time Italian restaurants bar none. This mafia-chic speakeasy has it all baby; good food, quality service and even a lounge singer who's actually really good. I'm a fan of the piccata, parm and scampi. Hell even the bread is good, perfect for any sauce that happens to still be on your plate. And for the guys, Capo's is a great place to bring a date. No matter what your reason for going is, this restaurant provides a memorable and unique experience you won't forget.my first pick for all first time visitors  to vegasThis is one of those places that when you pull in the parking lot you're thinking, hmmmm.  After we started eating our dogs, we said "glad we found this place".

If I were basing my review on the service alone, it would be 5 stars!  Didn't get the fellas name that served us Saturday evening, but he said he's only worked there three weeks.  He's a keeper!!  Pleasant, efficient and just a really nice guy.

We got two coneys, the kraut dog and chili cheese fries.  The only thing I would change would be to dice the onions smaller.  Kraut dog was delicious.  A tad bit on the pricey side, but from what I understand they fly stuff in from Chicago.  

Definately stop by and try them out, you won't be disappointed.One of the better steakhouses in Vegas.  Prices and quality are comparable to Morton's or Boa.

Had a porterhouse with creamed spinach and mashed potatoes.   I'm a happy camper as long as it's tender, seasoned and somewhat bloody.When Marc invited people to come up on stage to be hypnotized, I asked my date if he was going to do it. His answer was a definite, "NO WAY." If he wasn't going to go up, and if I didn't go up, I probably would have been just as skeptical about the "hypnotized" group. But you get the most of your money when you see people who know personally go up and do out of the ordinary acts of craziness. That's where the real entertainment lies. So if he wasn't going to do it, I was. 

The people who volunteered to get hypnotized were not actors. They were average Joes and Janes just like me who wanted to see what hypnosis was really all about. And despite what some people think, hypnosis not about someone having complete control over your mind and making you unknowingly do things against your will. It's about getting you in such a state of relaxation that you're open to the idea of just about any kind of suggestion because there's no filter in your mind screaming, "It's embarrassing! Don't do it! You'll look like an ass!"

I knew exactly what I was doing, and I did have control over what I could and couldn't do. It's not like Marc could really give me a knife and tell me to stab the person next to me and think it would actually work. But if he did tell me to strut my stuff like a Playboy model in front of a large crowd without being hypnotized, I wouldn't do it... or at least, be awkward and hesitant about doing it instead of smooth and collected like I actually was.

I felt like the audience was miles away. As far as I was concerned, it was just me, Marc, and the others onstage who were also under. I wasn't worried about the silly, harmless things I was doing or who was judging me until Marc sent me back to my seat at the end of the show and I slowly started coming out of that relaxed state of mind. It was definitely a unique, fascinating experience.

A star is missing because the only way you can actually get a five-star experience is if you or someone you know was hypnotized. Otherwise, your money should be put towards a different Vegas show. That, and Marc made me chuckle, but he wasn't particularly ROTFLMAO funny.I have never seen a burlesque show before in Vegas or anywhere really.  So with Crazy Horse Paris, I approached it with no expectations and an open mind.  And in the end, I thought it was great show!

The women here were really beautiful, nicely sculpted, and very talented performers.  I loved how each vignette was produced to look like you were looking at a moving painting with the artistic lighting "painted" onto the ladies.  That was some definite eye-candy. 

Along with the women, they had two side acts as well.  The Popping dancers were really cool and the "Short" Tribute to Michael Jackson was really entertaining.  They were both a nice comedic change of pace from the burlesque dancers

I highly suggest to pick up the $32 tickets at Tix4Tonight to get more bang for your buck.  But if you don't have time to stop by at one, I think it would still be worth the $54 tickets.  If you have about 90 mins to spare in Vegas at night, go see this show!Take into consideration the following:

- I was with children age 7 and 3.  The three YO ate for free.
- I was with my husband and our meals came with our room at the Palm.

The good things I liked about this BREAKFAST (won't be going for dinner or lunch) buffet:

 - the QUALITY of the food was good.  Everything I got was tasty.
- my favorite was the Thai congee.  I know that sounds weird, but I seriously can have congee everyday for breakfast and never tire of it.  I was apprehensive at first, but it was seasoned extremely well, simple, but really delicious.
- wasn't the best omelett station I've seen, but the service was quick and friendly
- our drinks guy was the best.  He quickly served our drinks, filled them up when they were just 1/2 way down, and took away our dishes literally the SECOND we were done.  That's TOP SERVICE.
- it was a clean, non-trendy, not flashy ambiance.  I don't know about you, but when a place start to create too much ambiance, I start to wonder about the food quality.
- they have a good selection of what I call "southern breakfast".  Biscuit and gravy, chicken fried steak and gravy, fritters, home fries with steak, etc.  My husband esp. liked that.
- it's kid-friendly.  How many places can you say that about?  Though our munchkins were the only ones around, they were not shirked at for being loud kids or anything.
- it also has a good selection of "cold stuff": yogurt, granola, lots of fruit (though I only saw maybe 4 different fruits total, they were all naturally ripe and sweet), etc.  So if you're wanting to eat healthy (oh yeah, they had oatmeal and crack of wheat, too), this is a good place to go.

And when you think about it, $9 for all of that is NOT bad at all.  I spend $9 at IHOP or Marie Calendar's and I would NOT get the kind of selection or even quality I experienced here.

I definitely would eat here again for breakfast.Me & my girls purchased a Groupon deal a couple of weeks before our trip so we only had to pay $15/person. I'm not really sure what the regular price is. 

If you get there expect to wait in a line to pay & also to be seated. The buffet is open 4-8pm, I think. We got there at 4:15ish & there was already a line there. They need a bigger waiting area for the people that have already paid & that are waiting to be seated because it was just sooooo cramped by the time we paid. We were combining with line that has yet to pay. 

When we were seated we went for the kill. lol. They have little sections for different types of food, ie: American, Asian, International, Mexican... etc. 

I lose at buffets I only ate one plate & a bowl of miso soup. The miso soup was pretty good but how could you go wrong with miso soup, right? Had their salmon which was yummy! Their egg rolls were alright, my mom's is better. lol. I'm a little biased. 

Their dessert buffet was soooooooooo bomb! I had their:
Mini Chocolate Eclair: YUM!
Mini Banana Cream Cupcake: YUM!
Mini White Chocolate Mousse: YUM!
Mini Creme Brulee: YUM!
Overall, yummyness all around! &&& the plus side is that it's all mini so you don't feel bad for not finishing any desserts. 

I'd recommend it for sure, great selection & it's pretty good.It's been over two years since my initial Boston's review, so I figured it was time for an update. Boston's has been our go-to place to watch Sunday football for the past three football seasons. We always sit at the bar and have gotten to know the bartenders and waitresses that work Sundays. We have also gotten to know the other Sunday regulars. I guess you could say Boston's is our Cheers. Everyone knows our name.

32 oz Bud Lights are now $3 and appetizers are still $5 all day on Sunday (this is also their HH special during the week). Starting this year, doors now open at 10 am on Sundays during the first part of the football season. Of the food I have tried, I recommend the mozzamia, potato skins, baked cheese fries (a new addition to the menu), and Boston's Chicken salad with fried chicken (you can either get grilled or fried chicken). 

Plenty of TVs dot the interior of the space so there is no excuse not to watch your game. In Tempe, I can't think of a better spot to watch sports.You kind of have to go to a buffet while you're in Vegas, right? This one has a fantastic selection at a reasonable price: italian, mexican, asian, cajun, fried things, meat stuff, soups, salad, and an especially impressive dessert variety: ice cream, cakes, pies, danishes, all kinds of stuff! I went at breakfast, so they had breakfast things too like waffles, omeletes, and pancakes. The dishes were hit or miss quality wise, as generally to be expected at a buffet, but the majority of it was quite good, and the beauty of a buffet is that you can try all kinds of stuff and eat more of what you like! I think my favorite dishes were the shrimp/cheese enchilada, churros, mashed potatoes, crabcakes, and apple crumble. And convenient if you're staying in the hotel!This is a very nice bar and restaurant.  Great atmosphere, great beer and some very good dishes.   I once had a fish dinner on a friday night that was very good.  We once ordered burgers to go and those weren't as good as we expected.
I have always had good service here.  Not excellent but good.Aside from Walgreens, ABC Stores is my next go-to spot for stocking up on water and drinks to keep me going on a hot Vegas day.  While not as cheap as Target, it's definitely a whole lot cheaper than pickup up drinks inside the hotels.  Nothing much else to say, but I'm glad it's around so I won't be forced to buy overly expensive drinks at the hotels.  
$4 for a small Gatorade at the hotel?  I think NOT! 
2 large Gatorades for $5 at ABC?  SOLD!!!I really enjoy staying at Caesars but I was really disappointed when we arrived this time for a surprise getaway for my moms birthday and our rooms were in separate towers. Then I ended up having to sleep on a rollaway bed because the 2 queen bed rooms that we were told we were getting were actually sold out. 

I've never experienced this type of problem before. They offered to move us to an upgraded suite for the remainder of the stay and even transferred our luggage for us. The rest of the stay was wonderful. We enjoyed a concert and a full day in their amazing spa. We will definitely return sooner than later.Have never stayed in the hotel, but the casino is large.  The sports book is probably one of the biggest is Vegas.  Good screens.  One of the few places that have a good Keno section.  

Restaurant selection is decent, but for the stature of the property should have more.  Mesa Grill is good, yet last visit was average.

Have never shopped inside the resort where it's mostly lesser known upscale, but the Caesar Forum Shops are wicked.  Almost every store wanted is located here.

Probably the most famous Vegas resort, so always worth the visit.Its tradition that my mom and dad go to Vegas every 6 months to splurge...and just so happens to drag my me with them. With foreign parents, its often difficult for them to communicate to the English Speaking people of "Las Vegas". Guess who serves as the translator?  So, I'll share my insights. They have something called "Diamond in a Day" where if you accumulate around 5,000 tier credit points you get the Diamond Card. Now this is awesome if your cranky and don't want to wait for the taxi or buffet line at the resort (perks of diamond). Its also handy if for some odd reason, such as  you get a hangover and forget your in Vegas and have an insatiable craving to work out, you can get into the Fitness Gym for free (Which is awesome)

Now for the room, we always stay in the Octavius Tower, mind you, is Awesome! The beds are extremely comfy, decor top notch, and you get a nice view of the pool downstairs. I hear the price of the room in Octavius is pretty pricey, but we always get COMPED. 

Other than getting drunk and wasted at the many bars, what else can you do?
The Pools, they have 7 pools which are open during the summer and 1 pool that's open year round. Its Awesome, the water is crystal blue complemented with the authentic roman floor decor and surrounding statues make you really believe that your in ancient Rome. Its a nice temporary escape from the fact that you just lost thousands in the casino. They have nice seats for you to sunbathe and free towel service. The only downside is that the beds surrounding the pool are EXPENSIVE.  

Overall, the hotel itself is top notch. If you're in the Total Rewards program, this is the best hotel that is in the program. So the next time you're deciding to gamble millions, remember to choose Caesars.loved this hotelI really like the inside of Caesar's, I think they have some of the more unusual decorations, The gambling is alright, but tables tend to have high minimums. The hotel was really nice though, they were nice enough to upgrade me to a huge suite with a separate sitting room. The housekeepers were also unusually friendly. Minus one star for wifi not working entire stay.This hotel is one of my favorite hotels I've ever stayed in! The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because they don't let you plug in any video game counsels. The tv has a place where you can plug it in but the input buttons are gone on purpose! So I called the front desk and they said oh sorry, we don't allow anyone to plug anything in our tvs. I bet the only reason is that you can't do that is because they want you to go out to that casino and waste your money! But over All, this hotel is amazing!!Was looking to stay at Caesar's for a while. Got a room in the Augustus Tower, paid $315.00 for 2 nights.
I expected more for the price, the furniture was ok, nothing modern. The tv was small. Don't touch any food items on the counter or fridge or you will be charged for it.
The bathroom is great, jacuzzi tub, used it both days. There was a tv in the bathroom which was pretty nice.
 Great view of the strip.
Complementary slippers, chocolate and water in the evenings.
The location is great, close to everything.The truth about Bare Pool. It's a beautiful place, almost spa-like in appearance, but the music is fun and rowdy -- a good balance of serene and lively. 

They will rummage through your purse/bag at the door before you are allowed to enter, so don't take anything but money, lipgloss and sunscreen. They will remove Advil, a granola bar, and even an empty water bottle. Ask me how I know.

You are allowed to take your camera, but will be instructed not to use it. However, If you google images of "bare pool vegas', you will find it this instruction must not be enforced too strongly. Even took a few myself, but just of my friends, and all tops were on, at least at that time. I tend to think pics are allowed if they are taken discreetly, and only of your party. 

The crowd starts out very docile, sipping, visiting. Maybe just a couple of tops off. As the day progresses, more come off, in a casual 'oh, is it topless o'clock already?' kind of way. Some of what you see -- some of them are big, but more were small. They are all lovely. It's almost surreal, looking around at topless women, visiting with them, and all the while acting like nobody knows we're.all half naked. It's like having a pink elephant in the room. With plump knockers soft pink nipples. And everyone is pretending not to notice.

The service is great, and the music is bumpin', but the bodies better not be. We watched many, so many people get kicked out for public display of affection. Evidently, you can look sexy, and act sexy, but there is absolutely NO CANOODLING. 

Rules are fine, but there were none posted. People were warned for the slightest bit of affection, and removed from the premises after violating the unwritten rules too many times. It's cruel, really, to put all of these beautiful people in a gorgeous tropical environment, fill them with drinks, let the girls take their tops off, and then expect them not to want to cuddle a little. 

So -- my advice: Go, definitely go. Wear sunglasses. Sure, to protect your eyes and to look hot. But mostly, for stealth-staring.  It's a delicious secret-thrill, eye-candy, people watching experience.. Just bring money, and behave. Really. Do not touch. Or you will be made to leave this Eden. And you will be sad. So very sad. Ask me how I know.Great little place.  Fast service and the food wasn't that bad or bland.

Half of the group ordered the $15 special (smaller portions, but there was a salad).  

There was free bread, and lots of it which helped some of us fill up due to the smaller portions, although some were still left hungry.  

Service was fast.  Table for 10 was ready in a minute.Even with just waxing services, I had access to the spa! The access is for use of the Jacuzzi, sauna and lounge areas for relaxation.  You'll also get some complimentary coffee, tea, water and fruit.  It's not a lot, but it is a nice place to go and escape the craziness of the strip and Vegas in general. 

The waxing services was great! They are very gentle and do a good job of preventing irritation and redness. It was pricey, but that's what you get for going to a spa on the strip for just simple waxing.  It's very convenient if you are staying at the Mandalay. 

Remember...you are paying for Ambiance! You get what you pay for at this spa.  This is one of the nicest spas I have ever been to. The decor, the quietness and the zen feeling is amazing here. 

I would gladly come back for a round of pampering....when I have cash to spare.Monkey Pants was really dark, there were sombreros sitting here and there and there was a bulletin board across from where I was sitting covered with Polaroid photos (I assume victors of Burger Nation challenge they have).  The clientele appeared to be local regulars (always a good sign).

This is the only place I have ever been that offers 3 varieties of wings: fried, grilled or blackened.  I tried a hot grilled dozen.  The wings were very tasty but not hot by any means.  I'm not sure if my order was prepared wrong or if the grilling neutralizes the hotness a bit.  Either way the wings were very good so I have no real complaints.  It did take a bit for my wings to be served but the website did indicate that they employ only one cook and everything is made fresh.  I don't mind waiting for good eats.

The bar is large with ample seats at the bar and many tables.  If you're a sports fan they have television sets all over.  They don't all have the best picture but you won't miss any action.  There's a pool table, various arcade games and a jukebox (loaded with compact discs).  

I dig Monkey Pants.  One day I shall return and inquire about the Burger Nation challenge.Hello, my name is Faith, and I am a cupcakeholic.

It started at a very young age. Doctors and television shows would run warnings about cupcakes informing our parents that they should keep them away from us for our health. My parents were able to protect me for a while, that is, until I grew old enough to attend birthday parties on my own without their supervision (age 5). 

The music blared, the party dresses swirled, the party favors circulated. At last, the platter of cupcakes arrived. Everyone was doing it, I would be left out if I did not join it... After all one wouldn't hurt right?

At first it was just a party thing. Birthday party= quick fix in the name of celebration. After a while, it became a morning thing to accompany my coffee. Then it spiraled into me eating them at home by myself. I knew I had hit a low when I began to replace meals with a cupcake.  

One night, as I tossed in bed with the idea of eating a cupcake. I gave in a grabbed a cupcake in the refrigerator and ate in on the kitchen floor. I knew I had hit rock bottom. 

At 2:25am that night I made a decision. I would no longer be oblivious to any cupcake. I would use all of my cupcake craving energy on ONE cupcake a week. As a cupcakeholic, that is a massive amount of energy to put into one cupcake.

It was hard at first, but slowly I progressed with the support of family and friends who had gone through similar issues in the past.

That ONE weekly cupcake is often one from this delicious (and cute) little bakery called Urban Cookie. Is it worth skipping mediocre cupcakes throughout the week for ONE cupcake? 

The answer is YES. I only go for the good ish now, and when it comes to cupcakes this place hits the spot!

Go Urban Cookie! :)Wow! The chocolate cupcake was so rich and decadent I couldn't finish it. The shop is very cute and looks great. Next time I will try another (hopefully less intense) flavor.I went there today for the first time - hummus was amazing! The bartender could have smiled a little more....Pita Jungle is great!

I love their salads - the Mediterranean Chicken Salad is my absolute fave. Their Broiled Chicken Salad is also good if if you're looking for something a little more simple. I frequently order these but have also had their Lavosh Pizza, which is tasty too.

As far as starters go, you can't go to Pita Jungle and not get their hummus and pita. The best hummus flavors are the regular and the cilantro ones. I've also had their Spanakopita (fillo dough with spinach and feta) which is great - but can't be good for you!

I enjoy both dining in or takeout for either lunch or dinner. Keep in mind, eating inside here, it gets pretty loud. If the weather is nice, I would suggest eating on the patio.Exceptional Burger! Meat was perfectly charcoal-broiled with a just slightly crispy, crunchy edge, and juicy, steaky flavor, sitting on top of a generous layering of dressing, followed by shredded lettuce, 2 Beefsteak tomatoes, diced, grilled onion if you prefer, and perfectly melted thick-sliced cheese. Can't stuff it in your gullet fast enough! The oil used for frying has got to be changed often, because the fries come out with a perfect snap everytime. Prices are very fair. Portions very generous. Service is exemplary. One of the Best Burgers I've ever tasted!First time trying this place with my guy, and when we got there it was dead. Beat the rush by going in a little earlier than you'd like. 

We politely asked for a few minutes, and the guy proceeded to just stand there. Staring at us. Waiting. Not looking away. I explained that this was our first time and we need a minute to think about what we need in hopes that he would at least smile and tell us to take our time. Nothing. Just stood there and stared us down until we ordered*. No pressure.

The second staff cheerfully brought us our meal with a pleasant smile and really warmed the place up. This guy seemed to be the grill man, and I'm not sure why they don't put him at the cash register. 

My food: Regular burger with no cheese was room temperature and needed a little salt for my taste as the inside was completely unseasoned and unsalted, only the tops are sprinkled with grill seasoning it seems. Fell apart trying to hold the weight of so much mayo. Sweet potato fries were also lukewarm but delicious and mushy. 

His food: Garlic Mushroom Swiss burger was passable but like other Yelpers said, these mushrooms are waterlogged and canned, never having seen a grill in their miserable lives. Chili cheese fries were the star of the show, piled high with steak chili and liquid molten nacho lava goodness. Hot and fresh, seasoned well. 

Notes:

-They DO deliver from 11am to 2pm. Call first!

-There is outdoor seating (2 tables), should you want to sit and eat while being serenaded by the sounds and smells of Central Ave traffic. 

-The inside seating is tiny, and while the atmosphere screams family, you will not be comfortable eating here unless you're a party of two. Their take-out service might serve you better.

-If you're going for the first time, I suggest either the Mexican Burger or anything buried in chili and cheese. Can't go wrong, and wash it down with sweet tea if you're so inclined.

*For those wondering if that guy was just in a bad mood, I've been back once since then and he also stood there silently staring me down until I ordered. He is the silent, staring spirit that still haunts Lenny's to this day.LOVE this place.  Always has a cute selection (though often out of my price range).  But watch out for their sales, makes it very dangerous.  On this trip, a whole wall of sale items - an extra 50% off!  Crazy!  Crazy awesome that is!

Sales staff was very helpful and attentive.  Very please with my experience.I freaking love David & Goliath! They have the most clever and witty quotes on their tees and tanks ever!

I couldn't help, but to make a stop here as I was shopping around the Grand Canal Shoppes in the Venetian Hotel. The bright and vibrant colors in the store would draw anyone in. They had a bunch of tees, tanks, and pajama sets for both women and men. They also had a bunch of accessories; such as bags, wallets, stickers, magnets, and even lip jelly.

I bought myself a pair of cute pajama pants with cupcakes imprinted all over them and I got my sister a tank that said 'I heart music,' which had a cartoon heart wearing headsets. It was super cute! As a matter of fact, everything in the store was super cute!The sandwiches are to die for, the prices are great and the staff are super friendly. From pastrami to corned beef to prime rib sandwiches and tasty wraps, to fresh salads and healthy smoothies, to mouth-watering cheesecake and other delectable desserts, you'll want to keep coming back to try something new. 

They only use the best ingredients between their freshly baked breads. You can choose from Ciabatta, Pumpernickel, Italian, Sourdough, white, wheat and many more.This is a very cool park with tons of amenities from the rec center (haven't been inside) picnic areas, trails, playgrounds, splash area, skate park, the works. I am going to focus this on the multi use trails.

Heading to the south the trail goes down to Grand Ave where it loops around to the west side and heads north just past Bell Rd. This loop is about 9 miles and with the underpasses is completely free of car traffic. Along the trail are a few rest areas that have benches, one of the rest spots has a pavilion and water fountain.

When you take the trail north of the park, it loops past the Peoria Sports Complex, hooks up with Thunderbird Paseo Park and meanders southeast and connects to the canal trail. I have taken this down to Central Ave.The coffee seriously taste better from Java Cat than any other place on earth. Pure taste bud delight and always served by the friendliest staff. You can tell the owners put their heart into it! I mostly go through the drive through on my way  to work. Which is really saying something because its not really on my way to work and I work right next to a coffee shop. Java cats coffee tastes better, cost less for the quantity than most places around, including the place next to my job. 

The only reason I am not giving it a 5 is its not my favorite decor style in side, kinda dark and dated looking. They really are not very accommodating to children either but I kinda love them for that, and I do have kids. If I wanted to listen to my kids loud banter while I sipped my coffee I would have drank it at home. 
I do think they could use some help with the vegetarian section of the menu but personally the coffee flavor and Love I feel when I go in there make up for any short comings.
Im actually sipping on a cup of joe from the shop next to my work because I was desperate and wishing it were from Java Cat instead. Which is what made me think of writing this review. Tomorrow I will leave for work earlier...
Java Cat stole my heart..Good strong coffee, tasty baked goods, free WiFi, friendly service and yummy gelato, combined with a diverse clientele and nice vibe--Java Cat is head and shoulders above any of the coffee chains. Really the only drawback is the very limited parking, which sometimes necessitates a bit of a walk, not a problem in good weather, but not fun during our much too long Wisconsin winter.I loved the DJ at Tao Beach.  The music he spun on a saturday-day was amazing as well as the body on olympic swimmer Michael Phelps!  I had so much fun here.  My only issues with the place is that the pool is waaaay to small.  It looks like a kiddy pool with a bunch of hot sweaty adults in it.  Also, there is noooo place to sit in the shade or even find a lawn chair to sit in/put your stuff.  You need to stake out these spots like vultures.  Maybe if you get there early you'll have better luck?Came on a tuesday afternoon and it was pretty much deserted so i didn't get a chance to experience the party that everyone talks about. My hunny and I still had a blast with the drinks, chatting with some of the super friendly staff and thoroughly enjoying the music selection. Hopefully we'll go back on a weekend!I've always heard that Tao Beach is "too small" compare to other pool parties, but after experiencing it for myself, I think I actually prefer it better.

We went on Labor Day weekend Saturday so needless to say it was packed by the time we got there. Luckily we reserved a table and had a great host so getting in was a breeze (even we arrived a little later than suggested time); Our host ended up hooking us up with a great daybed right in the middle of Tao Beach right in front of the DJ booth (Thanks so much again Chris!). We ordered just about every single type of pitchers on the menu as well as beers and straight liquor. Our waitress was very friendly and took care of us even though by 1PM the place was insanely packed.

DJ played a great selection of music, including hip hop, which you don't hear a lot in major clubs in Vegas consider everyone's playing Electro. We had an absolute blast the entire afternoon. If you're with a group (I'd say 4+) reserving daybeds/cabanas/tables is the way to go if you are going on a popular weekend. General admission takes a long time and the bar gets packed really fast, so getting a drink will be a challenge and let's face it, who wants that in Vegas!

Looking forward to LDW2012!My boyfriend and I chose Tao Beach because our Vegas trip was on Labor Day weekend and all the bigger pool parties had jacked their prices up for the holiday. Tao Beach was still $20 for ladies, $40 for men. We arrived at about 10 a.m. and were admitted for FREE! We like to think its because we are good-looking, but we're probably fooling ourselves. Lol! I bet it was just because it was early and they were trying to get people in the door. The party started slowly, so we relaxed for a while on the lounge beds - you can use them for free until someone rents them out. One of the staff members recommended we sit in the back by the jacuzzi because those are the last lounges to be sold. We did just that and were so shaded and comfortable the entire time and never had to give it up. At about noon, we went back to the hotel room (re-entry is allowed with your wristband!) for lunch and some vodka drinks (too expensive for us to buy more than a few drinks at Tao), then went back around 2:30 to find the place had transitioned from a peaceful, relaxing atmosphere to a crazy, packed party!! Everyone was dancing and having a great time. The Dj was playing great music and Trey Songz who was scheduled to perform at Tao Nightclub later came out and hyped the crowd and sang along with a few of his songs. After the party was over (5:30 or so?) we went out to the venetian's pool and relaxed as the sun went down. It was such an amazing day. We will never forget what a great time we had.

Pros: all of what I said above
Cons: expensive drinks (yeah I know - that's Vegas for you)
small poolThis place has been busy every time we've been, and understandably so. The food is consistently good and the servers are always friendly. Even the cook has popped out now and then to give us a friendly nod of recognition. The fried chicken is just great, as are pretty much all the sides I've tried : red beans and rice, green beans cooked with bacon and potatoes, rice and gravy, etc.,, but my absolute faves are the yams in syrup - always hot and the perfect amount of sweet, and their amazing cornbread dressing that I wish I could make at home. I would be the Queen of Thanksgiving! Banana pudding would put a smile back on Paula Deen's face. My only quarrels: I wish they were open a little later - 8 pm comes awfully quick, especially in summer, and I know it's soul food, but I wish they at least offered a couple of lighter options like fresh fruit or green salad. Again, in summer, gravy-covered everything can get mighty oppressive.Went on a Saturday evening and was surprised that it wasn't packed
The outdoor patio seating area was nice even if the mists were going 80mph
It wasn't that hot but whatevs 
Our server was really great
She was nice and very attentive 
This is a great place for drinks
I had a house marg and it was yummy
The food...
I was kinda iffy about it
So I asked the server what she liked 
I got a 2 option dish... Enchiladas and rolled tacos or something
I was really surprised by how tasty they were
They also came with rice & beans
My group was very pleased by the food here and we would stop by if we are ever in the area again

Ps- they have Cornhole hereMy family decided to take me out to dinner here and I got the normal stuff.  I gotta say it was pretty good!!.

Like any hotel with a moderate price... it was packed and loud!!! We didnt wait long, but I can see that happening as this place was starting to get busy.

The service wasnt bad, but it did take a little bit longer to get the food.

Parking sucks if its busy.Really great food here, especially the banh mi. My friend, a pho connoisseur, deemed the pho better than Pho Kim Long. Only thing that keeps it from 5 stars in my book is that service is sketchy. That comes with the territory for Vietnamese restaurants but one time I sat by myself for 10 minutes and didn't get -any- service (i.e., no one came to the table to help me). This last time was good and prompt, though.Very, very good food.  My only complaint is that it should have two dollar signs on Yelp ($$) because it costs more than $10 to eat there.  I was a bit disappointed by that, but the food was really top notch.  Great service and staff too.  If I'm feeling a bit pricier than I normally am for lunch, I'll be back.Large bar with lots of room, plenty of pool tables, darts, etc. etc. Not very crowded, so its a great place to hang out with friends and relax, shoot a game of pool, or watch bands on Fridays & Saturday nights.The service was excellent. I was surprised that the carts came around so frequently and our tea pot would be filled the moment it became empty. There was this guy coming out with special dishes, he's a good marketer btw. Lol. 

As far as food goes, it was good, not great but it was more than just okay. The salt and pepper squid was too breaded in my opinion, but the congee was surprisingly pretty awesome! The eggplant was also a favorite of mine. The Chinese broccoli was overcooked and shriveled to me so it was a bit rubbery and difficult to eat.I've been shopping here regularly since it became a Food City several years ago and love it. 

One of the best things about Food City, at least this one, is that if anything like a line begins to form at checkout, a new clerk immediately jumps in and moves people through. The opposite of the long lines I've endured at Albertson's.

Second great thing is perusing the fascinating selection of Mexico-oriented products that you don't see anywhere else, particularly the great variety in the produce section.  Where else would I have discovered the really tasty 'Super Leon' chili-encrusted low-sugar dried mango candy? For a total gringo like me it's a culinary adventure. 

Highly recommended!I am writing an update to this review just to say that I am glad that the owners of Polar Ice decided to sell to the Ice Den. The Ice Den (North Scottsdale) is a great place to skate and take ice skating lessons. I hope that carries over to the Chandler location as I intend to visit every once in a while when me and my family go there to spend time with my parents and nieces and nephew. I will write a proper review once they open and I've had a chance to try out the renovated facilities.I love philosophy hand and body lotions.  "handmade" smells like lemon custard and is very hydrating.  Not too crazy about their Hair products but the lotions are amazing!The Vermont Sandwich Co. offers a varied and unique menu. I got the "dead ahead" wrap, which had chicken salad, cranberry sauce, and thin slices of Granny Smith apples. It was a fresh blend of sweet and savory flavors and the veg was nice and crisp and not soggy at all (a problem that usually occurs with wraps). I also got the potato salad which was perfect! It actually tasted like potatoes rather than mayonnaise soup. The place is small, so I would recommend take out rather than staying for lunch. Definitely recommend!I think for the first time in my life, I felt good about what I ate for breakfast. Which is huge considering I rarely eat breakfast. 

Once again, another place so near my house that I've never been and am kicking myself about. I honestly thought this was just a coffee place so never bothered to stop in and take a look. It's beautiful inside and very quite. Almost like a library, you feel like you need to whisper. 

I had a turkey sausage omelette with toast. So tasty. The portion was huge, plenty more for another breakfast. I glanced over the menu and the sandwiches, salads, pizzas, and entrees they have look delicious so I'll definitely have to stop by another time.My family and I have dinner here at least 4 times a month.  They have excellent pizza and terrific wings.  Sometimes, I'll stop and order from their lunch menu which includes an assortment of pizza and a salad bar. I recommend if you're looking for great chicago style pizza!I love this costco.  They have remote scanners you take with you while you shop and you scan the merchandise you want to buy while you are shopping.  Then when you are done simply hand the scanner to the guy at the express line, pay and go.  Simple and fast remedy to the all to often long lines at Costco.Pretty solid crew, solid gym!

Only thing is I understand they like to keep the gym clean, but it seems like every machine I'm  on is constantly getting cleaned 
Hard to get a solid workout in with someone in your shoulder the whole time.

Other than that, awesome.In one short day I needed so many things mailed out and faxed - and this place really accommodated me and my list. All smiles, no complaints...

Best thing? Everything was done perfectly! Faxes arrived where they should have as did the packages. WOO HOO!!!

No one rolled their eyes when they saw me coming with the boxes. I have been known to cause a small amount of fear and trepidation in establishments like this because everything that goes out has to be precise.

Two thumbs up!Can't go wrong with pei Wei! Great location for dining in or sitting on the patio when az weather permits. Right now they have a special menu, I tried the Thai chicken lettuce wraps and they are amazing! I hope they add this as a permanent item to their menu. They also have 2 saved convenient parking spots in case you are doing pick up you can be in and out quicklyI love everything about Bookmens except the location... The location scares me a little. But you can't really beat good prices on used books, electronics, music, and knickknacks. The employees are real helpful... I've never taken anything in to trade but I've donated and that goes pretty well... Just wish they weren't so far and the location...Barro's is quite good, but I think its weird how this is supposed to be Chicago style pizza. It's not like any pizza from Chicago that I have had. In any case it is still good food. I also like ordering the wings with my fiance.= = = = = =  WEEKDAY LUNCH BUFFET!  = = = = = =

This is a smaller Peter Piper but they do have the game & play area properly separated from the dining area.

Things started as always for me at this well run chain with a friendly cashier, this time Merisa, taking my payment.  Then I helped myself to some of each of their 3 tossed salads:  Garden Ranch, Classic Caesar and this month's special, Mandarin Orange, to munch on while my custom ordered pizza was cooked (at no extra charge).  I went with the same combination as the one that was so good a few days ago at a different PPP location:  Thin crust, red sauce, Mozarella, Italian Sausage, Pepperoni, green onions, mushrooms, olives & red onions.     :-)

While my pizza was baking I did have time to go for slices of some of the other varieties that were out, of about ten.  Then one of the staff members alerted me when my "Special" was ready.

"My" pizza (no, I didn't take all of it) was great, & again this was a killer Buffet for the money.  The dining room was a little on the cool side, but the sound was AVERAGE, not "Very Loud" as I see up in the Yelp header.  The entire staff was cheerful & friendly and it was FUN to eat here today, just as they suggest that it will be in their TV commercial!     :-))

Weekday Lunch Buffet $5.99

PS:  All Peter Piper's in the Valley serve beer, but not all the same brands.     :-)Great welcome package to new residents of the area (lots of good coupons and 5 free stamps!).

Cashier was quite friendly and was able to steer me to the best shipping option even though it wasn't what I originally recommended.  This shop just reinforces the UPS store image of being a helpful place to go with all sorts of small business/residential issues.This place is pretty cool for a variety of reasons. Nice staff, lots of sports. They'll put whatever games you want on, at least for me they have. But, here's where they fall short. Order a meal, get a side salad and sometimes they refuse to put it in a bowl. Every so often, someone insists on putting a salad with dressing on a piece of paper in a plastic basket. I mean, seriously. It's a bowl.Bought a groupon here about 6 months ago and like most that I buy, I always wait until the last minute to redeem them.  My groupon expired the 24th (Thanksgiving) and I called for my appointment on 21st.  They were able to get me in the next day and didn't seem irritated that I waited until the last minute like some other places do.

The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is that they are rather pricey.  I paid $50 for a groupon that included an eye exam, $150 toward a pair of glasses and 30% off a second pair.  I needed 2 pair and still paid over $550!  

I arrived early for my appointment, the office and waiting area are beautifully decorated and all the staff were friendly and helpful.  I looked around at the frames on display, all designer frames and in the price range of $300-$500 just for the frames!  When I expressed a need for something less expensive they were more than accommodating and the optician brought me several frames in the $99-$125 range.  This was all before I even saw the Dr for my exam!  She was extremely helpful and it didn't take long to pick out 2 frames for the glasses I would be buying.  I was then called for my eye exam and I was very impressed with the thoroughness.  Dr Minor took all the time I needed to go over my options for lenses, I need a different prescription for distance, computer and reading.  He was helpful and understanding and we finally decided I'd get a pair of computer only glasses (I spend most of my day at the computer) and a second pair of bifocals for distance/reading.  

Back out to the optician to go over options for lenses.  No hard sell on upgrades, she gave me my options and suggestions for each pair, ie: no glare, scratch resistant, transition lenses etc.  I felt very comfortable in the lenses and frames we picked out.  They said it would take about a week or more for the glasses to be ready, and considering the holiday weekend, I was surprised when they called yesterday telling me they were ready.  Stopped in this morning and picked up my glasses, had them fitted and they were perfect.  They each came in one of those hard eyeglass cases that were so cute!  She also gave me some eyeglass cleaner and a cleaning cloth and told me to come in anytime if I needed them adjusted.  They also offer sonic cleaning of glasses and I could stop in once a month or so at no charge for a cleaning.

Overall I am very happy with the service and the glasses, just wish they weren't so expensive here.Went to this shop today 10/17. It was closed. Now they have a Modern Sushi open in the old spot. Just for the benefit of other patrons looking for it -- its now CLOSED.Pretty Awesome place! 
It's very difficult to hide the label: FAST FOOD, but i think chic-fil-a does a pretty good job trying. The place is always clean and the service is really nice by everyone working there. I don't really go to places like this, but this was a warm welcome! Go here if you want a "healthier" alternative to most fast food places while not giving up taste, quality, and serviceWhen they say floor, they mean it!!  They have a wide selection, and their price on what I needed was 30% less than their competitors. Will definitely be back...Wednesday 2 banger is awsomeI play Co-ed soccer with my husband and some good friends. It's a lot of fun and the facility provides us a place to play in the summer heat. It's clean and staff is freindly. If you are at all interested in playing, you should check them out. There are always teams that need players of all levels.I stopped in because I was in the area and needed a cup o'joe. I usually drink Carmel Macchiato, so I tried the Carmel Latte, here. It is better than Starbucks, by far. Unfortunately, I do not live near here, so it is just a happy accident. You should stop in, if you are in the neighborhood. I know I will, again!I'd been in the mood for a real philly cheese steak for quite a while, and this place fit the bill!  i went in there a little before the dinner rush, so I didn't have to wait, and was greeted by a very pleasant and helpful cashier. the meat and sandwich were very tasty, but it almost looks like they were using steak-um's like what you buy a the store.  I've never been to Philadelphia, so im not sure if thats traditional or not, because I know using Cheese Wiz is something they do there too.  The sandwich I ordered had provolone, and it was melted perfectly and mixed in with my chopped steak and onions.  Ordered the 8in, and it filled me up fine.  Overall, if you looking for a great cheese steak and service with a smile, go there!Always get fast and friendly service and food is always good. My go to for delivery or a late mealI LOVED this gym and have had trouble trying to find a gym up to the standards of this gym. I'm originally from California so I came into this gym with absolutely NO biases and was very pleasantly surprised. The only reason why I give this place 4 stars is because they forgot to give me a tour when I arrived for my first workout because I declined the tour when I first signed up. Here's what I think:

1.) The equipment it well taken care. I've gone in mornings, afternoons, and nights, and I always see custodial staff cleaning the machines, vacuuming, and cleaning the locker rooms. I also LOVE the fact that the people who attend this gym clean the equipment after they use it. WIN!

2.) The staff is super nice. Maybe it's because most of the staff are men and I'm a female, but they always start a conversation when I enter and leave. 

3.) I attended this gym for 5mos, always used the lockers and never used a lock. I know that's but I'm a creature of habit =/ During that time, my stuff had never been touched or stolen! I think that says something about the community there.

4.) I never used the sauna or pool, but they looked clean. The showers and bathrooms are clean. 

Had I gotten a tour, their rating would be a 5 for me! Check out Farenheit Tanning and the nutrition store next door. They're amazing too! And, don't be tempted to visit the starbucks and In n Out after a workout like I did a couple times! Woops =)My coworkers and I come here a lot for lunch and we all really enjoy it. Their lunch portion is the perfect amount of food and comes with delicious soup. I've tried about 3 different dishes but mostly I get the Panang Curry (Thai Hot 1). They have like 10 different levels of spiciness with extra levels that are not even on the menu. I took some friends and family their for dinner once and my Dad got this crazy seafood dish that came out in an aluminum foil swan. He just raved about how delicious it was. I've never had a bad experience and recommend that you give it a try.Not to sure why the other reviews weren't as good, but I like Pei Wei. Yes, this is the same (for the most part) as PF Chang's (same owner) but it's fast food and quicker. It's also a scaled down menu, too. 

I like that it's close to my house, so I can just pull up and head in the delivery door. 

I don't typically eat inside, but I've been to several Pei Wei's in the valley and this one is good.Good and fast... food

Some coworkers and I rely on this place as a regular standby for Chinese food.  Portions are reasonably large and the dishes are flavorful. All things being relative in the West Valley, this place is top-five for Chinese restaurants.

Not a haute eatery by any means. More like a side diner you would find in a large city. 

The ladies who run the place and nice and quick. The Mongolian Beef is my and a coworker's go-to dish.  Lunch Special with a soda will run you about $11 with tip.Excellent customer service. Was even able to get next day service. Preferred method of payment is cash/debit as they charge a credit card fee. However, they aim to keep their prices low so I am okay with that.

They also do alterations and all kinds of other good stuff!As a part of my move to Phoenix, I am trying new things.  One such thing is tennis.  This has been high on my list of things to learn for a long time, mainly because tennis players have great legs.  :)

Anyway... enter Scottsdale Community College's Beginning Tennis class.  It's me and a couple other older students (older, as in 25-50) learning tennis with a bunch of 18 year olds on Monday nights.  You might think this would be weird, but it's totally not.  I can't believe more people don't take advantage of such a great deal on lessons.  The instructor (Dan) is very laid back and fun, but he knows what he's doing and is always willing to help.  Every Monday I leave in a great mood, even if I play poorly.

And if tennis isn't your thing, sign up for yoga, or salsa, or ceramics.  Just go LEARN something!  You'll be glad you did.  Highly recommended.I love, love, love Great Harvest.  We've had a love affair of nearly 15 years now, starting in Chico when I was in college.  Once I started working I would pick up a cinnamon swirl and share it with my cube mates if I was in town.  I was thrilled when Great Harvest opened a location in Chandler, not even very far from me.  Their breads are all fantastic and they give you samples.  They would earn five stars if they weren't so expensive, seems like the bread in the California stores is a little cheaper, strange.  They also have great sandwiches.Good pizza - crispy crust,tons of toppings, and some creative combinations.
Stopped in when stranded at the hospital across the street and would happily go back to this location or try the other locations.Now I'm not an expert on Vietnamese cuisine but I do consider myself a fan (frequented several Vietnamese restaruants across the US) and I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of food at Noodles Ranch.  Maybe it's because the location is not prime (strip mall with a Taco Del Mar next door) but for some reason I didn't have high hopes.  The wait staff is a bit quiet/reserved but I prefer to not be bothered by a waiter asking me 50 times if things are ok.  I have ordered the Mango Chicken and the Curry chicken as well as the sampler appetizer.  I'm not proud to admit this but each time I go I practically inhale the entire meal before I realize it.  I also tried their Fusion Ginger Limeade which was very refreshing.I love the Beef Pho and would have loved the spring rolls too if not for the overpowering mint taste - my friend had no trouble fixing this problem for me btw. I will be back once it's under 100° again - because seriously, soup in the summer just sucks.I work down the street from this location and I'm glad I do! They have a good selection of pupusas and all of the ones I have tasted haven't let me down.  My favorites are the chicharon and queso as well as the shrimp pupusa.  They are served with some tasty black beans and some rice.  Both of these are very different from what you get in a Mexican restaurant.  

To drink I ordered horchata, which I guess in El Salvador is different from Mexico.  It has a slightly nuttier flavor but it's still very good and refreshing.  

Next time we go back, we will try one of their entrees (with a couple pupusas on the side) and see what else this Salvadorean cuisine has to offer! If it's anything like the pupusas, I am sure to be satisfied!This place is good for a sports bar around here but with the concrete floor, and no sound absorbing surfaces anywhere, it gets very loud and you often can barely here the people you are trying to talk to across the table.  Also while it is decent for a sports bar in AZ, it is no where near as good as sports bars in my home town of Milwaukee.  I just don't think anyone knows how to do a good sports bar in this town.  The food is pretty good but the service gets pretty slow when they get crowded.I love it!! It's huge!! I could go on and on...I enjoy being a Costco member, even though the membership costs are a tiny bit sucky. But I understand they must do what they need to do in the wholesale business. 

Typically, I'm able to get good deals on items, but not always. Do your homework, people, if you have the time. Sometimes, the regular, old grocery store advertises a better buy (yay, Fry's!). The coupons are great, especially on items I was planning to purchase regardless. And unlike the coupon mailer states, you do NOT have to bring the mailer with you to the store to receive the savings -- the cashiers have customers covered (thanks, guys!). The staff is typically personable, too. 

My kids can't get enough of the food samples. The "free samples" tactic has worked with me -- I've happily bought a product, because a sample was offered and I found it delicious or my kids really loved it. 

I had a positive experience purchasing my latest smart phone from the vendor several months ago. The staff was pretty knowledgeable and didn't pressure me into anything. 

Coming from the east coast, I really miss BJ's Wholesale (better prices, better selection), but I'll take Costco over Sam's Club any day!Very appropriate lodging for a quick stop on a long road trip. Clean, comfortable, and reasonably priced. Everything that I was looking for.This was our first visit to the T-Bone.  We had a friend in town and thought we'd give it a try. We heard the view of the Valley was great and the food even better. What we found is a no-frills, classic cowboy restaurant. The tables are picnic style, with vinyl tablecloths. The menu is on the wall and basic, meat and a couple of sides. We had the t-bones and sirloin and they were excellent. Dinner comes with cowboy beans, bread and salad bar. You don't go there for the salad bar. It's as basic as the menu. What you do get is a great piece of meat, cooked to order, that is delicious!  If you are looking for a fine dining experience, probably not the place to go. If you are looking for good food at an honest price, you'll enjoy the experience as much as we did.Great atmosphere and great people. Equipment was recently replaced. It is a great place to work out, play basketball, racket ball and swim.  Staff is friendly and willing to help. I highly recommend this LA Fitness location for a morning, afternoon or after work workout. The training staff is knowledgable and ready to answer questions from personal training clients and LA Fitness members.So the last thing St. Francis needs is another glowing review, but I feel like any place that makes an item you get addicted to deserves a shout out. So here it goes...

The Za'atar chicken salad sandwich must have crack in it, or else there's no way to explain why I'm so hooked. The first time I had it, they were still making it as a chicken flatbread. Now they've incorporated it into a sandwich full of things that sound like they shouldn't go together but definitely do. It has a vinaigrette dressing instead of mayo, which makes it perfect for the sweltering Phoenix summer. And if you pair it with the quinoa salad, it's fantastic.

 I'd like to order something else when I go, but no dice since I stumbled upon this combo. Maybe if I figure out the recipes, I'll finally be able to order and enjoy some of the other fantastic things they have to offer here. Until then, I'll just have to steal bites from other people's plates.Happy hour drink prices = AMAZING

Dinner was delicious. Had the baked goat cheese. This was SO good. How can you go wrong with goat cheese though....

Also ate the pork chile verde which was very good and truly the cornbread was some of the best I have had at a restaurant. Usually it is too dry or dense...this bread was light, fluffy, perfectly sweet/salty. My friend had the cauliflower soup and salad. Extremely tasty and satisfying and despite being so full from dinner, we had the cheesecake in a jar to top things off. 

Atmosphere is definitely hipster and the building is just tucked away in the most random area in downtown Phoenix. Loved the decor and loved the openness of it all. I didn't necessarily like how loud it was inside. I don't think they can help that though. 

Try it out!Absolutely one of the best date-spots in Phoenix. The menu has a little bit of everything. from light and healthy, to decadent and rich. The service is (usually) very good, and the ambiance is quiet and candle-lit. Keep in mind- if going for dinner and drinking wine and appetizing. it can get pricey.went this place for my first mani/pedi in AZ. just moved from S CA and was nervous finding a place to equal to the one at "home". debon was nicely decorated and clean. pretty busy but my husband and i were service right away. his pedi was fast and he picked the $35 option which included callus remover and massage. he liked it. i got the $35 mani/pedi special and wasn't disappointed. i will go back.This small surprise of a find really made me happy. Originally I had gone to the shopping complex for Euro Cafe...it is closed and it looks like there is a frame store in its place.

It is located on the northeast corner of Longmore and Southern directly behind McDonald's and right next to Life Uniform.

BTW -- What is it with strip malls with strip malls behind the strip mall? Also, what's up with the inability to properly NUMBER a freaking building? The numbers here are hidden so well, you practically have to run into the building with your car...even though it won't actually guarantee that you will find the number.  URGH

Anyway, I digress...sorry! For a scant $10 I was surprised to get a 12 inch philly cheesesteak with fries and a drink.

The meat was lovely and not mega greasy like some other Philly Cheesesteak places. The cheese also wasn't added on top as an afterthought, either. They had taken the time to actually blend it with the meat, onions and mushrooms -- heavenly! The result is something that doesn't stretch for miles on end after you take a bite, only to sloppily land on your shirt or even worse, drop food onto your lap or plate. The fries were not dipped in salt like Two Hippies. They serve Coke products -- boo, hiss!

The owner (or I am assuming he is the owner) and I were talking about Euro Cafe...He said it's been closed for over a year. He said I should try the Gyro next time...and I will.

Decor is scant, but functional...and it is wonderfully clean. You won't feel like you've stumbled into the kind of place that will make you feel sick after the first bite - I loved it here.

I really hope this place does well. I have my reservations because of where it is located - behind two fast food restaurants and a strip mall that's about 20% empty. I wouldn't have found this place if I hadn't pulled over to google Euro Cafe on my phone.This is a huge store and love that the clothes were sized.  There is a separate room for housewares and a bit messy.  Some of the housewares stuff was dirty but great deals. They were running a 50% sale on all items in the store, blue, red or white.  Own parking lot.Best Mediterranean food I've found since moving here from Europe (yes, it's not abundant in AZ at all). Service was quick and friendly, and the serving sizes were huge. The Greek salad was amazing, and the gyros was the best.
The former 5 & Diner decor was a bit odd, but I suppose it doesn't matter with food this good.My dad used to take me to sardellas after going to the dentist. Always good memories here. In glad to see they are be arching out. And the pizza is good too!took LEANNE S's advice and decided not to wait 4 hours (literally, we showed a little after 5 pm and the hostess told us not before 9 pm) at the PHOENIX pizza hot spot. turns out she was right -- this place definitely satisfied.

PATSY GRIMALDI's is very old school. the FRANK SINATRA photos behind the hostess desk and OLD BLUE-EYES crooning on the sound system were a dead giveaway ...

their coal-fired oven produces an excellent crust, from a technical perspective probably the best i've ever eaten -- thin, crispy and perfectly cooked.

the sauce ("raw" style alert in case you're overly partial to the long, slow simmered variety) goes on top. this is not a style for fans of bloated, soggy (super-sized) pizza piled high with toppings and big, greasy blobs of cheese.

two personal pizzas fed four with some left over. service was attentive. if you're a pizza minimalist (like me), i haven't found anybody that does it better.Okay, okay... I KNOW it's a fast food joint. I KNOW it's a chain. HOWEVER, let me tell you, the ladies who work there are AMAZING. Their customer service is top notch. The store is always exceedingly clean. The food...well, it's Carls' Jr. It's the same food you'll get at any Carl's Jr. But, the staff at THIS one makes it truly a pleasure! I was very pleasantly surprised. Good job girls!!Got my wife her Galaxy Tab here. Nice place. They only sold expensive screen protectors for it and only had 1 brand. Dumb. Had to go to Fry's electronic for the screen protector.

Also got my son a video game here for his PS3. This will now be known as my best buy.I've been coming here 3 times a week, for either coffee, fresh pastry, great selections of soups, and deli.   I love how you can order hot foods by the pound,and I get to sample fresh apple juice, or their fine cheeses    I also get tempted to taste their wines, while I'm on my break.  :) 
Their customer service is always helpful....I never give a place 5 stars, cause there's always room for some kind of improvement.You always get exactly the seat that you want because nobody goes here.Definitely as the temps hit triple digits we find our solace in a frozen deluxe sensation called ice cream. I however enjoy CA's fab shakes the most and for some reason I'm on an Oreo fix lately. Nonetheless don't walk but run to avoid heat exhaustion!It's a Quizno's, so it has all the standard fare, sammies, huge f'ing subs, and that delicious lemonade. This is the location I go to most often because it is right by my office, and they do a decent job.

Because they are located in an office park, keep in mind that they close at 5 so don't count on it as a dinner spot.

I love to grab two veggie sammies...flatbread topped with cheese and a veg assortment. They are a great, quick item to grab for lunch, and they tend to be pretty generous with the toppings at this location.Sour Dough Bread Boule with Cream Cheese Potato Soup!  Yumm Yum!  I love the fact that this unit is NOT at a mall.  It is accross the street from a upscale strip mall.  Food was Great (but they burnt my friends bread boule.)  Service was excellent.  Young men and women working, but super nice and accomidating.  I asked for three soup samples and they were busy!  (They had three registers a ringing.)  Great people watching.  I saw an old cougar, a wicked (plastic surgry nightmare) stepmom, and a few other interesting people.    The  breadboule was cheap.

i recommend this place for seafood buffet.Hey!  I haven't been to a buffet in a couple of years.  I would say the last time was the holiday buffet at Verona Chophouse a few Christmases ago.  But on Sunday I had a wild hair to try some place different that also had seafood on the menu.  Well, do they have seafood?  A lot!  Mr. M and I made a couple of trips and tried little bits of all kinds of things, and I think we still didn't even taste half of the offerings.  Everything was really good, from the little stuffed shrimp to the sautéed bok choy to the chicken wings to the donuts to the soup to the dumplings.  Oh yeah!  And neither of us eat sushi or sashimi, but if a person does I could see this being such a great deal.  

Sunday's prices are something like $16.88/person all day and it was well worth it.  I also had a coupon and had printed the incorrect $1 off per person for lunch, and our waitress, Latanya, gave us the $1.50 off dinner coupon.  She was great even though they were still fairly busy around 1:30.  Very friendly and always smiling, she kept our drinks filled and took care of several other tables.  

Next time I'll take pictures.  This isn't your average buffet.  Everything tasted very fresh and there was so much variety.  I look forward to a return visit and would definitely take friends or family who are visiting if I didn't feel like cooking at home and trashing the kitchen.I love me some chick-fil-a.  Their waffle fries are the bomb and their chicken sandwiches are so delicious and juicy.  I love their Polynesian sauce on top of everything!  I also love their great customer service.  They seem genuinely happy to work there.One of the best fast foods out there.Delish, but they don't speak English. It doesn't look clean. It's quite strange. It's really really good food though. Sometimes I don't even get what I ask for. It's strange, but good.I am willing to traverse town to find great deals. Usually, I intersperse a visit to a friend's house with shopping. With this HomeGoods, it is just down the street from my house. I could practically throw a stone from my backyard. This is a bonus and a danger. Now I must fight off boredom and not wander through to buy more than I need to. 

There throw blankets are the best quality of all the discounted furnishing places. They are soft, warm, and come in many styles and colors. If you find one that fits your house, scoop it up. They tend to be cheap at $20.This store is home decor heaven!  From large furniture items to cute little nick nacks... they have it all.  The prices are a little steep on some items, but if you look hard there are always deals!  I wish the staff at this store was a little more knowledgeable about the products sold here though.Hyped up which I think can set some people to be disappointed, but I thought it was good. 

I wanted cake. I had such a crappy cake slice the day prior and I remember having a really good cake slice from Freed's years ago. It definitely hit the spot. 

I grabbed a red velvet cake which was tasty. I have a problem with a lot not having balance but this achieved that. Not too sweet, the cream cheese frosting had a really nice rich consistency but not too thick and still taste like cream cheese, the cake was moist and had great flavor. 

The black forest was the better of the two though. I'm not a chocolate cake fan, but I really enjoy theirs since it's not a sugary mess but cacao flavor. It was so moist, the cherry filling was nice and the frosting was just the right amount of sweet. 

While I think their custom cakes are pricey, I can understand why it is in demand as they really understand how to make cake. I think a lot of places are too heavy handed on sugar and I cannot eat a whole slice of it or put too much frosting that I'm scraping off to get the right balance in a bite. I did not feel gross and in a saccharine coma after their treats. The BF was holding back from eating more in one sitting when we were just planning on a tiny nosh and saving the rest for later. 

There was a Yelp check-in deal with $6 you get 12 cookies. This to me is CRAZY of a check in deal as their cookies are normally by the pound and you can pick any. There wasn't a bad one in our picks, but the standout for me was the cookie with marzipan covered in chocolate and nuts, and the 7 layer squares. We went to a friends house close by and while I wanted to try more than that, I went back to the bag and everything was gone. 

Welp, I take it that means it was good. I wasn't gone from the kitchen that long.Just finished a move with these guys in town.  It was ok.  The price per hour is higher than I would expect but at least they are insured and take care of stuff.  I had some wood pieces that were damaged, they took them and repaired them no questions asked.

However, I have a beef with the teardown/assembly portion of the move.  They took my king bed apart which was fine, but the re-assemble was basically all wrong.  They forgot a piece, stripped some screws, and what they did put together was not properly aligned.  When I pointed this out, they said their handyman would call me.  It's been two weeks and counting, no call... (*note - did eventually call).

I had to take the whole thing apart, fix it, put it back together which was a 90 minute job.  So I was not happy about that.  So overall pretty good but since they cost top dollar I expected top service and it fell a little short. To be sure I probably would use them again though.South Point is a hotel/casino geared towards locals in the Las Vegas/Henderson area. It has an equestrian center, Bowling, Bingo, Movies and Night life. 

The staff was very efficient and got us in very quickly. Everyone was friendly and they give you a nice little coupon book for you to use on your stay. We booked on Vegas.com and it was $50 less than any other website, including their own.

We were there on the weekday and some tables were $1 minimums which is nice when you are starting to learn to play. The dealers were very patient and taught me some games.  We even played Bingo and that was fun too.

Now, the rooms.... I thought they were very nice King Deluxe rooms with super comfy beds that had cotton linens, not that tacky polyester. We requested non smoking on a high floor and thats what we got.  They had a great 42-inch plasma televisions. The prices for room service and in room movies was your typical rates ($13 movies/ $25 with tip for Dinner). We ordered Chinese food to our room (Kung Poa Shrimp-really spicy-yum) and its was very delish. 

Our room had plenty of square footage and a nice little love seat. The bathroom was very clean, with a seperate grooming area (mirror/sink) from the actual shower/toilet which is nice.

We ended our stay with a 3am breakfast at Coronado Cafe. It didn't disappoint and neither did the prices. 

The only thing we didn't get to enjoy was the pool. boo. it was being renovated. 

Overall we had a really great time and I would 100% Stay here again.I don't know why there's two entries for South Point... but the following is my review off the other [identical] one:

Located at the end of the strip, I can see people completely skipping by this place. There's nothing too flashy from the outside like a pyramid at Luxor or the Eiffel Tower at Paris, but the building can easily be mistaken for any of the other big name hotels on the strip with gold tinted windows.

I stayed here with my family during Spring Break and the rooms we got were super nice. Huge beds, clean room, flat screen, and a nice view overlooking the pool beneath (One un-heated, one heated, and one hot tub).

I really didn't like that there wasn't free wifi and the fitness room cost an additional $20 or so, but I guess in Vegas, everything's gotta cost something right?

I'd would stay here again and be happy :) Not overcrowded like many of the other hotels I stayed at.I came here for a work convention.  This place was clean, nice, and updated casino.  The rooms had a lot of room and the soap bar was great. I enjoyed staying here and there was very low cost tables for gambling.  All you need in one spot.  Had a good time.  I would come back but they are off the strip.My husband and I have been to Las Vegas close to 10 times in the last 4 years, but this was the first time we stayed at a hotel off the strip. We originally were thinking about staying on the fremont street area, but decided against it as it looks super run down and kind of a seedy element. Sooooooo glad we decided to stay here, the room (a standard room) was great! Nice sitting area in front of the window, clean and comfy room. 
This hotel has so many things to offer their guests including, a movie theater, a bowling alley, a concert theater and lots of good restaurants and bars. The bowling alley was really fun on Friday night after several cocktails...is there any other way to bowl? So my hubby and I are totally into finding the best deals for drinks/food whenever we go anywhere on vacation, and this place has so many great deals to offer including:
Friday night - From 4-10 at all casino bars, ANYTHING YOU WANT for $2!! We had crown royal, Glelivet, Long Islands, like I said, anything for $2.
Also at the Tequila bar everyday from 5-7 you can get any kind of tequila for $2! Including Patron, Milagro, Herradura, and Tres Generacions. The bartender was super friendly and knowledgeable. He suggested we order the tequila as a shot and sip to really get the full taste of each tequila. He also served each shot of tequila with something called "Fuego" on the side. It's basically like a bloody mary mix, but sooooo much better and amazingly spicy, which I love. My hubby couldn't drink it though, too hot for him. It was so tasty with tons of great spices and peppers, a great compliment to the tequila, in my opinion.
And on Saturday night, they have a fantastic 80's cover band called the Spazmatics, they are hilarious! They look like they're straight out of Revenge of the Nerds! If you ever get a chance to see them, I highly recommend it. The mexican restaurant there (forget the name) is really great too, awesome food and great service.
All in all, a great place to stay off the strip, great value for your money and also the M Resort is 2 miles away which also has great restaurants and drink specials. I'll review that resort in another posting.
We will definitely be back to stay the South Point Hotel!!This is our place to stay out in Vegas. Yes, I live with mom and dad in California. And yes, due to the fact we have a rental property in Vegas this trip is tax deductible to an extent. I am a marathon runner. I asked the casino shift manager if he knew where the stairs were, after I had asked other guests, one other guest said, no i don't know where they are, another guy said, wow there are never any fires. The shift manager said that they keep the stairs locked because kids have gotten lost in them and they've had problems. It was a nice clean room. There was no refrigerator there, but other than that it was pretty nice!This was great hotel we stayed four days and we had great time. The room were clean the staff were friendly over all. The food was OK. The buffet is a buffet not bad for the price , they have movie theater but its a bit expensive. We were lucky that we booked early enough that we did not have to pay the resort fee.....

MESSAGE TO MANAGEMENT

Please stop the nonsense of the resort fee stop pretending it not part of the room cost when you have no choice to decline it.  Just add in. Is it only me tired of nickel and dime in this  case 15 a day is not dimes and more .  to use Internet that you might have on your phone any way , and gem that you might not use at all... Please give everything include in the prices not surprise in the end. Would I go back probably but I will check more deals and will try a hotels without the resort fee... 

Overall it was a good stay. For a nice hotelStopped by to pick up some $0.45 wings. Got a dozen Mango Habanero Wings and some celery. I called ahead and my wings were ready when I got there. The staff is always nice at this location.great sushi. Fresh fish. Their toro was particularly good. Did not like their hanabi. Everything else tasted amazing.My girlfriend and I had a last minute trip to Las Vegas on Valentine's Day and of course just about everything was booked! So we went on Open Table and found out Sushi Roku had late night reservations. We went for a nice stroll and went to our dinner. We were sat at an great table next to an exquisite view of the Las Vegas strip. It was very romantic, the crowd was very hip, and the attire was semi-casual. We ordered the truffle edamame (definite recommendation) and 3 rolls of sushi to split. Don't bother going to Kabuki or any second rate sushi place because the sushi here is delicious! The only thing I would complain about is the price but you pay for quality and you look like a stud waving the check to your date at the end of the night!This was my first time here.  Had a nice time. The food was good, the staff pleasant and menu selections gives a wide variety to choose from.

I really liked the pitcher of margarita options.  Mango was the BOMB!!!  Next time I will have them mix the pineapple & strawberry together--sounds good to me.

Everyone enjoyed their meals so that was a plus++++

When time to pay up--it was great to see how they handle credit cards.  Instead of taking your card away to process, they do it at the table on a hand held charge machine.  GREAT!!!!Nice to know you can crate dig in Vegas, prices are a little high but you can find some 
heat.Everytime we come to Vegas, our first stop on the Strip is a to Fat Tuesdays at The Forum!  It's right next to an Express store.  The boys usually get the 1/2 Yard or Yardlong alcoholic slushies with an extra shot.  I take sips here and there and it's really delicious, I almost forget there's a bunch of alcohol in there sometimes... try the Peach Bellini one!

Don't forget to save the plastic bottle so you can get cheaper refills later on!Surprisingly pretty darn good. Our group sampled a variety of dishes and everything was better than I had expected, with the bone in rib-eye and the house special pork chops being particularly awesome. It is certainly better than some of the other more "well known" steakhouses in Vegas....plus no wait (at least on a random Monday night).I grew up in this neighborhood so Sunrise Library has always been my go-to library. What's nice about the Clark County library system is that if your home library doesn't have the book you're looking for (which is about seven times out of ten for Sunrise) you can request it online and it'll be delivered to your home library when it's available. At Sunrise, when your book has arrived, you can get it off the hold-shelf yourself and the check-out process is now all self-serve and electronic. I'm pretty sure it's like that at all Clark COunty libraries now, but really loving this feature at Sunrise because their staff is small (but friendly for the most part) and the line could get pretty backed up. Staff is available for those who aren't self-sufficient or are technologically challenged.

This is a very child-friendly library with a great children's and young adult section and they often have small group activities and show children's movies here. Schedules can be found online and you can get on the mailing list to get a quarterly newsletter/events calendar for all Clark County events, book clubs, etc. There's also a small art gallery that changes, I believe, quarterly. Nothing's ever struck my interest, however if you're in the area and looking to check out some art, you can pop by Sunrise and take a look at the spread there. 

You can't control the patrons of the establishments you go to, so my only comments on this are, look at the neighborhood, assess and have your mind right and ready when you go here because there are some characters whether they be obnoxious high schoolers there to do anything but check out books and/or study or the elderly man who can't figure out the self-checkout process and verbally assaults the staff member trying to assist him.  

Overall, a decent library with a moderate selection with nice staff and has finally caught up to the 21st with modern check out processes.I didn't eat here but my friends did but I came in and played some Video Poker.
The place is pretty standard for locals to hangout with a bar area and restaurant area.
Justin I believe was pretty nice guy and I would say this place seems pretty chill to go to.
After hours they have to buzz you in.
Only thing is when you do a Drive to Directions from Yelp and some other maps it brings you to a residential area!  Crazy we were in front of someones home because of the GPS!They put more meat on than most storesEverytime I come they have good service and good food. Fresh, because they cook it right infront of you.

VERY AFFORDABLE AND EVERYONE SEEMS SO NICE.

This is one of my favorite place to get food at.My boyfriend surprised me with dinner to Todd's on Valentine's Day! It was a great surprise and even better food! The service was great and the waitress had made some recommendations for wine pairing and they were all great.  We had a nice intimate table and was a great ending to our night!A great store and it's nice to have everything devoted to men.

I really like the trendy fashions and styles you can find here.  The quality is pretty good and the everything fits well, especially if you're a bit more on the slender/skinny side.

A guy can find everything here: shirts, pants, jeans, shorts, suits and accessories...definitely worth stopping by.DIY manicurists, rejoice - OPI for $4.75. I was THRILLED!

The setup of the store and the store itself is a little intimidating if you aren't used to the area (I'm definitely not). The help there (for my visit) did not speak English and the store is a little apocalypse-esque - not extremely well organized but organized, the floors are a little dirty, the lights were flickering florescents but for cheap OPI, yeah, I can handle it.

I didn't see their hours listed anywhere, but I walked in at 6:00pm on a Sunday and they were still open - that was nice, as I've always had the experience with beauty supply stores that they close super early.

I'll go back for more nail polish after I burn through these OPIs, and hopefully I will have more time (and nerve!) to explore the store further.I found this place when I was shopping with my wife, we walked in the mall and I smelled a great smell, I fallowed my nose to a corner and found this place. I was a little intimidated by the hipsters out in front looking like they were the kings of the cigar shop and you don't belong but that wouldn't stop me from getting me a few good smokes. 
When I walked in they girls at the door were nice welcomed me in, as I headed to the humidor one of the guys greeted me and helped me out and gave me a few recommendations I pick out a nice mild cigar, this guy was great very friendly and helpful. I went back the next day got me another, this will be my stop every time I'm in Vegas.This is how Jaymie Lynn S. gives her friends the Vegas treatment.

190 Octane with 2 extra shots.

Drinking this is like running a 10k (well to me, anyway, I have low tolerance). 

Guess what Jaymie S. did the next day? She made me drink another one.

Did I just do a half-marathon in alcohol?

I never knew that I could love and hate someone at the same time. Because of this place, now I know. Thanks Jamie! For a very fun time in Vegas!When I feel like taking a break from gambling and the Vegas scene it's nice to just watch a RedBox video, grab a Big Gulp, and other goodies and kickback, relax, and enjoy the comforts of a high end hotel in Vegas that provides a DVD player.  One of my favorite RedBox locations is this 7-Eleven.  The people are nice and the RedBox machine always has the latest videos here.I asked the owner to recomended me something new for me to try. I was surprisingly happy!Use CVS for most of my prescriptions, however, I like browsing through the isles and looking at everything. They seem to have some good prices from time to time and I can only find my shampoo and condition here, however, this last time, they didn't have it, seems they discontinued making it as I later found out. 

So I dropped off the Rx and told them I would wait, took about 15 minutes and as promised it was ready, since I had picked up a few other items, they let me pay for it all at Pharmacy. The Pharmacist made sure I understood how to take the medication and the side effects since this was a new one for me, they are very good at that! 

I use my CVS card and get bonus cash rewards, which I can use to purchase other items, I have even gotten a $25 gift card for bringing in a new prescription, so the rewards are great too!You walk into the smell of a real pizzaria, there was a little TV and some teenagers playing nintendo on the floor, kinda like a pizzaria living room.

I went here to pick up a pizza to go, not calling ahead I made my decision a taco pizza, ordered a coke pulled up a booth for a while.

Things were somewhat quiet, then a rougher looking couple came in sat down ordered their pizza with a coupon and brought their own drinks "yikes..things seem tougher in vegas"  

Anyways, I was really impressed with how the owner handled these guys, called them right out on "so you think you can just bring your own drinks into a restaraunt"  words don't do it justice, but it was priceless and handled perfectly.

My taco pizza in retrospect was a poor decision, although delicious, it only left me wanting a turkey taco grinder...

I would recommend this place for its great food and genuine atmosphere, maybe during the day only for families though...

When in vegas again I will be back for my grinder!Busy on normal payday rush hours. 
Friendly staff !This is a nice community to live in. They keep up the grounds and have plenty of places to walk your pets. 
It's newer than many other communities in the valley which is a plus.Holy Moly. Sonics drinks and ice will bring a dead person back from the grave. You can get any concoction you can possibly think of and the ice is perfect for crunching. Their tots with cheese are ridiculously good too. The rest of their food can kind of be blah but I love every version of their tots you can get. They had a sparkling strawberry lemonade that isnt on the menu anymore but I would hit my mama for it! It was amazing!One of the better Costco's in the area, but the self-checkout loses the chance for 5 stars.  Ridiculous set up and if you don't set the stuff down properly on the belt, it comes back to you and you have to wait for someone to come over and clear the program so you can start over again.  Would rather just stand in one of the long lines and let someone check me out.Incredible veal. My favorite in Vegas for their veal dishes. I agree, the service is less than stellar. But the vibe is nice and the food always very, very good. This seems to be the trend in Vegas. So many places offer mediocre service in Las Vegas and this is just one of them. To be in a city that needs to remain top notch, service needs to be impeccable - always. This would be 5-stars if the service matched the kitchen.I walked in and no one else was there so I got my hair cut right away. The lady did a good job and I was in and out fairly quickly with a cut and shampoo.Tom Cruise- Mission Impossible - Must see! It's only on here and only on IMAX. So really big screen, great sound and expensive tickets. $17-50 adults and $13-50 for kids. Plus concessions & tip for valet, expensive Sunday afternoon. 

It's always busy here for new movies so get here early, we were here 20 minutes before scheduled start time so probably 40 minutes before the movie and we got the last seats in the upper level. Everyone after us sat in the front and I could see their necks being cricked from my seat. 

Nice and clean theatre , I like it. Oh and as expected Tom Cruise did a lot of very fast running and hitting people,This is a large, relatively modern-looking mcds. Its a bit grimy, which in mho, kind of defeats the purpose of the remodel. Why bother making it all pretty & modern if youre not going to wipe it down regularly?

The service here is ok. Food is standard mcds fare. 

The one reason we come here is for the HUGE four-story play area. The kids enjoy exploring it, and i enjoy getting a half hour of sanity.  theres a small space underneath for littler guys to play in, but this playplace is realistically more for older kids who can climb well. 

The kids room is completely closed off from the rest of the restaurant, which works great at keeping my boys from running off, and theres a separate bathroom in here just for aparents.  No changing table, which for some strange reason seems to be the way las vegas restaurants roll. I really hate that. 

Therefore they shouldnt be surprised when i change a poopy diaper on one of their posh bench seats since theres nowhere else to do it.
Maybe then they'll wipe it down afterwards... But dont count on it.Excellent, yum.  the soup served with the meal is so tasty!  I had the tilapia with a garlic sauce.  Muy bueno!  Dan M.'s review says everything I would agree with.  Try it, you'll like it.  They have a great wall showing off all the tequilas they serve.Happy hour is 2 for the price of one. Service is immediate. Food is pretty awesome. I ordered the Cubanthis spots on point with the local grinds... i'd say i agree with Melanie A. when she says it's better than L&L... at least the ones here on the mainland...  i checked this spot on a thursday once for some hip hop function... not bad... thanks DZ kids... 

the loco moco... come the fuck on... if you haven't hit it you better get on it mofos... stop sleepin on it... get yours and enjoy...Joe's is great- the stone crabs were fresh and a good size, the calamari was good and the crab cake had little to no filler.  I ate in the bar and found the service to be a little slow (it wasn't that busy), but would certainly go back.Very good service. The food Is good. Their's a lunch special menu which you can ask for with reasonable prices.  Wine very good, bread excellent. You need to have a large  bankroll to really enjoy. Stone crabs are great , crab cakes great. Deserts good.I think this place is closed because they didn't pay their rent.  It's a shame since my folks and I liked eating here. :(Had bottle service this past labor day weekend here and we had a great time.  I was looking for something reasonable in price with a great view (ie moon, voodoo) so this was the best option.  The line to get up the elevator was pretty busy, but since we had bottle service we went right up to the front.  The bouncers/hosts were pretty cool.  The view is one of the best.  It's not as packed as other places, but still busy.  I love the ice thing that you put your bottle in.  It wasn't overly loud and the dance floor is very small, but it has the view.  The best part is the bathroom!  Floor to ceiling windows and the toilet is turned facing Mandalay Bay.  Never have I loved going to the bathroom so much.Great views of the strip from the top of theHotel.  Interior is very modern and clean... and very different from the lounge/bar area.

Ordered the Lobster Curry and Sea Bass which were very tasty.  Only wish there was a bit more curry sauce with the lobster.  The sides of asparagus and mac and cheese were also pretty good but the mac was a little out of place with the rest of the classic French menu.  An experiment in trying to mix classic French with casual American within the meal was not successful but each dish was tasty on its own.

I'd stick to going with one or the other for the entire meal.Great dinner with a friendly and attentive staff... I enjoyed the Tuna Tar Tar and the Ribeye steak, I would recommend the medium rare instead of medium done.  Restaurant has a fantastic view and great ambiance...This is my go spot to bring clients, especially if they have never or rarely been to vegas. The view at night is gorgeous and the food is great, made by Alain Ducasse; probably a top 10 chef in the world. Food may seem a bit pricey as the recipe are fairly basic while still very good. You mostly pay to eat on one of the best view of vegas.

Dont forget to step on the balcony to take few pictures....This is by far one of the best places for Greek food in Las Vegas. My family is from Europe, And we need a lot of Mediterranean food. None of the other Greek places in Vegas come near Yassou. The food is always fresh and delicious. Nothing compares...Whenever I'm in the mood for a delicious big burrito, this is where I go. This location of Chipotle is on the corner of Las Vegas Blvd and Warm Springs Rd so it's relatively easy to get into and out of, which I like. I feel like it doesn't matter what time I arrive at Chipotle, there's always a long line, but for the most part, the line moves quickly. I once ordered online to pick up at this location, but I still had to wait to jump in and pay for my meal. In fact, when I online ordered, they hadn't even made it yet so they made my burrito quickly.

The food is yummy, like most Chipotles, and the price is reasonable for the amount of food that you get in return. I always take my burrito to go, but glancing at the rest of the restaurant and I see that it is usually clean though filled with people eating. The downside to this location is that it opens at 11 am (boo!) and there is always a line. But hey, it's totally worth it for a Chipotle burrito so I don't mind.We went to the orchard this past weekend. It's great for kids , fun and educational. There wasn't much to choose from but you can sign up for their weekly newsletter to see what's ready for picking . 
The staff was soooo friendly and helpful, that's a huge plus. 
The produce was very inexpensive . 
There are some tables under some trees near the cashier stand, we brought our own picnic lunch to enjoy after the kids were done picking. 
Would Definitely go  back when more things are in season!Home plate has great hamburgers especially the greek burger but their prices are a little high on most of their stuff expect to pay $25 + for 2 people.  The garlic knotts are also very good but I would pass on the jalapenio poppers next time not very good and deffinately not worth the money, the pizza is also pretty skimpy but tastes good.This  place is clean compared to other places I've gotten a pedicure. Staff is very friendly and offered me a. Bottled water upon arrival. Not the best massage but overall was satisfied.I needed my front brakes repaired on my car and I was not sure where to go...

After reading reviews here on Yelp of various repair shops, including T&M Automotive, and a recommendation from a friend, I decided on taking a chance and bringing my car to this shop.

It is located near my residence and that was a plus as I had to walk home from the shop after dropping my car off.

I began by calling the shop to make sure the service I needed done could be performed.  I spoke to Peter on the phone and he was friendly and professional.  He confirmed that brake repair could be done and that they could take a look at the car that day.  He did advise me that since they were closed the day before, due to a holiday, the shop was busy and he could not guarantee me a time.  I totally understood.

I took the car in at approx 10:45 am and spoke to Bruce and Peter at the desk.  They were friendly and professional and took my information as I had never been there before.

I was very surprised to get a call back around 12 pm that my car had already been looked at!  Such a quick turnaround!  Bruce explained that the front brakes definitely needed replacing and that the back brakes were still in good shape.  He explained the work that would be done and gave me the price estimate.  I was shocked at how reasonable and affordable it was.  After hearing prices of what my friends have paid in the past to get brake repair done, I was really happy that pricing was fair and honest.  I approved the repair work to be done.

Then at about 3 pm, I got another call that the car repair was complete!!!!  I was able to pick up the car around 4:30 pm and Bruce was friendly and professional in explaining the cost breakdown and guarantee that was on the brakes.

I am definitely impressed with this repair shop and would go there again.  I was really impressed that they were able to repair the car in such a short turnaround after I was advised that the shop was really busy.

Thanks T&M Automotive!!!!!I found this salon on my way to work and figured I'd give it a try since it was a convenient location. I was helped right away and had my nails shaped, filed etc. by one of the women then had a man do my gels. For a full set of gels with a heart design on the ring finger it was only $25. Great deal & fast service but not exactly the biggest place.I loved this place!  Perfect for a healthy delicious lunch with a ton of options to pick from you can't get bored!  Personal favorites inclue the Mediterranean Veggie Sandwich, the sundried tomato bread is great, and the vegetable soup with pesto! Panera has great options for kids too.The BF and I come here for all the oil changes, power steering fluid, light, etc. for his car. Beats going to the stealership and coming back with a sabotaged car. 

The guys who work here are always polite, friendly and very friendly. They normally let us know when there's discounts and offer it since we come in so often. 

Normally there is no wait or a car or two ahead. Usually can be out of there within 30 minutes so it's also a pretty painless wait.Thank you Jeff for trying to bring my body fat to the normal range for women...  Not!  Ha ha ha..  

This place is just as good as Coldstone Creamery, if not better.  I loved my root beer float!  While I was hoping to get strawberry, the flavor was not available last Saturday, so I settled for vanilla.  The vanilla was unbelievable!   If you have a Neilsen's Frozen Custard in your area, you should definitely treat yourself to a sinful treat!the custard is amazing, way better than regular ice cream.  The service was not as amazing. The staff was not rude but they weren't friendly either.Now I'm a big shopper at another grocery store, but I do like Albertson's for their beef. Their quality of beef is decent and generally their cupcakes are pretty good. I know weird combo right? The bakery is on the way to the meat section so a cupcake always catches my eye. 

Albertsons is definitely a little pricier but when they have things that go on sale it can be fairly priced. I do like their quality of meat and their bakery is hit or miss but generally it's a hit. I'm not a big fan of their bagels either.

I've always checked myself out since there doesn't seem to be too many not self serve lanes open when I go...which is kind of annoying. I've got a baby and don't want to be checking out a bunch of stuff either. Oh well. I'll be back!Ah, an oasis of relative normality amid the incessant glitz of the Strip.  I usually avoid New York, New York because it's one of the more "amusement park"-esque casinos in town.  But on our last trip, those of us that were left on Sunday afternoon were bored and could use a place just to sit and have a few beers...like we do everywhere else but Vegas.

A sign in the men's room claims that the bar was built in Dublin and transported piece by piece.  I'm not sure if I buy that, but it is comfortingly authentic in that Americanized, idealized way.  Everything's a little too perfect, but I'll take it.  Dark wood, cozy nooks, wistful signage evoking the old country...it's all there.  

Beer selection could be better, but of course they have Guinness, Smithwick's, Harp, and Magner's.  I tried Murphy's Red for the first time (B+) but would have preferred Murphy's Stout.  Pints are $7, which on the one hand is highway robbery, but on the other seems in line with Strip pricing.

All in all, a great place to park your caboose to take a rest from the sights and sounds of Las Vegas, especially in the afternoon when it isn't crowded.  

Incidentally, check out their website for a lengthy and respectable (for a bar site) history of the Young Irelander movement and the nine eponymous patriots.Despite the 'no reservations' policy, our wait for a large group was not long for Sunday brunch. The restaurant was crowded but our server visited our table quickly and frequently. (The kitchen was a little slow but the servers were great).  The menu is extensive and so much of what was available sounded delicious.

I tried the veggie eggs Benedict.  It was pretty good but nothing to rave about.  All of the other diners in my party seemed to really enjoy their meals though (fiesta benedict, OG sandwich, Leo sandwich, sunrise french toast and ultimate french toast).  I'd go back again to try other options.Allow me to take you on a trip in my virtual DeLorean.  Strap in, sit back, and relax.  The flux capacitor is fluxing.

There!  See, that wasn't too bad.  Were now back in 2006.  October 2006, to be more precise.  Now here's my review...

My wife and I celebrated our three-year wedding anniversary at The Charcoal Room, a cozy little steakhouse located inside Santa Fe Station (a "local's casino" situated in the northwest part of town). In the more than ten years that we've been together, we've had the pleasure of dining at several fine restaurants across the country, from Aureole in New York City to Donovan's in La Jolla. And, as denizens of Sin City, we've also experienced some of the best food and beverage offerings available on the infamous Las Vegas Strip. I guess you can say that we are "foodies" by definition, and as such it takes quite a bit to impress us. With that said, however, the folks at The Charcoal Room did just that.

The place was pretty empty when we got there. I think there may have been two other occupied tables in the room and maybe two or three people at the bar. Needless to say, I would've been really disappointed if the service had left us wanting. The good news is that our server, I want to say his name was Anthony, and his assistants did very well. They were attentive, upbeat, speedy, and they demonstrated well-polished tableside manners. No complaints about the wait staff here!

Timing-wise, everything came out properly.

Where this restaurant really surprises and delights is in the quality of its food. Here's what we ordered:

    * Bacon-Wrapped Scallops (as our appetizer)
    * Glass of Pinot Noir - one of Francis Coppola's reds
    * Caesar Salad for Two
    * 12oz Filet Mignon - Medium but Charred (for me)
    * 12oz Filet Mignon - Medium Well (for my wife)
    * Au Gratin Potatoes
    * Sautéed Mushrooms
    * Some kind of chocolate cake and molten peanut butter confection

Phenomenal food! With the restaurant's pricing, I was expecting the food quality to register just a notch or two above what's available at Outback Steakhouse (the filets were only USD$30 each). But when I cut into my tender morsel of red meat goodness and chomped down on that sucker, boy, was I pleasantly surprised! Perfectly charred on the outside, just right in the middle, and superbly flavored. And the rest of the food was equally as good!

Compared to certain overpriced and overhyped rooms (i.e., the "fine" steakhouse located inside the Bellagio), The Charcoal Room is a breath of fresh air.

So far, I believe the best steak in town is offered at Del Frisco's. Second best can be found at Craftsteak inside the MGM Grand. Third best is served up at Fiore's Steakhouse inside The Rio All-Suite Hotel & Casino. Fourth calls Delmonico's at The Venetian its home. The fifth best steak is delivered by the talented folks at Mon Ami Gabi at Paris Las Vegas. And sixth best? You guessed it, The Charcoal Room. Not bad for a "local's" restaurant, methinks.

Overall Rating: Excellent
Food Rating: Outstanding
Staff Rating: Excellent
Ambiance Rating: Goodhe Charcoal Room at Santa Fe Station is where we come when we want more of an upscale steakhouse without breaking the bank. Since it's not far from the house, we usually try to get up here every other month or so. The meals and service are always outstanding.

The restaurant is tucked away in a corner of the casino not far from where the front doors used to be before the casino underwent many of its makeovers. You might not expect a local's casino such as this to have a fine dining establishment, but the Charcoal Room has survived when many of the other eateries that aren't in the food court have come and gone. One complaint is that the dress code has gone down somewhat over the past few years. It used to be business/dressy, but it seems that we see a lot more people in here dressed in shorts and t-shirts. However, they're usually seated toward the front doors or the bar area, so the good seating in the back is a bit more refined and romantic (except for the TV over the fireplace).

Although it has seldom been busy when we've gone, reservations would be recommended on Friday and Saturday nights. Request a table or booth in the back of the restaurant to avoid the noise of the bar and the flow of people coming and going. When arriving, we've never had to wait more than a minute or two until the hostess took us back to our table. Once seated, the waiter stops by the table promptly to introduce himself and take your drink order. They have a large selection of wine, so if you're planning on having wine with the dinner and aren't sure what to order, don't hesitate to ask the waiter or sommelier. They'll listen to your wine preferences and recommend a few wines that will pair well with your planned meal. They don't push the most expensive wine or the one with the biggest profit margin. We've found some good wines that we normally wouldn't have picked out.

We always begin our meal with a starter and can heartily recommend the stuffed Portobello mushrooms, crab cakes, bacon wrapped shrimp, or the bacon wrapped scallops. We usually choose the scallops and they're always perfectly cooked. Since this is a steakhouse, we don't change our order that much on each visit. I usually have the pan-seared ribeye and Brenda gets either the petite or full size filet mignon depending on her appetite. The steaks are always cooked to what you order. We don't have to order our steak rare to get one that is medium rare like some establishments. Dining is a la carte, so your sides are additional. The grilled asparagus, baked potato and garlic mashed potatoes are all tasty. They don't have the garlic mashed potatoes on the menu, but the chef will usually whip some up for you.

During the meal, the wait staff checks on you often enough to make sure you don't need anything else, but they're not intrusive. They are staffed well enough so it doesn't take more than a slightly raised finger or nod of the head to bring the waiter to the table. Every time we've been there, the head chef has always made the rounds of the dining room to personally ensure that everyone's meal met to their satisfaction. Instead of cheap Styrofoam, any leftovers are placed in disposable plastic containers and given to you in a nice red Charcoal Room bag.

Just writing this review makes me want to give our host a call to set up reservations for another meal here.Went here just a couple of days ago for my first time. i'll start out with the service first. Our waitress was friendly, funny and on the ball! There was never a moment during our entire meal that we were sitting there waiting for her to show up to refill a drink or help us. And I also want to make note of the fact that each waiter/waitress was dressed in white from head to toe and not one uniform that we saw was out of place. Each person was dressed perfectly without a stain or blemish on their clothing. And for anyone that has worked in food service you know this isn't an easy thing to do. 

We ordered appetizers to start out the meal, crab wontons and the warm crab artichoke dip. OMG let me tell you what both of the appetizers were amazing. The crab artichoke dip was perfectly hot temp wise, seasoned perfectly and there were tons of lump crab pieces in it, came with a toasted garlic sourdough bread what a perfect combo. The crab wontons also came out a perfect temp and that pop of fresh green onion flavor combined with the sweet spicy dipping sauce was to die for. 

My husband ordered the filet mignon, it came with sweet potato fries, onion rings and he added a side of steamed asparagus. I myself ordered the factory combo that came with the steak diane, shrimp scampi and their house mashed potatoes. For me the steak was tasty and cooked perfectly, the shrimp however I felt was a tad over cooked and i've had far better scampi's from other restaurants, not that it was awful, just could have been better. Now the mashed potatoes, sweet baby jesus these things were delightful, they used red potatoes and there were still nice random lumps of potato throughout which I enjoy, the seasonings they used were on point and I just couldn't stop eating them. My husband said that his filet was perfectly cooked and that his whole meal was tasty, he even proclaimed that it was one of the best filet's he's ever had. 

Now for the cheesecake he ordered the lemon raspberry and I got the red velvet. Let me tell you what that red velvet cheesecake is amazing, I have an affinity for anything red velvet and am quite stringent on my standards of a good red velvet. The cake itself was moist and tasty and when surrounded by layers of cheesecake and crusted with white chocolate curls and garnished with real deal whipped cream this stuff is the business. I would go back just for the cheesecake.Service is accurate, fast and friendly. The garlic shrimp is one of the best I ever tasted! My family loves the kalua pig and kalbi. The Mac salad is soooo Ono! Price is about the same as the rest of the Hawaiian places. Small seating area, so be sure to claim a table quicklyHad one of my best haircuts here in April. I was in town for a trade show, went without appointment on a Sunday. The cut was done all with electric razors (with varying guide adaptors to control length). It was quick, cheap, fast and good! An experience!I love my Chicken Sald with the cilantro dressing, and there new carnitas tacos. ummm. ummmm, ummmm, ummmmm, ummmm!
I've been getting the same thing for a long time until the taco came out.  lol  I usually stick with what I really like.Scary when I considered eating at El Pollo Loco as eating healthy.  But it's healthier than most of the restaurants that I will frequent throughout the week.  I don't go to this particular Loco often, only when I'm getting my cut at Xpress Cuts.  

Cleanliness is hit or miss here.  Sometimes it's super clean and sometimes it's just missing some housekeeping.  But I put that blame on the guest that don't clean up after themselves.  

I really don't go outside the box when I visit El Pollo Loco. It's usually 5 Chicken Legs or their 3 piece combo.  Regardless what choose, I'm shredding the chicken meat and eating it burrito style.  

TIP:  This drive thru is crazy busy and at all times of the day. One reason this drive thru gets busy is because it wraps around Wells Fargo Bank.  There has to be at least 2 times I've been here where someone thought they were in line for the ATM.  My suggestion, dine in or get your meal inside.The number one reason I go here is for the salad that comes with.  The dressing is very memorable!

I usually get  the plate here with teriyaki chicken, teriyaki beef and teriyaki shrimp.  It also comes with rice, the salad (so good!) and two orange wedges.

The staff is friendly.  The place is clean, even the rest rooms.  There is plenty of seating and their portions are generous.

Don't let my review make up your mind for you.  Just drive by the store front and roll the window down... I bet that'll be enough for you to park and hurry in!This place is great...  A buddy and I had a wonderful experience at Hennessey's.  

We had a waitress named Nikki and she was absolutely amazing.  This girl was just hilarious AND we were grateful that she was knowledgeable about the menu... helping us vegetarians navigate it with ease.   She was beautiful, sure, but she was SUPER witty... which was a relief after the rather dull service we had gotten throughout Vegas earlier in the week.  I'm telling you, if you go to Hennessey's and you get Nikki as your waitress (whether you're a boy or a girl), your experience will be elevated!

I had a veggie burger and fries... not bad.  Food and drinks were quite inexpensive.  The meal was followed by a shot with our waitress.  My only criticism of the place is the surprise I had to see a bathroom attendant in the bathroom.  I've dealt with restroom attendants a few dozen times but it just seemed strange to have one in a Irish bar in Vegas.One random lunch break on Halloween, I was invited to join a huge group of us at work to eat lunch at Hennessey's.  I love visiting places I haven't been to before and so I jumped on this opportunity to enjoy the company of others at work.  

This place was your typical Irish looking pub.  Two toned walls, lots of dark wooden panels.  Not really a hip place.  More traditional and older looking but in a great location on Fremont!  

For lunch, I got the Hermosa Chicken Salad.  It's a salad filled with mixed greens, tomatoes, feta cheese, shaved carrots, cucumber, fresh strawberries, avocado & toasted pecans, tossed in balsamic vinaigrette.  The chicken was a little dry but everywhere in the salad so I appreciated it better.  I LOVED the fact that this salad had avocados and strawberries.  That flavor combination and the texture combination with the crunchy pecans really made a great salad.  I "slurped" that salad right up and really enjoyed it at the end of the day.  

The best part: it was expensed!  Loved it.  I can't complain when the company is great and this lunch was no exception.  I will definitely try to check this place out in a different setting like a late night drink to see how the vibe changes but for now, I'm a fan.For the price you can't beat this place. Fresh, made to order Asian style food. Lunch specials starting at $6.95! One of the best deals in town in my opinion. And for you PF changs fans, this is a great place to enjoy similar items at a fraction of the cost.What a quaint and charming little place! The moment I stepped into the door I was greeted by a corridor lined with happy pots of flowers (yes, they are fake but they looked lovely!) They have really comfy and inviting looking tables and benches where you can sit to talk or eat your buns, and if we weren't in a hurry I'd sit there for a while! Anyhow, I purchased a bun filled with coconut custard - it was delicious!Similar to Maggie, the cheap bastard in me got me through the door of this place, a $75 off coupon. I rarely order lobster, but when its free I eat it. It was cooked right and so was my ribeye. The presentation on the plate was neat too, looked like something you could frame and put on the wall. The cheesecake was no good though, not sure what happened there.11 o'clock mass on Sunday is like going to a Vegas show. Great way to start a Vegas Sunday.First thing's first: thank you Priceline. A bid of $110 per night for an on-Strip 5-star hotel landed us at the Trump. Judging by other reviews, it looks like if you go the Priceline route, expect that you are essentially bidding on the Trump. Be happy! The Trump was a good experience!

The hotel is impressive looking. It's set about 1/3 of a mile off the strip (which can make for a long walk when your date has 4-inch heels). But the hotel runs a free shuttle back and forth between the hotel and the Strip itself. Plus, once the surrounding drive is developed, the hotel will definitely have a more "on Strip" feel.

The hotel is shooting for less young-and-trendy, and going heavy on the luxury image. The valets, bell staff, and front desk staff really kiss your butt, which feels nice. They fill the lobby with a very pleasant smelling perfume of some kind, but it is almost a bit too strong. There is no casino, giving the place a more "resort" feel. And best of all: NO SMOKING!

On check in, we handed the desk clerk $20 when we handed over our credit card, and he gave us a "complimentary upgrade" to a corner suite on the 50th floor! Good lord the rooms are nice, and the views are drop-dead incredible from up that high! And for $110 per night!  Best $20 we spent all weekend! I could truly rave about our room for pages on end!

The breakfast buffet was sub-par. 

The spa was nice, and its staff was friendly. They were able to take me as a walk-in for a massage one morning.

Next trip to Vegas will be booked through Priceline, and if we get the Trump again, I will be quite fine with that.I spent a weekend there with my fiance and these are some things you should know...

** There is a $20 daily resort fee that will be charged to your stay daily on top of your room rate. There is no way out of this.

** Ask for a room away from the train tracks! 
The train rolls by several times throughout the night blowing the horn all the way, they're glad to accommodate if you ask for a room away from the tracks.

**The do not disturb sign is ignored.
At least it was for us, twice! 

**There is no free self-parking, valet only

** The hotel is a good 5 minute walk through blazing hot Las Vegas sun to the nether reaches of the north strip. They have a shuttle that drops you off near the Wynn that is complimentary a la your resort fee.

************

On the bright side...

** The rooms are SWEET. They come equipped with a full kitchen and whirlpool tub...nice :) Very luxurious. I booked through Priceline.com for $80/night...I don't feel like I got a deal, but just about what I paid for.

** The pool is great and the pool side service is excellent.

Summary...
Next time I'm going to stay closer to the strip. But if you want a luxurious room away from the strip...this is a great option.This is one of the nicest hotels I've ever experienced and I'd recommend it to anyone staying in Vegas. Bottom line: killer value! I stayed here for $109 a night on the weekend and for what you get, it could have easily been $200+ anywhere else. The lobby entrance is fancy but not over-the-top, with a large space but pretty straight forward design between the front desk, lounge, and restaurant areas. The pool is just alright, nothing special, but does the job if poolside isn't going to be one of your main destinations while in Vegas. Our room was one of the basic spaces offered, but it had plenty of amenities and was beyond comfortable. I'd say the highlights are, the huge bathroom with large vanity, shower, and separate jacuzzi tub, and the kitchenette that allows you to have all the functionality of a small apartment even for just a weekend stay. I've found myself wishing at EVERY nice hotel I've stayed at since that they had that kitchen. The bed and seating provided are all comfortable and the room was very spacious. The only reason I'm giving the Trump a four star rating is because of it's location. This is Vegas after all and it's at the end of the strip, so taxis, and a bit more walking were in order. The hotel is a five in my book though, and if you don't mind the location, then it's well worth it.Las Vegas is my least favorite destination, however, this hotel offers NO SMOKING and NO CASINO which sold me.  Very classy, very friendly staff,large beautiful rooms, My only complaint is the obnoxious resort fees that most hotels charge these days.  Wanted to go sit in the steam room, they informed me it would cost $12, even though they charge $25 per day resort fees , no thanks... thought the " fees" cover that.A welcome respite from the hell on earth that is Las Vegas, Nevada, ladies and gentlemen, where it was 106 in the shade yesterday at 6pm. People live here?
I was able to overcome my feeling of disorientation at being tricked into thinking I was outdoors (though certainly never a thought that we were in Venice kids!) due to a wonderful simple pasta dish with black pepper and cheese. Definitely equal to a meal in Italy.
The waiter was great if a little patronizing-he knew the wine list well and had solid menu advice too. 
Good job Mario & co.For our last supper before my sister and family fly back home, we went to Enoteca San Marco (http://www.enotecasanmarco.com/) which is also in the Venetian. Sheesh. I work here 5 days a week and then have to come back out here for dinner?! Anyways... Enough ranting... Back to Enoteca, the restaurant is in the Grand Canal Shoppes and I was a little skeptical since its in the mall area. Wow. This place has some awesome food. The flavor just explodes in your mouth. Seriously. I thought the portion was a little smaller than the normal Vegas fare but the flavor definitely makes up for it. Dishes were about $20 a pop. The meal was about $50 per person.

I ordered the Braised Pork Shoulder with averna apple reduction and cucumber. The portion is super small but the taste is super big. Really. It was the best tasting dish of the night.

Brother-in-law had the Cavatappi with Lamb ragu, mint, and pecorino.

My sister had the Fried Pork Belly with Rigatoni Pasta.

My date had the Crispy Duck with house raisins and black Italian kale.Lucky to stumble into the Onyx Bar when Daniel Park was performing.  Is there no end to this guy's talent?  Maroon 5, Coldplay, Bruno  -- he can do 'em all -- and he has his own amazing tunes, too.  Releasing a new CD in September.  Anyway, back to the bar.  It's a favorite for meeting up with friends or on a date.  Caveat:  It's not cheap, but you get entertainment with drinks.  One shot of Grand Marnier with a bottle of water is $21, plus tip.  Their Side Car will knock you sideways if you're not careful, it's cinnamoney smooth.I always wanted to eat at this place... Maybe it was the big scary humpty dumpty sitting out in front that caught my attention, but whatever. I just knew I'd eat here one day. I did just that about a month ago. Great food, good service, very attentive staff, a bit pricey but thats just the way it is when you wanna eat good food and especially in Vegas where everything cost an arm and a leg.Came here for a moms night out and had a blast!
It was 9.25 for shoes and 2 games..after midnight its 1 buck a game.
They were doing 2.00 drinks...of everything!
So I had many drinks...bowled poorly.
Had a hotdog & french fries. They were ok..what do you expect..its a bowling alley.
I had to cushion the booze!
I will come back when I can for sure!!I came here for a celebratory lunch with a coworker.  We wanted yummy Japanese food and were NOT disappointed.  I had the Chicken Udon, it was a very nice serving, chicken was tender, and the noodles were quite good.  My colleague had the sushi lunch platter and was very happy with it - and she is a well versed sushi enthusiast.  The green tea icecream also received excellent reviews.  The decor is quite nice, there were a number of people there but, we didn't have to wait for a table.  The service was very friendly and attentive.  Am definitely going back.  If they keep it up, they'll get five stars :)i really like the roof. like, a lot. i thought this place was really cool. we got fast service at the bar and the music definitely lead me to showing off my sweet dance moves. the crowd here was really cool and a big mix of really nice people. i love when you find people like that! 

the only thing i didnt like was the smell of barf on the roof. it really grossed me out.4.5 stars

Best (thrill) ride in Vegas. It's awesome to say that you've been on the highest thrill ride in the world. The Big Shot shoots you up at a speed of 4 G's and you drop down at 0 G's. After the first "shot" though, the rest aren't as scary because they involve less distance. Definitely get the pic afterwards, your face will be priceless!We ate at Hawaiian Tropic Zone and could not resist walking thru this place.  THIS IS A NICE A$$ CASINO!!!!!  They are putting forth effort to appeal to the young and hip and it works!    IT'S SO PINK, GIRLY, AND SEXY!!! Everything about this casino is just hot.  The tables are nice.  OOOOHHH, THEY PLAYED BEYONCE!!!  THE MUSIC IS OFF THE CHAIN! **I'm getting excited just typing this**  

 They have mounted stripper poles in between the tables.  I don't think they are for general public use.  The chick up there was lame , I could've done better than her.  She danced like she ate a whole slab of Ribs, mashed potoatoes with extra gravy, cole slaw, a bag of chips, bread, AND 2 BEERS before she got up there.  Dancing like she had the world's worse case of ITIS!  But the concept is HOT!!!!  

I took pictures AND THIS B!#@ STOLE MY DAMN CAMERA!  I GOT HUSTLED!  I'M STILLLLLLLL MAD!!!!!!  But, the light fixtures, the overall design of this casino is awe inspiring.  I really want to know what to rooms look like.  They have definately peaked my interest!  We didnt stay long because I was so mad about my camera but I will be going back.  

GO HERE AND LOOK AROUND!!!  You will feel sexy!!  loli was actually PLEASANTLY surprised by this  hotel! talk about FACELIFT!! this place used to be the aladdin back in the day, and everything from the rooms to the casino floor screams swanky and modern. there is a LOT going on. the 40/40 lounge, prive, cafes and miracle mile shops.

its really  hip and modern and draws a pretty younger crowd which is a plus, their pool is poppin with lots of activity as well! 

their rooms are very clean and spacious. and OH EM GEE two mirrors in the bathrooms VERY important for girls getting ready! 

im definitely a new fan!Stayed here while on business.  I had a magnificent room on the 32nd floor with a view of both pools, the Bellagio Fountain, and the strip. Awesome.  Can't say I was overly impressed with the room. The room had poor lighting and semi loud plumbing, but it was very spacious, and contemporary.  However, as a frequent traveler, I have experienced much nicer.  

I do love the convenience of having the Miracle Mile shopping mall just outside of the casino. Love splurging in French Connection, Marciano, BCBG, Bettie Page (for my eclectic side), Benetton, Urban Outfitters, White House Black Market, and Bakers or Wild Pair when they have a decent looking shoe that doesn't lack in quality or craftsmanship. PH is one of my must stops for shopping because it houses the Coffee Bean, one of my favorite chain coffee shops. While I enjoy shopping at PH, I expected more in terms of the rooms. The rates are usually fantastic, but I would rather pay a bit more for luxury. In that regard, I will likely stick with the Venetian/Palazzo, Bellagio, Cosmopolitan (because I'm a Marriott elite snob, lol), or the Aria. 

3 Stars for the room
4 stars for the Miracle Mile Shops and great room ratesThe hotel was very nice. They checked us in quickly & was very nice at the front desk. We requested a fridge and got one right away. Would have been nice if there was a coffee maker & a microwave in the room. Anyway, the casino was ok. It was clean & not to smokey. While there, we ate at Earl of Sandwich several times because it was quick and cheap and good. There was one girl there that had a bit of attitude, but it was my last night there, so I didn't care. 
We stayed there because we were going to see Britney!  We got upgraded to the front of the stage!  Thank you for that cause it was awesome!!  I would stay there again.Had a fantastic time! Fun entertainment, kinda cheesy, but what do you expect. Food was good. Dragons Blood soup was awesome! The chicken was dry but tasted decent. I wish they served water along with my soda. I would go again. Best part was taking a picture with King Arthur afterwards. Very coolLove it...this time we skipped the crawfish (too much work) and opted for 2pounds of shrimp. Wished we had gotten one pound of shrimp and one pound of crab legs like the people seated next to us..oh well, still awesome.  We got it medium spice and Hot N'Juicy special- got the extra sauce to put on rice...OH HELL YEAH...the sauce on the rice alone was DELISH!
We also got soft shell crab and chicken wings..everything was very GREAT...stuffed ourselves silly that's for sure..Any place where I need to wear a bib, is an instant favorite! Ok, I've been to Boiling Crab and other comparable places many times and all had their similarities and differences. Some people like the flavoring at BC and others like it at this place or that. etc... 

So back to Hot n Juicy. We came here when it just opened for lunch (we knew about the crowds during lunch and dinner), we sat immediately and I ordered crawfish and shrimp both with med hot and juicy special. And you know what... i liked it. The crawfish was cooked right (not over cooked which i've gotten at other establishments) and there were different sizes of crawfish. a few really large ones to. the shrimp was equally tasty. With a side of salt, pepper and lime juice... oh my. I have my routines.

I also ordered the corn, sausage and cajun fries. Got a couple of Coronas to wash it down with and I was happy. 

Ok, I wasn't really hungry.... ;) jk.

Service was friendly and attentive as well as attractive. Dining area is a decent size and i can see it getting a little cramp'd when it's a full house. Has a local dive feel. Don't expect gourmet here.

Sorry to hear about other's bad experiences at this place, as it was a good one for my friends and I. I look forward to going back and right when it opens for lunch. :) If you've never been, give it a try. Enjoy! :)Love the quick service, casual atmosphere and the food is so very very yummy. 

We were on vacation this past weekend and we took a chance after seeing it on Man vs. Food. So good.

Even my super picky 3 year old loved it. He polished off 1/2 a pound of crawfish himself. 

Try it  and you will not go away feeling hungry.First the problems with this place.  It gets to hot in the building.  They need to turn the AC on or lower the temp.  Second when it is busy, and this place gets busy the service can be slow.  Now the good stuff, everything else.  Every waiter I have had has been very friendly.  I don't order the crawfish.  I think they are too much work.  I actually prefer the shrimp.  You get more meat, I feel the flavor of the sauce is better on the shrimp, and I feel they are easier to peel.  I also like pretty much everything else they have. I will say that not all Hot N Juicy's are created equal.  The one in Fountain Valley California sucks.I used to live in Nawlins and my friend took me here to try it out and see if it was the real deal.  It definitely was.  

We went in there with big hangovers and appetites.  The waitress was engaging and attentive.  My friend and I had fun goofing around with her while asking questions and trying to make decisions.  

We ordered a bunch of dungie and crawdads along with some baskets of fried stuff.  Over the course of the next hour we did our best to eat it all--we ordered too much--while having fun with the people at the tables around us.  

All in all it was a great crowd and we had a good time.I ordered a hot pastrami sandwich on rye, potato salad, and a chocolate egg cream. The pastrami was served barely warm (which was ok even though it should've been served hot), sliced thin, and was pretty tasty! It came with a decent whole pickle. I only ordered the potato salad because it was mentioned by other Yelpers to be good. I found it to be bland and tasteless and wouldn't order it again. The chocolate egg cream was delicious. You get a large sized drink cup for $2.95.
If you're a New Yorker, it's hard to miss the glaring typo on one of their signs touting NYC authenticity. See if you can find it!
The staff were all very pleasant and the restaurant was pretty clean for a busy Saturday night.
It's not NYC's Katz or 2nd Avenue Deli, but will satisfy your pastrami craving while in Vegas.Las Vegas food options seem so overwhelming sometimes, but it can actually be really difficult to find simple, yet affordable food. Greenberg's Deli inside of New York New York is the perfect place to get an extremely filling sandwich for a fairly reasonable price! People rave about Earl of Sandwich, but I found it to be nothing special aside from the low price. However, Greenberg's has some really quality meats that don't need a ton of dressing up before inserting between two slices of fresh bread. I ordered the Greenberg's Reuben on marbled rye, and it came with pastrami piled at least two inches thick, as well as a generous helping of sauerkraut. I love the combination of the savory meat and the sour cabbage, but after only half the sandwich I was struggling to down the other half! The size of the sandwich is insane, but they definitely don't skimp on quality at all. If you're looking for a quick meal to pad your stomach for whatever you're doing in Vegas, Greenberg's is definitely the place to go!Saw the one in San Diego a week prior and then this one in the Luxor.  they are 90%  the same,except the vegas one has the a large piece of the side of the ship and the mockup of the grand stair case .  A little over priced at $30 a person  and that was with a coupon!  It takes the average tourist a little over a hour to get through it. Very informative and interesting.Worth a visit. Exhibit could have been better presented. Whistle should be with whistle automation, and they should be displayed next to big piece. Rope lighting could be laid on floor baseboard to illuminate the floor. More video recovery clips should be provided. Maybe a real lifeboat on the nite deck . Not for kids. Plates should be wine bottles and photo should be with plates not on another wall...really? A bench or two would help with older tourists (like my parents).  The wall listing names is hard to read survivors, how about side by side? The exhibit should also have a clock timeline...as you walk through, dinner bell at8:00pm,  to final exit of lifeboat...on a weekend that consisted of a surprisingly great room at Harrah's, a surprisingly great dinner at Guy Savoy in Caesar's and a surprisingly good show from Celine Dion (that's right i'll admit it!), dinner at Zeffirino was excellent.  they put us at a nice table overlooking the gondola.  the service staff was excellent and very helpful in helping us out w/ the menu.  we both found dishes we loved and had a great bottle of Moscato as well and at the end of the day, what more could you ask for?  really a 4.5 star restaurant but i don't wanna round up...  yelp, start allowing 1/2 stars!!!We had a great experience. The food tasted great, the service was on point and the prices were very reasonable. The restaurant is lovely, this is a very romantic spot. You can request to be seated by the canal where you can see and hear the gondoliers singing to their passengers. 

The ordered from the lunch menu - appetizer or salad, entree and dessert and coffee for $22.99. 
We had the: 
-Calamari and fried zucchini- very good 
-Beef carpaccio- nice but could have had a more flavor 
-Veal ravioli - very good 
-Beef medallions with vegetables and polenta - FABULOUS! The beef was very tender, everything on that plate was absolutely delicious. 
-Assorted desserts, served with coffee. 

We loved being there and enjoyed the food. It was a great deal and we were very satisfied with the food and service.Roller derby lives!  If you remember either the Great Depression, McCarthyism, or Joanie Loves Chachi, you probably remember roller derby.  Sometimes a serious sport, sometimes a three ring circus, roller derby had pretty much died out by the mid-eighties.  Then, early this century, a new breed of skaters emerged.  All-female teams, skating mostly flat-track and with decided punk personae, revived the sport.  These self named rollergirls now have leagues in over fifty cities.  Las Vegas' own Sin City Rollergirls, aka the SCRG, aka the Neander Dolls, are a new team, formed by Ivanna S. Pankin (you figure it out).  Other players include Trish the Dish, Glam BAMM!, and Lorena Bobbitt.

Now, I remember Joanie Loves Chachi.  And I remember roller derby.  I decided to check them out.  The first time was during a practice session.  Practice sessions are informal affairs; the SCRG outnumbered the spectators, and the most vocal fan was the mother of one of the skaters.  Nonetheless, it was worth a quick visit.

Next came an actual match, versus the Angel City Derby Girls.  If you like to watch highly polished professionals beating the crap out of each other, then you've got to go see...something else.  If you want to see a bunch of quirky but obviously competitive people playing for real, see the SCRG.  It was fun, and after about the first period the rules were easy to follow.

Interested?  Tickets are dirt cheap, and their schedule is on their web site.I'm not a huge coffee drinker, but I might as well have an IV of tea at all times. Teavana in the Fashion Show Mall is the best place hands down for great loose leaf teas, as well as all of the pretty accessories that come along with a tea obsession. Even though it is a trek from my house to the Fashion Show, sometimes it is just necessary for a good cup of iced tea and a new tea set. My favorites are the oolongs and almost all of the greens. The staff is friendly too and eager to offer suggestions for blends and inventive preparation instructions. Even if you don't want to prepare your own tea at home, it is worth the trip for a great cup of iced tea while you peruse the Fashion Show.OH MY VIETNAMESE GOD. You have clearly touched down in Glendale...

I've been here twice now, and wow. Its just, amazing. I am a huge fan of Vietnamese cuisine, and have tried some pretty phenomenal places throughout my travels, but hands down, Avina is a gem, although I don't think its that big of a secret considering the amount of patrons that constantly occupy the place. 

The perfect combo...

1.) BÌ CUN - shredded pork spring rolls
2.) PH TÔM C BT - Beef & Shrimp 
+ Sriracha & Hoison hot sauces to top everything off because I love my Pho SPICY!!!
3.) Coffee Boba (amazing amazing flavor)

They also provide you with the necessary sprouts, mint leaves & lime, of course..

I think I'm in love.How does a big hot steamy bowl of awesomeness sound?  If it sounds great to you, you need to hit this place up, it is fantastic.  My wife and I have been here more then just a few places and every time it is great.  I don't know how many times a week my wife is craving some of their pho.  This place definitely has a lot more to offer then just pho.

Between my wife and I, we have probably tried all the pho's on the menu.  The chicken and the beef are always are go to soups.  If you are feeling a little adventurous there are some more exotic meats you can try in your soup though, too.  Last time I was there I tried one of their other soups, it was a spicey beef soup.  It normal comes with the tendons, but I went ahead and skipped those this time.  it was fantastic.  It wasn't the usual rice noodles that you get in pho, which was a great change.  It was a giant spicey bowl of deliciousness.

While we haven't got much here other than soup, we have tried some of the appetizers and some of the Bánh mìs.  They were good also.  The Bánh mìs are pretty tasty.  Some are better than others, for my taste. If you go you'll just have to try a couple and see which ones you like best.  Don't worry, it will be enjoyable.  

With all these praises, you may be asking why I'm only giving it four stars.  That would be a good question indeed.  The only reason I'm not giving it five stars is the quality of the meat.  From time to time, some of the meat is little bit fattier and a little bit more grisly then I would like.  I understand that this meat selection is a huge part of what makes the broth taste so amazing, but It's my only real complaint about this place.Tix4Tonight is a great resource for those looking to save some money while visiting Lost Wages.

they don't have tickets to every single show in this town, but a lot of the big names are here (Cirque, Blue Man Group). we scored tickets to Penn & Teller for $64 a person.

if you go in the morning and head right away to your venue to exchange the vouchers for tickets, you may luck out like we did and get bumped up from Mezzanine to Orchestra! 

make sure to do your research ahead of time for ticket prices - sometimes you can get better deals direct from the show/venue - but for the most part, Tix4Tonight is a great deal.

they also offer discounts for meals at some restaurants.

I do love saving me money. like the quote from A Christmas Story goes, "the old man loved bargaining as much as an Arab trader, and he was twice as shrewd."I can't get enough of Beach Cafe. 

I always order their food for lunch while I am at work, and I am never disappointed. 

Beach Cafe definitely has the best Corn Chowder I have ever had. It is so creamy, with big chunks of chicken, sausage, peppers, corn. 

They also have an amazing Southwest Chicken Salad, served with a tortilla on the bottom. 

I have ordered several items off their menu, and shockingly for me they have the best frappachino's too! They are made with ICE CREAM = yum, especially on these hot Vegas days. 

I would highly recommend going there at least once. I have never eaten in the restaurant I always order the food to go, and they have offer free delivery service which is very convenient. 

There service is a little slow, it usually takes me about an hour to get my food, so I always order it prior to my lunch. I have never had any problems with the staff as far as customer service, but honestly the Corn Chowder is amazing that I will wait any day for it.Friendly staff, Alfredo Supremo, White Sangria.I've been renting cars out of the Vegas airport for years.  So, when they moved them all to a central location.  I was pleasantly surprised and grateful.  This makes it easy for even the casual car rental user.  

Upon arriving at McCarren Airport simply get on the rental car shuttle bus and they take you to the Rent-a-car center where all the agencies have their own window.  You can use the restroom and get a snack while you wait.  Then quickly head downstairs to your brand of choice pick out a car and go.

On the way out, they have you scan the bar code of your rental agreement and you are out of the gate.

Fast and easy just as it should be.  I'm sure I'll be back again.SO simple! Most of the rental car companies are in this building and you only have tot take one shuttle from the airport to it. (However cramped the shuttle may be). It was especially nice when Thrifty ran out of cars and sent us over to Alamo, who had taken some of their reservations. Getting the car was fairly easy and the garage was clearly labeled. Returning the car was easy as well. 

Going back to the airport, there are several different shuttle lines, depending on what airline you are flying. This was a bit confusing at first, but we didn't have to wait for it.Staff were great. I'm a big gal and some seats hurt my hips. The staff went out of their way to make sure I was accommodated. 

We did the VIP experience which was a few bucks more but we got to see an extra little opener who did slight of hand. Armando Vera was great. First few tricks I was thinking eek this is kind of lane but very quickly I was amazed. I have no idea how he did them.

The main show was pretty darn good honestly. For the most part I kept asking myself, wow, how did he do that. The funniest bit was actually done by a guy from another show with audience members and I laughed until I cried. 

I'd recommend this as a show to see while here in Vegas. Inexpensive and hits quite a few high notes.Awesome place with fantastic courses for young children. I have enrolled my 8 year old in cooking and swimming and she has loved it. Great asset to the community!Henderson Multigenerational Center is basically a rec center located off Green Valley in the Henderson area.  Because I live about 25 minutes away, I probably will not be here too often.  But it's also not uncommon for me to drive to different gyms in Vegas throughout the week to mix it up.  Parking is small, but not an issue in the mornings.  The track is free and that's why I go here. 

Features:
-Full size indoor basketball court
-Olympic size pool
-Fitness room with cardio and weight machines
-Dance classes.  I need to see the Hot Hula Class in action. I said see, not participate.
-Yoga classes
-Pool tables and ping pong tables
-Small track
-Rock climbing wall
-Kitchen classes

I was actually surprised with the size of this place and all the features.  If I'm working on my cardio (which I hate) and in the area, I will make it a point to get a quick workout HMC.  During the summer, the pool will definitely come in handy for a couple quick laps. Overall, Henderson Multigenerational Center is a great change of pace for me.  I prefer to hit the weights, but know that cardio is just as important.  I see myself coming back.  Most likely really soon.Best eggplant parm in the west valley.I was pleasantly surprised to learn there was a Jollibee in town. For those of you that do not know what Jollibee is, it is a fast-food chain that is wildly popular in the Phillippines. I read a favorable article about the company a while back, and I wanted to try it out for myself.

Jollibee is located by Boulevard Mall inside a seafood market. It is bright, clean, and has flat-screen TVs with shots of people enjoying and eating their food. The people behind the counter were fast and efficient, and I got my order quickly. I had my hands full of stuff, so the lady behind the counter was nice enough to bring my food to my table, which was very nice of her. The girl who was cleaning the floors even opened the door for me when I entered the restaurant *and* when I left, which you NEVER get from fast food places. That really impressed me.

I ordered a combo plate which consisted of one piece of fried chicken, palabok fiesta noodles that had eggs and some other stuff in it, and a drink. It also came with a side of gravy for the chicken, but I did not care for the gravy very much, nor did I think the noodles were all that great either. They were both about average. I did like the fried chicken and it turned out I didn't need the gravy after all. What really surprised me was the peach mango pie I had for dessert. It was really tasty and puts McDonald's pies to shame.

This is a good place to bring kids and is very family-friendly. I would come back, but I'd order something else instead. I gave them one extra star for service, otherwise the food itself is only a three. For fast food, it is a little overpriced ($9 just for myself is a little much), but Jollibee is good to try if you want something different from the national fast-food chains.Jollibee is a filipino fast food chain. The first time Kalila ever had it was in the Philippines itself! 

This place is great for a quick palabok (they call it "fiesta noodles") fix. Their chicken Joy is comparable to Popeye's or Church's fried chicken.

Kalila's favorite is their Jollispaghetti. Filipino spaghetti is typically sweeter and has hot dog in the sauce.

My favorite thing to get is the corned beef mini sandwich.

They have other filipino favorites like halo-halo, taro drink, sotanghon soup, etc.

Only problem is that when you leave Jollibee (located inside the seafood city market center), you will leave smelling like food.The four stars are entirely for the overnight manager.

I can't recall the guy's name, but he just oozes Vegas.  He has glasses, a beard and wears a chain necklace.  Says things upon checkout like, "you want chips not crumbs" to himself when he's bagging up your items.  He also tells me to be careful out there with "all the drunks on the road." I love this guy.  All Albertson's stores (and pretty much any supermarket) are mostly the same.  I go for the people.I LOVE Target!

This store is conveniently located for me! 

I love that I can go to Target and find everything I need! This location is always very clean, the staff is friendly, there is a large parking lot, and there is a Starbucks in the store.In the buffet world, Sweet Tomatoes is a 5 star. In the world of restuarants in general, it's probably only a 2 star but this place goes above and beyond.

My sister, the starving college student, was in town and we decided to come here for lunch. We have many a memories of Sunday lunches after church at Sweet Tomatoes (although not this particular location) so that my parents could feed two picky eaters with a mimimum of complaining. 

It's your standard salad bar. Many options for building your own salad and many prepared salad options. A nice thing is that if you are trying to be reasonably healthy while dining out, this is the place to do it. In addition to the salad offerings there are soups, pastas, breads, and potatoes. Plus there is the soft serve. It's also a good place to take vegetarians. 

So why is this location better than the rest? Well, according to my sister it's pretty damn classy. The staff here is friendly and they'll clear a dirty dish about a minute after you are done with it. It's very clean here and the items are always well stocked. 

So if you got someone visiting who needs some stomach filling on a dime, this is the place to go.We were walking on that area of the strip, looking for something asian, when we realize we needed something quick before our show. Then we found this place, kind of hidden. Okay price, but quite tasteful, plus, much quicker than a regular buffet place. They have the option to prepare the BBQ in the kitcken, good for lazy people like me, and who wants the meat done properly. So we were very satisfied. I think we'll visit here again next time.went here for the first time a few months ago [when i lived in henderson]. first time ive ever had meat jun, and LOVED it!!! lightly breaded meat, and their meat jun sauce is perfect with rice, and of course the kimchee, cucumbers and bean sprouts. 

went back again yesterday [probably the 4th time ive been in]. its a small restaurant, very "mom and pop", which i like. they have a fairly simple menu, but they do it well. ive had the bi bim bop, meat jun [absolute favorite dish], spicy seafood soup, kalbi, spicy pork...ive enjoyed everything ive tried there.

the kimchee is a little spicy for my taste, but i cant stop eating it! the bean sprouts are my favorite side there. theyre simple, but so flavorful! 

service is always great there, and i will definitely be back when im craving that meat jun!!!I've had better (read: Sprinkles in Beverly Hills). The cupcakes themselves are okay, but their size and price makes them a complete rip-off at around $3.50 each. A half dozen is $27+

I always get the red velvet with cream cheese frosting, but haven't tried the other varieties although I'm sure they're just as good. The cupackes are very moist and I don't mind often returning as long as the economy is good to me.best strawberry cupcake anywhere!!!

but, they use too much oil in their recipe. it shows alot.

but the strawberry cupcake is still too die for!!!!!!!!Great place to sit outside, grab a late dinner, and watch the crowds on the strip.  The burgers are pretty good - probably not worth ten bucks in most parts of the country, but, hey, location, right?I had been wanting to try Firehouse Subs on the recommendation of my best friend who lives in Utah, so I was happy to discover this location in Henderson, NV. 

 I ordered the meatball sandwich and my boyfriend ordered the Italian Sub. The meatball sandwich was delicious! The meatballs were tasty and it was a perfect amount of cheese and sauce melted on top. The bread was lightly toasted just how I like, and very freshly baked. The Italian sub that my boyfriend ordered was good, however the oil and vinegar they used was a little too sweet for me.

The restaurant was clean and the people behind the counter were very friendly and efficient. We were in town visiting hey family member, and would definitely go back and eat there again the next time we're in town.I'm not a huge sweets guy, but the pumpkin cup cake is what I would imagine Jesus would taste like if he came back as a dessert.I have been a fan of sprinkles for some time, and I'm not sure why I have not written a review. The cupcakes are HUGE however you do pay a pretty penny for them. Part of going to Sprinkles is the "experience" and if you aren't really of fan of that then you probably won't rate this place high. The cupcakes are tasty but they are a little on the sweet side. Did I mention that they are huge?! They have select flavors depending on the day but I've never really had a flavor I didn't enjoy. My fav is the pumpkin spice during the fall! Everyone has to try this place at least once!We took a table at the bar, and after a long time without service, we decided sitting at the balcony - the barman wasn't bad - although with a very big and unnecessary ego. Surprisingly good burger thou. Altogether - not a bad choice.

P.S.: One of the very best fries I ever had...Damn good burger at a damn good price! Had the lunch special (regular burger, fries, and a drink for $15). Also tried their Beignet dessert, very good even though a couple were fried a little too long. The name says sports bar but don't confuse this place with your local Chili's, it's way better!we just got back from Marquee and my girlfriend was craving chicken wings out of no where at like 2am. haha so we walked around asking everyone until this random security on a bike told us about this place. and thank god we went in. service was instantly amazing. the girl who sat us was so nice and so social. not annoyingly social. like, we instantly got along. haha and she said he's come talk to us again. it was slightly busy so we didn't think she'd really come by just to say what's up.. but she kept on coming back. :) and our server was soo helpful to fulfill my girlfriend's craving. lol we got the buffalo wings, which were alright after we thought about it, but super amazing at the time..that's what cravings do. we also had the potato skins, which were pretty much just a whole potato cut into 8 wedges, none the less, twas delicious. BUT what really hit us good was the BBQ Duck soup. UH MAZE ZING! the broth was distractingly good, the duck was juicy, the noodles were perfect. she even brought us some soy sauce and sriracha on the side. and it's like she knew that sriracha is my kryptonite. it was soooooo good we felt nervous to ask for a little more broth, but she happily came by and gave us more. no charge. we definitely tipped her good. and to top it off the girl who sat us came back to us again to let us know she was going on her break and we'd probabl never see her again. haha this place is just utterly amazing. hit my spot goooood.Oh how I love discovering coffee places to go to besides Starbucks! And this place is GREAT. The atmosphere is relaxed and there are all sorts here, not just hipsters. Everyone that works here is so nice  and helpful. the owner has been there every time I've come in and he goes above and beyond, bringing your food/drinks to the table and even grabbing the silverware you forgot to get for you. 

We've only had the pancakes here and they were a mix from TJ's I'm pretty sure so not amazing... but they have veggie burgers here yay and I can't wait to try one. 

The coffee is really good. I'm an iced coffee or latte girl and they are accommodating about making mine with soy! The BF goes for the blended drinks and those have been scrumptiously dessert like. There iced teas are really good too and they always have a great suggestion for you to try. They will mix any of them to concoct your dream iced tea.

I love this place bc it's yummy, fairly priced, and a LOCAL, small business!I frequent this theater the most since it is the closest to home. It's big, clean, and there's plenty to do before and after watching a movie since it's located in Tempe Market Place. It does get quite crowded here during busy hours, but not any worse than a typical theater. This location also has a lot of late showings thanks to its close proximity to ASU. 

I like that all the auditoriums have stadium seating, and a pretty good sound system. The Cine Capri is a unique experience since the screen is huge and the sound system is massive, but I am not sure if it's really worth the extra dollar. 

My only real gripe with Harkins (and this applies to most of their locations) is that ticket prices are starting to not be worth their value. While the price itself is not anymore than other theaters, a lot of new theaters have opened in the area that have pure digital screens and sound systems, and they cost the same.Switch... I really miss you.  My four stars are based completely on your food.  If I were to factor in the horrendous service I experienced the last three or four times I was there, there would maybe be one star left.

Being huge fans of FEZ, my husband and I made sure to try Switch.  We went many many times, bringing different people with us every time.  We were proud to call Switch our new hangout.  The Turkey Mac and Cheese was pure heaven, and we ordered it nearly every time.  The sandwiches are always delicious and many of them creative.  The galettes are amazingly delicious with all their flaky yumminess.  There was something new and yummy to try every time we went.

Then we brought my family.  The restaurant was about 2/3 full as it was a Friday night.  Our party of 5 sat at the long high top towards the kitchen.  After being completely ignored for a good 10 minutes, a highly irritable waitress rudely took our order... for drinks only.  She ran off before we could order dinner.  Another long 10 minutes or so, she brought back our drinks and impatiently took our order.  Allowing what seemed to be an eternity to pass, we got tired of being nice and asked someone why we had not been served our food after another 40 minutes or so.  Unacceptable at a restaurant.  The waitress never came back to ask if we wanted anything else or if everything was good or not.  She was entirely too busy flirting with the bartender to pay any attention to us.  We debated dining and dashing, but not really because my parents were with us, and that would be bad...  We paid our bill, and left a tip that sent a message.

I'm sure things have changed since then, it's been a really really long time.  That awful waitress has most likely left, and I am sure most of the early problems have all been hashed out.  Switch, I miss you.  Maybe I can convince the husband to let me see you again.Being a huge fan of Chicago, and the cuisine it creates, I'm always on the prowl for a good Chicago style pizza or hot dog. I stumbled into Johnny's one day on accident after being disgusted by Z Pizza and I'm glad I did. They do the single best reproduction of the true Chicago hot dog I've had in Phoenix. Perfect bun, dog, relish, onions, sport peppers, celery salt, tomato, and pickles. There is no ketchup to be seen, which scored some big points in my book, until I looked around the corner and saw it was served but with french fries... I guess I can let it slide. Johnny is a nice guy and serves great dogs. Can't beleive nobody has reviewed this place yet...Great food....excellent blue plate specials.  Love the meatloaf and the prime rib.  Always good specials on salmon.  Their fish tacos on Fridays are excellent.Beautifully appointed bar with one of the best views in the Valley, rivaling the Wrigley Mansion. The drinks are large and potent - nothing watered down here. Keep that in mind when you see the drink prices. You're paying for a lot more liquor! Good service and always an interesting crowd, including but certainly not limited to guests of the Sanctuary Resort. An impressive place to bring a date that's off the beaten Scottsdale path. Although I live in Phoenix, I stay at Sanctuary at least once a year for a business event with three dozen others, and we rarely venture off-property for drinks during that week because we enjoy Jade Bar so much.Stayed here for a business trip. The rooms were very nice, the pillows were comfy and the best part was the HUGE jetted tub! I will be here again as I had a great dinner at Spiedini and fun in the casino. It was nice to be off the strip and low- keyCentrally located bar, very nice pools, very friendly staff, oddly tiny spas. The day we were there wasn't that crowded, which was all the more relaxing as the cool desert wind blew through my chest hair.One of the big reasons why we decided to stay at the Palms this trip to Vegas was the offer of a comped cabana at the Palms Pool.  In truth, the fiancée and I aren't big on Spring Break-like, raucous pool party atmospheres.  We'd rather relax by the pool and receive attentive food and drink service in the shaded comfort of a cabana rather than be bombarded by loud, big name DJ-curated EDM and Jersey Shore rejects embarrassing themselves while trying to impress members of the opposite sex.  So, we got everything we wanted on a Wednesday afternoon at the Palms Pool as the atmosphere was a distinct 180 from your Ditch Friday (or name any other pool party at any Strip property) crowd. 

Only half of the Palms Pool area was opened up to guests since the crowd was light.  The pool and deck area isn't the largest to be found nor is it the most aesthetically pleasing, but it is clean and seemingly well maintained.  Our cabana could easily accommodate 8-10 people and was equipped with a flat panel TV, misters, which definitely cooled you off especially if the breeze blew in the right direction, and a day bed for our use when we wanted sun ourselves.  One thing it did lack was a safe to store our valuables.  However, it was the friendly and attentive service we received from, our cocktail waitress, Paige (I think that was her name), and the surprisingly good drinks served up by the bar that made the Palms Pool stand out.  Our waitress seemed to always know the right time to check on us, never disturbing us when we were in full relaxation mode (i.e. napping).  As for the drinks, I had the Paloma made with Don Julio blanco, St. Germain, and San Pellegrino grapefruit soda.  It was well executed and remarkably balanced as the St. Germain was used with restraint, not overpowering the tequila.  It was very refreshing on a hot July day!  My second round was the Bloody Sunrise made with Absolut Peppar and the Palms house made bloody mary mix.  Once again, it was a nicely balanced drink made with one of the best bloody mary mixes I've had in a very long time.  Palms Pool impressed with drinks that were legit cocktails and not cloyingly sweet, frozen, tiki-like abominations. 

In the end, Palms Pool may not be for everyone.  But if it's mid-week and you're looking to relax and recharge before tearing it up until the wee hours, then the Palms Pool works like a champ!This place sure has changed a lot over the years - and for the most part, for the better.  They've updated their look since I was last here about 2 years ago with new furniture, paint job, decorations - looks more like a family Italian dinner place than the local, grimy-but-charming Italian lunch place I frequented.

The menu has been changed, and gone are the handful of lunch specials that could be had for $6-10 (this is what I miss), replaced by a single lunch special and a menu where most items are $10-15.  The food had always been good, and that has been maintained.

I still recommend their calzone - at $6.95 and $0.75 a topping, it's a reasonably priced lunch item that WILL fill you up (or provide an afternoon snack).  Italian sausage and basil pesto were delicious!  My friend was very pleased with the shrimp pasta (which he really should have made two meals of, but was wallowing in pleasant agony after finishing).

They still have a bar, and plenty of tv's, and think it likely still a good place to grab an after work libation and catch a game - but only if your part is small - it's not the largest place.

I'll be back for more calzone combinations!GREAT BFast!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! YUM YUM YUM!This is hands down the best breakfast place in town. They do a super lunch and dinner as well, but I usually can't get off the breakfast selections. The "California Omelette" (Avocados, Mushrooms, and Jack Cheese) is superb, as is "The Volcano" which is made up of three fluffy / yummy pancakes, sausage, bacon, and eggs. 

As other reviewers have noted, portions are ginormous. Go planning to share a selection or take at least another meal home with you. There can be a wait on the weekend, but once you get seated, service is prompt and attentive. (Albeit the Fuzzie Bear that walks around can get a little creepy around the fourth table pass).

BBD is supposed to be known for their desserts and they do look good, but the blackberry pie that I took home was more than a little tart and the crust was on the tough side. I wouldn't let this stop you from sampling as it could have been an isolated experience based on their reputation.

There are actually a few locations in the Phoenix area, so visit their website to see which one is closest to you.  http://blackbeardiner.com/location/

This definately isn't your parent's Denny's!I cant say no to 99cent  Sauza margaritas. Or $5.99 steak and eggs. This place has both. Therefore, I was happy, drunk and full.PROS:
+ Fantastic Location: Right on the strip, walking distance to Bellagio and other attractions. 
+ Cheap (see no frills). Seriously, great price for the room and location though.
+ Plenty of parking on their structure which you can access from the lobby.
+ Clean. No frills. Large rooms with decent A/C. 
+ Dollar margaritas at casino downstairs.

CONS:
+ Not the most family friendly place - crowd downstairs can be a bit rowdy at night.
+ You have to go down to the lobby to access the parking structure.
+ Not the nicest room if you're gonna spend a significant amount of time in there.

Have read other reviews complaining about noise but I didn't encounter this problem on our stay.

Love love love Bill's. Will stay here again.We ate outside on the patio on a gorgeous spring day.  The food was light, and delish.  My boyfriend and I split a salad and a sandwich, and they were both much better than we expected.  I would definitely go to NM, just for the cafe.  The sandwich was a veggie one, and was very well made.  The flavors all blended very well, without one overpowering the other.  The salad was very good.  It was pre-tossed with dressing, which usually can be tricky.  Some places put too much, some too little.  At the Cafe, they had the right amount of dressing.  The waitstaff was very nice too.  They butted in an appropriate amount, they didn't hover too much or leave us alone for too long waiting for refills.  

I would recommend eating here when shopping at Fashion Show.  You will not be disappointed.With so many restaurant to choose from on the Strip, the poor little Neiman Marcus Cafe can easily fall by the wayside but if you do find yourself shopping at the fashion mall at the end of the strip, and you'd like to have a quick bite to eat with a cocktail on the patio overlooking the Strip, this is your spot. They earn four stars for their patio and I will also note that their skinny mojitos are delightful as are their cheeseburgers. I wouldn't tell you to seek this restaurant out while visiting Vegas, but it is delightful if you are in the area and crave a patio.Arizona lacks Irish pubs and this pub is exactly what that is. The bartenders remember you by name and for the most part they know you by drink! Fast friendly service! Their food is also surprisingly fantastic! You wouldn't think a place like this would have such phenomenal food. I love this place!The restaurant decor is gorgeous. It's monstrous 30' ceilings and eyeball art on the wall is fantastic. I loved the neon pink menu covers too. It felt very Japanese Pop Art.

The food was good. The soba noodle soup with duck was very tasty and had a good amount of meat in the broth. We had the crispy salmon skin roll and the avocado and mango roll too... Both were good. The fish was fresh, the rolls were neatly packed tight. No complaints here. Our server was attentive and we enjoyed the support staff as well.

The chutoro was fresh but not as tasty as the last time I had it at Morimoto's in NYC. That has to do more with the individual fish though than the actual preparation I'd imagine. There's not much prep besides selection and cutting with a piece of sashimi!

All in all, the experience was a good one. I felt the prices were in line with what I'd pay at Shibuya at the MGM Grand. So yes... I think it's pricey. I don't know that I'd drive out to Red Rock Casino specifically to eat here again considering all of the restaurants between me and it.
But... if someone said, "Hey! I'm going to be at Red Rock," I'd tell them to stop in for a little sake and a bite to eat.Huge expansion. Decent selection of foods! Huge selection of craft beers to add to their pre-tap days offerings. And plenty of live music without a cover (usually). All without sacrificing the dive bar atmosphere.I have eaten here for both lunch and dinner. The food is always fresh and served relatively quickly no matter what time of day you visit. The staff has always been friendly and informative.

Typical AYCE sushi rules apply (no sharing with non/AYCE guests, don't waste the rice, you have approximately an hour to eat, etc.)

Some favorites: Crab roll, 911, Friday 13th v Jason, Spider roll, spiderman, cowgirl, japanese lasagna...there are so many to choose from


This is a small place so you could end up waiting for a table in the evening hours. The good thing is, the service remains at all time high because they can only serve so many people at once. If you can't get a table, order to-go! It's made fresh when you order it, unlike the cold dry sushi that you get at RA!Solid menu, descent quality, GREAT price! 
Loved the atmosphere, dim lighting, digging the paradise tropical theme:) 

The Food: they have make your own shrimp cocktail, fresh strawberries and bananas, bagels and lox. They had a bomb salad bar w this delish seafood salad! 
Hot Food: make your own thanksgiving dinner, egg omelette station, pancakes, french toast! Coffee and frozen yogurt w toppings and baked pastries! Fun date night get creative w your buffet! Definitely going back, next time we visit VegasGreat place to go if you're looking for a sports bar that has more thought and effort into their menu than other sports bars. 

They offer all the faves, Burgers, Wings, Fries, tons of drink choices always something on special it seems. But they also offer more craft options like flat bread sandwiches, pastas, and even jambalaya. 

i also love a place that has projection TVs, so you can REALLY see the game, they have three here. It's also a pretty good place to go for UFC, even though I think it's lame. Either way, if you want to chill with some good food and drink and watch some sports, check this place out. They even have a nice patio with some big screens showing all the action.I have always been trying to find the best lo mein in Vegas and I have found it! Their chicken lo mein is really good- done right. noodles are fresh, very tasty sauce. Have come back for the lo mein twice now :) my husband gets the Szechuan beef noodle soup and loves it. Pot stickers app is also great. We come back to LVH often for this restaurant. 25% off locals too!Romantic place to take your loved one to at night! 

My hubby brought me up here for my first time and boy was it breathtaking! If you come here during fall, I'd recommend to bring your jacket because it does get a bit chile up there at night. The view of the strip is spectacular along with the Bellagio water show. This is definitely a romantic spot to bring your date to! ;)definitely need to get flat screens in the bar area, but thankfully the amazing selection of beers, and Alex and Dave's service, made up for the Analog Bears vs. Vikings game.  

Did i mention all-you-can-eat one topping pizzas for only $7 on Sundays??  i was ashamed i could only make it thru 2 1/2... but they are huge!  unbeatable deal.  Rock!Boulders is one of my favorite lunch spots during the week- it's close enough I can get there during my lunch hour, and not very busy at that time of day so we can get our food quickly.  I get the Honey BBQ Chicken Salad (with no onions! ...no onion?) every time.  My coworkers have ordered a variety of different lunches, and gave two thumbs up to those too.  They have a large beer selection for my beer-drinking friends and really tasty root beer for me!  I haven't been for happy hour or at night for drinks, but I'd like to!Sacks has a great sandwich. Shocking right? But they do and I'll tell you why I like to visit. During the week, often times I am running from meeting to meeting and when lunchtime hits and I'm hungry, I just want to get in and out with a good sandwich in hand. At Sacks, I can do this. It reminds me of another sandwich shop I've been to in another city and I was incredibly happy when I realized the similarities.

I enjoy every sandwich I order at Sacks, especially ones that have cream cheese on them. The sandwiches are the perfect lunch size and not overwhelmingly large that leads to a food coma. A sacks sandwich also comes with a cookie which is an added bonus. The pricing is decent and I can enjoy a nice meal at an economic price in a quick manner. Does it get much better for lunch on the go?

So in summary of my short and sweet and to the point review, my suggestion is that next time you are on the go and looking for a good place to find a sandwich quickly, check out Sacks.I was in Wisconsin for training and wanted a good steak! So my coworkers and I decided to try this place. We went on a Thursday night around 8 and the place was almost empty. We got a nice booth at the bar.  The ambiance and feel of the place was nice. I hate to be stereotypical, but it reminded me of a classic Italian restaurant. And when I saw the picture of Frank Sinatra on the wall, I knew it was official. :o)

To start we tried this fried potato and cheese goodness.  There were four of us so we split it four ways and it was MORE than enough. How can one go wrong with potatoes and cheese??? I tried the smothered steak. It was AMAZING!! The steak was nice and tender and seasoned well. My potatoes were delicious and mushrooms were amazing. Everything was just darn good! Our waitress was attentive and very friendly. We had no problems with the service at all.  She even split our checks and she split the appetizer four ways! We didn't even have to ask! 

If I have to go back to Wisconsin I'll be back at Johnny's. There is another steak I want to try!Brasserie V has an EXCELLENT selection of beers, some of which you can't find in even the largest liquor stores in Madison. Their frites are simply amazing and their meals have also never disappointed me. However, eating here will be anything but cheap and some of the portions have been very small. It has also been very crowded and it can be tough to get service at times. I would suggest Brasserie V for a quick drink and order of frites with friends, that is when this place truly shines.Great place for breakfast or lunch. Service is always fast and friendly.This is the nicest bowling alley I've ever seen. It's a whole other experience. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because the price to bowl is insane. For a family of 4 it's $75-100. Wow!First thing I have to say . . . is that I am sorry for visiting anouther Steakhouse in the Area two nights before . . . and had a Five Star Experience their . . . with that said . . . I would probably have given Binion's a five if it were not for the wine service.

The ambience was very nice and high class . . . took me back to the days of Classy Vegas . . . problem . . . kind of warm . . . would have been nice if it was about 5 degrees cooler.

The appetizer . . . Blue Crab Cakes . . . Full of crab, crunchy, and very tasty . . . would have liked to have had a few larger chuncky of crab meat.

Dinner . . . Chicken Fried Lobster . . . I have now died and gone to heaven . . . the cruchy out side, the melt in you mouth inside.

Desert . . . Creme Brule . . . Small Portion and very cold . . . tasted like it had been made the day before and placed in the cooler . . . berrys were room temperature and not very appealling.

View . . . Best in Vegas . . . most likely will return,I still like the old-school feel of Binion's. Steak was pretty good, too. Be sure you make reservations.The Great Indoors Cafe' is also known as Dazbog and serves really good coffee. I come here a few times a week and always enjoy the folks behind the counter and the pastries. They also have a flat screen tuned usually to the Food Network or the Golf Channel.I went here for dinner with my boyfriend on a Thursday evening. We were promptly seated and given our menus. We ordered the almond crusted lemon chicken and a beef with noodles dish (I can't remember the name of it). The food took a while to get to us, but it was absolutely delicious. The beef was very fragrant--as soon as the waiter placed the dish on our table, we could smell it! The almond crusted lemon chicken was to die for! It almost reminded me of some kind of amazing fried chicken with a sweet lemon sauce. (I could quite possibly eat this food every day.) I knocked off a star for two reasons. One, the food is kind of expensive considering the amount you get. I realize its good quality, but still. Second, service was painfully slow. We expected to be in there 45 minutes and ended up having an hour and a half visit. We were supposed to be at our show at a certain time, so we got very pissed off at how long they were taking to give us our check. Other than that, the place was wonderful and I could see going there again. This place would be great for a romantic meal.If you can get on the guestlist and not have to wait in line, do it! This club was beautiful and had great music. The dance floor was crowded but in a good way. There are definitely a lot of interesting characters here and watching them is half the fun. Overall, a fun night if you don't mind spending some money and waiting in line for a bit.Yum! We went here for dinner tonight and really enjoyed it! We had the coupon from the internet for 2 free glasses of wine which is always nice!

Let me preface this with I can not spell, so please forgive me if I spell the dishes wrong!

The hummus was good, the pita bread was great and warm, not burned or dry. The consistency of the hummus was smooth, probably thanks to the yogurt it's made with.

I have the spanakopita plate (spinach pie) which I thought was very good. Great balance of phyllo dough, spinach and feta. It was nice to have the plate because it came with rice, a small greek salad (which was good - lots of feta, good salty kalamata olives and nice oil and vinegar dressing) and a taste of hummus (we had gotten an appetizer of the hummus as well...we love hummus).

My hubby had the chicken gyro and really enjoyed it. You can pick was dressing you want on the sandwich, which is nice (tsatziki, hummus or something else).

We also had a side plate of the falafel, which was really good! They were small little falafel balls, but the texture was really nice. Very smooth with a great flavor! 

The service was good and quick, the place was clean and the food was good. We will definitely come back here again!Good Greek/Mediterranean food. Yummy hummus, moussaka, etc. Great customer service as well!Other reviews were spot on about the Decor and the Food. The Decor is lacking but I was waited on quickly and my food came to me within a few shot minutes. The Food is excellent and I highly recommend the Papaya Salad on Medium heat, just enough to have a little kick. I also had the Green Beans with Red Curry, also excellent, word to the wise, their hot scale is a real hot scale, so if you order a 10, be forewarned, it'll be HOT. Flavorful and hot. I'm sweating on an 8!Full disclosure, I didn't pay a dime for my meal at Tender. I was being wooed by some suits. So I can't speak to the pricing, just the quality of the food and drinks. Both were very impressive, and classy as hell. The ambiance is old school mahogany-walled fine dining. Honestly it was exactly the kind of place to bring clients or someone you want to impress. I was impressed!

I started with a nice Caesar salad. The classic "feels healthy but isn't" salad. It was great. Not too fishy, dressed nicely, with crisp lettuce and fresh croutons. For the main course, I ordered the filet mignon. They have a bunch of options on their cuts of steak, but there was only one on the menu that the suits gave me, and I can't remember which one it was. But I do remember that it was absolutely delicious. It was cooked maybe 2 minutes longer than it should have been, and that's my only nit pick. It was still awesome, melty, and flavorful. Exactly what you want in a steak. 

The meal was wonderful. The service was very good as well. Waiters were friendly and accessible. Drinks were on point too. I was drinking Old Fashioneds that evening, because the place feels like the kind of place where you order a classy drink. I think I had 3 of them, and they were consistently perfect. Check this place out if you are really into steak and high quality beverages, and have some money burning a hole in your pocket (or can get someone else to foot the bill).Sonic has some great burgers and shakes. Oh and don't for get the tatter tots. Sometimes you just want tatter tots. I haven't been in while because the service can be a little spotty. It has gotten a little better. If you don't like your job or are stressed out please don't take it out on the customer. We just want an awesome burger and some tatter tots. If you don't like your job go find a new one there are plenty of them out there. But while you are there do your best and try and be nice to people. It took me awhile to learn that lesson. I know how it is.
Supersonic Cheeseburger with mustard! So good. All the food is good. Even the grilled cheese on the giant Texas toast is good. I will keep going here and put up with the slightly off the mark service sometimes because the food is so good.A friend of mine and I were searching for a new neighborhood bar, so we checked out this place. It was a cozy little spot that was buzzing with a small local crowd. It was excellent people-watching and we felt pretty comfortable there. It just barely earns a 4 for lack of a 3.5 to score it, but it's definitely worth checking out. Easy-going atmosphere and not terribly noisy or crowded.Even though I don't know the first thing about autombile care, I know when I'm being taken for a sucker. Which is pretty much all the time. What can I do about it since I can't afford a brand new car?  Nothing except make this shop my new tow-to location.  

I felt like I was given a fair price for necessary work (tune-up) and for the first time nobody tried to take advantage of me.  Upcoming concerns were addressed professionally and it was OH, SO refreshing when I realized that I was actually making it out of the shop without some dude coming up to me holding a slightly dusty car part telling me that as I can see this needs to be replaced and the $5 doo-dad can be replaced for only $30 extra. Whew!

ETA: Received a message from this business on my voice mail the other day; following up with the service to see if the problem had returned. More great customer service!These guys do a great job.  The service was good and I never had to wait long for my food or appetizers.  The mini chimichangas were great as appetizers the whole party enjoyed them.  My main meal was good for lunch.  I had the cheese enchilada.  I would definitely go again and take friends.Ah, the Pho cup... full of steamy broth, basil, onion, chives, noodles, slow-cooked brisket and bean sprouts. Ah, how I love you. You give me warm feelings in my belly and you make me want to snuggle up for a nap. You are comfort food - so good!

But, give the Saigon Crepe some credit, too. What a way to kick start the meal. Yep, talk about an appetizer to surprise you with how good it tastes, especially dipped in the mildly spicy chili/vinegar sauce. Loved it! The standard Chinese beer (on happy hour price) hit the spot, too. 

My belly was so full, it wanted to burst.We went here for an anniversary dinner and it was fabulous! We had 7 courses! Some I enjoyed more than others, my fiance at the time liked everything though. I'm a bit more picky.. The atmosphere was beautiful. Excellent wine. Beautiful entrance/ stair case. And I noticed a very reasonable price cheese course that I wanted to get during happy hour, so we'll definitely be back! Servers were also very friendly and on their A game!

Ps. I loved how they referred to this restaurant in a great tv show, Modern Family, like a million times in an episode and I could relate since I've been here!Tried this place again for the second time, and actually had a better experience, so I am upgrading my rating.  Food was better and the service was much better.What originally drew me here was the fact that you could eat and people watch the strip at the same time. DING DING DING! That's all it took to rope me in! We got a bucket of beer, mahi tacos, and some chips & queso and had ourselves a great time here. We ended up accosting some cute guys from the strip, sharing food with them, and it ended with all of us doing shots of tequila. Definitely one of the best dining experiences I had in vegas (as far as fun goes). The atmosphere here is so laid back and great. The servers were attentive and adorable and everything tasted good. I will definitely make this a stop the next time around! 

And I didn't get the skinny on that 'Wall of Fame & Wall of Shame' , but I am making it a goal to get on one or the other next time!I have a strange relationship with this place almost unhealthy.

So at a point in my life I would frequent this place for lunch, when I did I mastered it. So here is the thing- you need to go here for lunch.Dinner is more expensive and is nothing different. Fill up your first bowl- and take a to go box. If you take a to go box on your second bowl they charge you $4.95. Rice noodles are the way to go. 6-8 ladles of sauce is what you need. It stops the meat from frying and gives it flavor. Add an egg. Roti= malaysian paratha=awesome. Philipino sausage is damn good. If you have vegetarian friends or friends with allergy, this a good place. They cook it in a wok for them, unlike most Mongolian grills. 

Flattop is not an authentic Mongolian grill- it does not claim to be. Its about quantity, but with quality. Its not like fine dining quality but its good given that its kind of all you can eat. Its about having fun experiment with the sauces, don't like to experiment ask a waitress for help. Don't like what you made, get another bowl. 

Flattop is about the experience and its been good for me. The service is good and so is the ambiance.Most Vegas food on the go is mediocre at best and likely overpriced. So I must say, I was extremely delighted & surprised to dine here at Earl of Sandwich. Now me and some friends came here after a long night of drinking and a 3-hr heater on a craps table. With the afterparty drinks being on the house, we were still pretty tossed, and this sandwich hit the spot. Sure, it was 9am and we were mad drunk while other tourist families were giving us the staredown, but I do not apologize! After some sleep, I was thinking about killing the world to cure my hangover, and then I started to think about real things like, "was that sandwich really that bomb? or were u really that wasted?" To get to the bottom of it all, I came back...and it really is just that good.

The place is fast and what value! $5.95 flat rate the whole way through! I ordered "the Earl's Club" (Roasted Turkey, Smoked Bacon, Swiss Cheese, Lettuce, Roma Tomato & Sandwich Sauce) and "the Original 1762" (Freshly Roasted Beef, Cheddar Cheese & Creamy Horseradish Sauce)--both scrumptious! The toasted Panini and hot ingredients make this. My biggest complaint is that they could've been bigger--I feel like I could easily eat two of them in one sitting but I'm a fatass personally. I feel like most chicks would be satisfied with one of Earl's "Cannonballs!" [sorry, cheesy bad taste joke ;] But seriously, my other friends recommend that sandwich and "the Italian". Definitely coming back the next time I'm at Planet Hollywood. I would suggest this to anyone in the area looking for a quick bite at a reasonable price.Open 24/7 in the Miracle Mile shopping mall.  You go up, order, pay and wait for the pager to tell you when your order is ready.

Unfortunately they treat every order as a take out, so plenty of wasted plastic bags and the what-not.  Also, after you make your order, you go conveyer line down a series of desserts, chips, and bottled drinks and god help you if you weren't paying attention and have to scramble back to find something because you cause a bottleneck of customers even at midnight.

Other than that, I really enjoyed the two sandwiches I split with the gf.  The Earl's Club (Roasted Turkey, Smoked Bacon, Swiss Cheese, Lettuce, Roma Tomato & Sandwich Sauce) was recommended by the cashier and was very tasty.  The Full Montagu (Roasted Beef, Turkey, Swiss & Cheddar Cheese, Lettuce, Roma Tomato & Earl's Mustard) was also really good.  I honestly couldn't tell you which one I enjoyed more.  Both were served on their own artisan baked loaf.

The strawberry shortcake parfait was okay but overpriced.  I couldn't find the pudding =(

I downed it all with Earl's Grey Lemonade (think Arnold Palmer) which was pretty good.

Absolutely no qualms about trying more sandwiches though!Pretty good for sandwiches I'd say. We've been here a few times and every time it's pretty darn good. The last time we went I got the chipotle chicken sandwich and it was the best one I've ever had there. I also got the broccoli soup and it was creamy and delicious. Their desserts are also quite delightful...cakes, muffins, etc Yum!
My husband got the Original 1762 sandwich and he really enjoyed it. The Earl's Cub is even better according to him. I really think it's their warm and fluffy breads and tangy sauces that put them a notch above most other sandwich places.
You can tell all of the ingredients are fresh, so I don't mind paying 7ish dollars for a sandwich that IS smaller than a Togo's sandwich in comparison. 

I am not orgasmic over this place like my best friends are, but it's a cheaper lunch option in Vegas if you want to pass over the typical buffet, and the food is really fresh and high quality for a sandwich shop. 

I'm sure we'll return.I'm not a huge fan of sub sandwiches or sandwich shops in general but EoS hit the spot for a quick bite before a night of debauchery. The Chipotle Chicken Avocado hot sandwich was just delicious. I seriously considered coming back for seconds when we rolled back in to Planet Hollywood at 5am!Sandwiches don't excite me too much. When it does, it's goooooood. Why did I wait this long before trying EoS? I love their crunchy bread. Their meat to bread ratio isn't the greatest. Too much bread, not enough meat...but if you're carbo-loading or drunk, I guess that's a good thing.

The Original 1762:
Roast beef, bacon, cheese, horseradish sauce. The flavor combinations were good. The saltiness from the beef and cheese plus, the nostril-burning sensation form the horseradish. 4.5/5

Tuna Melt:
Albacore tuna salad & Swiss cheese. I only trust tuna sandwiches from a handful of places because I don't want a fishy and gross sandwich. 4/5

I've heard good things about the Montagu so, I'll try that next time.With its extremely friendly staff and great waffles, Indie Coffee is like a big warm hug, with coffee...and waffles. I just moved to Madison, and it's my new favorite place to go when I'm having a sub-par day. Get a waffle and a latte, grab a copy of the onion, and sit and ignore the rest of the world for a while. Tables seem to be sometimes wobbly and chairs aren't the most comfortable. If I lived closer I'd be there every day!Yummmmmy! This was really good. I had the fresh spring rolls which tasted great. I just wish that they didn't cut them into pieces. I had the Sizzling beef which had a really good savory taste. I wish I had more room in my tummy for more food. I will definitely go back.Great place, fast service, lots of options. You really can't go wrong here. If you're not in the mood for pizza, you can get a salad, panini, or pasta; I've never tried their panini or pasta options, but they sound very good, and their salads are definitely really good! Nice and fresh. My favorite would probably have to be the chicken, spinach and apple one, but they're really all good. 

Usually for pizza, my friends and I will each get our own (they only come in 12", which is too bad - you can't get something bigger or smaller depending on how hungry you are) and just share them all. Favorite so far is the Chicken Pesto, but I also wanna try the Portobello and Artichoke. You can choose thin or thick crust, but get thin - it's best by far.

Cool, fun vibe. Love to come here, and will more and more in the future!I've been here a couple of times and had a great time! I'm not a fan of many hookah lounges in Las Vegas except for this one. 

Enjoyed a lovely dinner with our group. Ordered hookah and it was great, service was awesome! Our waiter was very attentive and treated us great. We stayed for some music and dancing and I was very pleased with the DJ. Played all sorts of songs hip hop, dance, Persian, Arabic etc. LOVED IT! Although I had a great time the only problem I have is that towards the end of the night the DJ kept replaying tracks.. Got old! 

But other then that, we had a great time and will definitely be coming back!I went in with no expectations and was extremely pleased with the phood. I did take the food to go, so I did not experience their uncourteous-ness. Those that attended to me were quite helpful. I will gladly eat there again next time I am in Vegas.Ya know, I really like this place.  They have enough varieties of tea that I could come here 70 more times and never duplicate.  That makes for great selection, but also almost a good five minutes for me to settle on one.

I would have liked it a little more if it weren't for the teeny-bopper staff.  For some reason I didn't have the most confidence that they could steer me to a savory selection to my liking.  One of them did get me a sample of one of the featured iced teas of the day without me even asking, which was nice.  I ended up with a small pot of pomegranate black tea, which yields you 2 cups.  My friend ordered a round, chocolate decadent dessert which I sampled and it was delish!

They have pots, mugs, filters, and other fun tea accessories.  I'm glad to see a shop entirely devoted to tea since I drink more of that than coffee and tea shops are hard to come by.  I'll definitely be back to try another tasty tea and probably another dessert too...This is a really nice small airport. No issues leaving nor arriving and the place is just beautiful. Super clean and it even has an art exhibit in the front.

Staff was super nice even when I messed up the security scan by forgetting both my phone in my pocket and my dog tags. They have a full body scanner btw. And also all the cheese I was bringing back they had to check but it was all good. They told me the only cheese I couldn't bring back is cheese spread.You know the holiday is coming when The Wisconsin Cheeseman catalog arrives in your mailbox.

Let's see.  A Gouda Santa?  Check. 
Sixteen oz. cans of cheese spread (smoky, bacon cheddar, sharp cheddar, blue cheese, wine)? Check.  
Sausage Master sampler? Check.
Cheese curds & batter? Check.
Foot long pecan log? Check.
Christmas Stollen? Check.

You KNOW there's someone on your gift list who would dig this.The moment you walk in the door and hear Italian on the TV and those behind the counter speaking the same you get the feeling your food is going to taste as authentic as the people who prepare it- and it does.  We tried several items the pasta was great and the Big Beef Sandwich with sauteed onions also good.  The people who work here are very friendly and the service was fantastic.  They played with our girls who loved their bread and pasta and often giggled when the waiter joked with them.  We tried two deserts (dont know what they were) but they were also great.  We will be back soon.I don't understand the lack of love here for Qdoba. Maybe everyone has been sucked into the Chipotle burrito-sphere and the refried beans are affecting their brains. There are enough tortillas in the world to support more than one fast food burrito joint, people!

Don't get me wrong. I like Chipotle too. I will enjoy a burrito bowl there from time to time. But Qdoba has one thing Chipotle doesn't offer - their queso dip. A squirt of cheesy heaven, Qdoba's queso makes everything taste better. 

My favorite thing to get is their nachos. They load 'em with beans, your choice of meat, salsa, cheese, sour cream and 3-cheese queso. YUM! You get a heaping serving of salty yumminess for like $6.00. If I'm starving I can finish a whole plateful but there is certainly enough to share.

So do yourself a favor and indulge in a little queso therapy next time you're craving some fast mexican food. You may never visit Chipotle again.This place would have gotten a 5 star, but they got rid of their Happy Hour prices!  But still not bad for $13.95 per person.  Went on a Sunday for lunch.  The food was great that day, the last time I was there the consistency wasn't the same.  My main love in that place....the sukiyaki beef!  I LOVE LOVE LOVE the fatty beef with the broth, simmering with onions and tofu and cabbage.  Getting hungry just thinking about it!  I could eat plates of it over some rice.

Their sushi is normal fare, lots of California type rolls...some with roe on top, some with avocado, and even some with eel on top.  Their best sushi bet is the hand rolls (you have to ask to have them made).  They come out the freshest and taste the best.  For you beginners, go with the California hand roll.  Me, I like the spicy tuna.

Lunch that day had a good menu, of course the usuals like fried rice, noodles and tempura.  But they actually had fried oysters that day for lunch too which was unusual because I usually only see them during dinner.  Needless to say, the gf had like 2 dozen of em' because she loves her oysters  (heh heh...good for the libido too *wink**wink*).

I wish they didn't charge for drinks, but their peach iced tea (I think it's peach) is really refreshing.  Just ask for iced tea, and it already comes that way.  Their dessert selection for lunch wasn't bad, some strawberry shortcake, some cheesecake, a green tea cake, couple other things I can't remember, and fruit with the chocolate fondue fountain.  They also had the shave ice machine going that day and ice cream too.  My favs are the shave ice with strawberry, and I like the red bean ice cream.  For you folks from Hawaii, ask for a scoop of vanilla ice cream in your bowl before the shave ice goes in there....almost like home!

This one is the nicest Makino's in LV, too bad the other new one in Summerlin had to close down.  The decor isn't so 'cafeteria' like the other 2 locations.  I still go here for lunch if I need a sushi fix on the weekends.Olive garden, more like I love garden. lol ok, this place is famous for there endless breadstick and salad. If you can stop from eating this which is so hard to do, the food is awesome! I sometimes ask for substitutions on my orders like to add chicken or a different sauce, and I have never had a problem. They are always friendly and always recommending different things to try.... I usually go for dinner so I can't speak about the lunch menu.Amazing! This was my first Cirque show, and if the others are anything like this one, I'd love to see more. I'm a HUGE Beatles fan, so I, of course, had to see this one first. The music was great, duh, but I was also blown away by the sheer athleticism of the performers. They are all simply incredible. I also loved the art direction of the show; the sets, the scrims (I especially loved the images projected on them), the costumes, etc. The interpretation of the songs and the lives of the Beatles' was so interesting and I'm very excited to watch "All Together Now," the documentary based on the creation of this show all the more. If you're a Beatles' fan, this show is a must see.Good show, but some criteria to help you decide whether to go for Love or some other cirque show:

- there's less acrobatic acts than other cirque shows, but more emphasis on choreography, sets, and other action on stage. Depends on what you like.
- most of the acrobatic displays are aerial, and no stunt type acts
- read up a bit on Beatles history before going to fully appreciate
- it's a very small theatre, so even the worse seats are pretty close to the stage!
- there's also loads of half price offers floating around all the time, so check those out before booking
- the show is about 2 hours long

And don't forget to catch the Mirage volcano eruption at the entrance to the building! Erupts every hour in the evening, so time your arrival/departure at The Mirage.A cuisine that has recently started appearing on the Vegas food scene is Chinese Szechuan, and one of the first restaurants to start serving it was Yunnan Garden. Szechuan cooking is much spicier than food from other regions of China, yet traditionally, Szechuan cooking was not as pungent or as hot as it is today. I don't find Szechuan cuisine I've had to be nearly as hot as what I've had at Indian or Thai restaurants, so if you prefer milder foods you don't have to avoid this cuisine that sounds spicier than it is.

The first dish that came to us today was the least impressive and least expensive, the Dan Dan Noodle ($5.95). It consisted of a sweet and overly salty sauce underneath a mound of noodles sprinkled with peanuts. You mix the noodles and sauce to combine, which you can somewhat do in a way that caters to your own preference for heavy or light dressing. The next dish to arrive was #156, sauteed seasonal vegetables with garlic sauce ($7.85, I'm not an expert on Chinese vegetables, but after looking at some pictures online I think what we had was Choy Sum). Though this generic 'seasonal vegetable' dish appears on most Chinese menus, you aren't quite sure what exactly what you'll be getting, and the degree of expertise used to prepare it can vary dramatically. This version was fantastic, with perfectly cooked vegetables, a light sauce that barely coated them, and excellent flavor. It's hard to tell where the flavor is coming from since there is barely any color, but I'm guessing there might be some MSG in there somewhere, judging by how shiny it was (Anthony Bourdain claims food gets glossier the further West you move due to the use of this magical ingredient. MSG produces a sensation on the tongue which can only be described as umami). Other than the fact that children and pregnant women should stay away from it, I'm not averse to the use of MSG. It's a pretty remarkable ingredient that can really add to a dish, however, it should be consumed in moderation and is usually considered culinary cheating. If the vegetables didn't have MSG, the Fish Fillet in Spicy House Special Sauce ($10.25, #57) that was our entree almost certainly did (see how shiny it is in my picture). I was totally willing to risk consuming the controversial ingredient, however, because the dish was great and a fantastic deal; the plate could easily have served four people with hearty appetites. Though seafood is not an integral part of Szechuan food, freshwater fish is, and there is an abundance of it on Yunnan's menu. This fish was flaky and moist, and the sauce was pungent, spicy, and rich with the color of chilies. I loved the use of crunchy fried soy beans on top and the bed of incredibly fresh soy bean sprouts underneath, but it was a bit oily. Despite the oil, I didn't feel stuffed, and despite the possible health risks, I would order it again.

It's a little difficult to get your bearings when ordering at Yunnan Garden as the choices are numerous and the descriptions vague, but everything coming out of the kitchen looked pretty good. Don't count on much help deciphering from the waitstaff unless you speak the language, but if you stick to your personal preferences you should be fine. Just remember, don't bring the kids and leave the pregnant ladies at home. (Note: Many restaurants -not just Chinese- use MSG, and it is also present in a lot of processed snack foods because of its addictive qualities. I'm not trying to single out Yunnan Garden as a culprit.)

Tip: The restaurant is difficult to find. The best way I can direct you is to go to the far back side of the one story strip mall between Valley View and Arville on the south side of Spring Mountain. It's part of that same set of buildings.Wife and I had the lunch buffet.  The food was outstanding everything was awesome especially the rice dish.  The food has some similarities to Northern Indian food so it seemed familiar to me but different enough to intrigue me.  The only con was the bread which I guess is traditional but I found very dry.  We will go back for dinner for sure.I go here for lunch with friends a few times a month.  Had various types of the Pho, all delicious.  The food quality is consistently good.  Vietnamese iced coffee is very good.  I'll continue going back for a long time.If you have to wait in line and some of you will this place is worth it. The decor is excellent and the music was great. The crowd was decent and the drinks were pricey but strong. If you're club hopping in Vegas give Poetry a try.This is our favorite happy hour spot, especially when it's cooler outside and you can sit on the patio with the heaters and fire going.

Happy Hour is 3-7PM and 9-CLOSE, in the bar and outside patio areas.  $1 off beer, $5 cocktails, and some appetizer deals.  Last night we ordered my go-to favorite GB beer- Marzen.  Always delicious.  We also got the Homemade Chips ($5; with bacon, blue cheese, some blue cheese sauce (we assumed), and green onions).  They were good, not great, but we ordered a side of blue cheese dressing and that bumped them up a notch.  Also ordered the pork sliders ($5 for 3 total with some onion straws/rings).  They were tasty, but again, not fabulous.  The onion straws were good, though a touch on the greasy side.

I LOVE the crispy artichoke hearts that they have, though they are not on the new happy hour menu, which is sad for me. :-(  Still enjoy our HH though.

Service was good.  Started out strong and then fizzled.  At 530PM on a thursday, the seats were pretty plentiful and it never got packed, but did fill in nicely as the night progressed.  Total came in around $34 (tip included).Really enjoyed the "MOONSHINE" beverage with 4 shots. It was pretty strong but it was pretty tasty. Had me buzzing a little while walking along the strip. Saved the tall cup as a souvenir (: definitely a MUST try !I ate at this restaurant twice during my trip to Vegas. I must say, their prices are a bit steep for the food they serve, but they are relatively healthy compared to the other places on the strip.  Don't forget to check in on yelp to get a discount! I got tried their buffalo chicken wrap and their caesar salad.  Both were what you would expect BUT do get their cilantro lime sauce in their sauces section! It is delicious with their food, which is why they get four stars instead of three. Such a fan of this sauce, I wanted to try and replicate it at home!Great food and service. Third city and the grand lux never disappointsThis guy is full of energy. 

I've actually seen the show about three times now. Once at Planet Hollywood years ago and twice at Gold Nugget, where he currently resides. The production value is quite high and his band is fantastic. His vivacious performance leads you on a ride. By the end of the show I'm exhausted for him. 

He has some really great impressions, he's funny as hell and he has a great singing voice. Granted, this show is geared for the older crowd, but growing up my mom made sure to expose me to everything no matter the generation, so I followed along pretty well. 

Definitely a great show. Look out for discounted and free local discounts. It's worth the trip downtown.Let me preface this review by saying that I in no way would be able to afford this restaurant on my own. But since I was here with my co-workers for a work dinner we got to expense it (woo-hoo!). 

We were here on a Sunday night for dinner and sat in the main dining area. There's a section that's very loungy with couches that overlooks the Bellagio...great view but the couches seem like they would be uncomfortable to eat an entire meal on. 

I got a bottle of the Star Rabbit sparkling sake- my ultimate favorite drink! I never find it anywhere and I was so excited they had it here. 
We started with the Cucumber Sunomono- a light pickled cucumber salad. I thought it was a great refereshing way to start the meal. Then we got the Vegetable Tempura which had asparagus, onions, shiitake mushrooms, eggplant, green beans and yams. I thought it was delicious. We also started with the Tuna Sashimi which was to die for. It came served on top of the most amazing sauce with jalapeno and garlic chips. One of my co-workers also ordered the kobe beef potstickers which he said were fabulous.
For our entree I shared the Spicy Tuna, Shrimp Tempura and Vegetable rolls which were all great. The spicy tuna was my favorite. A little random but we also shared a side of the Shishito Mashed Potatoes which were so creamy and delectable. 

Dessert had to be the most amazing part of the meal. We ordered the dessert platter which consisted of Molten Chocolate Cake, Koi's Signature Cheesecake (white chocolate with raspberries....YUM), Berry Cobbler w/ice cream, and Vanilla Creme Brulee. Oh. My. GOD. 
It was so incredible. Between 6 people we devoured the entire thing. 

Our service was a little slow at times but our waiter was still attentive and very nice. 
All in all a fabulous experience.You all know about the fabulous suites.

Handing out free popsicles by the pool - that is a nice touch.  Lots of nice pools so there is no need to pay and go to Azure.

You get a little sick of hearing Phantom every time you ride the elevator.If you aren't sure where to have dinner that night - go straight to the Palazzo and you'll be pleased with the variety of it's restaurants, quality of food, beautiful decor, incredible music and elegant atmosphere. 

Good possibilities for one of the best shopping and shows!It only took me one visit at Bazic and I never went back because of how pricey the wings were.  However, I will forever remember their chicken wings! It was crispy, crunchy, fried with olive oil and damn good! 

I thought they closed down but surprisingly they are still open under new management.  They brought the old chef back so the crispy grilled wings and bbq soy marinade are still being served and in their new special menu with lower prices.

Because this is a Korean owned spot, they do serve kimchi and other vegetable dishes on the side with your order, which is added bonus!This is my other go-to karaoke bar! The food, service, and song selections are great. It doesn't smell funky like Zizzy does, which is a big plus. 

For an interesting surprise, go to the bathroom and check out the wall decor lolThis store has become my morning power walk destination ...i felt it was a trader joes with expanded aisleways  ( my main beef with trader joe's ) i like the meat and cheese selection...the prices...hmmm...jury is still out on that one...comparable to trader joe's...the specials probably give f&e the upper hand over trader joes...  it's a welcome addition to my neighborhoodAfter reading the Italy chapter of "Eat Pray Love", I am all about finding delicious authentic pizza and experiencing the same bliss the character in the book did while eating it. I would say this is probably as close as I have come in the states. Homemade mozzerella cheese, fresh basil, perfectly seasoned marinara, giant meatballs, chewy crispy pizza crust. We had the spinach salad which comes with a warm onion bacon vinagarette, and the margarita pizza. We had to order a second pizza it was soooo good.  It was a great atmosphere and friendly staff. Our waitress was very helpful and had a comfortable manner.  She did include the gratuity, which is poor taste to me, so watch out not to pay a tip twice. (Other than that I loved the place.)More like a 3.5 but I'll bump up because it's a cute, busy place with reasonable prices. 

The pizza crust is pretty good except the center still gets soggy. Maybe Neapolitan's are like that because I've yet to find one with a crispy crust in the middle. They kind of skimp on the basil though. Chicken pesto lasagna was very rich but not enough chicken. It had a nice sauce that I soaked up with the accompanying bread.  Get this if you love cheese. We also had the the rigatoni al forno which didn't seem like anything special.  We calamari and cheesecake passing by our table looked really good but I wasn't hungry enough to try.Well, I know absolutely nothing of Chicago pizza (New Yorker here), but I thought their deep dish was pretty good. I like the sauce; it is a bit sweet as others have mentioned.  I ordered a small deep dish with pepperoni, sausage, mushrooms and peppers. The bottom crust was a bit soggy, but other than that, it tasted great to me. I also got a small thin crust white pizza, which is very good too, just not anywhere near a 'real' white pizza (this one has artichoke, spinach, mozzarella and garlic/olive oil). The Yelp user photos got me in the door and I'm glad I gave Amore a try! I'll probably return when I'm craving a change from my usual NY thin crust.I am a fan of Pappadeaux...Went on a Saturday night in JUNE; seated right away; hostess/manager came by to say our server just had a "7 top" and was taking their order; and would be there to get our order.  It took over 15 minutes to get our drink order; because none of the wait staff or management told our server that we were seated behind a wooden support beam.  We didn't even get water; not good...But after our server saw us he apologized for the delay; and the meal was great from that moment on; the food & drinks were great.  Our server after the rocky start; was one of the best I ever had at any establishment.We went to meet some friends and had drinks while our friends finished dinner.  The server was OUTSTANDING!!!  She knew her job and did it with amazing accuracy! I have not had this kind of service since leaving Okinawa.  The place was packed but we were acknowledged immediatly and there was no issue when we joined our friends. :-)  CANNOT wait to go back for a full meal!!I am a fan of Tawainese Spicy Beef Noodle Soup. The broth is dark, heavy and flavorful. It is a perfect soup during desert winters. Stinky tofu is very tasty, salty and stinky just how I like my Stinky tofu!Selection at this grocery store is excellent, but prices are very high. The store is clean and well-staffed. There is good Deli counter, fresh seafood, typical sushi offering, good selection of fresh fruits and vegetables...and a Starbucks located inside the store and a gas station offering prices similar to other outlets (the only reason this store gets four stars is the Starbucks and Gas Station).

However, prices are really too high to be sustainable. I expect to rate this grocery store down in the future if prices do not accurately reflect economic conditions in the Las Vegas valley.During a recent trip to Vegas, we had a few places in mind that we just had to try; Payard was one of those places. It's located somewhere in the maze of a hotel that is Caesar's Palace... both times we ate there we nearly got lost, but alas we were able to find it and indulge in some of the yummiest breakfast/lunch food in Vegas. 

Payard is made up of two parts; there is a breakfast/lunch sit down restaurant and an attached walk-up pastry/chocolate counter. We tried both parts during our vacation. First was the actual restaurant... we slept in a little too long for breakfast, but we ate lunch and were able to get a couple of lunch items that were very 'breakfast-y' anyway. First thing we noticed was the decor... the set up of this place is awesome; the colors and overall style of the place is just very vibrant. Additionally the kitchen is a circular area in the middle of the restaurant... so nothing is hidden; I love that! 

We ordered the french toast which came in a bed of fresh fruit and some kind of fruit flavored sauce. The flavor was amazing, not too heavy but very rich and flavorful. Next we ordered eggs florentine which was served on a crispy crescent roll... and we also got a side of bacon. All in all each part of the meal was near perfect... taste was outstanding and everything just seemed very fresh. A couple days later we also tried the pastry counter, and ordered a ham/cheese sandwich type thing (don't remember the actual name they called it) along with an apple crepe. Just like the restaurant itself, it didn't disappoint. Heavy on flavor, not too greasy, and oh so rich... it hit the spot perfectly. 

Payard is the type of place I love... solid food and a classy atmosphere, while not being ridiculously priced. It's earned a spot for us as a 'go-to' Vegas breakfast/lunch spot from now on. Can't wait to go back and try their full breakfast menu. This place gets my stamp of approval, next time you're in Vegas if you can find this place... give it a shot!After so much hype from my aunt and cousin about Payard in NY, I eventually made a trip out there years ago (probably close to 8 years ago).  Wasn't impressed with either the food nor the dessert, and was skeptical when a good friend mentioned that Wolfgang Puck said that Payard had the best macaroons.

Located inside the Caesar's hotel (not the Forum Shops) you'll see this little bistro with a cool looking clock (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw?select=HK3bDDmzc9XWsm7OY_05Og).  Still feeling the sugar high and saving room for the nights dinner, I only purchased a box of macaroons.  Best part of it was that it was the last box ... atleast that's what they said (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw?select=nOAbwLCOW974lJNWY2gNFg).  What sucks is that you don't get to choose the flavors, everything is preboxed to go.  Not exactly sure as to how fresh these little bad boys were but the texture and flavors were similar to what you'd find at Paulette.  I'd have to say that I think Paulette's were a bit better in my mind.  Perhaps it's the fact that we didn't get to pick and choose the flavors or the fact that one of them was damaged in the box.  It did however, come with a pretty cool little box.I came here with my wife for a Sunday brunch and got exactly what I was looking for. Very good bistro fare at a price that I knew was coming. It's about $20 - $25 a person, and for the portion sizes it is certainly a little on the expensive side, but the food is rock solid and so was the service. We were seated almost immediately, and I feel like it was just due to us being polite and not interrupting the woman as she was working. She found us a table for two and instantly we were asked what beverages we would like. I ordered a coffee and they brought it out post haste with milk. Cafe con Leche is one of the world's perfect things, but they bring sugar for you as well. We both ordered sandwiches, which came with a delicious salad. The sandwiches were smallish, but I didn't leave hungry and I didn't find myself having anything else to eat until many hours later.

Very happy that I ate here, and I would recommend it to anyone that likes French food.There are a few things I need in life to be happy - in no particular order:

-good friends
-sugar free red bull with a straw
-moderately slutty dress and heels
-fake eyelashes
-opportunity to meet new friends
-bottle service
-hearing poison by Bell Biv Devoe at least once during the night

Eye Candy provided all of the above.  And our under 21 homey got a chance to hang with the big kids.  We had a great time - BUT - this crew would have made a trip to the dentist fun.My first visit, just a fifteen minute drive from the condo. I liked everything about Lucille's. The white clapboard exterior trimmed with green & white awnings, invites everyone. Very remindful of my days on the Mississippi Gulf Coast. The Jambalaya was superb, loaded with shrimp & andoulle sausage, rice, peppers & a reaux that was delicious. The apple butter & freshly baked biscuits were as good as advertised. The Corona was ice cold, with attentive servers. $46 included tip & tax.   NICE DEAL !!Ok, I really like this spot.  First, I think they must have the frostiest beers in Las Vegas.   They come out so cold that a thin layer of ice forms on the top and along the sides of the mug.  Big kudos.  The food is consistently good, especially their tacos.  I had the chicken tacos with teriyaki sauce and pineapple in them.  Very tasty indeed.  The only obstacle to a perfect 5 stars would be the overall ambiance.   Maybe I'm being picky but the place often feels a little dead.  Don't let that dissuade you though, try the food and have a cold one!My husband and I give this restaurant a four and a half.  We went there for the first time today (04.20.14).  First of all, we were greeted the moment we walked in by the cheerful hostess and seated right away.  Our server, Andrew, was very attentive and checked back on us and made sure we had refills on our iced tea.  We started with nachos which were good.  I ordered the fish tacos which were very tasty and came with a side of beans topped with some sort of queso fresco.  I don't usually go crazy over beans but I have to say that these were very delicious!  The fish tacos were cooked well and had a creamy sauce - yum!  My husband ordered the tortilla soup and said it was delicious.  The restaurant seemed very clean and again, the staff made it a very pleasant experience.  I don't usually choose "island" type restaurants or burgers but I was glad that we visited and would definitely go back!4.5... One of their beers was really good. great taste. We also ordered a dozen wings and a small pizza, food tasted great, service was fast. Great place to have a beer and some finger food.After hearing so many good things about Bountiful Baskets I just had to give it a try, especially with a pick up location just down the street.

While I love the idea of the co-op and I look forward to getting my basket, I really wish they had smaller basket options. Unless I am able to convince my sister to go halves with me and my husband I find that a lot of produce ends up going to waste. I would also love a fruit only option. Despite my minor complaints, the price vs. the amount of produce you get is awesome and a great inspiration for meal planning.For the most part, I have enjoyed eating at this buffet for lunch.

There is a variety of sushi that is fresh for the most part. The salads and pastas are made under your order, and are very tasty as well. I also liked the assortment of the Asian food and the Southern barbeque. However, in my opinion, the dessert is best part; with many ice cream flavors, cupcakes, eclairs, different cakes, mini donuts and cookies, you definitely will have a good time if you're a dessert person.we eat here everytime were in vegas. i even had my wedding reception here in may of this year.very friendly staff and the manager was super nice. they have different types of food stations so you will be stuffed when you leave and the dessert bar is way good!With the sushi wave cresting I was beginning to wonder if anyone in this town knew that there was more to Japanese cuisine than sushi. With restaurants like Ippei and Taneko Tavern failing, the choices for Japanese dining beyond sushi were scarce. Enter Roka Akor.

So much to talk about, I'll just hit the highlights. First, the design of the restaurant is amazing. Very contemporary with just the right touch of modern Japanese influence. The Shochu Lounge rocks. The sake selection is extensive and the shochu drinks are inventive thanks to master mixologist Carson Quinn.

A friendly staff serves the exceptionally prepared food with as much attention to presentation as mouth-watering flavors. Some of the menu's highlights include the Butterfish Tataki, Black Cod and the spectacularly large Madagascar Prawn. In addition to the grilled delights, the selection of sushi and sashimi is unique with inventive combinations like the Age Watari Gani roll featuring soft-shell crab, cucumber, kimchi and chili mayonnaise.My friend suggested that we check this place out.  I was pleasantly surprised that the venue was much bigger than I thought it was.  Also the All You Can Eat Menu had a lot of different things that I haven't seen on other menus around town.  The sushi was great.  The one roll I compare restaurants with is the salmon skin roll and I liked it here.ayce is the best. great flavor. less one star though because 3 times we did ayce, food was really sloooow to come out from the kitchen.Finally got the chance to sample this southwestern sushi spot.

Restaurant design: very modern. Comfortable seats everywhere, very nice lounge with its own TV, huge counters at the bar. One of the largest interiors I've seen. The only weird thing is how low the armchairs in the lounge are. Luckily, we didn't have to deal with that since we didn't fill the table.

Service: consistent pacing throughout the night. Could be because we were the lounge table, but I'll take that versus sometimes being forgotten.

Picks:

Nigiri: everything was delicious through and through, even the tuna. The spicy tuna was a bit overwhelming for my sensitive palate. Smoked salmon special here is superior to Goyemon's special. Uni is the best quality other than when I tried Kaze's AYCE sashimi lunch. There were some issues with seaweed wrappers from different pieces sticking to each other though.
Oysters: no real off flavors and haven't gotten sick yet, so that's a win for me
Baked mussels: solid
Fried calamari: fine
Lasagna roll: didn't notice much difference with the inclusion of avocado, and good quality
Parfait: really, really good. Fruits and crunchy granola made me really happy. Glad I made this my limit-one-dessert-that-isn't-ice-cream-scoops choice.

Passable:

Dynamite: pretty good, but the sesame threw me off.
Surf n Turf sizzling plate: beef strips and shrimp on a bed of onions and cabbage. Not bad, but not great.
Hot sake: average, I suppose. Best part was that it was a Mon/Tues 2-for-1 special.

Pans:

Popcorn scallop: pretty useless.
Amaebi head: brain drained. I feel like they did this as a restaurant-wide strategy to appeal to a more mainstream palate (you can tell by how they let you order yum yum sauce on the side). Would've liked all off the flavors to be there.
Ice cream: while the green tea was pretty good, the vanilla was not that impressive and the texture of both had noticeable ice crystals

Overall, I enjoyed the meal with a few notable exceptions. It's worth the drive if you want a change from your normal sushi spot. I'd probably come back to explore the rolls since we didn't really plumb the depths of that extensive part of the menu.Sushi Eye in Motion was only my second sushi experience and I enjoyed it very much. I went with some veteran that knew what they were doing so that helped. They first sat us at the bar thing that had the conveyer belt in front of us but that stressed me out too much so we moved to a table and go a menu :)  I had the shrimp tempura and it was awesome. I let my friends get the actual sushi and I tried theirs. It was great. Way better than my first experience. I would recommend this place. Just not sitting at the conveyer belt. That was the only weird part.Went to this place after purchasing a living social deal. I was impressed with their happy hour as well as the sushi belt that tempts you the entire meal. Flat out amazing oysters. Average sushi. Amazing oysters.This restaurant is located in the food court of the Stratosphere. Desiring Mexican food and not wanting to venture out of our hotel, my family and I decided to give El Nopal a try.

The horchata here is delicious. I ordered a carne asada wet burrito. My sister got enchiladas and my dad got a taco salad. The menu selection is wide and so there are a lot of decisions to be made. You can help narrow your choices by choosing the form of food (e.g. tacos, burritos, and enchiladas). My sister's shredded chicken enchilada was better than my burrito and my burrito was better than her shredded beef enchilada. The shredded chicken was nice and moist.

My family and I decided to come back the next day for breakfast/lunch. I got the shredded chicken enchilada and again it was good chicken. I was also able to consume the refried beans with the rice quite happily. Finally, I had a taste of my mom's eggs. I liked the taste. The eggs were prepared with cheese and green bell peppers.Good show to walk and see a large diversity of skilled artists. While the quality of the styles and prices varies greatly, there is almost always a few that make it well worth the visit. Good for families too as there is a variety of entertainment, face paining, etc. which makes it fun for everyone.

One of the best ways to get very nice, custom artwork for your home.

Grab some friends, family or colleagues and make plans to spend the day shopping great art, jewelry, pottery, glass, wood, sculpture, and various other handmade goods.OMG! I didn't know on Wednesday's it's $2 off the salad bar and hot dishes! Awesome surprise for my lunch today! YUMMY!If you have not been it's time to go .  Great  Homey Food and excellent service.   
We have been meaning to try Town Talk since last years Cajun festival . 
Last night we tried their Beef Brisket Sandwich ,,which  had taa daa a lovely pink smoked edge..that's when you know its good.  BBQ was really tangy , spicy but not overpowering  ..I should have bought a bottle of it!   I had coleslaw which was  good but not my style . The mustard potato salad tasted really good nice spices that enhanced the flavor without overpowering it. 
We also tried the cobblers which were outstanding great blend of fruit , crust and sugar. Just wanted a bigger portion!! 

The family that runs this place was so friendly and hospitable I felt like I was in someones home. Food arrived promptly and they wouldn't allow us to tip them! WOW!   

We will be back !! Maybe time for a UYE!Great local pub. Good Beer selection on Tap. A friend of mine recommended the Jameson flight which was great to try on a hot weekend night. 

Friday night bands are always fun & fill the bar.The menu is vast and we've had a good sampling of it over the years including Tom Ka Koong, Tom Ka Kai, Larb salad, pot stickers, and fried trout lemon grass. All of which I would recommend without hesitation. I've eaten the red, green and panang curries which are usually all good. On my last trip I ordered the panang curry and it was a bit disappointing as the chicken and green beans were over cooked and a bit short on the red pepper slices. 
The walls are finished with wood paneling and carvings which are 1 part traditional and 1 part dated but its a nice break from the ultra hip granite steel and marble of vegas' upscale dining scene. Well known tunes from the last 3 decades seep out of the speakers at a level which doesn't interfere with conversations. Even at near capacity, the room is still quiet enough to feel relaxed but energized.
I requested booth seating and the hostess guided me to the one remaining spot. Gracious considering that several parties came in after me and I was taking up a four top alone. Years ago when I first found Pin Kaow, service was slow and you likely had to ask when you were ready for your check. It seems that feedback from customers has shaped the restaurant into a more western service style, wait staff make frequent visits and your check comes as soon as  you are finished. The jury's still out on whether this is an improvement as there's something to be said about the Thai pace of dinner. 
I thanked the waitress for bringing me a chang with one of four mangled Thai phrases I've memorized. She pressed her palms together in an elegant wai and said "kaa". The shift ended for my waitress and my desert was served by a waiter who was just as polite. The manager kept an eye on all tables and greeted customers as they were seated. 
If you live in Henderson or South Vegas this restaurant is easy to reach and prices, food and service all rate well. Bookmark now and stop in for dinner some time. They also have a well placed outdoor seating area. Saa-waa-dee kaap.Went for lunch today and this place was slammed! The line to order was almost out the door. What a great sign to see coming to a restaurant for your first time. I ended up ordering the the Pork Barbacoa Burritto Enchilda style w/ guacomole. It was GIGANTIC!  The taste of my burrito was amazing sweet smokey and spicy! I will definitely be back to try some other dishs here.Been here twice now - friendly staff, nice environment with a good choice of Margarita's and more. I was given a free guacamole coupon at the nearby Hyatt Place (ask for one!) and so started with a free dish of table side guacamole (3 avacodo's) followed by taco's with all the trimmings and two excellent margarita's. then a free Hyatt shuttle to a good night's sleep!Well after so so many years of driving by it and looking at the ghetto joint being tempted to stop and try it, reading all the reviews made me make a Uturn and stop by TODAY!!!

Was not disappointed at all, i ordered a Lucky Boy burger with some fries and a regular Dr. Pepper.
Fries were hot off the fryer, crunchy and soft in the middle. Nice amount of salt to make it very tasty.
 The burger, THE BURGER!! I love charbroiled burgers, it gives it a nice char taste, damn very yummy.
Only thing is that they added a tidbit to much catsup, but it was fine after i almost finished it. WOW burger was big, filled my Big Ass up, lol

Will go back and have a taste of some of the other items on the menu.we tried the breakfest buffet and wow it was stunning!!  It wasnt as good as TI''s buffet but it was still up  there.  great omelets and breakfest burritos here...the french toast i couldnt put down..it was so good.  gonna check it out for lunch next week.Buffalo WIld Wings is one of my simple pleasures.  The food is simple yet good.  I ordered 8 boneless wings as usual.  This time with the parmesan garilc suace.  It is my favorite sauce without heat.  I also ordered buffalo chips with cheese and cajun.  As usual they were quite tasty.

We had a large group and our server did a very good job keeping up with us.

The endless supply of televisions gave us several sports options.its open 24/7 !!!

chicken is a great source of protein when you're partying vegas style (all day, all night). add some awesome wing sauce - and VOILA! tasty. 

same chain, different city/location.This place was great in terms of the food and drinks... I ordered the salmon and a side of mashed potatoes and it was awesome! The mini sliders were expensive but great as well! The shot of Patron I had actually ended up being a double shot which was awesome as well! LOL! 

I gave them a four because they took FOREVER to come to serve us. We were wondering what took so long since there was barely anyone there...  but anyway, once we got served everything took only a lil while to come out to us.

I think we spent about 80 bucks for two people which isn't bad and we got full...!

The decor is a little weird and woody but it was cute and different...I recently stayed at the Luxor and was happy to find a deal in Las Vegas - not the easiest thing! They have a brew of the day for $3, which is exactly the kind of deal that makes me happy. The food isn't bad, from the little we sampled, and the atmosphere is cool - darkly lit, dark leather and a stone slate bar counter.I have been going to Urban for a few years now. I love to sample all the different teas and of course indulge in the delicious food! I have gone with kids and adults and have always had a pleasant experience. Plan ahead, good food can take some time to prepare, but as I always say, it's worth the wait.This place is great!! If you tired of eating in casino's overpriced restaurants with gaudy interiors and snooty waiters, visit this place. Food is good, appetizers very good. Try steak asparagus. Why 4 starts than? I reserve 5 stars for truly exceptional places, this place is not, but is very good. Waiters are attentive, food is very good, prices very reasonable. Plan to visit every time I'm in LV.My family is a big fan of sushi  - this is our favorite in our area. The service is always good and the sushi is always fresh and tasty. 

My only complaint is that the place is a bit small and when you walk in you're never greeted - and we always end up standing in the entrance of the dining area for more than a few minutes. 

Other than that - I highly recommend and know I will be back to get my sushi-fix when needed!Never been a big breakfast guy and I vastly prefer lunch and dinner.  My lactose intolerance has a lot to do with that, but time management plays a key factor as well as I usually just need something quick to eat before running out the door to work which limits the amount of breakfast I eat in general.

In planning to visit Arizona to see my Eagles play a terrible game of football against the Cardinals, I was extremely excited to see a Cracker Barrel was located nearby.  Cracker Barrel has this aura surrounding it much like Chick-Fil-A (religious beliefs notwithstanding) in that I hear so many people talk about how much they love it that I've been wanting to try it for quite a while and this seemed like a perfect opportunity.  On the Monday following the game, I decided to go with my dad and brother to visit this location and drown the sorrows of our team's horrible performance in some gravy and egg yolk.  

I get the hype now.  I was actually a little surprised to see a very standard menu full of typical breakfast foods like eggs, bacon, sausage, pancakes, and the like.  I don't know why exactly but I always assumed that they must offer some sort of atypical breakfast fare for people to be as in love with it as they were.  Instead the major decision to be made seems to be in deciding which one of 8 or so combinations of those standard items you want on your plate.  I went with Grandpa's country fried steak breakfast because I hadn't had one in years and it sounded soul-soothing and spirit raising all at once.  It came with some eggs cooked to order (Sunny side up), biscuits with gravy, a choice of hashbrown casserole or fried apples (went with the hash), and a bowl of grits on the side.  

I thought every single item tasted like a very fine version.   The biscuits were warm, fluffy, and deliciously buttery.  The country fried steak was a huge portion completely smothered in a fantastic creamy gravy.  The hashbrown casserole tasted all sorts of cheesy and potato-y and it all went well with the perfectly runny sunny side up eggs.   Yes, I have lactose intolerance, and yes, this was not a well advised meal for me (I apologize to my dad, brother, and anyone who might have come in contact with me for the next several hours after).   The only thing I wasn't too high on was the grits, but I don't really know if I like grits period so I'm not a good judge on that.   

The real reason I think cracker barrel is so popular though is the price.  All that I mentioned above cost I believe $6.95.  Just an absolute steal for the price and the amount of food you get.   Service was impeccable.   Friendly, quick, and quick to bring out refills.  

While cracker barrel couldn't erase the inept offense the Eagles displayed the day before, it helped this fan's morale (and slight hangover) the next morning and comes highly recommended!Tucked away in the back of the Bally's is the rarely crowded Tequila Bar.  Popular for the $2 tequila shots, $3 draft beers and cheap tacos that people stumble in to chug back before heading out to the casino floor or night club, often overlooked are the stellar entrees.  Sure, you're going to pay full price, but they make it worth it.  Especially delectable is the carne asada plate.  Marinated just right, slathered with chimichuri and cheese, it is among the best out there.  The carne asada sits atop a savory plate of black beans, lime seasoned rice and sweet plantains.  For desert, skip the cheap Jose Cuervo swill and ask the bartender for a good tequila recommendation; you won't be disappointed.Stopped here again on the trip home from Vegas for breakfast this time.  Our server's name was Brenda and she was a hoot!  Breakfast food was average - eggs, hashbrowns, bacon... my husband ordered biscuits and gravy and it was a really decent sized portion for $2.95.  Brenda brought us extra toast when we ate all of ours.  She was reallly what made the whole experience above average for us.  She obviously enjoys her job and has a good time with customers.  Even my husband, who is deathly afraid of talking to restaurant servers, enjoyed her.

They still have $1 strawberry shortcake and it's still good!  Next time I stop I'll make sure it's at lunch again - they always seem to have a really good sounding special at a great deal.Second time here, park away from the truckers. Service and food are ok-good friendly staff. Had the 4.99 burger special, it was as expected a good quality burger. Fish and chips were crunchy and hot, seasoned well. Would come back.My place to go when im craving mexican food. They make my order quick when i make it To Go. When they make mistakes on my order ( 2 or 3 times) they would give me free food like a carne asada burrito. How nice of them. 

I give it 4 instead of 5 because on this particular store, it gets pretty lonely when youre eating in and theres no music. They should add radio because it gets pretty weird when youre eating in silence. Hopefully they will add one sooner or later!I came to visit in late December and it was sort of chilly.  As such, other than a few groups of school kids, I had the place almost to my self.  To take in the entire property and all it has to offer takes a good 3-4 hours and I am sure I still missed some stuff.  While in the gardens I got to spend some time with the curator and chat about vegetable gardening in a desert and she let me peek out back as see her little compost pile, almost as long as a football field!  She was excited about having just gotten a permit from the city to start growing vegetables for the cafe.  The permit required that that garden be kept out of he public area but I am sure photos will be on display somewhere after it is in production.

In addition to the gardens there are several indoor areas with lots of interactive stuff for people of all ages.  Areas focus on wildlife, water conservation, and lots of historical info on the area.  If you have kids in tow while visiting Vegas this is a must do side trip.I'll start off by saying that I've heard in the past they've been hit or miss (possibly more miss than hit). As I am only a recently Arizona resident I cannot validate this. What I will say is that right now they seem to be doing something right judging by the amount of phone calls they take and people picking orders up when I do the same. I've ordered carry out several times and what I've received is something consistent with well-balanced flavors. This is not your sweet sauce style of pizza. In fact, they don't use a lot of sauce at all which may or may not be your kind of thing. The crust is the thin crispy type. I can tell you that one of these little square slices is good the next day.

My only complaint is that as the cheese is not the ooey gooey stringy type so the toppings and cheese do have a tendency to slide off the crust when you bite in. But it doesn't really matter when you've got the flavor to make up for it.

Now if you excuse me... another slice is calling me.When it comes to Pet-centric megamarts here in the valley, you have two choices that I know of, PetSmart and Pet Co.  For my money, I tend to find better deals at PetSmart and they carry a better selection of the oddball stuff that I tend to care most about.  

When I was moving into my new place, I was concerned about both the new furniture and the light colored carpet.  I have 2 longhair cats who shed like it's going out of style.  One is black with a reddish undercoat, the other is soft tortie / grey tabbie.  Between the two, we have enough colors to show up badly on any type of furniture or carpet you can imagine.

Employing my internet research superpowers, I discovered the Furminator, which is hands down the BEST shedding tool I have ever seen.  I was able to pick one up at my local Petsmart, along with a bottle of Simple Solution Allergy formula cat cleaner.  And it turns out they even stock the softclaws brand kitty nail caps that I have to keep on my Maine Coone to prevent him from destroying every fabric surface in existence.

Go Team PetSmart!tasty, inexpensive shrimp cocktails! always fresh tasting and cold!
I've also had their homemade Yukon potato chips, pretty tasty. 

i think they offer beers here and a few unmentionable menu items, come for the shrimp cocktail and move on

1.99 regular shrimp cocktail or 2.99 for a largeCool night club on Freemont Street in Downtown Vegas.  It's part of the Golden Nugget and the outdoor balcony overlooks Freemont Street. 

From Thursday-Sunday, the club is open till' late night, spinning a cool mix of the latest Pop, Hip-Hop, as well some really good Club Music. On top of that, they get into sets of the old-school Rap and Hip-Hop too.. I would reccomend this club for the 30+ crowd.  

The bartenders are nice and they make the drinks strong.

The view outside is great.  You can see all the way down Freemont and enjoy the Freemont Street Experience (the show) while enjoying the club.Crunchy fish tacos - the best in the Tuke and maybe the Valley. The burger is excellent as well. Solid sports bar.THIS PLACE IS PERMANENTLY CLOSED???  Last time we called was summer of 2011 and the voicemail said that the restaurant was closed for the summer.  It is no longer summer and the place is still CLOSED!!!!  Too bad because of my previous review below...

Great outside sitting area, good food too!  The AC gets a bit too cold sometimes but if you say something, they will turn it down.  This place looks classy, nice decor.

Very good lunch selections under $10.00.  The service is good, they take very good care of you.  We asked for something on the dinner menu and they served it to us.  They have a good wine selection but we haven't tried it yet as my coworkers and I go there at lunch.

Try the spinach dip.  It is awesome.  Small salad plates are good and healthy.  Pizza is good, sandwiches are creatively put together.definitely a solid 4 stars :) - it's actually pretty decent Mexican food for a pretty good price! tasty tacos - might even go there again today! lolHad a good dungeness crab omelette. It was quite a hefty omelette. You also get some complimentary beignets when you sit down.The lunch special is a fantastic deal! Wednesday through Sunday from 11am-5pm they have a deal for $9.95 that includes a frozen Margarita, Fideo soup, and your choice of two items from: beef, chicken, or cheese enchilada; chicken, ground or shredded beef taco; chicken or beef flautas; chili relleno. The free chips served as an appetizer were yummy too and included beans, salsa, and guac. Coming back for the daily special in the future!Okay.. so I'm one of those people who loves taking a chance and trying grand openings. Humble Pie is one of this places Ive been waiting for since I read about it a year and a half ago. So today was their first public opening so with a spray of cologne and some plastic we were on our way!

Let me tell you up front, this place is going to be packed for a while. We arrive around 6:30 pm and not a table to be had so we opted to sit at the bar. We had a pretty good vantage of the whole place.. from the warming boxes at the front to the wine cellar on the far part of the restaurant (I want one of those!). The space looks like it's not quite finished but you can tell and feel that the space is going to be very comfortable. 

To start they offer wine flights, oh yeah honey.. thats what I'm talking about! Nothing like a nice heady wine buzz to get things started. Pouring over the menu was pretty easy.. there are a handful of apps, salads and pizza's. I started with the Grilled Steak Salad.. this salad is very good though the addition of some cheese would sent it over the top! We also ordered the Humble Caprese.. you know when your toes start to curl when you're about to uh, uhm.. well, ya know.. its sort of like that! Super creamy mozzarella, roasted cherry tomatoes on the vine.. it doesn't get much better, simple, clean and flavorful.

Pizza's.. Schreiners Sicilian Sausage with roasted Fennel.. Wild Mushrooms and Pancetta.. to start the crust.. light, slightly crisp, chewy, slightly salty in a good way.. for me, the crust here was nothing short of perfect.. it held the ample toppings nicely and of a nice chew and balance with the flavors of the topping. Sausage and Fennel was great plus nothing like sourcing locally! The Mushroom and Pancetta was a nice balance of earthy mushroom varieties and crispy salty pancetta. The mozzerella on the pizza's was the same heavenly pillow used on the Caprese.. beware, addictive!

We also received a mistake pizza of Pepperoni Pizza.. apparently we were in the right place at the right time since the guy next to us liked his mistake pizza (no sauce) so we were happy to take it off the waiters hands!  I'm not a fan of pepperoni, usually it's greasy limp and fatty. The pepperoni was crisp and well, I could eat one of these for breakfast!  I'm glad that kitchen had a few kinks to work out, this was a great mistake.

On to the desserts.. we tried the Olive Oil Gelato as well as the Fresh Berry Crostada. Having had Olive Oil Gelato at a place in LA called Mozza I was hoping that Humble's version would be better. It didn't disappoint! A very light taste of good olive oil surrounded in a creamy well textured gelato.. I would order this one over and over again! The Crustada was well done and since berries are in season this made for a nice treat.

So me and the Mister very much liked this place and want to fall in love.. so right now we are in the infatuation period.. we went ahead and made a reservation for tomorrow night.. I have plans on chowing down a Shrimp, Barrata pizza and or course, that marvelous pepperoni.Made it over there on Thursday after work for the Grand Opening.  I must say I was impressed with the atmosphere of the place.  Clean and modern but without the overpowering attempt at being trendy that plagues most Scottsdale locales.  Just a nice relaxed bar that happens to have some of my favorite beers on tap.  That fact that these favorites of mine were being given away for free much of the night of the opening was a definite plus. 

Unfortunately I did not get the opportunity to try any of their food as they weren't serving anything from their menu for the opening.  

 Although I live a few blocks south of the Ranch I definitely see myself and friends returning to this place.  I hope it catches on and achieves its goal of becoming a great neighborhood haunt for us Nordale folks.Contrary to popular belief among students of the ASU downtown campus, Phoenix really does have a lot of superb eateries - you just have to know where to look. And for those people like me who are often wary about venturing downtown for some grub, Thai Elephant is a great find.

Don't let the tiny venue fool you. What Thai Elephant lacks in size - and parking - they make up for with an extensive menu (and a really hot midday server). My favorite part is how patrons get to select their dish's spiciness, an added bonus for picky eaters. 

During a recent lunch visit I opted for the Drunken Noodles with chicken, mild spiced. The delicious dish of Thai thin rice noodles sautéed with garlic sauce, yellow onion, carrots, broccoli, cabbage, basil and bean sprouts was the perfect size. I found the mild spice to be a little too weak for my liking, but a previous visit to Thai Elephant determined that my taste buds can't quite handle their hot seasonings. The veggies were fresh and not overrun with sauce. The chicken, though appetizing, was in short supply however. 

I still left the eatery full and satisfied, especially with the bill. Lunch items are a decent $7 to$9, and dinner doesn't get any higher than $16 a plate. Throw in a drink and tip, and dinner can easily be under $20 a person. 

And speaking of drinks, Thai Elephant has a delicious assortment of hot and iced teas, my favorite by far being the Thai Iced Tea. 
The service is prompt and friendly, but on busier days (especially at lunch), they can sometimes be slower. That's when I choose to get my meal to-go.i haven't tried the food, but i've definitely tried the beeeer and the pong!!  beer pong here is always gooooood fun!  they have about five beer pong tables, and everytime i've been here, i've never had to wait for a table.  i highly recommend this place for a good time, affordable night-out, off-the-strip  fun and a low-key, dress comfortable atmosphere.  all you need is friends, pitchers and balls!  go during happy hour...... :)I've only ever been here on Wednesday night for karaoke, so I can only speak for Wednesday nights. I enjoy it myself; it's not horribly crowded and I'm a karaoke nut, so there you go. They also have beer pong.

What I do enjoy about this place come Wednesday is for a mere $20 you can have all you can drink draughts, which is awesome. Karaoke goes from 7 - 11 (or later) and it's good. Service is always very good here.
All in all, I'd say check it out. It's a nice pub, great beer, and all you can drink on Wednesday.
EDIT -  I have recently discovered Quinn's DOES in fact offer food. It's traditional Irish fare, and can't say I've tried much of it. The shepherd's pie is very good though.Stopped in for lunch. Great for a quick, casual meal with friends. Love that I can pile on lot of veggies. That's something that you don't usually get at a restaurant aside from salad.I have to say i was very happy with the service this time around. They have new owners and i love the new settings inside. It is more personalized where the server actually calls your name instead of a number and it looks alot more organized and cleaner. I will be going back because im once again a fan of the service.Usually get the strawberry chicken salad. Fresh food, good atmosphere. Nice place to take a mom or grandma.Guru Palace has so many highlights that it's hard to pick just a few.

The lunchtime buffet provides the opportunity to mix dishes, and I'm a huge fan of both their Palak Paneer and Daal, so a lunch trip is always my first choice (even though lunchtime wait service is on the slower side).

Their dinner menu is fairly basic, but I've never had a dish that I disliked.  And while I prefer the veg dishes the most, the Lamb Vindaloo is also very very good.This is my favorite Indian restaurant in the valley that I have been to so far. I like the Chicken Korma and Vindaloo.  I have been here several times and it is consistent and good. 

the bad:  they  charge for rice. On the whole, it's on the expensive side, maybe I should go for the buffet but I'm generally not a fan of buffets.I'm very impressed by this place, before I give it 5 stars though, I would like to try more of their food.  I had the Beghan Aloo, it's potatoes and eggplant with spices.  It was incredibly good, but also drenched in ghee (not necessarily a bad thing).  I also had the rasmalai, which if you've read any of my reviews of indian restaurants, is my favorite dessert EVER.  It was only okay here, not quite the best i've ever had.  The service was really good.  It's a pretty bare bones restaurant, with a little bit of ambiance, but I don't really care much for that, the one sample dish I had here was pretty darn good, I will definitely be coming back to check out the lunch buffet.Yes, it's expensive and the prices are jacked up to take advantage of the tourists, but yes, the coffee is killer! As a Las Vegas local, I frequently make the trip down to the Strip just to get my macchiato fix. There's no other coffee quite as authentic as Illy. Since I can't afford to travel to Italy that often, shelling out $4 for an espresso doesn't seem so bad. They serve their coffee in REAL china cups which is important to me; I don't think coffee tastes as good in paper cups. And yes, you do have to pay an extra .50 cents for a "real" cup if you stay and drink in the restaurant. But that's okay, that's how it's done in Europe after all. The seating is very limited but there are several counters if you don't mind standing to slam your espresso. The gelato is decent too with several sugar-free flavors.Still a front runner for happy hour drinks and industry appreciation.  Cocktails are awesome, we always end up with 1 or 2 extra martinis down the hatch because they are just so good!  The half naked girls playing violins threw me off one night, but hey, whatever brings them in I guess.  Good flatbread.I ventured here (okay I was dragged) one Friday night when some out of town coworkers were visiting. My first impression was that it was a really nicely decorated meat market. We couldn't find a table outside so we retreated to the indoor area. The decor is very lively and, after a drink or two becomes quite enchanting. I let the company do the ordering and since it was happy hour they ordered food as well as drinks. The dirty martini I had inspired me to make it my new favorite drink. I order it everywhere I go now. Yummy salty heaven! We had some smoked salmon quesadillas that were small but delish. The other appetizers weren't memorable, but I didn't dislike any of it. After 4 of us had 2 drinks each and shared 3 appetizers our bill was still under $50. Gotta love happy hour prices!!! I will definitely return when I need a happy hour fix and am in the Town Square area.Consistently good food and service. Nice atmosphere. We come here often and are always pleased with our meal. Excellent Chile Rellenos, Enchiladas, and burritos.  Wish their salsa that comes with the chips was more tomato-y and flavorful but that my only complaint. Recommend highly.I think Breadfruit is a wonderful little Jamaican Restaraunt.  The dishes are unique and wondefully flavorful.  The place is small, but that just adds to the air of intimacy.  The kitchen is close and within view.  The Wait staff is extremely knowledgable, friendly and ready with a great and candid assesment of what's "great" on the menu that day and what's not.  The cocunut/carrot juice drinks are absolutely amazing.  I think this spot is best as an off-downtown lunch spot as it can get pretty crowed (and hence uncomfortable) during week-end evenings.  I definitely give it an enthusiastic recommendation and am certain you will love the food!They should also put Quick in the name.  This is now the closest one to me since they closed so many stores.  I hope they make it because they excellent selection and good prices.  I love the way they have the place set up.  You go to any one of their stores and you know where to find what you want.  They even have a good selection of items you can only get at British grocery stores but at half the price.  The fruit always looks fresh.  They have some lunch meat without nitrites.  I wish they would add nitrite free bacon and hot dogs too.  I also like their flower selection.It must have been a good shoe day, because I had 4 boxes stacked on top of each other ready to buy.  Then reality sunk in, and knew that I couldn't very well buy all 4 and fit them in my suitcase.  So, I narrowed it down to the pair of Diesel shoes I've been intending on buying for a while a needed to change to all my stilletos.  I'm not sure what it is with these cashiers in Phoenix, but I had another interesting interaction here as well.  The girl was updating my contact information in her computer and said, "I know this is a stupid question, but what state is Chicago in?"  I politely said, "Illinois".  My friend was pretty funny and said, "It's its own state."  I felt really bad for the cashier.Chicago dogs, meatballs, sausage sando, Mac and cheese, brownie....WOW!  Even picky kids loved the food.   Hours are a bit tight, but that must be the norm in AZ.Having only sampled part of the menu I give a 5 star to the burger, one of the best in the area and reasonably priced.  Next menu item is the Stromboli; quality ingredients and not greasy, I should have asked for it to be cooked a little more on the well done side of the scale it was slightly under cooked hence the 4 stars pizza is on par with the Stromboli same quality ingredients .  Will definitely be going back.  Friends give high ratings to the Chicago dogs.We hadn't  been to Arizona in years, so we were initially itching for Mexican food, but Blue Adobe turned out to be relatively near where we were staying and had some great reviews on Yelp, so we went. It was absolutely fantastic. However, it's not for everyone. We did not find it to be especially hot-spicy, but chili powder is in a lot. The salsa that comes with the chips is rich, thick and flavorful, but if you really, really like the tomato-centric salsa of the typical Mexican or Tex-Mex place, you might not like this dark, smoky salsa. I had a special, halibut rubbed in ancho chile spices with a shrimp enchilada. The fish was dry -- a big hazard for fish -- but good. The enchilada was out of this world. The rice was very good, though I hit a lumpy pocket of spice that hadn't dispersed in the pot. There was so much on the menu we would want to try, if we stayed in the Mesa area for a week we could come in every night and keep trying different things.their homemade salsa is sooo good and i love their baja shrimp tacos  :)We got take-out from this place for lunch today, and I was pleasantly surprised! I was expecting a Quiznos-esque experience (which isn't bad, but isn't overly exciting either), but Firehouse exceeded my expectations. 

I ordered the Smokehouse Beef & Cheddar Brisket Sub, which is JUST as good as it sounds:beef brisket topped with melted cheddar cheese and sauces....mmmmm! I devoured the 8"...at the risk of sounding like a pig, I might get the 12" next time, just because it was SO tasty I seriously couldn't stop eating it. One of my coworkers who frequents Firehouse a fair amount claims that everything is good...so my only dilemma next time is choosing between the already-proven-to-be-great Smokehouse Beef & Cheddar Brisket Sub or something else that (apparently) will be equally as good...so many choices!!!Pole Position is located behind and adjacent to the Palms Hotel & Casino right off of Flamingo Rd. It is a large warehouse that contains 1 large indoor track with electric go carts with radio controlled kill switches. 

The staff was friendly and clear in there instructions. For first time drivers a safety video must be viewed ahead or your race. This contains info about the carts, track, flags and safety. 

The carts are quick and the track with fun. The track is pretty wide so passing can happen. They have a leader board as you go down the home stretch which is a nice feature. 

This would be a appropriate for responsible older children and adolscents

Be aware. You are racing for time so your fast lap will rank you not your position in the field. 

It is a bit pricey as all of these go carting places but bring some friends and hang out and race a few times and it will be worth it. 

Out of the ones I have been to, this is the best one I have been to with a good mix of speed, nice track and carts, and overall fun.Socal tourist here, went down to Vegas for vacation with the fambam and the first thing we do is go eat, and what do we eat? Filipino food (if you haven't noticed my sarcastic tone yet I'm Filipino). We drive all the way down to Vegas and the food we eat right away was Filipino food -_-; well that's what I thought.

Boy was I definitely hit by a truck. The food here was amazing. I don't know of many good Filipino in Socal other than good ol home cooked dishes, but this place is definitely authentic. I got their bistek and pork adobo and it tasted real; tasted just like my dad's cooking AND at a great price (was 4.99 or something for 2 dishes + rice + a cup of sinigang). I do NOT like sinigang, or any "sour" soup of any sorts but I went ahead and ate/drink theirs. Omg, was I hit by a train this time. Their sinigang was SO good. Not too sour and the taste was so gooooooooooood. Their portion sizes were good enough at the cheap price it's at.

The place looks a bit old and it's not packed. There's plenty of space and plenty of food; however, not too many choices in terms of drinks. I don't think they even have halo halo either (I didn't check for bibingka either).

This place deserves at least 4 out of stars. Great AUTHENTIC Filipino food and a great low price that isn't too busy. I will definitely go here whenever I go to Vegas, even if it's not with my family.Is their food the best? Um...not really, but it's decent and cheap. Sometimes even free! 

If you have family from Hawaii staying downtown with Aloha Coupons, make sure to get their books before they leave in the morning. My mom guys mostly only use their breakfast and lunch coupons, so at the end of the trip they have a sh*tload of meals leftover between the 2 of them. Most people use the remainder on those crappy cookies or popcorn, but you can get a ridiculous amount of food instead.

I feel super ghetto admitting this, but we usually use the Aloha Coupons to get apps from 777, then dinner from the Cal Cafe (includes prime rib or daily specials), then use the rest at the Cal Snack Bar. The $ value is in the fine print on each coupon so make it easy on the cashiers and do some math - add up how much you have to spend, then figure out how much you can order. Feels super shame, but we usually walk out with about 8 Zippy's chili bowls and a bunch of other stuff.I'd give this place 5 stars if it wasn't SO damned overpriced!  I mean...really...overpriced.

The ambiance is a tad dark and romantic on the interior with a pretty cool glass partitioned room filled with wine dividing two dining areas.  I think if I were to eat here again, i'd request a seat inside.  We sat out on the patio...if you can call it that...more of a gated off section in the mall area of the Palazzo.  It was bright, loud, but great for people watching...I give it that!

The service is FANTASTIC...they give you three servers per table and when the food comes out, it ALL comes out...in one swoop.  So no waiting for your honey's plate to come out while yours sits there in front of you cooling off...THAT, I like!

As for the food, have to say, quite impressive but not for the cost.  We started with the escargot which was served up inside what appeared to be fried potato skins with a wine demi-glaze of sorts.  Divine flavor...the perfect blend of sweet and sultry.

Entrees...mom had the sea scallops which, if you like scallops, were pretty good.  They were served up in a bowl in some sort of corn and sweet tomato sauce.  I had the filet with the add-on of lump crab and chive butter and my honey had the lamb atop mashed potatoes. And funny thing, looking at the menu from their site now...NONE of the things we ate are even on there aside of the snails!  What the?  Most of the items I see on their online menu are less expensive than what we ate...

My filet alone (thanks mom for paying for dinner by the way!  whew...) was $38...for JUST the steak!  The crab add-on was another $15!!  And no veggie.  Just the beef and shellfish...$53.  Like I said...OVERPRICED.  Excellent but not worth the cost...The lamb on the menu is listed as $27 but when we had it...$38.  You would think in a recession that they'd LOWER, not RAISE the cost.

For desert...we had a trio of dishes.  I had the blueberry bread pudding with lemon and caramel sauce, mom had the chocolate malted creme brulet, and the honey had these little donut thingies which were essentially balls of white chocolate wrapped up in a donut hole and then deep fried.  Yuuuuuuum.

Overall...lovely meal but I won't be hitting up the place any time soon seeing as i'm unemployed. :(  I'd suggest saving up and splurging here or just taking your business to another establishment where you might get a little more for your $.I enjoyed a really good lunch here today thanks to a Living Social $20 gift certificate.  The only downside was that we had to order off the dinner menu and this was not indicated on the certificate. The place was completely full by 12:30, it has a nice ambiance, overall, and the service was pretty prompt and friendly.  Here's what we ordered:

- Spring rolls (non-fried, vietanmese style) - Very good and included two large rolls with peanut dipping sauce.  This appetizer is very light and healthy and almost reminds me of a seaweed salad

- Spicy noodles w/ pork - Very good and included more veggies (carrots, broccoli and cabbage) than Pad Thai, although I prefer the Pad Thai flavors over this particular sauce; also a good sized portion and plenty for two to share

- Coconut ice cream w/ fried bananas - DELICIOUS; this was decadent and an amazing combination of flavors; the fried bananas were light and fluffy (not greasy) and a perfect balance to the ice cream which had chunks of pineapple; my dining companion felt that it could have used more coconut

Overall, it was a great lunch and they even continued refilling our drinks as we sat there and talked for about two hours.A hilarious family--friendly night out!

I took my 17 year old daughter and 13 year old son to NCT last Friday night.  We had a fantastic time!  The performers are top notch, and the family friendly atmosphere was fantastic.  They have a policy that no performer, or audience member, can say anything lude, crude or indecent and I really appreciated that.

The audience is involved throughout and the games they played were great.

If you're looking for a great night out I recommend it highly!People who have known me long enough know that I basically live here. Why?

- Giant cases of water.
- Giant boxes of cereal.
- Giant bags of fish and chicken.
- Giant boxes of lactose-intolerance pills.
- The best rental car rates I've found.
- Random batches of organic fruits and vegetables.
- Their printing services are ridiculously cheap.
- The best return policies EVER.

I think the last point is possibly Costco's greatest asset. If you don't like something, you can just take it back. For any reason. This comes in handy because there are some misses here.

The fruits and veggies used to be really fresh all the time, but that just isn't true anymore. I suspect they over-order by quite a bit. They bring in too much product, refrigerate it too long, and then bring out chunks of it at a time. By the time they hit the second half, it's just rotting already. Now they stick dates on batches of produce but this just wasn't an issue before. Oh well, just be picky I guess.

Other than that, I do like their rapid changes in what they stock. You'd be surprised what they bring in sometimes. Items from various cultures, various qualities, various purposes. It's an adventure every month.

I will continue to live at Costco. You should, too. It's a place of wonders.If if wasn't for a rude hostess I might bump this place up to 5 stars. That being said, this place still offers an AWESOME happy hour! Not only is there several, cheap, options but the sushi is actually GOOD (let's be honest, that's not always the case w/happy hour sushi). Also, HH is EVERY day (including Sundays). 

I've also never been to a place that's so accommodating at splitting bills. Seriously, they ASK you immediately if you wanna do so, and don't mind if every single person in your 10-person party wants there own bill!Wow I had the best breakfast/dessert here!  Nutella crepes are amazing!  I've never tried Nutella before but these crepes won me over!  Since I split the crepes with a friend I completed my meal with the Eggs Benedict.  The Benedict is perfect!  It comes with a poached egg, the right amount of bacon, right amount of hollandaise sauce on an english muffin.  Perfect amount of hollandaise sauce....my eggs or english muffin wasn't drowning.  Thank you Scratch for introducing me to a fantastic Benedict!  The staff were helpful and gave great recommendations.  I can't wait to go back to try something off the  lunch and dinner.  I will have to leave room for some dessert too.  The window was full of great selections!A great store to find wine and various other alcohol related items. The employees are all helpful and the selection is massive!Smooth, rich, flavorful.... vegan?  I was a bit doubtful about trying soy gelato (soy-lato?), but after trying the spicy chocolate, I was hooked.  I had a mix of the chocolate soy and a regular mixed berry, and while both were very good, the mixed berry was a bit more icy rather than smooth.  The spicy chocolate was very rich, smooth, and had great spicy flavor.  I could not taste any real "soy" flavor either, which was nice.  They have a diverse selection of flavors, including sugar free selections.  Definitely a great place to get dessert!So far so good. This was the only bar in the airport that wasnt mobbed with people. They have AC power at the 2 end booths. This is located in the B terminal, near gate B8 (the yelp pin is misleading). The biggest problem with this place is that they close at 3PM! :-(The amount of late night spots that I am starting to Yelp, makes me thing I should create a list. Fatburger deserves a place at that table!

Having lived in SoCal for a number of years, and now, once again, Sin City, Fatburger is a staple for late night grub. The location on the strip is open 24/7 and is the perfect choice when you are trying to nurse yourself into zombie mode. I say that because, sometimes, Vegas can be too much fun, and you are near a coma-tose point. 

Being a Zombie would take some sort of miracle. Fatburger, can be that miracle.

On my way home from the club the other night, I got hungry. There really isn't too much in the way of convenience at 5am near my place (I can't wait to move to the Strip). Thankfully, this Fatburger location popped up like an oasis in the desert.

Feeling "healthy", I decided to order the Turkey Burger. With Bacon. Clearly, I wasn't in the right frame of mind, but whatever. It was late.

Yeah, it was delicious, amazing, and the whole nine yards but the reason I give this place Four Stars is simple. Convenience, speedy service, and a clean restaurant.

Done and done.The breakfast is what I like about this place.  They have such an amazing breakfast that includes traditional American means and the traditional Mexican breakfast foods.  

Everything I have had - pancakes, hash browns, eggs etc, or the chorizo burrito and other Mexican breakfasts - It was all yummy.  

If you are tired of only having fast food options for breakfast in the un-incorporated Pinal county (they call Queen Creek) then try this place - you will not be let down.Was in Vegas for a trade show recently & was invited to a customer dinner at TJ's in the Hilton. I have to say that I was really looking forward to a great Sin City dinner at one of the hot spots on the strip & TJ's is not it... However, I knew that going into it and the bottom line for us was that it was convenient to the trade show, taking place a few steps away at the LV Hilton Convention Center. 

We were greeted by our server with menus in hand right as we were seated - he was a character! I believe his name is Limon and very accommodating :-) We started our meal with a lovely champagne cocktail and a bread basket with an assortment of different breads and softened butter was passed around. 

Next, the wine "expert" at our table selected a lovely bottle of Pinot Noir for us all to share... delish! We finally made our menu selections and were served our soup/salad starters in just a few moments. My selection was the lobster bisque which I was quite pleased with, although it could have been a bit hotter - temperature wise. It did have some nice chunks of lobster meat in it and the texture was a buttery velvety perfection. The salads served to a few of our dining partners looked nice, again - great portions - although I didn't taste any of them.

Next up - the entrees and naturally, most of us ordered up a steak and/or lobster. My fillet was cooked to perfection with a *fabulous* Maitre 'd butter. Now, they're on the pricey side - I want to say aprox. $39/steak with no sides included. We ordered up a nice assortment of side dishes (about $9/side) for us all to share, including the mac 'n cheese, whipped potatoes, asparagus and broccolini... All = YUM! 

After that grand meal none of us were up for dessert, although a few of us enjoyed a hot tea or coffee. 

I have to say that the only negatives were the atmosphere, it feels like a hotel restaurant & not in the show-stopping Vegas way and the fact that it's located in the out-of -date Hilton. I'm pleased to share that our trade show is being upgraded to a hotel & convention center on the strip next year - yea! Although this is not TJ's fault :-)

Bottom line - if you're stuck at the Hilton, TJ's is a nice place for a great steak dinner!This is the first time my family has completely different opinions about the food. I personally love there thin, crunchy  style pizza. However, for rest my family it was too thin and the crust was too crispy. If you like thin crust pizza then you should definitely try this one.I have never been disappointed at this place and I would recommend them! The food is good and the price are fair.Green chili pork, chicken fried steak.  Nothing else needs yo be said!I have to sat when they 1st opened a couple of years ago, I wasn't totally impressed by Carmines but after trying different items and time has passed, they've surpassed themselves. 

We generally grab a pie before a sins game. I love white pizza-they've got it. Calzone, wings, pasta, etc...  I tried my 1st sandwich there (roast beef with cheese hot) and the bread was so fresh and the meat/cheese was delicious- I made my hubby take a bite!  I'm glad I was in the mood to try a new item there. 

With plenty of shared seating outside with Maria's and a good amount inside, Carmine's is a great place to grab a quick slice pre-game or a whole pie (yes, they'll make a whole pie for you during the busy times).very exquisite & unique starters - the beef tastings r good but a bit pricey - sides r also good & the variety choices of bread r quite delicious as well as the desserts esp the white chocolate souffle - very recommendable rest.Here is a list of what my hubby and I ordered:
Maryland Blue Crab & Carolina Shrimp "Louis" Cocktail, Spicy Tomato-Horseradish (to share)
New York Sirloin 8 Oz (additional 2 ounces available) +Bone Marrow (for me) 
Rib Eye Steak 16 Oz (for the hubby)
Yukon Gold Potato Puree (to share)
Warm Chocolate Soufflé, Whipped Crème Fraîche, Gianduja Chocolate Ice Cream
plus a coffee and doughnut dessert thingy (can't find it on internet menu) and a banana pie thingy that I can't find either given to us complimentary for our anniversay!

Appetizer was great! (except for the drops of ketchup - which they called tomato-horseradish- tasted exactly like hines tomato; luckily they were just drops for deco)
my sirloin was was half wagyu/half kobe so it was a bit more expensive ($75) for the cut...but it was INSANELY good cut...(and cooked perfectly to my liking!)
Tasted hubby's and not as great...note to self! ($66 for his cut!) better to pay for good/smaller cut!
Souffle was so-so...a little too rich for my liking..didn't like the complimentary dessert...but I don't really like banana desserts...the hubby liked it though, although he didn't really like his doughnut dessert thingy. 
Service was great! Overall experience was great.I havent eat a burger eversince i rmbr..
This totally out of my diet...
I told myself if im gona eat a burger again im goin to this place.....so here i come!!!
Im excited to eat a burger with grilled onions and thier thousand island sauce is the best.....yayyyyy!!!!!!Very good.  Nice staff, good bar food selection and nice space.  I am reluctant to eat at a restaurant in a strip mall BUTTT this place was very good.

The food was good.  Loved the homemade mushroom soup.  The waitress was VERY friendly.  The clientele was relaxed and subtle.  

As I wind down my year in Wisconsin I can definitely say this place is very Wisconsin and for that I appreciate it even more.This is a hidden gem in North Central Phoenix.  It's a family owned restaurant that isn't much to look at from the outside (in a little strip mall) and isn't very fancy on the inside.  But what it lacks in decor it more than makes up for in taste. 

They make all their breads, desserts, pastas and sausage by hand.  It is some of the best Italian sausage and Tiramisu I've ever had in my life - and I've been to almost all the old Italian neighborhoods in the East Coast cities.  If you want "real" pizza like that from NY or Philly, this is the place to go.  

I special order their hot Italian sausage every year for my Christmas party and serve that along with their sweet Italian sausage.  I also order their Tiramisu.  I get nothing but rave reviews from my guests every year.

I would definitely recommend Belfiore to anyone looking for a simple but delicious Italian meal, pizza or dessert.Great sushi!!! Service was speedy! Quite a few unique rolls to try here! Get here early on the weekends and it got quite busy for the dinner rush! Will be coming back for sure!I have eaten here two times and loved it both times! It is a bit expensive for a family but super fun on a date night! I enjoy the bruschetta and the pasta options. They have an amazing sangria as well. Make sure to go early they do get busy!Bf and i went today and the pho was REALLY good.  You really didn't have to add anything to the broth to make it taste good because it was already perfect.  4 Stars because we had pho and some spare ribs, and all the meat that we had was a little tough.  And it was completely dead, so I didn't really like the ambiance.  It was all awkward trying not to slurp noodles too loud because there wasn't that much sound going on lol.  And after we got our meal no one stopped by to see if we needed anything really, and when we were done we just kind of sat there and didn't know if we were supposed to walk up to the counter or what.  But other than that it was really good.The food is pretty consistent from visit to visit.  I love eating here because it is so close to my home.  I like to take my daughter here on walks for a late lunch.  The wait staff is usually pretty nice to us.  They don't even seem to mind cleaning up her baby mess when we leave.  I love their egg rolls, spring rolls and chicken wings.  I always have a hard time deciding between rice and noodles.  But I am always happily stuffed by the time I leave.

This place has two personalities.  When the owner is there, she plays jazz and it's has a bit nicer atmosphere.  She is very professional, stylish and friendly. When she isn't there, a girl and a guy work there.  A little younger.  They play random loud music (top 40, rap....).  The guy wears tee-shirts and jeans.  He is a little unpolished (doesn't repeat orders, mumbles....).  So the experience isn't quite so nice.  But the food is always yummy.  And he is nice.  So we will continue to eat here.  So glad it is so near by.went back to try more...coffee and doughnuts, cookies and cream, PB & J, and Red Carpet.....All good, moist and delicious!!!Reminds me of my days in Long Beach Ca, hanging out at "Live Bait" ,  the shops and all the eat spots on 2nd street.  The service knew it's stuff about what to recommend and what to eat. We came for lunch and the food was reasonably priced and delicious! The ambiance was awesome. We decided we wanted to try to come during the evening hours to get our drink and food on and see it then. I will write a new review for the evening hours.Great tacos!Visited the YardHouse at Red Rock Casino over the weekend.  It was pretty late, well after midnight, and we obviously got right in and sat down.  Wasn't too crowded.   Wait staff was accommodating and friendly.

I had the chicken lettuce wraps.  My girlfriend had the asian pork bbq appetizer.  Both were pretty good.  The beer is good and they do have quite the collection from which to choose.

We like to go there roughly once a month and that won't change after our latest visit.  Definitely a pleasant atmosphere and good place to get some food whether it's early or late.

4 stars!I frequently this Costco alot. I usually come here to buy hard drives for work. The price is real good and seems like the Hard Drives I buy are always on sale.I ate here for the first time for lunch today. We went in around 2:30pm and the place was dead. We were sat quickly. It took a while for us to be greeted and after waiting for 5 minutes the bartender finally came over to help us. We received super yummy chips and salsa to start off with. I ordered the fish tacos and they were by far some of the best fish tacos I have ever had. I wish they had come with rice and beans or something but it was definitely enough food. Our server was cute and filled my iced tea several times without me asking. I'd definitely eat here again. It looks like a cute place to take a date!BF and I were passing by and wanted to just to "ooo" and "aaahh" at some ties in the window like usual, but one on display caught our eye that we had to go in. 

It was the only one in the store so the lady had to get it out of display. She displayed it on different colored shirts which was very helpful in seeing what kinds of hues and patterns it can be paired with. Their ties seem to be all $49, which is a reasonable price for the quality and style (I put a picture up of our pick). We were at Barneys and though you can tell the material was a lot finer on a paisley tie we liked there, it was $175 which is still too steep to pay if he isn't in a position where he wears suits daily.  

Yeah the BF impulse bought a tie.

 In all of the time we've been together, I've never seen him with a tie so now that he has a sexy accessory, it's time to do so. We always had a thing for ties. He never has a reason to wear one though nor owned a tie he liked so the longing hasn't really been fulfilled. I just look like a lesbian with a tie on or a server at Olive Garden so I live vicariously through him. 

I think if you're needing a tie/ascot/bowtie specially if you need a difficult color (they have a wide variety of hues) or want a stylish pattern definitely stop in.Interesting mix of cuisine (Japanese, Peruvian, and Brazilian). Sounds like a potentialy disgusting combo, but it actually works very well. Try their signature sushi rolls. They're extremely good. They also have more Sake than Japan it seems. About a 6 page menu to select from. They also have amazing muddled fruit cocktails. 

Now, the negatives. As sushi goes, and tapas for that matter, it's slightly pricey. I know it's Vegas, but some things such as sushi just can't go higher than a certain price. The second thing is the fact they have an amazing modern space, but then have a giant screen tv playing football. Why dumb down a hip place. Oh well.I went here for dinner on July 17. I must admit that it was a little overwhelming trying to figure out exactly what to eat but end the end my favorite dishes were the seabass skewers, lobster taquitos, and the Choc Banana dessert. Heck anything would have been in the sauce they used for that Sea Bass dish. YUMMY!  

Yes it was a bit pricey, but the food was good. Give it a try.Edit: 
Upgraded from one star to 4 and removed my scathing review with a long and boring problem. In the end the manager Chris called me back and talked to me to make it right. It is nice to see a business take the time to fix a customers problem. I still prefer my membership at Clean Freak car wash but in a pinch this place will do nicely.This place was a zoo.  They have one of the worst drive thru set ups in my opinion.  Anyways the line was too long so I went in.

They workers are like a fine tuned machine.  They have the process down.  One makes the burger, another person adds the fries, another makes the drinks.  It went really quickly.  We had a lot of custom burgers and they got our order correct despite it.  

Only complaint is the fries were cold and soggy by the time we made it home 10 minutes later.  If you get fries you better dine in.I typically hate fast food, but hell, when i need a good hamburger I go here. Only problem is if your on health kicks like me, sometimes this sort of food doesn't agree with you. But overall I believe they have very competent staff!The sienna golf course is a combination of straight fairway golf and target golf. 
It is located in the far western end of Las Vegas along with it's "sister" course - The Arroyo at Red Rocks Country Club.
The course is beautiful and very challenging. 
Often intimidating looking, until you fly your ball over the nmassive set of sand traps in the middle of the fairways.
There are walls of sand traps on numbers 1,6,8,11 and 12 ..... whew ...
The scenery throughout this course makes it a treat to play.
The greenery of the course blends in with the desert areas.
When you are finished, there is an excellent Bistro located on the course.
The bistro serves breakfast lunch and dinner.
Selections include nachos, pizza, meatball subs, firecracker shrimp to grilled atlantic salmon and seared peppered Ahi Tuna .
My choice is the Italian Panini sandwich with meats and cheeses served on ciabatta bread.
Try to play this course on a nice day in the summer when the rates are about $90 - $100 cheaper than their prime season rates.
A great place to play.
It has all the challenge you will want.
Be prepared for some great drinks on the 19th hole ...Several of my friends and I participate in "No-shave November" to support prostate cancer awareness and research. November is only 30 days long, yet it seems so much longer when you can't shave. So, in order to commemorate the end of our self-inflicted discomfort for a great cause, we've decided to get a nice straight razor shave every December 1st.

I have never been one to grow great facial hair...or even AVERAGE facial hair for that matter. I'm as close to a "baby face" as it gets for a 33 year old man. Needless to say, I don't typically have the NEED for a straight razor shave, and this was, in fact, my first go for our new annual tradition.

Needless to say, I was a bit nervous at the prospect. I mean, there was going to be a woman holding a razor blade to my throat...the living embodiment of my worst nightmare! But, traditions are traditions...even if they're new traditions. So, I brought my daughter along (as a witness), and headed to the Pavilions. 

When you walk into this place (as a guy), you feel completely at ease. The walls are completely covered in sports memorabilia. There are autographed photos of sports stars from different generations. There are numerous bobble head dolls on the shelves. There are over-sized couches in front of the television. There are two barber stations with awesome chairs where the fate of your facial follicles will be finalized!  

As I climbed into my chair, my daughter stretched out on one of the couches. She was set. I sat down, laid back, and closed my eyes. I was so nervous, that I didn't even ask the name of the woman conducting this operation. My nerves were immediately put at ease after the pre-treatment began. There was a mentholyptus rub to stimulate the follicles. There were warm towel wraps. There was a light facial massage. All of those things led to extreme relaxation.

The woman was very careful and very thorough. When all was said and done, a month of my life had been rightfully eradicated, and I had my baby smooth face back again. 

The service was great. While my face was under wraps, I could hear the other barber interacting with my daughter. He was kind enough to offer her a lollipop while she waited for daddy to finish up. Any place that takes the time to engage my daughter and treat her like a person is fine by me!

The cost for the shave is $17. So, once a year for this type of service is fine by me. I can do it myself the other 12 times a year I have to shave. But to get that kind of price on a pampering...that's pretty cool. 

They do offer a full gamut of services including haircuts and facials. You can even opt for a package deal that includes several of the services for a bargain.Love to go to Aj's Fine foods !  They have a great salad bar, and they always have a special sandwich of the week!  You can also have a burger grilled out on the patio, if it is a nice day, the patio is perfect to enjoy your lunch !  If you sign up on their e mail they will send you coupons, I just used one, for slice of cake, buy one, get one free,and they were delicious !I'm pricing my return to Vegas in the summer and just cant seem to fork over the amount of money it will cost to stay at one of the nicer hotels on the strip. Sure they are really nice and chic but I plan to stay for 5 days and will be taking multiple vacations this year. 
I stayed in a 1 bedroom suite (Rosemary Building) in November for FREE and would actually pay to stay again!

Why would I choose to stay here instead of being directly on the strip?

Reason #1
Simple, the cost. Many people have timeshares they rent here. They usually go from 550$-650$ for the WEEK! Yes folks, 7 days! I know most people don't stay here that long but you have the option. That's a 2 night stay at the Cosmo and many other hotels.
There's a ton to do in Vegas and IMO you cant do it all in 2-3 days.

Reason #2
This resort is literally 5 minutes from the strip, 10-15 minutes from the airport, a 5 minute walk to the South Point Casino, and 5 minutes from Walmart/shopping, and 4 hours from Californian beaches lol. Its near pretty much everything you could want. Close enough to all the action but you still have piece of mind when you return to your room.

Reason #3
Its clean, has a large full kitchen, large bathroom, comfortable bed, updated decor, pullout sleeper in the living room, LCD tv's, and a "home feel." The grounds are also very clean and there is security in the front of the premises.  

We cooked breakfast nearly every morning and even made dinner once. There's plenty of silverware, cups, plates, and anything else one would need. If you'd rather not cook on vacation, you can walk over to the South Point and enjoy some super cheap eats! Prefer something fancier? Drive to the Ihop 10 minutes down or back to the strip. There are plenty of places to eat near the Grandview. Breakfast, lunch, or dinner.

Cons

If you're looking for something "sexy" or  "hip" this may not be the place. Its very family friendly and slow paced. I have absolutely no issues with that. I just wish the gym area was a bit more updated. There are no free weights and the machines are pretty dated.

-No free wifi 
Really not that big of a deal because I used the hotspot on my phone.

I really enjoyed my stay in November and will more than likely return this year. If you'd like to save money for all that Vegas has to offer, this is your spot! I'd definitely recommend this for those on a budget and those with children. 

P.S.
EVERYTHING is cheap at the South Point. Take advantage of it. Its not the sexiest casino but you can have a good time there. I definitely had my doubts but I thoroughly enjoyed myself. Even shot dice with Flavor Flav lol! 5$ tables booooooooooyyyyyyy!Chompies has been around long enough to be a Phoenix (moving) Landmark.  When I moved here they were on 32nd Street between Shea and Cactus.... Now, after a couple of new openings and a couple of moves, they have 3 locations.  I have to admit, I like the newest location the best.  They have moved to Paradise Valley Mall and have a great spot there.  They have access from inside the mall, as well as their own door on the outside just south of the Dillards entrance on the East end of the mall.

The new location affords them a few advantages they didn't have in their old place.  They have windows..... lots and lots of windows.  They have more space.  From the looks of it, the kitchen is larger, and they have a whole side of the place, near the outside door that is dedicated to carry-out service.

Chompies is all about east coast comfort food.... Jewish style, but they have taken Jewish soul food to a whole new place.   They have elevated the art of artery destruction by taking 3 or 4 of those familiar comfort foods and layering them to greasy carb and fat filled perfection, to create dishes that even have comforting names... like knish dish, or Sarah's Favorite, or Grandma Sadie's Meatloaf.   Where else can you get a huge potato knish, cut in half like a hamburger bun, piled high with corned beef and sauerkraut, then topped with cheese and broiled till bubbly?

There have never been many places in town where a die hard bagel fan can get a "real" bagel in all it's boiled and seeded glory.... but Chompies has always been there.  The best day to pick up bagels by the dozen is on Wednesday.  Your money goes farther on Wednesday because they sell 1 and a half dozen for the dozen price. 

They have an extensive selection of bakery goods as well.  I have never preferred their baked goods other than the bagels. The baked goods all taste the same to me.  I find that odd since i don't think mandelbroit is supposed to taste the same as a black and white cookie. I'm sure someones grandma made all their cookies taste the way Chompies does.... but not my grandma.  It's all fine with me though.... The main courses and all the appetizers are soooooo good that I never have room for any cake or cookies after a meal at Chompies.A totally authentic Chinese Restaurant, I felt I was back in Beijing vacationing, although this was not as fancy as the upscale as the Renaissance Hotel in Beijing. 

My waitress barely spoke English and attempted to speak to me in Mandarin, I'm Chinese but was born and raised in the US and my parents both speak Cantonese. Enough personal chattering. 

Since I was dinning myself it was a difficult choice dumplings sounded good but there were ten to an order and that would be just to filling. 
I went with the tofu seafood soup a small order which when it arrived it was large. Nice amounts of shrimp, scallops, mushrooms, eggs and some diced veggies gave this a nice soothing flavor. I ordered the fish with spicy sauce as my main entree. It arrived in a large bowl and it looked SPICY - chucks of tender fish with napa topped with cilantro. the broth had a nice flavor but there was so many red peppers I had to remove some before eating the fish BC I no I would be coughing if I didn't. The fish was so tender, and flavorful and went great with the steamed rice. 

I'm looking forward to coming back here with friends or clients so I can try some other dishes.I was pleasantly surprised. 

The server was incredible.  It was a GREAT value.  We enjoyed our meals. Loved the environment sitting on the patio.

I had the Lasagna and Ash had the Seafood Manicotti.  The Lasagna was great.  I really enjoyed it.  It had a great texture, perfect amount of cheese, and was well seasoned.  The Seafood Manicotti was incredible.  I HIGHLY recommend this dish.

Along with dinner we each enjoyed a wine flight.  They offered a nice selection and we both really enjoyed the tasting.

I would highly recommend this spot.  Give it a try.  We will be back.  For the $$...you cannot go wrong.Cute and comfortable little Italian spot inside Mandalay Bay next to Burger Bar.

You could totally miss this spot since it's pretty dimlit.

I remember the service being quite amazing. I believe I ate here once by myself...yes, sometimes I like to enjoy a nice hearty meal with a sexy glass of wine on my own. Yeah, I can treat myself out if I want, no judging! I ate here again with the SBBF during the time of my tradeshow days as well.

Pasta here is very YUM!

The bread and butter they bring out is also pretty bomb. Then again, at this point in my life, any type of CARB is BOMB!!!

This would be a good place to go if you're staying at Mandalay Bay and don't wanna have to pay bajookoobucks to dine at StripSteak, Fleur De Lys or any other hoity-toity spot in this hotel. This place is AFFORDABLE, which is nice, especially if you just lost ALL your change at the penny slots. ;)So a year or so ago I walked past this little spot and got the most amazing $5 bloody mary ever made with Skyy Vodka and the best handmade spice mix.  I went back early this month for the sole purpose of getting another one of these...and sadly they were no longer $5 but now $8 - but seriously just as awesome as I remembered, so it was totally worth the extra few bucks.   We've ordered at the little window of the bar along the indoor cobblestone 'sidewalks' just before you reach the casino - so you can order, pay and take your drink on your way to where it is your going.   Seriously though, if you love bloody mary's, you have to get one here.QQOM is so much fun to visit! If you're into food, sustainable and local be sure to make your way out to QQOM! The olive oils are extremely good and while a bit on the pricey side (64 bucks a gallon) its worth every penny knowing that you are supporting healthy farm practices and our own local economy. 

It just feels good to buy from here!Wow. There is a lot of stuff here to try. Yea! Olive oils, balsamic vinaigrettes, tapenades. 

The tour is not really for little kids. You sit outside where all the benches are for half of it and listen to the guide talk about the mill and then you go into a very small room where they make the olive oil, where the guide continues explaining the process. It's not an ideal situation for an energetic kid. At the end of the tour you get to try a couple of stuffed olive samples.

They have a lot of places outside where you can sit and enjoy lunch. We had the Kalamata and Manzi. I prefer hot sandwiches so I thought the Manzi was delicious. I had some of their prickly pear lemonade and it was so good. They would run out within minutes of setting it out. Be sure to try it out! We also bought a small loaf of bread and filled a few of the sample cups with a couple of different types of olive oil and vinaigrettes and headed out to sit under one of the olive trees. 

Don't count on their site to be accurate. We went on the first Sunday of their Festival of the New Oil and even though they said there would be wine tastings there weren't. You can't tell me there will be a wine tasting and not come through. Minus one star. 

I only came away with a few goodies (gourmet dipping oil and asiago and Parmesan tapenade) and spent just over $20. Lots of great gifts!We just moved to the area and were looking for a good place to work out. We decided to try the rec center and got a 1 week trial period. We worked out at different times during the day and were always able to get a treadmill or elliptical. I love that the classes are included in the month to month membership-no contracts too!After many visits, I feel it's time to give them a review! I mostly come here for the Pho...but I do enjoy other things on the menu(Love their spring rolls!). Pholicious has good Pho, good prices and the staff is always friendly here.I Have a healthy, nearly full term food baby that Chef Becky Windels & The Herb Box restaurant are responsible for!  This quaint little Bistro/cafe' Located on Market Street in Scottsdale's uber chic DC Ranch Area, is a gift to the culinary world.

Having happily enjoyed several of their sweet baked offerings, I decided to give the lunch menu a spin, what followed was a lesson in how to do food right!

Shortly after being seated by a cheerful, smiling hostess our server Maria dropped by to take our drink order and let us know what the day's specials were.  After looking through the menu I settled on the Rosemary Steak Ciabatta sandwich prepared with charred onion, watercress, white cheddar cheese and a Dijon mayonnaise.  A side of the Smoked Gouda Mac N' Cheese with crispy Rosemary breadcrumbs and an order of Crisp Fingerling potatoes sprinkled with sea salt and served with a side of house made red pepper aioli.

While all of this food might be a case of my eyes being bigger than my stomach, I simply couldnt resist trying a little of everything.  After a short wait, the food arrived and I was certain I'd made great choices.  The Steak sandwich was cooked to order, a little short of medium on the softest ciabatta roll I've had, piled high beside it were sweet potato chips dusted with curry powder (why have I never had this before?)

Biting into the sandwich, I experienced the carefully crafted mix of flavors and textures that a great chef strives to achieve.  The steak was juicy and well complimented by the rosemary, crunchy watercress  for added texture and the tanginess of aged white cheddar, all nicely brought together by the Dijon mayo.  

The house made sweet potato chips are brightened and brought to life by a deft sprinkling of curry powder making you want to eat more than you should (yes, they sell them to-go and I have a bag atop my fridge for a late night snack!)
Let's talk Mac N' Cheese.  I'm going to say it... The Smoked Gouda Mac at The Herb Box is simply the best I've ever had! Creamy cheese and al dente' pasta topped with crunchy rosemary breadcrumbs made this my new favorite dish.  Yes, I know, everyone has a favorite Mac N' Cheese but forget about them!  Try this dish and you will be sold! (I didn't forget to order a portion to-go...I know what's going on at 2 AM when I have the munchies!!)

What's a steak sandwich without potatoes?  Yup, ordered them!  A tasty side of smashed, crisped fingerling potatoes served with a delicious red pepper aioli disappeared just as fast as I could dip and eat! (I can see dropping in for any one of the items I've mentioned so far but together they are DANGEROUS!)
okay, clearly I was done eating and in need of both the check and a pillow but enter Maria again who eagerly suggested I try the pistachio ice cream sandwich cookie.  Never one to ignore the recommendation of a foodservice professional, I agreed that I should have one and what came next was wrong in so many ways I'm almost at a loss for words.

Now I've never had pistachio ice cream though I've always heard it was tasty but this was extraordinary.  My mouth and taste buds were assaulted by the flavors of almond, pistachio, strawberries, blackberries and a delicious thick creme', the crunch of the cookies was the perfect counterpoint to the cold soft ice cream and the fruit just completed the sensation.  Think that was the end?  Try again, the dessert case beckons with such a variety of scrumptious looking treats that must be seen to be believed.

If you haven't figured it out by now, I'm a BIG fan of The Herb Box and Chef Becky's Cuisine, if you haven't had the opportunity to visit, make it a point or I assure you, you're missing out!Second time in and still pleased...
I highly recommend getting there distinctively fresh and smart anti-pasta dish...
Also love the grilled artichoke with the lovely house made lemon aoli...The Shoppes at the Palazzo is one of the finest collections of luxury brands you will find one the strip.  The mix what you need and what you want is dangerous because you can spend a lot of time and money over there and that's exactly what they are going for.  Nestled above the Palazzo Casino floor it feels much more welcoming than the Grand Canal Shoppes at the Venetian although you can't discount the difference in atmosphere being a good change of pace.  The Shoppes at the Palazzo is more of your "traditional" shopping setting.  This is a great place to go for shopping, dinning and just strolling around.  If you haven't stopped by I would make it a point to go.I love this place!! I stumbled upon SWINA one day , online. I was in desperate need of a facial, but did not want to drop alot of money to do so. I decided to give it a try. I was also impressed with the fact that they use all natural products too!! The staff is friendly, I always can get an appt right away!! An added bonus is that they are open late on Thursdays!! They are even kid friendly; I took my 10 yr old to have a facial! I am a customer for life :)My cousin took us here.  He and his sister are regulars.  It was a good experience.  Great sushi rolls.  I loved my old favorite the japanese lasagna roll.  The wait staff are awesome.  There was a fun atmosphere.  I have to admit I was glad my mom wasn't with us because it was very loud and you know how she is!With over a dozen sauces to choose from for your chicken wings....the problem is what to choose?  The waitress was very accomodating and gave us samples of many of the sauces.  An added BONUS to this particular restaurant is the 24/7 hours of operation.  Although I may never be there in the wee hours of the morning, it is nice to know when I am in the area, there is an awesome place for buffalo wings.  We ordered 18 wings with Medium, Asian Zing, Caribbean Jerk, and Parmesan Garlic assortment of sauces.  Also my friend also ordered the "Buffalito Tacos" with her choice of any sauce, but she chose the standard BBQ sauce.  Granted we both ordered water for our drinks, the cost of everything including tip was below $25 for two....NOT BAD!  If you are fan of buffalo wings like I am.....you will enjoy Buffalo Wild Wings whichever restaurant you choose.  I can't wait to go again!

(Sidenote:  I  found out from the waitress that Buffalo Wild Wings is a large franchise chain that still has to creep into the Orange County area.  Until then, the Chino Hills or Rancho Cucamonga area will have to do.  But for this review, I reviewed the Montecito-North Las Vegas restaurant.)Everyone wants to be next door at BURGR right now so it's a tough ride for Yolos.  The drinks are sensational though and the food was just the right amount. Tasty but not over the top so you could enjoy the rest of your evening.  You won't be blown away but will not be disappointed in any way either.  And i'm picky about Mexican and down right fascist about great Margaritas so that's saying something.Good food. Nice service, decent price for the strip. Way less busy than other nearby similar Mexican restaurants probably because it's indoors only but good break from the heat! Great 10$ lunch special (15 with a margarita)Walking in I felt like I traveled back into time.. The 50's maybe? Awesome vibe. Totally made me want to sit and eat and enjoy the ambiance.

The burgers are delicious and juicy. Love that you can add as many topping as you want for free, except the special ones (bacon, guac, and egg, etc) free toppings include, onion rings, chipotle sauce, jalapeños, etc)

0f course my burger had a bunch of toppings and I got the classic burger, which is the smallest. It was good size and delicious. I decided on onion rings, grilled onions, lettuce, chipotle mayo, ranch dressing, bacon, jalapeños. Omg hit the spot. Spicy yet crunchy.

We order the mix basket of fries and onion rings. I found the fries to taste fresh, no frozen. Could use a little more salt and I didn't like that the onion rings were not very crunchy. They got chewy and were soggy compared to others I've had else where

The raspberry lemonade they have is delicious and I highly recommend it. Good bye soda! Wish I could get the recipe.

Customer service was good and attentive. Only problem was at the end when we asked him to split the bill and instead he put it all on one card.Mmmmm delicious. Had the loaded fries with chili, cheese, and jalapeños and DEVOURED them in 13 seconds. My burger was juicy.....in fact the juices were running down my arm. I also love the fact how the burgers are cooked to order!

Staff very friendly and attentive.  Milkshake was ok. 

Go!!I love this place.

It's WAY, WAY better than Rehab.

It's a much more chill crowd and there are three pools to go into.  The layout is nice and the staff is very friendly.

OH! And they have a bar/TV area in case you are there on a pre-season Football Sunday! :)I've been to a lot of pool club in Vegas and this is my favorite pool club in Vegas, so far.
Good space, so you don't have to rub against wet drunk people when you walk around.
DJ is good most of the time.
Crowd is usually good but sometimes you see people who should go to Rehab or regular pool. 
They check EVERYTHING in your purse and wallet. Don't bring any gum or mints because they will toss away anyway.
Ladies, front guys are very nice if you are nice, fun, classy and dress well (Remember, this is a pool CLUB). They usually let us in without the line or charges.
We always meet nice and fun people here. Love it!Yes, it is just a casino bar, but it's actually a pretty nice one.  The seats are super comfortable, the bartenders are pretty friendly and attentive, and they have 25c video poker at the bar.  Great place to meet friends and grab a drink, especially if you're heading to Pure.On this visit we shared a large bowl of tom ka gai soup which was loaded with chicken. It was on the spicy side and delicious, but IMHO it would have benefited by the addition of a little more coconut milk to round out the flavor. We also shared orders of sweet chili basil chicken and seafood eggplant. Both were above average, but the meal ended up being too much of a good thing.  

A rating of 3.5 would be most appropriate.Favorite grocery store in town. Produce is always fresh and the bulk foods section rarely out of stock. The aisles are nice and customer friendly, clean and organized. LOVE LOVE LOVE!For 3 years I have lived less than a mile from Top Shelf, and for more than half that time I would drive by and scoff ... What kind of name is Top Shelf ? Sounds like a strip club, not  a Mexican joint.

Well, I wish I wouldn't have been so prejudice. This place is awesome. My mouth waters every time I think about it.  I only eat 2 things here, the chips and salsa and the Carne fundido. Its all I need. Oh, add a pitcher of margaritas and I am in hog heaven.

First the chips & salsa -- this is one of the rare places that brings you 2 bowls of salsa. One mild and chunky. One puree of the HOT stuff. Mix n match and you have a nice treat before the big meal. They also have bottled hot sauce on the table. The possibilities are endless! 

Next, the fundido -- I LOVE fundido. Top Shelf has THE BEST I have ever had. Its rich, creamy, tangy, smoky and delish. For the gringos out there, this is a chimichanga smothered in a spicy cream cheese sauce. This is not health food, but being happy is healthy, so its all equal in the end. Live a little and try it. They have pollo fundido too...

Top it off with some margaritas. Real, salty, tangy margaritas. And guess what?!?! They actually put tequila in them!! Thats more than I can say about the majority of the cheap Mexican places around the valley. 

Anyway - go to Top Shelf. It's awesome. Who cares about what they have on the wall (the have a sweet tropical mural!). You go to a restaurant to eat, not judge their interior decorating style. Have  a margarita and forget that materialistic stuff~~I love Fresh!!!

The store is cozy but very inviting with plenty of different fragrances to choose from. My absolute favorite scent is Citron de Vigne...it's very light & citrusy and champagne inspired fragrance. It's a perfect fragrance for summertime because it's not too heavy. The last time I popped in here I was planning on getting another Eau de Parfum, but ended up getting the new fragrance Brown Sugar. It also has a citrus notes w/ a hint of sweetness to it. The sales associate was really helpful too and mentioned that the Brown Sugar scent could be combined w/ Citron de Vigne. I love Fresh fragrances b/c they are very clean & light and also a perfect size to pack if you're traveling.

If I was ballin I would probably buy everything in the store b/c I love all the Fresh products! (Especially the candles & diffusers!)After about a year of hype from friends and neighbors, we gave Maizie's a try about a month ago.  It was a weeknight and we took advantage of some great happy hour pricing on cocktails and appetizers.  The service was slow and the hummus was positively dry and awful, but the entrees were absolutely irresistible.  I liked that you could choose from half a dozen different types of bread for your sandwich-- it made for a lengthy ordering process.

I went again for brunch a few weekends ago with some of my friends.  The atmosphere was lovely and my mimosa was just $3.  The waitstaff were attentive and don't appear to have spit in my drink when we  had to send our coffee cups back because they were covered in schmutz.  I had the breakfast burrito.  Let me tell you, I lived in New Mexico (the home of the most amazing breakfast burritos) for seven years and this big burrito gave any New Mexican burrito a run for its money.  

Because I understand that no one is perfect all the time, I'm a Maizie's fan for life.  I just won't ever, ever, EVER get the hummus again.  :-)Hit up the Friday early show with the gf , my daughter and her bf.  It was a surprise birthday present - NICE ! We received a free drink, a signed pic and a program with third row seats ( i still haven't read the program ) 

As cheesy as i thought this show would be ( and yes, there were some cheesy parts ) 
The guy does an amazing job with the ventriloquism skills.  Are the puppets corny ?  yeah.  are the songs corny ?  yep.  and the general schtick  ?  Oh yeah ! In fact, the show kinda reminded me of the heap of shows i saw in my youth - Donnie and Marie/The osmonds, Sonny and Cher, Hee Haw, etc etc.  I guess one of the reasons i give the show high marks is the nostalgia - brought back some memories of those sappy shows.

Mixed feeling about his solos - major sappy ass songs - but since he's giving the proceeds from the sales of those songs to charity, i'll give him a pass.

Once is enough and if you can get a discount ticket i recommend you go see it.The crepes here were fresh and good- not the best, but pretty good.  It is a small space but it's open, airy and clean.

I am giving this place 4 stars after debating giving it 3 stars because the crepe stuffed with tomatoes, mozzarella and bacon, topped with a fried egg, was really, really good.  My own crepe was good, but not amazing- I wish I had ordered the tomato/bacon crepe!  My own ratatouille crepe was just OK, nothing spectacular, and pretty plain.   

I got their iced chai which was good, and their "sweet" crepe with the dark chocolate, caramel and sea salt was just OK, not as caramely as I would like.Fresh coffee, a crepe (sweet or savory) and sitting looking out to the intersection. A perfect start to the day.

The place is TINY and is set up with more communal type tables along with window bar seating. So if you don't like getting cozy with your neighbor (when it is busy) pick a different place. It would however be a shame because they do make a mean cup of coffee. They've got a guest espresso on every week.

The crepe menu changes weekly, sometimes daily, completely based on what's fresh and available. The crepes are the best I've had since spending 2 weeks in France. The prices meant seem high but the same with the coffee they are consistently the best.  Not overly cakey but not too crisp either. With just the right amount of filling so everything can shine. When ever they have one with a fried egg im game. The runny yolk ends up being the perfect sauce. They also got scones and muffins too if you fancy them.I avoided eating here because of its historically known giant portions.  That is no longer the issue.   Now, when I order there are actually healthy options like spinach Ahi salad with normal portions.  The mini pizza is really mini. The plates are big, but portions reasonable. The mother load cake is giant to be shared.  Nice happy hour drinks until 6:30pm. In town square mall. family of four $80 approxWe went to the one off of Green Valley tonight.  It was great we had 2 servers and my son had his birthday and they brought him out a little cupcake and he was delighted.  The fish tacos were delicious and the servers were very attentive.  Great experience.It's over the top, it's cheap and its tacky! It's everything Vegas should be! If you forget anything stop on by. You know you're only gonna wear it once anyway! When you get tired of Chanel, Barney's and Niemans- or you loose all your money. Forever is there.

xx ForeverWent to this location because it is gluten free (have a daughter that is gluten/soy/dairy allergic), a vegetarian and a vegan in the family.  Oh yeah, one meat eater as well. What a wonderful surprise!!!  The food was delicious, lots of choices for all and the portions were a very nice size.  We all walked away very satisfied and looking forward to more visits.  
You will not be disappointedThough we went to Eddie's House for happy hour and not dinner I can say it was delicious and very reasonably priced! All apps. were 50% off and they were served up quickly! Customer service was extremely quick and accommodating. We will defiantly be going back soon to try dinner. Thanks Chef Eddie Matney!I will need to go back to firm up my impression.  With that said, went there on a birthday and enjoyed the meal.

Lavosh that was for the table was nice as was the pesto that accompanied it..

Lamb chops with humas was really good.  

Sea bass, probably the nicest best prepared and tasting one I've had in recent meals.  Really good.   1/2 order portion was enough too.

Mac-n-cheese side was the only real miss.  Salty and not very cheesy flavor, and runny vs good and creamy and cheesy.  Would not get again. 

Atmosphere, music (contemporary) and service all good.  Service was really good and stood out....

I liked my time there...  Will go back....  Will take business guests too..

Not a 5 just because of the Mac-n-cheese.We kicked off Restaurant Week here and had a great time.  The ambiance is great and they have music that can be a little loud but definitely not as obnoxious and distracting as some other Scottsdale establishments.

For first course we had spinach salad and the lamb slider (says plural on the menu, but you only get one).  The slider didn't have a ton of flavor that I like.  It was complex but on the bland side and I don't like the taste of rye..  The spinach salad was great and love the little fried balls of cheese.

Second course my friend chose the Honey-spiced drumsticks with mac n cheese, which portion wise was huge, and I got the pork chop with stuffed jalapenos, less thrilling portion wise.  The drumsticks were pretty good but my favorite was the mac and cheese.  The stuffed jalapenos were good but I didn't enjoy the pork chops so much.  It was sweet, and not too dry but somehow not very exciting.

For dessert my friend chose the apple cobbler a la mode which was great although it was very thin (it was very wide and thin, so lots of crumble and less filling).  I picked the upside down pineapple farina cake.  I didn't know what farina was, and still really don't, but it tastes like a sweet corn muffin.  Not a huge fan after the pineapple ran out.

All in all, the atmosphere is pretty awesome and its cool that you can see the kitchen.  The service is great yet not overbearing.  The Restaurant week menu is worth a try although the portions seem uneven.  The passion for food is there, just hidden or steam lost at times.Fantastic onion soup!  Rich flavor lots of onions simmered all day, and just the right amout of what must be gruyere (sp?).  Anyway- worth it for that.  I have had the mussles and they are good.  Chicken was bon, but, then again, it is just roasted chicken.  I wish they would get together with the new French bakery for their bread!  Bread at Boulevard- 'eh; bread at bakery- c'est magnifique!  Overall, though this place is a gem in FH.Came here for lunch with the team at work - the seafood was very fresh and tasted great!  I had the seafood ceviche: octopus, oysters, scallops, shrimp, etc...and the 7 Sea soup with tortilla.  The variety of hot sauces was great and I enjoyed the "habanera" hot sauce quite a bit - no serious kick here, but spicy enough for most people.  The soup was filled with fresh seafood along with crab legs.  Not convenient to crack the crab legs with a work crowd, but a lot of fun nonetheless.  Some had the shrimp tacos, machaca beef chimichanga, salads, etc...all the food looked very fresh.  Warning: the portions are very large!  As far as atmosphere goes, well, it doesn't have any - it's definitely a "hole in the wall".  Will definitely be back for the other dishes.Seafood in the desert - Actually pretty good!
Before my spring break drive back I stopped at Mariscos Sinaloa.

Some reviewers aren't fans of the fluorescent lights and the jukebox but they didn't detract from my experience. Originally I was in a rush to get going and thought eating here would be a quick in and out. When I saw the free chips arrive though I settled in for sit-down restaurant mode. 

I got the:
Shrimp Ceviche Tostada
Shrimp Taco
Fish Taco

The tostada part was pretty soggy after a mound of ceviche was on top of it but it didn't matter due to those *Free* chips. One portion of ceviche was literally like a half lb of seafood.

The shrimp and fish tacos were pretty good as well though I was eating them while driving in the Phx traffic jam. The creamy chipotle and hot salsa that come with the tacos are winners as well. 

Now if you crave fish tacos you don't have to drive the 350+ miles to San Diego.It was one of those nights when I wanted something sweet and cold, but I didn't want your average joe ice cream. I read about Sweet Republic in a local magazine and I couldn't believe a Cheese Course Duo ice cream
was offered at the shop. It was a necessity for me to try it that night.

I was the only one in the shop by the time I arrived, being close to quitting time but the woman behind the counter was extremely helpful. The first thing I wanted to sample was the Cheese Duo flavor. It consisted of Roquefort cheese and Medjool dates. It was intense, rich and very unexpected.  It was delicious but I wanted something "cooler". Then, as I walked over to the sorbet area, the flavor, Mango Lassi, caught my eye right away. I knew at that moment, the Mango Lassi was my treat for the night. I was so sure of myself, that I didn't even sample it.
Once I put the spoon in my mouth, my craving was fulfilled, and I was happy. 

Nice location, simple interior..i don't want to say Pinkberry inspired interior, but that's what it reminded me of. 

Thank you Sweet Republic. I'll be back.

GenWe stayed at Encore this past weekend and had an amazing time, service was outstanding from registration to the concierge. On the Encore side of things the highlight for me was definitely the European pool, its a great atmosphere and we could have stayed at the pool for days. As for the Wynn, it was equally awesome. We saw La Reve and loved it and the service at the Country Club for dinner was outstanding. Our server was Cyrus and we loved him, definitely ask to be in his section if you go there. We got a great deal on our room, the only downside is that drinks and food are very expensive every at both hotels, not just in the restaurants but at the convenience store and by the pool too.Best of the best. Only con is the abysmal valet service which is the case in  all the 5 star hotels  I've been in.Was here with my wife and son today. Never been to a Red Robin before so this was a treat. Food was pretty decent and staff was nice. They had the air conditioner blasting so was not very comfortable. But we live in Arizona so that is a common occurance.Good stuff! Reminds me of a small pho place in San Jose I used to go to almost everyday for a while.

The pho is very good. Not the absolute best, but very good. Their fresh spring rolls are excellent as well. Cool, crisp and tasty. I also like their sandwiches as well, but could do without the tomato in them. Kind of strange.If I were strictly reviewing their smoothies, I'd give them 5 stars all the way.  I used to be a big Jamba Juice fan, but Tropical Smoothie just tastes better and much fresher.  I went in today to pick up lunch.  It's always the same super nice guy working and he somehow remembers my name even though I haven't been in there in a long time.  It was slow, so there wasn't a wait.  I ordered the combo, which includes food, a smoothie and chips.  I got the buffalo chicken wrap and the acai berry smoothie.  The wrap was disappointing, but my smoothie was delicious, which more than made up for it.  It was about $11 total.  Next time, I'll just stick to the smoothie, which is really a lunch within itself!Stay away from the entree's and go for the appetizers. Happy hour is worth it - service is very good.  Good atmosphere with nice hip music...we like to go here for happy hour but again I have always been disappointed with their entrees.  Wait staff is very chatty and friendly - remember you when you walk in.....Best thing is there Calamari App , great sushi (especially during happy hour) worst thing is the Yaki Soba noodle entree.  We go back on a regular basis...you should too.this place is such a treat!  my world of eateries in LV has always been so small. nearly every trip has always meant trips to various buffets on the strip or to chinatown.  

what a breath of fresh air to find this lovely jewel on sahara blvd!  this restaurant offers healthy, tasty menu options for all types of eaters.  in addition to menu items made with meat, vegetarian and vegan menu items are generous, especially when every meat dish can be made vegetarian or vegan!

restaurant is super clean, comfortable, and staff are super friendly. service is prompt too!

my friends and i split the following (all were made vegetarian upon request):
turkey club w/ side salad
veggie grill panini w/ side salad
sausage pizza w/ side salad
baked french fries

the side salad is made with fresh firm field greens and tossed with a tangy dressing-delicious!

the sandwiches are made with wheat bread and fat-free mayo.  

numerous meat substitutes are available for turkey, chicken, ham, bacon, turkey, shrimp, tuna, salmon, and ground beef.  

we ordered sandwiches because we needed to eat quickly, but they have plenty of other dishes, such as curry, pastas, quesadillas, teriyaki rice, and pizzetas.Loving it here... Drove all the way fr Henderson on a mission to check out this lil gem...

Much to our delight... we were pleasantly full & surprised... if anyone has visited 'Bread & Butter' up in Henderson then you might agree with me that it has a kind of similar vibe... wraps with salad... Very green greens are the way to my lil 'ol heart...

Would visit more often if they were closer to my side, however, if I am on the W side... I will stuff my tummy...

Server sold me on the 150 calorie filled Red Velvet Cafe - was happy to share with G & only consume 75! BAzing! =)

Very yummm!

your constant companion,

~deirdraI love me some frozen yogurt!  I got samples of the tart, mango and green tea and topped it off with some fresh mango.  At first, I was a little disappointed -- the tart was really just tart and needed some more sweetness (Pinkberry's tart is much better) and the green tea wasn't great either -- but the mango was yum-o!  With the bits of fresh mango in it, it was delish.  It had just the right amount of tartness, sweetness and was so refreshing!
I tasted my sister's taro froyo and realized that I had made a mistake -- I shoulda skipped the tart and green tea and gotten a cupful of that tasty, tasty taro! MAAAN!  That taro is some good stuff!  NOW I'm a believer!  Don't make the same mistake I made.  Get yourself some of that taro frozen yogurt!
If taro or mango doesn't float your boat, they also have lots of other flavors, including some sugar-free flavors.  They also have tons of toppings to choose from and some syrups (chocolate, fudge, caramel, etc).
It's also a great bang for your buck!  Mine and my sister's froyos (with my 3 flavors and her 20 or so toppings...read her review, she loves her toppings) were only about $5!I've made two trips here. First time with my husband, we came on a Saturday morning and sat outside. I got Tori's tortilla with turkey sausage subbed for the chorizo. I got the coffee cake which was good..I was expecting something denser but it was super light-textured. Another  yelper suspected a cake mix but I bake a lot and it seemed house-made legit. My husband got French toast and eggs...I had a bite of his French toast and it was good. My burrito was excellent...packed with veggies and scrambled eggs and cheese...I was super happy they have green Tabasco too. 

Second visit was with my mom on a weekday morning. We were seated quickly and were soon drinking coffee. We both ordered a special - sweet potato skillet with cranberry sausage and eggs. We also got coffee cake. Like the first time it was super fluffy and had a good flavor but I'll just get toast next time and save some calories for eggs and cheese ;)

Skillets were good...I would have preferred more veggies and fewer sweet potatoes but I am a big veggie fan so take that Into account. I would have also liked something more acidic thrown into the mix so I ended up asking for my fave green tabasco again. 

Service was good, nice variety and good quality of ingredients. Next time I plan to try lunch.  They offer coupons every month on their website but make sure you check that out before you go as they need to be printed.Ok, well I'll try to be impartial even though this is my friend's restaurant.  The service is very friendly, however, just getting to order seemed to take a bit.  Yet from there, the service gets a lot better.  They're always on hand, and they were so kind to take our requests.  I have to say, there wasn't that many side dishes served like I read in Teri C's review.  The sangchu and pa (green onion and lettuce salad) had too much green onion in it.  It sort of wanted to make my eyes tear up.  The sam gyup sal (three layered pork, resembles a huge bacon) and this type of kalbi sal (the kalbi with the bone at the end) tasted really good.  They insisted that we eat the kalbi first though then the fried rice (actually it's fried bibim bbap) which we didn't understand.  Should be able to eat it at the same time if you wanted.  Well they cook it on a brazier.  They also serve beer here.  Plenty of room, and overall I was satisfied.Good korean food for vegas. I really enjoyed the kimchi grilled on the pan and the pork belly. Good place if youre craving meat and korean food. The sevice was really good too.  No ajumas ignoring you when you ask for more food.Nice atmosphere, good food! They cooked my eggs perfect. Very casual, homey style service.I have only ever ordered food for delivery. The people on the phone are always very nice. I have always gotten my food faster than what they tell me. I only gave them four stars because I have to admit that they aren't the best Chinese food that I have ever had. However, they are very consistent and you get great value for your money.Krazy Buffet? What is KRAZZYYYY about a great buffet with a huge selection of Chinese and Japanese deliciousness. I walked in not knowing what to expect because there have been some gross buffets in Las Vegas so I went in without any expectations.

Luckily I made a great decision and the food was fresh, hot, and scrumptious. They had plenty of greasy, fried appetizers that were all tasty and a great start to the meal. To my surprise the sushi was really fresh and there was a dedicated sushi chef making rolls the whole night which was refreshing to see. Generally when you head to a buffet the sushi is fairly fishy smelling and rarely edible but kudos to the sushi chef here.

If you are looking for a buffet where the busboys take your plates creepily within 2 seconds of finishing your meal then Krazy Buffet is the nuts. I felt like I was being hurried up every time he'd grab my plate before I even stood up. If that was my only knock on the whole experience I guess I can't be too upset with the overall experience. Give it a shot, then thank me later.This hotel is well located if you're doing some sort of University of WI Madison business.

Its nearly as nice as the Hilton on the Square which, unfortunately, isn't that great. Free parking is nice. The rooms are clean, efficient and properly sorted in all the ways that you'll need it to be. I've stayed here a handful of times in the past year and can highly recommend it.

Something weird happened last time I was there (specificly, they gave me keys to an occupied room) and the staff went above and beyond not only to make it right with me....and gave me a brilliant hangover the next day by sending a bottle of wine up to my room.Sat outside
great service, great food- Steak & Pomme Frittes, Amys Bolongase

terrific dessert

will be back & oftenThis place is the bomb! I go here all the time with the wife! Just try it, anything on the menu is great!I love the huge collection of their Kachina dolls.
They have authentic dolls from Hopi tribe. 
They have a section of items on sale and you may find a great deal for a beautiful art piece! 
I personally found a great piece by Lauren Honyouti which was originally priced for $2200 for $600.I'm a fan of this library. It's nice, smaller than others (like Sahara West). It's a quaint place to study if that's what you're into. I had problems signing into the wifi from my macbook, but otherwise I'm happy with my experience here. 

Wouldn't go out of my way to get here, I probably would go to Sahara West if I'm looking for a large library with more resources.I have been to this place only once which was like 2 years back. One thing that stick'd out for me was the colorful interior with the theme of Indian flag. We were a group of 11 and we had a good time in their just having fun and enjoying the food. They served in copper plates and copper tumblers.
The food was excellent we pretty much ordered the whole vegetarian menu n like a chicken dish.. The taste reminded of food back home. 
They even had a big screen TV playing Indian music videos, some of musics were the once we grew up with. Brought back memories.
Me n my friends still talk about the food in dhaba n the experience we had in there. A memorable time to cherish and maybe go visit this place one day.a guy at work told me about this place so i decided to phone in an order from my car after work i tmust say it took me 3 times to get somebody on the line, i think they may own the store next door and thats who was answering the phone in a heavy indian accent after my 3rd attempt i finally got a employ/family member im guessing the daughter who spoke clear english i told her ihad not been there before and did not have a menu but between my semi knowledg te of indian food and a few  sugestions from her i got some great dishes spinich dish w/chicken a spicy curry lamb dish and a great vegi dish rice and naan yummmmySuper cute/cozy and comfortable. You have to make a reservation to eat here...but I actually appreciated it. When we sat down there was water at the table, chutney and Papadum to nosh on.

I also wasn't overly bombarded with service. Rather, they moved silently, taking plates away when needed and filling my water when low.

Overall the food was very good, and the portion sizes were VERY generous (I hope that doesn't change). They deviated a bit from the classic recipes which I actually didn't mind. 

The owner seems like a sweet little lady; and it's right next door to an Indian Grocer so if you're so inclined to do a little shopping after your, meal you can.  Lastly, tableware is very classic and cute, while the decor itself is modern and clean. 

I will be returning.So it's pricier than In N Out but what did you expect? Just look at the establishment, you know you're not about to buy two cheeseburgers for $1. They have the menu right in front of the restaurant, so you should peep at it before you make your decision. If it's too much for a burger, then go directly across the street to McDonald's.

Our waiter was on the ball. I never had to ask for a refill on my soda. He would bring me a new glass before I made that funny noise through the straw when there's no more drink left in the cup/glass. He didn't do this just once but twice without me saying a word. He repeatedly checked up on us. This is an example of how service in Vegas should be like. You don't want to send anyone home a loser. Least you can do for stripping their kid's college fund or taking their home's mortgage is give them good service and make them feel somewhat better about themselves.

I was tempted to try their kobe beef burger for $17. However, I just went with the combo: soda, classic, burger and fries which was not much less but it did come with a soda and fries. I substituted my regular fries for sweet potato fries which was not a problem at all. I'm a sucker for sweet potato fries. They were alright here. 

My classic burger was made just about right. Medium - slight pink in the middle. Tender meat and all the condiments and toppings complimenting one another. All this sided with a pickled cucumber which I'm not usually a fan of but it goes together after every burger bite. Wash it down with tasty beverage and everything plays out like a
perfect harmony.

My cousins ordered the chocolate milkshake to share. The shake looks like it's 1000 calories, the drink is massive (no joke, I'll put up a picture soon). Between the two girls they were not even able to finish it. Maybe it was too sweet for their blood. It was more of a full on dessert than a drink.

Our tab for three people came out to $40ish probably close to $50 after I put down the tip because I thought our waiter deserved it. Pricey but it was a pretty darn good burger and I'm not much of a burger person myself. Once in a while a joint like this isn't a bad idea. I'm not eating $15 burgers daily anyways. Besides, you're in Vegas, live a little.

Throughout the course of our meal, they had a lot of classic 80's jams on. No complaints there, can never get tired with that musical selection.

Last note: I believe they close late too because my friends dined here after hitting up the clubs.An incredible hand-crafted burger.  The beef tasted incredibly fresh and the side of onion rings were equally fantastic.  Basically a wonderful place to start a night.  In fact our night included the Love Cirque Du Soleil which is being reviewed separately.Pricey but well its in The Mirage so i guess i needs to be pricey. Great burger though. If you are in the Mirage try it out. :)Time to get your drinking cap on, because this place has a large assortment of beers!  My 4 star rating comes from the beer selection, and the food deserves 3 stars.

I want to start by saying that I really like the decor and atmosphere in this place.  Cute, quaint, and traditional.  Occasionally I have come here and was greeted with a live singing and performing Irish band, which is a nice touch after a long week at work.

My last visit proved to be pleasant.  It was a Friday night and surprisingly we were able to be sat immediately.  We made it to happy hour in time, which runs there until 7 pm!  I got a delicious Weheinstephen (sp.), and a large one at that.  I decided to order my personal fav...Corned beef and cabbage.

Now, I don't know if I am thinking of someplace else, but I swore that their corned beef and cabbage came in whole chunks and NOT in sliced deli meat style.  I was slightly disappointed when my food arrived at the sight of that...something about having the extra fat and shredded texture is what I crave...and it provides WAY MORE FLAVOR.

Aside from that, the food was tasty.  My fiance ordered the braised beef and the gravy was thick and amazing!  Delicious flavor.  I would have liked to see larger proportions for the cost of the meal, as we both had no leftovers to take home with us.

In either case, definitely check this place out and TRY THE BEERS!Typically the husband and I don't care for Harkins Theatres for a myriad of reasons, but this one seemed to be a step above all the other locations.  First of all, they seemed to be well staffed, and their employees actually did their jobs well.  I can't tell you how many times we have gone to see a 3D movie and haven't been given our glasses.  Second, the lobby is small, but designed well enough to hold a lot of people and keep the lines out of your way.  The theatres were clean, the bathrooms were clean and the picture/sound quality was great.For some reason, this lowe's is substantially more hopeful than their location in Tustin, ca. I had to run in several times as my buddy and I were working on my car. 

The first time I ran in, literally, because we had already drained the oil from the car. We needed a longer adapter for a ratchet, and Rick, the Man, helped me locate several choices and even suggested one with a wobble which was very fitting as the bolt we were trying to reach is deep in the car.

The second time we came in on the same day, we needed butane because stupid sears didn't carry any even though they sell torches which use the fuel. This time, Rick, the Man, and his pal, Stephanie helped us out and she went to the trouble of looking up fuel burning temperatures on the computer.

The last time we went in, we had to just buy the propylene torch they carried because the stupid sears one was too weak.

I wish all hardware stores were this helpful!Four of us = $64.00, Beats the airfare to Venice....so we had to try it. There is a bit of a wait. You get a ticket for a certain time and then you come back and get in line. Most Gondola drivers serenade you with great Italian songs! The ride itself may be only 10 minutes, but it is super relaxing in super charged Las Vegas! AHHHHHHHHHHHHH!The best part about Fresh & Easy is their prepared foods. They have a lot of ready-to-microwave/grill/bake meals in their refrigerator section that are healthier than traditional frozen meals and reasonably priced ($5 for a chicken breast with roasted kale and mashed potatoes; $5 for a thai noodle salad with shrimp and veggies). They also have a lot of healthy-ish prepared sides and snacks like hummus with veggies, egg salad, caprese salad. Their party platters seem like a good option for potlucks.  Another plus is they have a surprisingly varied selection of beers and wine for being such a small grocery store.

The negatives about this place is that the price for produce is expensive. I only buy the produce that is on sale, everything else I get at Safeway or Sprouts - no way am I paying $1 for 1 apple or $8 for a carton of raspberries! Also the parking lot has those islands in the middle of their turnout lanes, BUT THEY AREN'T VISIBLY painted or anything. I came so close to hitting the middle island today when I was turning into the parking lot! What is the point of those things? get rid of them OR make them more visible!This place gets packed for lunch, and rightfully so.  Delicious sandwiches that are absolutely huge.  Can easily be shared with two people.  I think I got the Rachel, which is pastrami with thousand island dressing and coleslaw (I think).  Anyway, it was huge.  I ate half of it and it was plenty for me.  

Make sure to come early or have some time because the lines get a little long.Pho-ck it.

Pho and I have had a rocky relationship from the get-go. 

I originally tried it in Seattle where my sister swore up and down about its deliciousness and supposed healing powers. 
 
I was super stoked to try this magical soup!
I was sorry to report to her that I did not, ahem, like it at all. I wasn't a fan of the flowery tasting broth and the raw meat that had to cook in there. And no, I don't think the Vietnamese are "savages" as one yelper was insinuating I said!

Anyhoo. I wasn't a fan. 

Jump to 2 years later. Vegas. My sister again tries to convince me and brings me here to Lemongrass. I wussed out and went with a Banh Mi (which was delicious!) and decided to give her pho a taste. Lo and behold, I didn't hate it!  

From that instance, I vowed to order my own the next time I had the opportunity. 

That such time came early this December and I am glad to report that I am a phan!!  The staff here is very friendly and their food is fresh and delicious. 

Thank you, Lemongrass. You win.Lemongrass has delicious food and tea.  The service was good.  My only suggestion/concern is the smell.  Need better ventilation.Okay, this review has nothing to do with the food - because it's always good at Paradise Bakery and Café - this has to do with the FREE WI-FI. This location is great for those of us that need a location that is Cool , has facilities, and lots of places to Plug in your lap tops.  You don't even need to buy anything to get the FREE WI-FI. Walk in, hang a right and there are plenty of sitting spots and most of those spots have wall outlets.. Sweeeeet.   Now, if the place is packed, walk right next door to the Book Store and use their WI-FI , and if the book store is full, StarBucks is just around the corner.   And this place is perfectly located right off the Loop 101 and Scottsdale Road. Oh, and the cookies are great...I have stayed at Emerald Suites a number of times and every time has been splendid. Yes, I know it is quite a ways away from the strip and there isn't a convenient casino right down the stairs, however, it is relaxing, CLEAN and has quite convenient amenities. Each room has a kitchenette, meaning stove, microwave, oven, fridge, sink, etc. The kitchenette is also stocked with the main untincils and cookware. If there are some items missing, room service gives no hassle in delivering any missing goods. I am definitely a fan of Emerald Suites South Las Vegas, not the Cameron one which is completely D grade. My only complaint with Emerald Suites would be that, years ago, I left something in the room and when I talked to the manager he insured me that they have my item and my item will be shipped back within the next few days charged on my card. That, unfortunately, never followed through. I guess like all hotels, don't bring anything you wouldn't want to leave behind.On Saturday, we saw on Yelp that Johnny Fontane's Beach House was having a free pig roast with a raffle where the proceeds went to an Epilepsy charity (charity is always a good thing)  and since we had never been there and are very adventurous, we thought we would give it a try.  We went over around 2:30 and there were a few people who were probably regulars with a great little band playing 50's and 60's music.  First thing we noticed when we drove up was a dunking pool and a whole pig roasting on a spit outside.  How fun is that?  The food was amazing - pulled pork, bbq ribs, bean, rice, and great homemade tamales.  We were lucky enough to meet the owners, Joey and Dodie, among other people, and they were nice enough to give us tastings off the roasted pig outside later in the day...Pig Cheek - YUM!.  It was a really fun place and we would go back even without the free food.  Everyone was really friendly and the only weakness I would say is we got the most UN-long island ice tea we had ever had, but whatever it was, it was pretty tasty.Date/Time:  Saturday - 1:30pm
Occasion:   Lunch
Party of:  Two
Ordered:  American ginseng with chicken soup, minced beef over rice + egg, satay oxtail and tendon noodle soup, lychee iced drink
Total incl gratuity: $120

Yes, you read right. $120 for two people for Chinese food.  Is it over-priced. Extraordinarily!  Is it worth it?  Absolutely.  After a long night of party hopping from LAVO, to Marquee, to Tao, being seated in a quiet booth in the corner and lunching on Chinese is the way to go.

The American ginseng is amazing.  There is a word in Chinese that describes the effect this soup has and I'm not sure if I'm translating it properly, however, drinking this soup really provides a "healing" effect especially after what we put our bodies through in Vegas (8+ hours of 5 inch heels, taking in second-hand smoke...you get the idea).  The bowl is small and runs you $20 for one, although it is SO good.  I was skeptical of the minced beef initially.  It is a dish normally not ordered by the typical Asian person.  It turned out to be generous in portion and very tasty.  The raw egg is stirred into the saucy beef mixture and tossed with the rice.  It is served piping hot in order to cook the egg.  I don't think this dish is on the menu so it must be special ordered.  Finally, the oxtail and tendon soup is good in small doses but a little overwhelming when you're eating a large bowl of it.  This is dish you'll want to share amongst two to three people.  Oxtail is meaty and the satay flavor is strong.

We enjoyed ourselves so much at Zine, we came here both days for lunch! Although steep in price, I think Zine makes for an excellent choice for good Chinese food inside a hotel.fairly decent italian restaurant.  food itself good, but not sure if it's good enough to justify their prices.  wild mushroom pizza was interesting.  cozy yet boring decore.This is a nice hotel for Waterloo.  Our visit was with our two girls ages 3 and 5.  They loved it.  The pool was nice and breakfast was good for a continental breakfast.  The rooms are smaller but clean.We celebrated my nephew's first communion here...the service and food was fabulous.

Here's our blog post about the experience:

http://tipsareincluded.blogspot.ca/2013/05/charcoal-steak-house.html

The Charcoal Steakhouse is a great place for dinner...or lunch...or brunch...Definately the nicest mall in K-W with a good selection of stores and a decent food court. You'll find groceries, Target, Apple, many fashion and electronics options here.I remember growing up when this place was called the Phoenix and was a roller blading rink.  Though it's a nightclub now, it also has a restaurant which serves pretty decent food.  I was with a group with one guy who comes by frequently for dinner.  Given that it is normally a nightclub it was unexpectedly good.  

The meal came to $22 including tip for myself.  I had the pad thai with the serving size of about almost 2 baseballs which was pretty good.  I liked the level of spice but from experience I know that a lot of people might find it a bit too spicy.  It was decent and I liked their take on it - with just chicken and tofu. The entrees in general range from $15-30 and others ordered and were pretty pleased with tempura halibut with an accompanying sweet and sour sauce and pizzas that appeared reasonably large.   

The ambiance was pretty good with the music getting louder though not too loud as the night went on.  The nice thing about this location is that the parking lot is massive if you're coming for dinner and you don't have to worry about parking.  I'd definitely feel comfortable in recommending it.The best pho you'll get in KW! They're definitely family-owned and efficient. While English is not their strong point, the food definitely is. I've never been disappointed. The decor is hilarious. The cow head logo of Pho Dau Bo is literally printed everywhere. On the chopsticks, on the spoons, from the windows, to the walls.

One time, I ordered the wrong thing without realizing and they helped fix my order right away. I was so impressed - I was only paying $7 for a bowl of noodles so I didn't expect amazing customer service at all. The beef brisket is great. I've also gotten a rice dish with pork and a steamed egg cake and that was also delicious. Some may not enjoy the egg cake, however. I also recommend getting the Vietnamese coffee with condensed milk over ice! A bit strong, but a good pick-me-up.

I always get cravings for this place, I just wish it were a little closer to University Ave! If you're a student and you like Vietnamese, this is a must-go.I am a huge Fleming's fan and I found myself a little let down at the West Gate Fleming's. The service is always perfect here. We had a larger group and I think they did an amazing job making sure we were all happy. 

The Food: We started with oysters as our appetizer and they weren't too far off from the best I have ever had. Ice cold and flavorful! Shoot away. I usually pass on salad or soup. I get salads elsewhere. This is my carnivorous place. I ordered the filet mignon med rare and it was cooked to perfection. I prefer a nicely peppered, salted steak cooked to perfection. I am not the soaking in butter steak guy. Go to Ruth Chris for that. We ordered the Fleming's potatoes and asparagus as our sides. The potatoes are a legendary staple and the asparagus is always slender and delicious. 

The Drink: Here is my one downfall. Almost as important as the steak are my Martinis. Usually you will get the best martinis at steak houses. They shake them a little longer and the bartender usually knows how to properly use vermouth. Well, my first martini was more like a half of a martini. It was also slightly chilled. My second was a full martini, but was so over vermouthed that I almost gagged. Slightly chilled as well. When you pay more for a steakhouse martini, you kind of expect more. 

I will always make Fleming's one of my steakhouse go to's. May just have to give a little more direction on the martinis.Great place to go for karaoke rooms.  They have the magic buttons that bring more booze, and a great selection of classic and new releases in English and Japanese!  You can fit a large amount of people in the rooms, and they are reasonable on prices for rooms and booze.  There is normally a buy two get one free deal on alcohol, which also applies to buckets.  All in all this is a great place to go for a fun night out with friends, especially if you can watch the same 3 or 4 videos over and over again in the background.Get a FREE Shake from the FUDD CLUB for your Birthday!!

I'll be paying another visit REAL soon at the BITE of Las Vegas!! 10/17!!Owned by Panera, this place has all of the things I love! Soups, sandwiches, bagels, treats and decent pricing. Clean, easy to get in and out of, the only issue I found was where do I order? Where do I pay? Do I leave my dishes or do they clean up behind me? Maybe I missed the signs but it seemed they could do a better job of directing traffic so to speak?Noca is a great place for a date. It is a culinary experience, with all its style. The chefs are working extremely hard right in front of you and they have many interesting things on the menu. We had appetizers of the duck confit and some sort of sashimi. The duck confit was great and had some really fun elements, like the huckleberry waffle(?) first for me. The sashimi  special was awesome as well. we also received a small sample of a duck mousse,tasted like tuna and mayo, which was alright and some cauliflower soup, yum! I had the duo of Berkshire Pork, which was highly recommended by the waiter. It was good in an artsy sort of way, but I wasn't completely blown away. It said it came with brussel sprouts, but it was really 3 leaves of brussel sprouts, haha funny. The pork chop wasn't so great, apples added depth though, and the pork belly I didn't care for. The demi was good though. The donuts for dessert were pretty good as well. I liked the dulce de leche dip. They gave us some homemade shortbread to take home, very good. The service was wonderful. I did wait at the bar and was suggested a very nice sauv by the bartender. The place is so tiny, reservations are a must, we had to sit outside, but it was a lovely night. I wish this place had some great view overlooking the city instead of the grocery store parking lot. Managers did come up frequently to check on us and gave some insight and great suggestions. Our waiter was knowledgeable and attentive. I will go back and try a different entree and hopefully it will be 5 stars next time. :)foodie-style dining in a safeway plaza?? only in phoenix. 

it's no wonder that i left giddy as a school girl, in surprise!

Noca is SF-palate approved *stamp*. fresh ingredients put together beautifully on a plate, with inventive flavor combinations and pizzazz! the menu is seasonal and for the summer time, a cold refreshing corn soup or burrata and tomato salad hit the spot. both appetizer and entree portions were perfect. while prices may be a bit steep for phoenix standards, i would argue that they are well worth it.

service is attentive, friendly, and genuine. little touches like pouring soup in the bowl table-side, amuse bouches, and *surprise* cotton candy at meal's end just make for even more giggles of delight. the setting is clean, simple, with a slight hum in the air from the open kitchen.

a great option for a date, dinner with friends, and even a work trip! we'll be stopping by this plaza again for sure, for more reasons than safeway!Have eaten here twice and both times thought the meal was great but just not worth the price.  The second time we had a Groupon but still ended up spending like $150 for two people. For that much money, my expectations go up and the whole experience does not live up to the price tag.  It is in a Safeway Plaza, and the place is a bit barebones.  The service is fine but it is not a fine dining experience. I would say there are other better places to spend your money. With that said, they have a Sunday special menu with lower pricing.this is a pleasant joint tucked behind Saks 5th Ave, the atmosphere is perfect for a work meeting or casual lunch with old girlfriends. I had the House Smoked Salmon with Crème Fraiche on an Edible Spoon, with a glass of Chardonnay. it was a fresh dish with a nice light taste of salmon. the edible spoon wasn't my favorite idea. it tasted like a slightly saltier communion wafer. 

the best part of my experience was the staff, the manager sat down with me at the bar and we chatted over what wines we liked with salmon and the bartender  Josh had a very calming attitude and made me feel very welcome as i sat alone. The chef came out and chatted with me about his experiences and other low key restaurants he enjoyed in the area.

I would recommend this place for anyone, alone or in a groupNice atmosphere. Service is good and food was good. There is a lot of space and enough parking. The only thing was you are gambling on the type of chef you get; either entertaining or not entertaining.... we had a party of 7 and we got "not entertaining". Would still go again if I were in town.This is a review for Lavo as a nightclub:

Sooo we basically snuck into Lavo via the door closest to the front desk of the Palazzo lobby. I'm not sure how or why there was no bouncer at the door, but wooohoooooo for no cover! I'd stopped by here in the daytime for drinks before on previous visits to Vegas, but this past trip was my 1st time coming to indulge in its nightlife scene. Bottomline is that we got what we were looking for, loved the decor + had a good time, but I'll probably try other nighttime hotspots on the strip before coming back again. Check out my photos of the place!   =)


Location - It's on the right side from the front doors of the Palazzo, across from the front desk. Easy to find + so there's no need to wind around the casino searching for it. If you're walking to it from the strip, there's outer awnings with LAVO printed right on it. 

Parking - As with every casino, Palazzo has it's own free multi-level garage at the back. They have an entrance from Las Vegas Blvd or on Sands Ave. 

Venue - A bit on the smaller side but very nicely themed dark, Mediterranean decor. Downstairs there's a full bar w/ an ample seating lounge area of couches + cushions. Then upstairs you'll pass by some decorative urns as well as a hallway of water basins that actually have running water in them. This leads to even more stairs (thank goodness for handrails...), at the top of which is another bar + finally the dance floor. This bar has more comfy seating around the wall + is far enough away to have a decent conversation away from the music. The dance floor is on the small side + is surrounded by the special reserved tables. The bouncers try to barricade the tables from the floor by using those velvet ropes, which only leads to people running into them because the dance floor is so packed... not very efficient. There's a stage at the back wall of the floor + a slightly tacky disco ball that hangs on the ceiling above it. 

Cleanliness - No problems here, but then again it's so dark that it would have been difficult to tell anyways. At one point in the night I did see employees wiping a spilled drink at the edge of the dance floor, but other than that, I take this as a good sign. 

Crowd - We went on a weekday so the only part of the club that was packed was the dance floor, where everyone seemed to be having a good time. The crowd was young + fairly diverse on multiple levels. Not too many older or creepy people. 

Music - They played different music downstairs + upstairs, the latter of which was a bit too much on the loud side for my taste. Anytime where it's kinda difficult to have a conversation with a friend right next to me can't be good for the ear drums. It was your typical top-40's music, danceable but not too memorable for being either awesome or bad... just loud.

Bar - As previously mentioned, there 2 large bars: 1 upstairs + 1 downstairs. As it wasn't too crowded on this weeknight, there was no problem getting the attention of the bartenders, who were quick + attractive as well as attentive. During our last round of drinks, I asked for mine on the lighter side + the bartender complied while saying that she added extra into my friend's drink to be fair. Nicely done; she got a good tip. 

Drinks - This is Vegas so of course the drinks are expensive. Everything we ordered was about $10-$15 before tip, but the drinks were stiff + as mentioned, they came quickly.  

Bathroom - I'm not sure about the downstairs, but there is a nice bathroom upstairs between the walkway of the dance floor + the bar. The bouncers stand around there + flash their flashlights to clear the area so you don't have to fight the crowd to do what you gotta do.

Price - Cover on the weeknight we went is $20, but since we snuck in, we paid nada, muahaha. If you stay at the Palazzo, you get complimentary entry into Lavo as well. There is also a guestlist, which can get you in free, but you have to either know a promoter or get friendly with a bouncer. The club is open until the wee hours around 4am, but they stop letting people in soon after midnight.As guests at the Palazzo, the wife and I got free line-jump/no cover coupons, so we just visited the club on Saturday night. Decor is sweet. Like the name implies, it's going for a bathhouse motif. Walking across a bridge with running faucets that overlooks the restaurant and up a staircase where two scantily-clad hotties in a bathtub are making out and into the club which features about 40 tables, two go-go dancers doing their thing, a moderate size dance floor and a bar area. Awesome.

A more mature, sophisticated crowd. Everyone seemed to be having a good time, I know I was. DJ played it safe and inoffensive, nothing but classic hits.

I will say that the drinks were pricey. I get that it's a club, but $19 for a gin and tonic? Really?! I haven't paid that in SF, NY, or LA, so why is Vegas charging that??) I also find it interesting that they apparently have gender-based prices: my wife and her male cousin both ordered the same beer: hers was $5 and his was $9. Huh. Never seen that before. 

Bottle service starts at around $550 and run upwards of $3k, but the table hostesses all seemed hot, friendly and they dance at the tables, so you're probably paying a bit more than usual but you're also getting more too.

But at the end of the day, I had a great time and I'd go again.LAVO, you trendy little beastie, kissing cousin to TAO, Italian style. You're just as guilty of being ridiculously priced as every other Vegas resort venue. But your food, your decor, your service... ya won me over, ya little scamp.

WTF were we thinking ordering an appetizer consisting of a giant baked meatball? And what in the world do you think you're doing making that thing actually taste really good? Flatbread with shaved truffles and truffle oil - expensive as hell and a ridiculously frivolous starter, but you still made it worth it somehow.

Lobster risotto? Perfectly seared rare tuna with grilled artichokes and sun-dried tomatoes? Why can't you suck more so I can slag you off as another expense-account darling with no reason to sit down to table other than a corporate AMEX account?

Oh, and the complementary quaff of Moscato d'Asti at the end of the meal... damn you.My co workers and I took a break from our Halloween Event at Lavo to have dinner. Though packed and on Halloween night, we recieved excellent service.
The Meatballs are so soft and so tasty you almost don't want to share.
The calamari was lightly battered and crispy. Loved it!!!
The Brick Oven margherita Pizza is made to be shared and savored!!!
The Chopped Louie Salad had large chunks of lobster and plenty of shrimp.
I'll be back!!!!I thought it was truly odd that Bellagio would have a cafe (Palio) located DIRECTLY across the walkway from Cafe Gelato, as they BOTH serve coffee/espresso drinks and pastries. Strange, no?

Anyhow, since I had visited Cafe Gelato the previous evening, I decided to give Palio a go. I ordered a mocha -- and it was among the best I've had! And believe me, I've had my share of mochas! It was super smooth (not grainy or powdery) and had a nice creamy consistency. 

Service was very friendly and quick, as I received my drink in under 5 minutes. They also offer a great selection of pastries and baked goods. There is also a good number of cozy plush seats outside of the cafe along the hotel walkway (still within Bellagio). There is also some seating inside the cafe as well.Tip: Join their player's club and you'll get the buffet for $13.99. I'm weird and one of my favorite meals is steak with salsa and tortillas. Some nice lady carved me big chunks of a roast and I got a handful of flour tortillas, a soup bowl of salsa and went to town. Not the highest quality food, but it was good, and for $13.99 it makes you consider gastric bypass surgery. If I lived in Vegas I think I'd be a much larger person.The buffet here is small but everything I tried was pretty damn good!!  We all have different taste and the four if us we're very happy and enjoyed everything.  Even though I was full, I still didn't want the waitress to take my plate because I still couldn't part from it.  :). It was one of those, "just one more bite" times.  We are definitely stopping by again. :)We have stayed here a few times, the first being when we got a flyer for a free room in the mail and again when our A/C went out in the summer.  It was close enough to drive home when needed and also inexpensive.  You can usually get rooms for $30 midweek.  Check in was fast and once they upgraded us to a jacuzzi suite.  The rooms are really nice.  The hotel is pretty new but you never know, it is Boulder Hwy after all.  The rooms were spacious, the tubs huge and beds super comfy.  Room service was inexpensive and very good.  There is no resort free and they do not charge for wi-fi anymore.  As far as the casino, the restaurants aren't great and not a lot to do but if you live close and have family coming to visit or going to an event at Sam Boyd then this is a great inexpensive option.  There are lots of chain restaurants and a few movie theaters nearby so you are not totally at the mercy of the casino options.Venetian is full of Italian restaurants, but this one stood out for us to try because it was small and intimate.  It turned out to be a very enjoyable dining experience, a vegas-sized "street side" intimate dinner.  We had simple pasta dishes cooked right (al dente!) and having reasonable prices made it even better.  =)  The waiter even had an Italian accent.  cute! woot.

Conclusion:  Simple dishes for a decent price with a satisfied stomach
p.s.  We should have been smart like other couples and SPLIT ONE pasta dish, instead of being lil' piggies and ordering one each.  hahahhahahaWho tries to make reservations at Applebees?? ME that's who LOL,  I was coordinating a get together for my birthday, and we are all on a budget and the 2 for 20 works well and what I had thought was going to be a party of maybe 6 turned into a party of 16, for me that's great!! I was tickled pink that everyone wanted to come and celebrate my bday dinner, but then kinda like uh oh better call Applebees LOL So I called them with a hour's notice and they were shocked and said we don't take reservations I said ok but I have a party of 16 headed your way LOL they said they could make it happen! Way to Go Applebees!! Ok mind you we had to wait about 30 mins for our table, but we were a fun group and didn't mind the wait. I have to say our server was very nice and quick and didn't let anything fall through the cracks everyone got what they ordered and we had a great time. Some in the party where are not a Applebee's fan, but walked away with a great experience!  I for one am a fan of Applebee's and do plan on going back!After our disastrous experience at a new foot massage place up the road, we decided to return to a place that we both liked before, hoping it wasn't a fluke.

Sunday afternoon and it was a tad busy.  They asked if we could wait five minutes and we took a seat.  The first things I noticed was how dark it was, creating a more relaxed atmosphere than other places.  As other employees were finishing up, they came out to the front and greeted us.  Their hushed tones added to the quietness of this place, and we both appreciated how friendly everyone was.  And they asked if we wanted anything to drink before our treatments.

We were seated shortly in our semi-private room for two.  They brought out a hot herbal bath for our feet to soak in and came around behind us to start working.  (Yay - no wasted time here!)  As they start working on our neck and shoulders, they ask how long we would like.  We tell them we want 45 minutes, and they do try to persuade us for the 60 minute one, but we're okay right now.  For the next 15-20 minutes, the girls are working on our head, face, and neck.  My girl (Rosa) was scratching my scalp like no tomorrow and it was definitely getting me in the zone.  Aww...this is the perfect way to start - head first as your feet soak and then move down your body!

When they come around to the front of us, they push our shoulders and arms for a bit before taking our feet out of the bath.  They also push your seat back so it reclines entirely.  After my feet are dried, she quickly dumps out the hot water bath and returns to get working.  She rubs some sort of ointment on my right foot before wrapping it up and then starts working on my left foot.  I am super relaxed now and I can hear the Husband breathing steadily next to me.  (Yes, he has fallen asleep, this is definitely a good sign!  May was working on him.)  I can feel myself wanting to fall asleep too because I am feeling pretty good.  Eventually, I do zone in and out of sleep, but just for a second.    

They do move to my right foot eventually and I'm practically sleeping, so it all feels good.  After the massage, they wipe your calves and feet down with a hot towel.  They then roll down your pants legs and push on your legs and thighs a bit.  You sense the closing movements of your massage and are sad to know the time has come.  And they also offer us something to drink afterward instead of waiting around for a tip (like a few other places).

They do a good job here, it's thorough and professional and there really are no complaints. (I would complain more about the other guests who talk very loudly because they are inconsiderate and do not realize we can hear everything of their conversation.  So please hush your voices when you enter!)  Also, when our girls did speak to each other, it was in hushed tones as well.

They are busy and had a steady stream of customers coming in and out, which can be distracting.  The Husband says he prefers to go late at night when there's less foot traffic, and I will have to agree.

They do accept VISA or MasterCard, but their credit card machine runs very slowly and is a bit of pain.  So, they prefer cash if possible.  They also have you sign your name in after the treatment as to keep track of their clients, which we find quite professional.

We'll return here often, recommend others here, and probably go for the 60 minute one the next time we come.

$28 for 45 minutes
$38 for 60 minutes
$48 for 75 minutes
$55 for 90 minutesI'm new to the world of knitting. Perhaps, I don't have many businesses to compare Knit Happens to, but I was completely overjoyed with the selection and service I received on my first visit. 

The yarn - is beautiful, so may different colors and textures. There are tons of pattern books, different sized needles, and basically anything you could think of that you may need when taking on a project. 

The staff was super friendly. I plan on going back today, because I need more yarn. Updates to come!We stumbled upon this place completely by accident, and I must say that I am glad that we did! We've been struggling to find a good, family owned Italian restaurant in Vegas and Montesano's was all that and more.  

The minute you walk into the doors, you are treated to delectable smells of homemade Italian deliciousness.  Then your eyes immediately head to the dessert case, where you will find everything from homemade cannoli (unfilled to keep the shells crispy) to cheescakes and cookies.  

The service is absolutely amazing and I felt like we had been old friends with our waitress who took excellent care of us.  

And then there's the food- my God the food! The garlic knots are so deliciously addicting, I think I ate my weight in those alone! The sauce is so amazing, it reminds me of my Grandpa's homemade spaghetti sauce when I was a kid.  I had the baked ravioli, and ate way more than I should have, but it was so yummy I couldn't stop.  

As a bonus- The waitress gave my daughter a free cookie for eating a good dinner! :)

We went back to Montesano's a few weeks later, and our waitress (the same one from our first visit) remembered us and gave us the same outstanding service.  

If you haven't eaten here yet, you definitely need to! Your belly will thank you...I can't speak to how the local students like this place, but 2 bars + bowling are A-OKAY by me.I keep going here.  A recent take-out discover were the tripa tacos (like little rigatoni tubes crispily fried - - but actually made of belly meat) - - truly a FUN food - - and really tasty.

Tonight sat down and had the Lomo Taco plate.   Very satisfying beans/rice/guac and tenderloin tacos with fragrant corn shells.  They have cut the number of salsas to four - - all of which are fantastic, particularly on the excellent chips (are they Milagro corn chip bits?).

In any case,  great food;   wonderful service (it has changed from trying hard, to wonderful);   and wild atmosphere (bright colors contrasting with sterile feng shui;   blaring TV - - some might not enjoy - -  with GREAT mtv-type blaring brass-band norteno music  - - LOVED IT!).

This place remains an otherworldly delight, that gets better all the time.Owwwwwhhhhhhhhh, this place is sooooooo delightful! The staff here, especially the blonde dude working the counter, are totally awesome, helpful gems. I forgot about this place and have been wanting to check it out since the remodel. Being in the neighborhood I stopped by. I always felt the name of this place says it all. One of those vintage old house reinvented into a restaurant. Each room is meant to be like a different reading/relaxing nook areas. Different feel, different decorations, different furniture, with a different thematic feel to each room. I sat in the silver furniture section-ha. Love the bookshelves with reading material. If you pick the back room I guarantee you will probably forget you are in a restaurant. It even has a TV.  Also, the entire place is covered with art work hanging on the walls for sale, by I assume local artists. They also have some jewelry for sale. BUY LOCAL! GOTTA LOVE IT! This is a totally fun and cute place. Very artistic for my inner creative Drama Queen. The place was also packed. 
   Ok, so now onto the food. I am a chicken salad fanatic so I got the Voodoo Chicken Salad for something totally different and unique. I think I got it because the name was so clever. Cajun Chicken Salad= Voodoo ha, ha, ha! Honestly, I was not really in love with it through no fault of the restaurants. It is just very different. I think I will just stick with my traditional view of white regular chicken salad and my addiction to Casella's Deli-the best!. However, this sandwich was still tasty enough. I would like to go back and try some other Hobnob sandwiches and or salads especially since I hear their Hummus is the best in town. On the way out I got all excited because I spied a Black and White cookie out of NY. I had already ordered a slice of their Coconut Cake which BTW I am eating right now as inspiration while writing this review. ( It is good) I can't wait to try the B/W cookie later or tomorrow for an Easter treat,  Finally, since it is a coffee house I got a White Chocolate Mocha for the road. The server was so helpful when he recommended I add Cinnamon and Caramel topping and sauce flavoring to it. Add it, I did and it was divine! All in all a fattening day here in Phoenix.To end this review I do have to say parking is awful and the place is pricey but as Arnold likes to say,  "I'll be back."Love Habanero's and I don't typically like Mexican food.  They are a seriously great deal for pretty darn delicious food!  I thoroughly enjoy their steak tacos and their carnitas dishes, that's the pork one right?We've been here a few times so it's time for a review.  Yes, as previously stated this insn't Lawry's but it is still very good.  We've tried  other mid-priced prime rib offerings at the Orleans and at Sam's Town and neither compares with the prime rib at PPR.  The meal has a nice salad and potato included in the price of about $17 a plate.

The service is excellent and the atmosphere is classy.  The waiter mixes your salad at the table just as they do at Lawry's.  Good people.

This is a great place for a nice late night meal after a show.

NickLOVE this place!! I love going to new grocery stores and just wandering and checking out the things they have, and this place has really good stuff. Not your normal grocery store and thats what makes it so unique. really good deals as well. lots of cool prepackaged meals, snacks, sides, apps.etc.  All kinds of interesting desserts as well. Their prepackaged meals including pastas, salads could be packed as good lunches as well for work! make sure you check out the clearance section on each aisle..you're bound to score some good deals. i have enjoyed everything i have bought already and will def be going back to try new things. I highly recommend checking out this place and see whatcha think. think of it like a trader joe's.. not exactly the same but the same in the way they are not your typical grocery store.Folks, I've reviewed this restaurant once before, and this is an addendum;  

This is a wonderful little Italian restaurant and apparently a secret to many. Please,  Spread the word ... we need to support the small restaurant owners.

WHY frequent the mass produced corporate owned eateries that proliferate the Vegas Valley when we have in our backyard this independently owned, and lovingly operated jewel?  

We try to always support the smaller, family owned & run eateries and find that we are infrequently disappointed.  Gina's Tops our List !!

Last night we dined on steaming bowls of the most delicious Pasta Fagioli I've ever had, it was served with a basket of warm & wonderfully crusty Italian bread (a new bread to Ginas).  We chose a lovely bottle of Sangiovese Puglia, an Italian Red wine that Vince suggested.  A PERFECT meal for a cold evening.  

Gina's well deserves one visit by you....because you'll be hooked!Thanks to my fellow Yelper's reviews, my friends and I decided to give Gina's a try. Good call everyone! We all loved that the place was fairly casual and moderately priced, but it was the wonderful food and friendly and professional service that won us over. 

I personally don't know a lot about wine, but my friends are pretty sophisticated when it comes to the grape...and they seemed quite content with the wine menu and their selection for the table. Again, I can't tell you if they have a great wine list or not, but we all enjoyed the reasonably priced wine that we ordered.

They serve really delicious bread!

We decided to share an appetizer of fried calamari, which turned out to be a bit of a mistake for two reasons. First of all, the portions of the pastas and entrees that were served later on were absolutely enormous. All four of us took food home. Secondly, I wasn't crazy about their calamari. I usually love fried calamari, but I found Gina's take on it to be a little mushy and not seasoned well. The breading was not crisp and there was hardly any salt mixed in. The presentation was fantastic and the serving was very large so when it was put on the table I was extremely optimistic. Unfortunately, it was a let down. My fellow diners all agreed. 

Other than that, the rest of the meal was perfect! Honestly, it was one of the best Italian meals that we had all had in a while and we all vowed to come back. The waiter couldn't have been more friendly or professional. The service was excellent.

All in all, Gina's Bistro was excellent and the only reason I am giving it four stars instead of five is because of the calamari.

We will be back for sure!I'm a big fan of Latin American cuisine and I had to give this place a try.  I was not disappointed.
The restaurant is located near a strip mall on the southeast corner of Dunlap and Central.  There is plenty of parking and it was not hard to find.  The restaurant itself is simple, clean and welcoming and I was greeted as soon as I walked in with a friendly, smiling face.  I asked for recommendations of what I should order to get a good taste of what defines El Salvadorian food.
I ended up ordering the Pollo Encebollado as the main dish, a Tamale de Pollo and Chipilin con Queso as starters and, of course, a couple pupusas.  Way too much food, but I love leftovers.  The Tamales were fantastic.  Way different than the typical Mexican tamales most Americans are used to.  These were soft, tender, moist and very tasty.  The pupusas came out next and I dug right into the Chicharron y queso pupusa and it was so good I wished I had just order a dozen of those.  I could eat those little heavenly slabs of loveliness every day.  When the chicken came out I was stuffed, but I insisted on trying it while it was freshly served.  The chicken was really good, moist, tender and seasoned perfectly.  It is served with rice and beans but not Mexican style.  The beans are like a sweet black bean soup and the rice is more like seasoned white rice with some vegetables cooked in.  The chicken dinner was also served with several of their small, fat tortillas which are kinda like the pupusas but without a filling.
I really liked the food here and will definitely go back.  The prices are a little high for a lunch place but about right for what you'd expect to pay for an average dinner.  You get a lot of food for the money though.This is my first experience with a meat orgy (okay, that sounds bad LOL).

Long story short, I learned a lot about steak. The sides were delicious. All in all, way too much food (so I took advantage of the salad bar to give my heart a break).

The service was spectacular! So attentive, polite, and all the while it had a real feel to it... not a, "dude im kissing your ass cuz I need to buy a new xBox."

I finished off with some dessert... a monster piece of chocolate cake that was just too good to finish in one shot (I saved it for the next days breakfast).

Oops... almost forgot - the decor was very sharp. I was impressed. The bathroom had these awesome super tall metal doors on both the entrance and the stalls. No detail was left behind.Damn good!! but pricey hence the 4 stars. Definitely not meant for vegatarians, especially considering the price. Luckily, my husband and I are meat lovers. In fact, we are both all about the beef! Give me the cow!

1. Salad bar- if you were to instantly compare the # of selections to that offered at Pampas (Miracle Mile Shops @ Planet Hollywood), you would think it was a small choice. HOWEVER, the selection at Texas de Brazil was so much better. Just goes to show quality over quantity is a winner. By the way, my hubby and I both highly recommend the chilled salmon and the sauteed mushrooms.

2. The Meats- I'm starting to drool just thinking about it. All the beef meats were delicious. The pork ribs good but the pork was dry. The sausage was spicy and yummy. My personal favorite was the bacon wrapped fillet mignon. The hubby loved it all.

3. The Dessert- After indulging in yummy meats and salad bar items, we were stuffed. But since we were seated near one of the dessert trays we could not resist. Lucky for us, you can get your desserts to go. And we did. I got the carrot cake and my husband got the chocolate mousse cake. Both absolutely fabulous, even when we ate them a couple days later. It took us that long to digest and recover. LOL.

4. Ambiance and location- the restauant is in a stand alone building, located at Town Square, located south of the Strip, near the airport. The interior is beautiful and relaxing. Our waiter, Zan, was attentive and helpful when I was debating the Rioja or the Malbec to drink. Town Square itself is a neat, clean, pretty place to walk around. It's a mix of locals and tourists. Warning- some of the stores and restaurants are overpriced. My husband found the sign about the water in the fountains being imported.This is a very small restaurant (about six tables tops) behind McDonald's in a strip mall on the corner of Sahara and Rancho. Bento style combination lunch & dinner but there are specialties like maui noodles (vermicelli). I usually get the teriyaki chicken or the teriyaki salmon- comes with miso soup, a scoop of rice, salad, a couple pieces tempura, and a potsticker. Most dishes under $10.00 per person. It's pretty good for a hole in the wall with a huge menu and is in a convenient location. The food is prepared quickly. We haven't had anything bad here. Rarely busy whenever we go, but I think it holds up because there is a pretty loyal following. The canned Hawaiian drinks like Pass-O-Guava, available. My only complaint: Closed on sundays. We found that out the hard way- and we really wanted a bento special too. PS.) I went to the other location but just thought that it was ok. Yup, this one's better- guess this is why it's the last one standing.My boyfriend brought me there to try something new while we were shopping. Cute quant place tucked in the back. We ordered the Creme Brulee. OMG nom nom nom. It was so good! $5 and it was more than enough for us to share. 

I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because of the service. Confusing much? 
So we ordered and grabbed our food and sat down. as we sat down a server came by and asked us if we wanted anything to drink...Wtf? We had that option when we ordered our food. We politely said no, and he looked rather annoyed. Are we supposed to tip this guy? As we were leaving he left a thank you card with some mints. Again are we supposed to tip this guy? Im all for tipping when it is deserved but come on I don't give away money for nothing.  

Maybe Im the only one for the confusion. But anyway like I said the Creme Brulee is definitely worth stopping by!Ummm. One word delicious!  Authentic and fresh. My husband and I went on a rainy day and sampled a few items on the menu and enjoyed each bite. I recommend the yellow curry and silver noodle salad an absolute must along with anything else they are dishing up.When some co-workers suggested going to a place called Two Hippies, I wasn't sure what to expect. It sounded fun, so I accepted. I was trying to eat locally after all.

As soon as we pulled up, I noticed the funky decor. I LOVED it!! There was also a large outdoor seating area. You order inside (there was barely room for three of us to be inside at once), and then they brown bag your order and write your name on it. 

Tacos are $3/ea. or 3 for $6. I opted for 3 tacos. I was expecting standard street tacos, but I got so much more. My carne asada tacos came with the standard onion and cilantro, but also had rice, beans, cheese, and cabbage. I wasn't a fan of the cabbage, but the tacos were delicious otherwise.

Canned sodas are $1.We have stayed at the Sheraton for the past three years at the end of June and the hotel has only gotten better.  Our preference is a two room suite at the Club level which allows for adequate breakfast and light hor d'oeuvres' in the evening.  The rooms are very quiet and the beds are great, as are the amenities in the room (flat screen, etc).  The workout room is better than most full service facilities with fabulous equipment for aerobic and strength.  Hotel staff are on their toes and very, very gracious.  The only thing that irritates us is the daily charge for Wi-Fi which is provided free by many other Starwood chains (this should be a no-brainer perk on the Club Level).  If Hampton Inns provide this as a free service (and what's free in a hotel, eh?) than a big and expensive hotel should do the same.  Otherwise, great location and is strongly recommended.Most of my hotel stays are for business. In this case, it was a trade show expo held over a Saturday and Sunday. I arrived Friday afternoon, and returned home Monday early.

Phoenix was experiencing the tale end of summer. It was "hundreds of degrees hot" this past week. But the Sheraton came through as "ultra-cool", both with high marks for customer service and in their very generous and efficient air conditioning. We were actually commenting on the hallways of the hotel being "chilly!" We didn't complain... we reveled in the "in-house" low temperature. 

I think everyone would agree, the Sheraton gets very high marks for their lobby, restaurant, bell hop, and valet staff. Everyone we encountered offered to help in a most comfortable way. I'm not a big fan of high-rise hotel facilities when I'm traveling on business, but when I do a trade show, proximity to the convention center or exhibit hall is huge. The Sheraton is a five minute walk to the center. Oh, almost forgot the beds... memory top mattresses; dreamy soft and contouring. And because the air conditioning grill is close to the window and blowing to the opposing wall of the where the bed is.... no sinus issues with "direct air up the nostrils... another issue I have with high rise hotels.... air in my face while I sleep.

Customer service level means alot to me, so the relatively high cost for food and beverage, if you're on expenses, makes it a wash. We ate in the District Restaurant, just off the lobby. My NY steak and halibut entree were both in the mid $20's, and the portion size was "gourmet small", while the flavors were "gourmet good." So if quality trumps quantity for you, you may like the in-house restaurant. If you're doing breakfast, I'd recommend going across the street and a little West to the corner bakery place. We did breakfast the day we left for under $10 per person. The hotel buffet is a little over $20..... and I am not a big breakfast person, so it's lost on me.

So... for high-rise, downtown hotels, I'd say a solid 4-stars. Where do I usually stay in the PHX area? Hilton Resort on 16th, or one of the Embassy Suites... usually I'm at the Emb.Sts. Tempe.Going here for happy hour is the best! They have a good menu at that time as well. I have never gone to pay full price though way too much for me. I always go as a group and have never been disappointed in the food, sometimes the service is slow but the food is always great!I dig this place quite a bit. Each room is unique--the Music Room, the Library, the Boat Room, etc.--and the attention they paid to detail when putting the rooms together is noticeable.

The staff was very friendly and helpful--always quick with asking if they could help, to providing another bar of soap, to pointing us in the right direction. 

Couple of protips: there is indeed air conditioning. We arrived on a day when it was 29 out, so it was key to know it existed.

Also, there are breakfast vouchers at the front desk that apply to some local businesses, so don't forget to stop by and grab yours. 

Finally, when you go to bed, make sure the blinds are drawn. That sweet Canadian sun is _bright_ in the morning.

The good: great little hotel close to everything.
The bad: one minor gripe: it being an old building, the outlets are hard to come by for charging devices, to prepare to get creative, or unplug a lamp or two.i have been to the deli's about 50 times and have never once had an issue. i have searched high and low for decent pizza in this town and this is the best that i have found. i have always had friendly service (in fact, they recognize me now and every once in a while comp my lunch!) and the food has been consistently excellent.who doesnt love Virgin.  I never thought anyone didnt like them until I had to deal with the air hostess on this flight...the red head was awesome (sorry, I didnt get her name) her partner was useless!  TVs didnt work and the gogo internet was not fast enough to keep my 16 month old busy.  Maybe next time.Ok so its nickname is "Whole Paycheck" - but you get what you pay for. The best quality, the best selection, the best staff!  Thats the rest of the store.. the buffet & food you can eat there is what I am reviewing here

Love their $5.99 Wednesday buffet(7.99 a pound the rest of the week)- It is the healthiest Buffet in town with a whole VEGAN selection.

I have eaten here several times and every time I was so pleased with their preparations.  They have pizza by the inch and soups with noodle which are exceptional and wrapped sandwiches & salads to go too. great to eat in a pinch when you just wanna run in and get something better than fast food somewhere else.

This is a clean healthy environment.Mmmmm, Mmmmmm, Great food.  The popcorn shrimp here are to die for-they leave a wonderful lasting impression.  So does their desert plate...The service was wonderful and quick and attending to us.  Also, we had been lounging at the pool all day and were not looking so sharp but they didn't seem to have a dress code or anything as they were more than welcoming.  It is a bit pricey but i'm not sure you can expect anything less when going to a W Hotel.  I recommend this place to anyone who wants a more chic sushi experience, cool atmosphere, doesn't mind paying the extra dollar and enjoys tasty food.Nice patio in the heart of downtown mesa. We didn't eat so i can't comment on that but the wine selection was nice. We had a quick drink before a show at the MAC. The service was quick.Taqueria Guadalajara re-opened August 8 after re-modeling due to extensive fire damage.  The layout is the same but everything is new and clean so the place does not have quite the same hole-in-the- wall feel.  It was packed with a diverse clientele and many families out for Sunday dinner.  Service was friendly though slow.  The food was very tasty and portions were ample. My husband had chicken quesadillas, my son chicken tacos and I had the pozole, available on weekends only, and we all enjoyed our dishes.  The noise level is high and tables along the side wall are cramped but overall it was an enjoyable experience.I visited this place for an event showcasing other local South Madison eatery's and I am definitely a fan.  I actually cannot believe that I have not been here before.  The food is fantastic!  I ordered the tacos with rice and beans, so simple but so good.  The meat was really tender and well seasoned.  I should also mention that the chips and salsa pre-taco were also really good; you are given two options, one with kick and one without.  Both options were really good.  

I look forward to coming back to this place and trying many things on the well sized and well priced menu.Great prices that can't be beat! We paid $13 before tip which included 2 dinners and beer. Don't let the small size fool you either - there's plenty of seating in back and it's usually busy with locals who have discovered this hidden gem.I personally love this restaurant, i visit there often with my family.  Being the fact that im was born in taiwan it is a great treat to be able to have some authentic Taiwanese food.  I highly suggest the spicy wongton, it is probably one of my favorite dish in the restaurant.  I really wouldn't suggest ordering any typical dish you would usually order at any regular chinese restaurant, after all Taiwanese food and Chinese food does have it's differences.  So skip the Orange Chicken, and Beef broccoli.  Because thats not their forte.Another new store here in Goodyear. This is one of the large targets that has a grocery and baked goods along with a satellite Pizza Hut. If I remember it also had a Starbucks in store. Of course the place is bright and clean since it just opened, but most Targets are anyway. This store has a  feel tending to Wal-Mart. The isles were a bit more narrow than I like. But it has a lot of stuff that needs to be crammed in. They also had a rather large area dedicated to Halloween which I suspect will be taken over by Christmas. The prices on things I would buy are no less than anyone else, yes they did have some good prices on things I would not be buying. You know, pop tarts, chips and canned coffee. I must say I do like the feel of the basket one pushes around the store, it fits my hands well. I do like Target stores so I am sure I will be back. Oh and the check out was super fast. It seemed like she was handing me the receipt before I even slid my card through.I must admit.. Im not much of a tea person.. but a few weeks back while at Biltmore, the friendly Teavana girl gave my friend a sample of Jasmine Tea with a bit of strawberry essence.. I had a sip of hers.. all the while thinking.. 'Im not a tea girl'.. I walked away from that day wishing I had that tea.. So today, I decide to become a tea person.. I scored a beautiful Asian teapot and some of the best tea leaves ... Friendly service.. but that was from 'my' girl.. I didnt find the other two that friendly.. but I will add, they know their leaves.. now work on the friendly part when someone is dropping $20 on a small tin of tea.. and you have a 5So, even though I've sworn off caffeine for the foreseeable future, I get talked into visiting a local coffee place by my girlfriend and my housemate. The girlfriend just wants to go because she's seized by a sudden need for a pastry, and my housemate wants to go because he is harboring entrepreneurial aspirations and wants to scout out the local market.

So, okay, I go. Never mind that this is like asking a newly-recovering alcoholic to take a tour of a winery. I go.

Sunrise Coffee Company sits just west of Pecos on Sunset Road and looks like your run-of-the-grinder Starbucks knock-off, except that their selection of snacks is even more limited. (So the Princess had to settle for a muffin!) But there's a BIG DIFFERENCE: they really know how to serve a beverage. They focus on quality ingredients to make drinks that would put the average green-aproned barista to shame.

Because I'm on the caffeine wagon, I order a peppermint tea, which irks me, because I just can't see paying a coffee price for something that's essentially made by dunking a bag of leaves into a cup of hot water. So, while the Princess raves about her mocha and my housemate raves about his latte, I get stuck with aromatic broth.

Then I take a sip....

Wow. The tea is pungent with mint and yet somehow manages to avoid the bitterness that often is the aftertaste of such herbal strength.

Which is to say I'm happy that I went to Sunrise Coffee Company and I hope they have continued success in their uphill battle against both the economy and Big Green. I plan to keep coming back.Great little coffee shop!  I enjoyed the Creme Brulee Iced Latte.  Wonderful!  They have a wide variety of drinks.  It's always nice to support a local business vs. the regular chains.  Sunrise is just as good and hopefully be back soon!We tried this place on Christmas Eve. The atmosphere was relaxed with low lighting and trendy decor. I love the big Buddha at the front. There are tables for 2, 4, and long tables for larger parties. There is also space to sit at the bar. The hostess (also our server for the night) was cheerful and very helpful. 

The tapas (small-plates) format is really fun for trying lots of things and sharing with your date or a group of friends. The best thing we had was the Tofu Curry. It was amazing!! Everything else was very good, but do yourself a favor and have the tofu curry come out last. We ordered something after that and were disappointed because the curry was so good! 

The drink menu is extensive as well, featuring infused vodkas made in-house. Alas, I was sick, so I didn't have anything to drink :( 

This place is located very close to Roosevelt and the art scene. This would be a great place to start your First Friday Art Walk. I'll definitely be back to try more dishes!Been here a few times with my BFF and we really like this place. It is clean, the prices are somewhat reasonable, and the service is nothing out of the ordinary. The food is made to order relatively quick and the Sherwarma Gyro is so delicious... that I feel guilty afterwards. But, it is well worth it!

I plan to frequent this place on a regular basis and love the fact that it is fairly close to work. I believe they have the best Gyro's in the Phoenix Metro area. Give it a try, you won't be disappointed.Always friendly, Call ahead and they've got it waiting.  I wish they could just know by my # what I always order.Went here for the first time during Restaurant Week with a friend and was not disappointed. I look forward to going back and bringing my husband. My friend cannot eat gluten and says that this is one of her favorite restaurant since there are so many options for her. When we arrived at 6 pm on a Saturday, we were seated right away. The service was great, and our server was very friendly. 

We ordered the turkey bolo, which was delicious. I had the summer salad and my friend had the hummus for our first courses. They were tasty. Seems like a great concept for a restaurant and I can't wait to try out some of the drink specials and other dishes next time.My husband I stopped off for a quick lunch because I heard rave reviews about the kale salad. The Hubby doesn't like Kale (or wouldn't choose it ) so we shared a Mediterranean salad and fish tacos. I know they don't go together , but the food was super fresh and delicious and some worked together. We kept looking over at each other sayin "this so yummy" and flawless. The salad had the perfect consistency of crunch and lightness. The Fish in the tacos was moist and flaky and seasons light and just right.  We also had the retail therapy cocktail, it was also delightful, not too sweet and very refreshing and made you want more , but then who would drive us home. I hope to figure out the cocktail recipe to make at home, may need to try a few more first .The portions are huge, and for a great price. I got the Meat Lovers Omelet, and it was purely delightful. The Home Fries were great, and is the perfect side for whatever entree you choose. I'm a visitor from CA, and this has to be one of the best breakfast places I have ever eaten at. If you are traveling, you should consider coming to Ronnie's for breakfast. You will not be disappointed.I like this place for a simple dinner. Good prices on steak, salads, etc. Please be warned that the "onion petals" are NOT the same as the blooming onion at Outback like your server will tell you. That being said service is OK (kind of slow at times, and not too personable). And you can't beat $2.99 beers and 2/$14 meals! Love their rolls and peanuts!!Love this place! They do Korean BBQ right and the best BONUS about this place is you get to pick 3 sides to go with your meal. You can pick from cabbage kimchi, cucumber kimchi, glass noodles, broccoli, corn, bean sprouts, to name a few. Typical hawaiian bbq joints just give you rice and macaroni salad and I always crave the kimchi and pickles to go with it and this place gives you 3 options! I've had the kalbi, chicken bbq, and cold noodles. All very very good!"Sis! Happy birthday!"
"Bro, my birthday was in June."
"I know. I'm taking you to Petit Paris. Woah, look at this city, it's PERFORMING! What's THAT building? And that one?"

This was the exchange that occurred when my excellent brother stepped off the train at the beginning of his visit last month.

Now then. There are two reasons that Petit Paris was the first place that sprang to my brother's mind when he wanted to take me out for a meal in a city he'd only actually visited once before. The first is that he didn't really know anywhere else. The second is that he was genuinely impressed with it when he came to Edinburgh last and he doesn't like to give shoddy presents; he's good that way.

Well, I see why he was impressed. The waiter who took our coats and saw us to our seats (table complete with cute gingham tablecloth) was cheery and warm, and plenty patient as we ummed and ahhed over the delicious-looking menu. We began with snails to share - yes, folks, I do the snail thing, and if you have not done the snail thing, Petit Paris is probably the place to do the snail thing. Rich in a garlic and parsley sauce, and blissfully un-chewy, they nestled in indentations in the special snail-dish like happy little blobs of buttery snaily joy. That dish, by the way, makes the process great fun and also, when you're sharing as we were, easy to ensure equitable division of the very good goods.

(I like to imagine that I am a hedgehog when I do the snail thing. That's just an irrelevant little side note for your entertainment.)

My main was the goat's cheese and vegetable pie - utter bliss. The number of times things get passed off as pies when they're really just tarts is so disappointing. The difference, of course, is that a pie should have pastry on the top. This, to my delight, did, and the pastry was superb. Likewise the filling; the goat's cheese was liberal although it could have perhaps been more evenly distributed as it took me a couple of forkfuls to find it, hiding as it was under its pastry blanket. Bro was less ecstatic about his rabbit, proclaiming it a little stringy, but generally adequate.

Having ordered, in a moment's forgetfulness, a bottle of wine instead of a glass, Bro must have been happy enough with its quality; it was all gone by the time we left and as anyone who reads my reviews regularly will know, Sis was by no means his glamorous assistant in this vanishing act.

It's not the cheapest place to eat in Edinburgh, but at around £20 for a starter and main it's very reasonable indeed, especially given the undeniable quality.I had some drinks and dinner here last weekend and had a very positive experience. The pub itself is on the nicer side with plush couches and dark wood furniture. It is also very toasty, which was a welcome respite from the outside cold. 

The vibe was very much a gastropub that was primarily locals (we got the recommendation from the owner of our B&B) who wanted to catch up over dinner or drinks. It is a friendly atmosphere.

The menu looked amazing - I had a difficult time choosing as so many items looked great. The menu is seasonal and sources from local farms and butchers. I opted for a venison stew with a pumpkin mash and my friend got a burger and chips. We split a fish cake as an appetizer and ordered a bottle of their own Hamilton's red wine. 

The cocktail menu also looked incredible though I stuck to wine. I had a glass of mulled wine while waiting for our table, which was great. 

The food was excellent. Very generous portions (maybe too big, but I'm not complaining) and you could really tell that they put a lot of care into the food preparation. 

While the pub was crowded, the dining area is separate and there was enough room to settle in for a relaxing dinner. 

Minus one star for slow, inattentive service that still managed to be friendly. If I lived in the area, I would be sure to go back here again.Started a pub crawl here, it was pretty nice and right on the main street. The set up inside the bar is nice, seats along the wall while the bar is in a U shape in the middle. Outdoor seats which are nice when/if the wind stops.**This is a review from a US tourist from her Scotland trip in April 2014 with her aunt and cousin (3 members in party)**

A really great hotel for the price! We paid $75 per person for a 3-person room for two nights and it was a GREAT deal considering the excellent location of the hotel. It's about a 10-15 minute walk across the bridge to Old Town/Edinburgh Castle and a 10 minute walk to the Waverly Train station. The front desk was very friendly!

Breakfast is free across the street at Cafe Rouge. The food there isn't bad, quite filling and has 3 options. Service is prompt and fast. 

This hotel has a lift for people with large suitcases. Rooms are not too small at all, but the bathroom was a wee bit small. 

Free WiFi and fast too. Lots of bars in New Town on the same street to walk to for a pint. About 5 minutes away from Rose Street, famous for plenty of pub and restaurant choices.Went to the bar side for a quick lunch. 

We had the Oysters kilpatrick to start and the fish stew and bangers and mash for main. 

Oysters were very tasty (and mashed potato was used to hold them onto the plate!!!! :P) as was the fish stew - not to watery, just the right consitency with a lot of seafood. Bangers and mash were awesome (as mystery-random-meat always is...) with thick, sticky gravy covering all that is good.

Service was fantastic, waiter had had a long few weeks due to the Fringe but was still very attentive and we were never left without a drink in our hands.

Nom nom yum nom.This fantastic cafe/deli just off Prince's Street has been open for over three years, and their menu is just mmmm...

I went in with a friend, and had the most fascinating conversation with the owner about countries of origin and the Uppsala film festival in Sweden! But now to the serious stuff, the foodddd.

They've got a large range of meat and vegetarian dishes, and the usual list of panini's with quite unusual ingredients! For example, the smoked turkey tomato cranberry was a bit of a novelty for me, but was quite delicious! They're quite affordable, and claim to use ZERO articial ingredients, so they win the health vote as well.My wife and I went here with our 11 month old twins.  They were very accommodating and brought us right in.  The food was very good and it is a very upscale Italian restaurant regarding portions and presentation.  The inside of the restaurant makes you feel like you are eating in an old bank with huge columns all around.  A very cool vibe.  We sort of dine and dashed as the twins were starting stir but the food was great.  

I ordered a clam pasta which was the perfect portion and very clean.  My wife ordered the Gorgonzola gnocchi which was heavy (as expected) but delicious.  A definitely must try if you are looking to break away from the heavy traditional Scottish food.get my coffee, drink it, enjoy it!The food here is the same decent quality stuff that you expect from the chain. By now, you probably know whether you like their food and drink or not. Whatever decision you reached, this branch is not going to change your mind.

A couple of things to note though. As the pictures posted by other reviewers show, this particular restaurant sits on a river called the Water of Leith. If weather permits, pizza by the water would probably be lovely. If not, the window seats will still give you  nice view out onto the water.

It's more cramped in here than in most pizza express restaurants. It's a great place to eavesdrop, if that's what you're after, but I bringing children in here would be stressful.I'm writing this in between mouthfuls of delicious haddock for my lunch. 

I love this shop, with all its different fish and seafood on offer - and the staff are great and very patient with, em, non-chefs like me and their stupid questions. They'll fillet and prepared your fish, discuss how to cook it, and wish you luck as you leave!

I also love just how old fashioned it feels, with marble slabs and newspaper to wrap the fish, and the trays of fresh eggs on the counter. If I fancy a wee nostalgia fest, they do old fashioned fish cakes in bright orange 'breadcrumbs' - there's a lot more potato than fish, but they cost about 30p each, so who's complaining!Well. I never thought I'd see the day I'd give a vegetarian restaurant 4 whole stars!   Seriously though, I was a bit skeptical of whether I'd enjoy our group meal at a veggie place but I couldn't fault it. 

For starters I was torn between the ravioli and the walnut gnocchi salad but in the end I opted for the latter. It was delish! Not the type of gnocchi I was expecting, they were fried rather than boiled, but v tasty nevertheless. They were served on a bed of baby leaves and beetroot which had some kind of sweet and salty glaze to them. Drool... The smoked cheese cubes sprinkled over the top gave the dish another dimension. Different textures and different taste sensations. Can't believe I'm waxing lyrical over a salad!!! 

For main I opted for the chickpea koftas which was served with coriander rice, a curry sauce and a cucumber and raita salad. I ate every bit! The koftas were soft with a nutty type texture. The sauce not overpowering but really complimented the dish well. Not a scrap was left on my plate! 

I did fully intend to have a dessert but between the fennel seed roll at the beginning and the 2 courses I honestly couldn't have managed a dessert (well actually I could have probably squeezed one in but I didn't want my fellow yelpers thinking I'm a greedy cow!). 

The service was great, the waitress really attentive and friendly and she didn't seem irritated by the fact a few of us has to pay separately as we were leaving earlier. The wine menu was pretty extensive and I opted for a cheeky glass of Spanish Tempranillo which was served at the perfect temperature. Mint and citrus water for the table and boom! An excellent experience through and through!

Would I go back? Actually, yes! Although the lure of meat from other nice restaurants might prove too much for me. I just wish i had a token vegetarian friend to give me the excuse to go back! Unfortunately all mine are die hard carnivores :(I think there is something to be learnt from this place - that kids dont need a whole lot of flashy crap going on to keep them entertained. If you need proof just come in here - there is always a selection of kids who seem content doing something that involves paper and crayons - shocking isnt it? No Play-X-Station-Box could do that.

This place is really quite the hidden gem - if you can find it, go on in, you wont be dissapoointed, because actually its quite good fun even when you are 21!

The actual centre is free, but you pay a small cost for each rubbing, but it really is a small cost - liuke 50p or something. It's all worth it to keep places like this open though.Mercat Tours offer historical and fun tours of Edinburgh. I went on the Gallows and Graveyards tour that was led by an enthusiastic and creepy guide. He selects "volunteers" from the group to demonstrate the historical stories he talks about at each stop. 
There were no ghostly sightings in the graveyard, but the guide did explain the grave of the alleged affair between Mary Queen of Scotts and David Rizzio and how Rizzio was murdered by the King right in front of Mary while she was pregnant... and who knows? It may have been Rizzio's child, but I have said enough! 

Definitely worth checking out one of the Mercat tours!The atmosphere in Brass Monkey is better than any other pub I've been to in Edinburgh! I usually come here after a morning of classes or an exam and chill out in their 'secret' back room of mattresses and cushions.  Although sleeping is not allowed it's extremely tempting to just doze off with a pint.  The food is also great and I would definitely recommend their sandwiches which go well with the reasonably priced drinks.
The front room, however, has the brilliant atmosphere I was referring to.  It's small with very few tables and so isn't cluttered.  If you're in there early you can grab a table with your mates and settle down for a heavy session in the midst of the bustling environment which the pub offers.  The problem, however, is that if can't find anywhere to sit then you're forced to stand which is fine, but it can just feel a bit cramped and pointless.  
Brass Monkey is a cosy and affordable alternative to the larger and more conventional pubs in Edinburgh.  Worth a visit no matter the occassion.The Southern has pulled off the hardest trick of all, changing one of Edinburghs more "dive like" student bars into something with an easy sense of class without changing the name. Essentially transporting the formula that has worked well in Holyrood 9a to a new location one can't fault the many tasty beverages and awesome burgers, though like the Holyrood I am not necessarily a fan of the staff having to turn their backs on you to pour the beer (somewhat mitigated by the provided table service) all in all though a great bar.Friendly, Inviting

Service hit or missSituated in the bustling surroundings of Edinburgh's Grassmarket, underneath the imposing shadow of the Castle, The Last Drop is nothing if not atmospheric. With its low ceilings and wooden beams, The Last Drop manages to successfully walk the fine line between traditional and tacky.
Named in reference to the Grassmarket's grisly history as a public execution point, the pub was originally was the last stop for the condemned to have a final tipple before facing the gallows. To be fair, the clientele seems to have changed a bit since the 18th Century. Although, like all the Grassmarket pubs, The Last Drop attracts a fair number of tourists, it still manages to retain a local, working pub vibe, with a good selection of beers and ales, as well as everything else you would expect.
One bonus to The Last Drop is the bar staff. One barman has got the art of pouring, chatting and giving change down to a fine art. With multiple people getting served at all times, he can give the the payment from one customer to another as change without going through the till. Assuming that he does this correctly (I didn't see him get it wrong), it is a genuinely brilliant spectacle; at times he seems to have more arms than a Hindu God.Mr Modos is a bar/pub, with quite a 'rock' element to it. Situated in the Tollcross area of Edinburgh, Mr Modos is just a short walk from the city centre, and it is a great place to go for pre-drinks on the way to a night out. 

The decor inside is really fantastic, it is quite funky and quirky, with soft rock music playing in the background. Mr Modos offers an extremely vast range of drinks, with beers from all over the world, Bulmers cider on tap, tasty wines, and best of all, an extensive cocktail menu including the standard Margarita's - yum, and the more unusual Chocolate Chili Martini - not yet brave enough to try! There are plenty of drinks offers available, and the cocktails cost less than £5 - bargain! 

There is a jukebox which plays great music and there is a quiz night once a week. The drinks are cheap and the atmosphere is friendly and lively so Mr Modos is a great place to chill out with with friends, or to begin serious pre-drinks before a big night out.If you are a whiskey lover and find yourself in Edinburgh this place is an absolute must!

I did a whiskey tasting and had dinner here with a group and it was a fantastic experience. The tasting lasted approximately an hour and consisted of an explanation of the scotch malt whiskey society, a lecture on the history of whiskey and how to properly taste/drink it and obviously a whole lot of whiskey! There were four whiskeys in total, and I'd say a total of 10 oz of liquor at least.

What I found to be the most interesting part is that the SMWS buys entire casks of whiskey from distilleries. The distillery itself will make hundreds of casks and then their tasters will determine which casks should be combined, diluted and bottled so the resulting branded whiskey will always taste the same. SMWS on the other hand, will sample and buy individual casks so the whiskey you get here is not available anywhere else and much stronger (since it hasn't been diluted - one of the whiskeys I tasted was in excess of 60% alcohol content, definitely needed to add water to that one!) The individual holding the tasting was very knowledgeable and professional. 

Unfortunately, nothing is served with the whiskey. My group had been golfing all day and had not had anything to eat since lunch so it was a bit rough on the stomach. However, when we asked for something to snack on they didn't hesitate in bringing out bread.

Dinner was also fantastic. We had a smoked salmon appetizer and braised lamb as the main, which they paired with another whiskey.

The entire tasting and dinner was in a private dining room, which I thought was a very nice touch as it led to a very intimate experience. I felt the price for both the tasting and dinner was very reasonable.I've lost count of the number of times this godsend of a place has saved me from my rumbling tummy on the way home from a night out.

There's not really that much to separate the generic fast food takeaway places that you never seem to go to when you're sober, but if my heels will allow it I always tend to gravitate towards this one.

For starters, you get student discount on absolutely everything, as well as student-only promos like a huge pizza slice for only £1.50... absolute winner. The food is always cooked well (in other words, I've never got ill from one of their burgers/kebabs!) which is generally  more than can be said for a lot of places like this. 

But what I think really swings it for me was the freezing january night when a friend and I were queuing out the door in the snow, to find that the staff were going along the queue handing out free chips to warm you up while you waited. You can't get any better than that. The only drawback? It's not open late enough!AMAZING!!  I agree with the other reviews, best pizza in Mesa, for sure!  My friend recommended this place to me, I didn't even know it existed, its in an odd area, in a strip mall on Main Street between Sossoman and Power Rds, next to antique malls, amongst various businesses.  

OK, to the pizza!  Its on a sourdough crust, such a good mixture for crusts.  I had the number 17-I forget the name they gave it, but is the ham with choice of pineapple or mushrooms-I chose mushrooms.  The best part, for me, the toppings are on the crust, under a yummy goey layer of delicious cheeses!  This is how they roll!  

My friend had their "blanca" pizza, the best all white pizza I've tasted, and I loved hers more than mine, it is sin on pizza, and I loved it! She chose to have pepperoni, and extra cheese, so amazing to bit into the cheeses with the snap of pepperoni!  I was in pizza heaven.

I want to make a special note, they do serve drinks, amazing prices, but the wine, I DO NOT suggest.  I ordered a red wine, it came, it felt warm in the glass, and one sip sent me to instant nausea.  I had to send it back, telling them it was undrinkable, I ordered a white wine, but even that wasn't the best.  So, this is the reason for the 4 stars, sadly, but 4 is not bad, it has to be on all levels for me to give it a 5.  If they are going to offer adult beverages, I'd like to not have to send back.  But the pizza is a 5 for me! Buon appetito!Great burgers. A bit expensive but it's a nice treat.Tesco of Musselburgh is a great place to shop at.

Today I bought a bottle of "Finest" Vintage Cava (amazingly, with the addition of Chardonnay grapes, very unusual for a Cava) for only £6.99

Their coffees and teas are wonderful.Visiting here with a surfing enthusiast I was impressed with what he claimed was a bargain buy. Boardwise do well to compete with online companies and they successfully add  well informed advice and tips with your every purchase. In an attempt to persuade me to get into surfing a particularly chatty member of staff enlightened me of the best places to surf in Scotland alongside offering affordable rental prices for all the basic gear. A nice gesture.

I you like anything involving a board, you'd be wise to go here. (cringe)Bruntsfield, with it's wonderfully unique, and sometimes pricey, boutiques and shops is the perfect home for this jewellery store! I'm especially drawn to it by its simplicity, and I'm happy to say none of the pieces I saw in there when I was browsing were garish or tacky.

A lot of the jewellery is made of real gold and silver, and although they sell all sorts of rings, bracelets, necklaces and earrings, there is definitely a decipherable common theme running through the whole collection! Alot of the pieces have adorable heart and bird shaped charms - even the rings! 

I just have to stress how wonderfully minimalist the jewellery is, which makes it so much classier. However, it's quite expensive, and something like a really beautiful necklace I saw there, with a heart and pearl, will set you back £105! 

They've got a fantastic website, which says they'll deliver the jewellery you buy online within 5 days of ordering. I'm definitely a fan.Yelp

Overall: 4 star
Food: 4
Service: 3
Atmosphere: 3

FOOD (taste, originality, plating):
TASTE:
The almejas al vapor are a must try.  The cheese plate is pricey for just one kind of cheese, but it came with apples, honey, sausage, prosciutto, pesto, honey cheese bread, and spicy chimichuri making it one of the most fun cheese plates i've had.

SERVICE (efficiency, charisma, helpfulness, menu knowledge)
Poor.
I sat a the bar, my favorite thing to do and was served by the bartender.

Charisma: Average: pleasant, but not a stand out guy.
Efficiency: Low: forgot my drinks, hard to get his attention despite slow crowd.  His work ethic was tremendous however as he kept very busy on side work.
Menu Knowledge: Poor.  Didn't know the answer to most of my questions.
Helpfulness: Low.  he did recommend the almejas which were fabulous, but when his menu knowledge was low, he didn't try to find out the answers.

5 star: one of my arizona favorites!
4 star: great eats, recommended.
3 star: good eats
2 star: avoid unless with good company
1 star: avoid despite companyWhen we get the coveted and rare date night, we almost always try to hit up The Mission. That means we've been here four times since we became parents a year ago.
First up, the guac is a must must must! It's some of the best guac I've ever had. Seriously, I have dreams about it. I could bath in it. And I may, if they ever let me. 
Secondly, the drink menu changes fairly often and although a lot them are on the sweeter side (not my fav), they do have one that I've fallen in love with. Avocado margarita- they have a fancy name for it, but it's an avocado margarita. And it's one of the best drinks in town. It may sound weird, but I'm asking you to try it because if you have taste buds, you'll be happy you did.
Third on the list is the pork belly dish. Just eat it. That is all.
And lastly is the halibut. I've had this dish the last two times we've eaten here and I will have it again. The sauce they give you to pour over the dish...oh, the sauce. I would have poured it directly into my mouth if it wasn't frowned upon in Scottsdale.
The killer food is a great compliment to the awesome ambiance (love the chandeliers!) and the people watching. Make a reservation- the secret's out!Great spot for good food and great drinks! We sat at the bar and had few Mission margaritas which was great. Then we had the guacamole , table side. It is delicious but not enough for four people. I had the hanger steak ! It was cooked perfect ! I would definitely recommend it!How have I not reviewed this yet?!?!

This is a strong contender for our favorite fish & chips in Edinburgh.  We park on the east side of Holyrood Park, follow Queen's Drive to the south, then walk down the hill path to Duddingston and you're right there at Sheep's Heid.  If you make that stroll, then you feel you've earned at least part of your supper.

("Heed, pants, now!"  Does anyone else like "So I Married an Axe Murderer?  That's how you pronounce "heid.")  

The haggis stack of mash, neeps and haggis was just perfect -- great seasonings & textures.  Fish & chips were crisp, hot and tasty.   

Great atmosphere as well:  perfect place to bring those picky out of town guests looking for authentic.  Don't forget to bowl.Peter Green is one of those shops whose existence I find highly comforting, even if I can count on the fingers of one hand the number of times I've actually shopped there.  

When I lived in Marchmont, like most students, my choice of alcohol was largely dictated by whichever beer happened to be on special offer at the Scotmid booze shop across the road.  However, I still cherish hopes that, with maturity and a steady cash flow, I might yet develop into a connoisseur, and when that day comes, it's reassuring to know that Peter Green will be there waiting for me.

Put simply, this is a quality independent shop that stocks all manner of specialty liquor, and manages to be friendly and charming at the same time.  It's slightly pricey, but then, you get what you pay for (as my cheap lager habit has taught me all too well). Apparently it's also the only place in Edinburgh where you can buy elderflower wine, so if that is what you seek, this is the place to go!This place has a fantastic selection of fabrics and sewing equipment. I came here with my friend who does fashion design and was amazed by the selection of fabrics and designs at quite reasonable prices. The shop though is bulging with stock and it's a bit of a labyrinth so you might be better off asking at the cashier if you are after something particular. Take note of their big selection of buttons as well (  I used to have a small obsession with buttons which I thought I was over with until I came here). 

 So for those talented enough to knit or make a quilt or for those just seeking fabric for a costume, sofa cover or just a toga this is the place for you.I was advised to come here by a shop around the corner also selling music and electrical appliances and gizmos. I was after a cord to connect my ipod to a CD player and none of the shops around the area,which I thought would be cheaper had it.

Richer Sounds did, and at an OK price (around 10 pounds). The service was great, despite the small price I was paying compared to the huge plasma TVs I was surrounded with. It's a small shop but they seemed very well stocked out and the staff are well trained and polite. I watched as a new owner of a massive TV proudly tried to squeeze it into his car outside, which turned out to be a very amusing operation with the shop assistants, whilst a parking attendant kept coming by to tell them off. 

Would certainly come here again for any future musical needs.Papilio is one of the finest Italian restaurants which I have come across in Edinburgh. Located in the centre of the Bruntsfield area of Edinburgh, it is a great place for students to go to for their lunch or dinner.

The place is quite small inside the restaurant, but it gives it a cosy rather than a cramped feel, and the decor is very authentically Italian with a Italian music playing in the background. The atmosphere is really friendly and lively inside and the waiters were lovely and highly efficient in their service. 

Papilio offer a wide range of authentic Italian cuisine on their menu including Pizzas, pastas and risotto, as well as steak and chicken dishes. I had the pizza pescatora with shellfish which was delicious, there didn't skimp on the topping which was good and there was lots of cheese too - yum!  My friend had the spaghetti carbonara which looked amazing and she said it was lovely. 

The prices are also excelled in Papilio and I think you would be hard pushed to another Italian restaurant in Edinburgh with the same high quality of service and delicious tasting food. Papilio is now my first port of call when I fancy an Italian meal in Edinburgh.I had their taco salad which was spicy and nice, but what really took the cake was the Cheese (Que so Fondue) that they had on the menu.....they melted 3-4 types of cheese together with ground up beef that was served in a hot skillet with really thick tortilla chips that would make your mouth melt. I also had their signature Mango Margarita which was sooooooo delicious and sweet.T & T! It's dynamite! 

T & T! It tastes so right! 

T & T! Gives me a power load! 

T & T! Watch my butt explode!

Bad AC/DC sample aside, Tacos & Tequila (T & T) is actually pretty good even though it's ridiculously overpriced even by Las Vegas standards. 

Seriously, this city will use any opportunity to overcharge you. On my last trip, they charged me 33 percent more for an escort because she had two legs and most of her teeth. Kidding. 

No really, I am kidding.

When my 11 day work trip to Las Vegas bled into the fifth day (and into the weekend), I needed to unwind a bit by watching the first round of the NFL playoffs in a sports bar environment. I had passed by this joint on the way to work a few times, so I gave it a shot. Luckily, it filled the bill (in more ways than one).

I walked up and asked for a table for one near a screen. Quickly, two pretty hostesses greeted me and sat me at the bar in front of some nice high definition screens. The bartender immediately put some chips and salsa in front me, asked if I wanted a drink, and presented the menu to me. Without question, the service at "T&T" is dynamite.

Bad joke aside, the food is also awesome. My order was promptly taken and soon enough I was munching on some awesome chips and salsa, sipping on a drink, and high fiving sports fans around me. Eventually, my order came out with 4 tacos of various meats with melted cheese on top. They were freakin' delicious. 

The price is a bit steep for food and/or drinks. But then again, the more you drink, the better it all tastes, and the less price seems to matter. 

Remember, when it doesn't matter how much the drinks cost, it's always happy hour.Ocean Terminal really is a one-stop shop. It has everything!! Including Trespass.
they are all things outdoor. Tents, backpacks, hiking boots, jackets, trousers, everything.

The staff are really friendly too, more than happy to help and extremely knowledgeable. The price is a bit much, but I'm told that this is typical of outdoor places.The weird thing is, when I used to live in Halls and pass this every day on my way to uni I never noticed how good it was.

Imagine the kind of fruit stall you'd find in a market, keep those prices and then blend it with a very well-stocked corner shop, and that's more or less what this shop is like. Whether you're after a pint of milk, a punnet of perfectly ripe black cherries or some exotic imported mangoes that are so juicy you have to eat them outside, this is your place.

Although they might charge a bit more than other nearby shops which claim to sell fresh fruit and veg at a fraction of the price, I've never bought anything from here only to get home and find that the underneath layer is all mouldy (unlike places like Kamco).I've been a casual user of the buses for a few years, but I now have to commute to work and recently purchased a Ridacard. Man, unlimited travel is really good.

There's plenty of bus stops everywhere in Edinburgh, sometimes as close to just 100yds apart in hilly areas. Services are very frequent on the busy corridors (8 minutes). It can sometimes get caught in traffic in areas without bus lanes or in Princes Street but the extent of the network and the frequency of service is fantastic for a city the size of Edinburgh.

A couple of things: no night services on the 23/27 corridor from Canonmills to Tollcross; that could come in handy. Some areas don't have so many bus stops (Marchmont anyone?). Also some routes popular with students don't have a bus alternative when the weather is bad, thinking about Haymarket - Dalry - Gorgie to Merchiston - Morningside for example. You have to connect in the City Centre which is long so you'll take the 30 minute walk in the rain any time... Also an "Oyster" type of prepaid card that automatically caps at £3.50 after 3 journeys thus avoiding thinking whether to take a single or day ticket would be great - Ridacard can be too expensive for some users and the m-tickets never solved that problem.

Apart from that, really impressive. On par or even better than some bus services in similar-sized French cities. And miles better than privatised bus services elsewhere in Scotland (First? Are you listening?)As we were walking by, I heard an older couple outside saying "oh this store is expensive, we can't go in there"

Truth of the matter is, this store is wonderful. The prices are comparable for what you're buying and everything on offer is real, wholesome and organic. They have fresh, local fruit, veg and dairy products. There are loads of dried goods, loads of micro, macro, raw, you name it, it's probably there! On top of everything edible, they also have a huge selection of natural soaps, deodorants, toothpaste, hair dye, vitamins, etc.

I know we have stores like this in Glasgow, but we need more! My life needs more community bake days and boxes of mixed veg! I loved this store!It's admirable to see a record shop avoid the mainstream. Underground  Solu'shn prides itself on offering those hidden rarities, hard to find gems and an impressive selection of vinyl.  Ultimately this comes at a price with the average vinyl/ CD costing 12-14 pounds.  Nonetheless, unlike the larger entertainment mega-stores, you can try out your chosen record on any of the available decks: a sort of 'try before you buy' system. If your a budding DJ and your looking to boost your track collection with some rare gems, chances are Solu'shn will stock such items.Firstly, you really cant miss this place - situated on George Street, this large and extremely dominating building stands out as one of the nicest places in the area.

But enough about Architecture, lets talk about what this building is really great for.

I've only been here for some gigs during the Festival, so I cant comment on what this place does for the rest of the year. However, for that one month or so when the whole world decends on Edinburgh, this place is great. As a venue for stand up comics its pretty great - large nough so that you can get a ticket with relative ease for th bigger acts and yet so well designed that you could feel as though you were at an intimate and private gig, this well decorated and beautiful venue has held some really great comics in the past.

Lets hope it continues to do so.This is a well stocked charity shop with a good range of bric-a-brac and all for a good cause, of course.

I particularly like browsing through the book sections in charity shops and they had a whole section called "Old and Interesting" with some pretty old school books including old film reviews which I thought was pretty cool.

The staff here are friendly and on my visit they were busy working away organising new stock onto the shelves.

They also have a section with brand new items including gardening accessories such as cool watering cans and gloves. They also had a box of rubber ducks for £1.99 a pop.There's a reason Blackwells has so many reviews. It really is a great bookshop. A modest chain store it may be, but you will forget that with its excellent quality of service.

This Blackwells in particular is stocked well with academic books geared toward the nearby University campus. In fact Blackwells is the first port of call for arts and humanities students stocking up on their course textbooks (if they're buying them first hand anyway). But beyond this they still offer a great range within each genres. Take philosophy. yes they offer some of the pop and pulp philosophy like Waterstones and other chains, but they also stock some really stimulating, acadademic books and new publications outwith the philosophy department's reading lists. This makes browsing these sections far more intereting.

Of course they don't only offer academic books, being a commercial high street book shop and you can still expect everything on the top 100 book charts, all your Twilights and what nots. Blackwells also has a good children's section and a modest selection of stationery. As I've mentioned in a previous review, I also enjoy the guilty pleasure of sitting in the Costa cafe attached, and browsing through books I've picked up.

Books are a little pricey, but Blackwells isn't any more expensive than Waterstones or whoever. It is of course cheaper to buy online.

Overall an excellent bookshop with a better selection than most high street retailers.I don't shop in Marks and Spencers for clothes as I haven't reached forty and don't have three kids. But I do love: 

1. Their underwear department. There always seems to be a sale section full of ridiculous bargains. I got a bra in here for 98p. 98p! How many things can you still buy for 98p? As a bargain hunter, this makes me happy. 

2. The home department. This store doesn't have the best home department in all the Marks and Sparks, but they do have some nice things. And again, there can be some fantastic reductions in some good quality gear. I got a nice blanket in here for a tenner which keeps me nice and warm during the cold winter. And summer. 

3. The food department. Everyone knows about Marks and Sparks food department and if you don't, well you don't deserve to shop there. Percy Pigs: Nuff said. 

Yes Marks and Spencers might be a little old fashioned and snobby, but it keeps the Neds out (which I am convicted are taking over the country) and maintains high standards. You can usually rely on good customer service too.Yes, the Elephant House is lovely, and yes, it has a good atmosphere, but listen up: do not attempt to go in on a rainy Wednesday afternoon after 5. It's so crowded it took 20 minutes just to get a seat! (My partner in coffee crime had suggested we meet there and I was loathe to hop back out into the rain again).

Having said that, nomnomnom, good coffee. There are several ways to get me happy and not burning the coffee or milk it comes with, is definitely one of them. I was pleasantly surprised as I really didn't expect anything too impressive coffee-wise, mainly because of the touristy nature of the place. 

Boy was I wrong. It's lovely, and cozy, and good for conversations that last for hours, and, yes, on a rainy afternoon I fully understand why half of Edinburgh wants to hide within these four walls. It's just too popular for it's own good, that's all.Last week I decided to drive up to Edinburgh for a mini holiday and thought to check this place out. I actually did not know about this café and it's history until I discovered it through an Instagram profile. I was searching hashtags of cappuccinos and a delicious looking one popped up and the title said "Birthplace of Harry Potter" which drew me in right away because I am a big fan of the book series. I walked from my hotel to the Cafe and right when I saw it, I knew I would enjoy the view because it was located on George IV bridge which overlooked a good portion of the city including Edinburgh Castle! The front of the Cafe is painted in this nice blood red color and there is a poster of JK Rowling in the window which draws you. It looks very small when you first enter and you worry if they are going to have room for you as there are only a few stools/chairs for window seating. However, as you get close to the counter you realize that there is a much larger seating area in the back of the café. The Elephant House differs from a lot of café's in that you have to wait in line to be served at the counter and then wait to be seated, rather than taking your seat and ordering from there.  The menu was full of cute British and Scottish foods/pastries and a set of coffee drinks as well. I opted for the special of the day which was a lovely fresh mint tea and a slice of the homemade organic carrot cake. After paying things got a little tricky because the place was PACKED! The front of the cafe is first come first sit type of seating but the back room where JK Rowling sat and wrote the first few Harry Potter novels is assigned seating by a hostess. It seemed really crazy because we had no where to place our tray and had to stand holding it in that hectic crowded area while waiting to be seated. After 2 minutes we were seated with another group, which made me a bit awkward but quickly that faded because I wanted to relish in the ambiance of the room, the HARRY POTTER WRITING ROOM as I called it :). It was a nice back room, not a lot tables so many people shared with other customers they did not know. A lot of writers sitting on laptops or writing on pieces of paper for inspiration which I thought was really cute. The best part was the view from the back windows. Perfect panoramic view of the city and Edinburgh Castle. Was it a coincidence that Hogwarts looks EXACTLY like Edinburgh Castle? I think not! The mint tea was lovely and fresh and the cake was sweet but not too sweet and had amazing frosting. I decided to take a quick break to the bathroom where I was extremely surprised by the white walls covered in writing with notes from fans all over the world thanking JK Rowling and complimenting the books. I really enjoyed the whole experience except for seating situation and being forced to share a table with others who didn't seem too keen to be sitting with us either, but that quickly vanished after a few minutes. Great experience, good food and environment.I'm a bit of a sucker when it comes to bargains. Hey, I'm only human.

Sally's provides just that. If I have a big event coming up, I come here for the DIY nails, body lotions, face-masks and hair-masks. They sell them in bulk too, so it lasts a long, long time. I still have a mud mask I bought 4 years ago.

They have a great selection of fake nails and tans, so you can take your pic. I prefer to come here over Boots or any of the big boys, because I trust the quality in Sally's so I know it will be a good product. 
I thoroughly recommend said same mud mask and their moisturizing face masks, they really work and last forever!!The food was good!  It was very quiet and we had a nice double date.  The server was friendly and wasn't afraid to take an extra minute to talk to us.  It is a nice relaxing place for an evening meal.There are a lot of frozen yogurt places to check out, but Yogurtini is by far my favorite.  (+ positive, - negative, -/+ neutral)

+ The place is freaking adorable.  I know it sounds a little strange, but I love the colors they picked for the place.  The blues and greens MAKE me want to eat their yogurt.

-/+ The frozen yogurt.  Although I do love their vanilla flavor, it doesn't taste like "original" frozen yogurt.  They do make a homemade yogurt, and I haven't tried it, but I'm guessing that one must taste more like the classic frozen yogurt.

+ SO. MANY. TOPPINGS.  Hot sauce? Yes.  Gummy worms? Yes.  They have all the fruits you love, and definitely all the candy you love, to make your frozen yogurt just the way you want it.  (I personally like to mix my vanilla yogurt with peanut butter and chocolate chips).  

+ Punch cards.  This is a big thing for me.  Of course I'm gonna come back if a company is going to reward me for my loyalty.Suzy and I are big fans of Indian Cuisine, she's a gourmet cook and has made many different Indian dishes herself.  We've eaten at Bollywood at least a half dozen times and know the owner and his wife.  The food is made to order from my knowledge and the wife is the one whose provided the recipes.  Now, the decor in the restaurant is fine, and quite frankly I don't give a rats ass about how a place looks, I come for the grub.  

If you're a fan of spicy food and have hair on your chest, go for the Vindaloo, it's unbelievably killer, I ate and cried, at the same time.  
The Lamb Masala is excellent, I've had it several times, as are the vegetarian dishes.  The breads are excellent, hot, tasty and just the right amount of flavor.
The Indian beer (litre bottle) goes extremely well with the food.  The food i very moderately priced, the service is good, not great, and the food quality is very good.  
Now, I've eaten at Origin India in Las Vegas, and dollar for dollar, this place wins hands down.Stopped in around 230pm so it wasn't very crowded and it ensured fast and friendly service. I don't eat most meat so I settled for a build my own salmon burger.  My delightful server asked if I wanted cheese and I said I didn't know about cheese on fish.  She said have crumbled goat cheese. So I did.  Came out quick and hot on ciabatta bread.  It was delicious ...I should have tried the fries. The cole slaw was okay but i like mine with more kick.  Had a cold Fat Tire and it was great combo
I had planned to try the veggie burger but she said they were good but frozen andhad to be fried to keep them together so I wasn't real keen on frozen.  I'm sure it's better than the Boca Burgers in my freezer, but with everything else tasting so good my only suggestions to do what Cold Beer and Cheeseburger does just south on Scottsdale and make the fresh each day.  This is going to be a regular spot for me and friends. If you are up this way you must try it. And don't for get the delicious goat cheese on your burger. Great serviceI really enjoy going to Floyds. It's a nice date place with great wine prices and tasty food!good food-good drinks-good atmosphere-always a little iffy on the service but they treat you like family, right?? a must try!!
this is a real no-brainer
superb, hot & tasty. the sauces were perfect. the chicken was crisp & juicy. the meatballs were savory & cooked to perfection. the salad & breadsticks as always were tops!!First read about this in the recent 2009 Best of Phoenix and wow, what a great choice! The place is cozy and friendly (laidback atmosphere) with food that is a wonderful culinary experience. I enjoyed the roasted garlic in olive oil with the toasted baguette slices from the start menu, though the nosh plate might need some work (more types of cured meats, and maybe some of those tiny dill pickles). 

From the starter plates we had the crostini duo and the roasted grapes and brie on the multi-grain bread slices was popular with all - the one with the cucumber slices on them, a distant and less exciting second. The other starter - dates stuffed with homemade Chorizo and grueyer cheese, yum! The come on a bed of greens with some sort of vinegar dressing, which was a nice compliment.

For Sharing Section of the menu - the citrus brined fried chicken and cheddar cheese waffles, loved by all! I recommend ordering it early since we asked for it about 7 pm and it was the last one left. Even the braised greens were good. I was not so impressed with the halibut filet plate  - nicely seasoned but frankly, a bit dry.

Other thoughts - they really like cucumber here - they put it in the water (makes it quite refreshing), garnished my gin and tonic with it (homemade tonic, nice but not really wowed by it), and had it on the previously mentioned crostini duo plate - just seemed like a lot of cucumer. As for the service, it was good throughout the meal. The waiter kept things well paced and was a good source of information when asked, without being overly obtrusive.

If you haven't gone, worth checking out and if you have gone worth going back again. :-)All the bartenders know how to treat their customers, WITH AWESOMENESS!For the short period of time I was able to spend at this spa, it was quite enjoyable (I was to meet my husband for golf at 2pm).  I met my aunt and cousin here for a relaxing noon, and it was just that (after I gulped down the $75 credit card swipe to just use the facilities).  

We had our own lockers complete with robes and sandals (although mine were more comfortable) with a self-created pass code.  The sauna was our first stop followed by the hot tub.  We had the facility to ourselves.  The cold deluge was quite refreshing after working up a sweat with all that relaxing.  

The best feature of the facilities was definitely the pool.  The spa's private rooftop pool has Camelback mountain as a back-drop, which was stunning.  Our pool-side server was exceptionally nice and served my cousin and I champagne while my aunt enjoyed her massage.  We monched on grilled fruit skewers, a Mediterranean plate, vegetable flat bread, and shrimp wrap all of which were super healthy and fresh tasting.

It is worthwhile, but you may want to wait until there is a special on the facilities price.  It sounds like they offer deals through Living Social and other sites.I'm going to try and piece together what I remember about this place and why it is worth going back.  

The strip and dumb dumb show gets old when you go to Vegas regularly.  All the tourists are running amok, scrounging for cheap hookups, free deals, bad blow, and complaining about waiting in line or how expensive bottle service is.  The whole circus gets intolerable unless you're 23 and fueled by hormones and/or some narcotic.

Off the strip is a tiny oasis of intoxicating pleasure called Frankie's.  We ended up there after dinner and this dim, cozy lounge was exactly what we had all been looking for.  The drinks are tropical and potency is measured by skulls.  The more skulls there are, the more trouble you are asking for.  Bartenders are friendly and it won't break the bank.  This place can either be the launching pad for a long night of shenanigans, or the place you all meet after to piece together where the night went wrong.Frankie's is a great dive bar. They have really good tiki drinks with a lot of crazy videos playing on the TV. This is one of the few places in Vegas that you can get high quality drinks comp'd while gambling. It's located right outside UMC. It gets pretty busy on the weekends and their parking lot is pretty small. So occasionally it's difficult to park. But it's worth a stop!We were in Scottsdale for a long weekend found this place via Yelp.  Indulge had good ratings and lived up to them.  Cool menu concept let's you fill out your own order from a menu they provide.  Top quality beef and ingredients are put together well. Food is very good.  Service was better, we were greeted immediately and the staff was all very attentive. The owner, Len, a former Chicagoan himself was there and very friendly. The prices were great.  We really liked Indulge and recommend it.I love this place!  The only reason they aren't getting 5 stars is the prices are just a little too steep.   My favorite burger medley:  turkey burger with buffalo sauce, blue cheese, a little avocado... mmmmmm!  (i may be salivating a little as I write this!!).  And the sweet potato fries are delish. 

If you want to make this a little more affordable, go for happy hour!  $2 or 3 domestic bottles, not too shabby!  Not exactly the usual happy hour hang out, but it works for me.  

Wish there were more of these around the valley - this one is just a little too far away from the Cen Pho, but if you do venture out - be sure to check this place out!Do you like acrylic floor lamps? I certainly do, and sidebar has two of them against one of the exposed brick walls in this new casual-trendy-cool upstairs bar on one of my favorite corners in Phoenix.

I went back tonight after having a smashing time there for my birthday party last month, and again I was not disappointed. They carry Blue Moon and serve it properly (with an orange slice) so I'm happy. From what I remember of my first visit (it is a bit hazy) they had a decent selection of beers. I vaguely recall being delivered what I think to be a Chimay Red.

Alas, back to the review. I has a nice, clean decor without looking like somebody emptied an IKEA truck to furnish the place. It is a mixed crowd that skews younger and gayer, but lots of different styles are represented. It is cozy, so it can fill up fast, although I haven't seen it get too full for comfort. 

Great staff, great vibeI definitely enjoyed a couple of hours at SideBar. I have been tired of the same places I always go, and have been wanting to check this bar out. Right when i walked up the stairs, my eyes were entranced. One of the first things that caught my attention was the awesome white bar stools, and lucky for me there was room at the bar, so I sat, directly facing beautiful champagne flutes. Immediately I was smiling because its not every Saturday I go to a beautiful spot, and get to sip on champagne by the glass, instead of by the bottle. The bartender was super nice and the  young lady behind the bar had a great style, and also very helpful. There was a movie playing, with the volume off, kinda like at the Roosevelt, except futuristic, not western. We got there around 8 or 8:30 and it was not especially busy but by 10ish it  was crowded. 
The bar stools don't have backs, so if you don't have a strong back, you might get uncomfortable by the end of the night. And I cant imagine if you were overweight being comfortable in them either.  Like Amy D. said, mints in the bathroom, ya gotta love that. Close to home? Yes, love it. And the super cool lighting. It  made me happy!
I have to add this, from my husbands point, no beer on tap, but they have a vast selection.  They even have Four Peaks, Kiltlifter, and 8th Street.  My husband said the prices were decent,  but i told him "it's not just the beer you're paying for, you're paying for the ambiance."  I gotta say, I loved the scene, and we will definitely go back, and soon.

One more thing! My husband really enjoyed the music, a reggae ska, sound, Sublime.Saturday night is ladies night, $1.50 well drinks...need I say more???Good air flow on the floor. Doesn't feel super smokey like most other casinos in the area. Smaller too and like other casinos, can get crowded on Saturday nights. Played BAD Bingo and had a blast with my family for my 30th birthday - didn't win but still had tons of fun!Stopped in here while waiting for our table at a nearby restaurant for a margarita with friends.  The place was packed so we hovered at the bar where we got served pretty quickly some awesome margaritas, chips, and salsa.  Looking forward to my next trip out here to try some of their food.Good margarita, rice, salsa and chicken tacos.This review is for breakfast at Prado...
Read on if you're interested in an impressive place for your morning meal!
(I hear that lunch and dinner can be inconsistent, but I have a new favorite breakfast place in town thanks to the meal I shared with my HUSBAND on Monday morning at Prado.

While I walked by Prado, the Montelucia's main restaurant, several times throughout our wedding weekend, I'd never been in for breakfast or lunch.  So, after a fabulous yoga class at Joya spa on Monday, my HUSBAND (yes, I love saying that) met me for breakfast at Prado.

There is patio seating but we sat indoors.  Either way, it's beautiful with a fantastic Spanish decor and ambiance.

I went with the egg white omelette, which comes with peppers, spinach, and mushrooms and a side of your choice of toast.  Multi-grain was my choice.  Jared ordered the burrito, which includes scrambled eggs, merguez sausage, onions, potatoes, and pico de gallo.  Each of these items are priced at $10.

My omelette was delicious!  It came well done just as I requested and they did not skimp on the veggies.  It was served with a delicious salsa and it was so big I couldn't finish it.  I may just have to return with a friend and order one omelette to share.  I didn't want to stop eating although I was getting full, but Jared was sick of waiting on me.  So, he left me eating and went to go take care of some "business" if you know what I mean.

Luckily, our server, Dominic, was super sweet.  He came and chatted with me and kept my water and coffee full.  And he didn't make me feel like an idiot when I asked for sweet 'n low and it was there just hiding in the sweetener box right in front of me.  He also dropped off a special quote of the day with my bill.  My quote reads "Time has a wonderful way of showing us what really matters." (Margaret Peters).  

So maybe the quote isn't necessarily UFC as it relates to my review, but if you're up for sharing a well done, fluffy egg white omelette with me for breakfast some time, let me know... we can meet at Prado at the Montelucia!This was my first Yogi's Grill experience.  It was a very clean restaurant and the food portions were big.  I enjoyed their food and this is a good place to go for a quick "fast food" Japanese fix.  We ordered the chicken plate and salmon plate.  Both were good! I probably wouldn't get any sushi here since we already have a favorite sushi place. If you're sitting on the fence, this place is worth a try!great food, incredible portions.  they also have a healthy breakfast menu, which is great.

love their salads and happy hour menu.   Probably my favorite breakfast place.  Great french fries.

wheat pancakes with fruit are incredible.Huge portions, delicious food!  A visiting friend and I arrived around 10:30am on a Wednesday.  I had the breakfast nachos; not the most health-conscious choice, but they were delicious!  The chorizo was tasty and they are served with a side of their amazing sausage gravy, which is unlike any I ever had before.  My friend had the southwest club wrap.  She said it was great and it was enormous; she couldn't eat it all.  We ate outside, and although the traffic was a bit noisy, it was a nice atmosphere at Daily Dose.  The service was good and we didn't feel rushed at all, even though business was at a fairly steady pace and we took our time.  I would definitely return!good breakfast i will go backI ate there w/my family... it's great for families, groups, and couples... very similar to cheesecake factory. It's probably not the best place to order Filet Mignon, but they do have some great pastas. If your a meat lover go for the sunday night pasta. If you want something that's light then go for the Pasta with Grilled Chicken, Tomato, Basil & Mozzarella.... or you feel something creamy Pasta Carbonara is really good too.... I really enjoyed my dinner there even tho the food was pretty average, i just loved the fact that my whole family was there and enjoyed our dinner together..Went here a week ago with a friend after work around 11PM. Really convenient since I was looking for a good place to eat around during late nights. The decor was casual elegant, not that I'm complaining about it, I actually think it's a good thing. It makes the food taste extra good considering the nice, grand decor. My friend and I ordered the ultimate appetizers which served different types of cuisine from around the globe like spring rolls, Philadelphia steak rolls, chicken, and etc. (My memory is a bit lacking since it's been almost two weeks now) Though the food is okay, the dish was served in large portion. Now that's a great appetizers all for 30 bucks!Checked this 24/7 place out after arriving in Vegas late Friday night. Came in at about 3:30AM and was surrounded by lots of exhausted barefoot clubbers with heels in tow. From what I remember, we were seated promptly and greeted by a friendly waitress. I wanted a Long Island Iced Tea, but was instructed that "Texas Tea" was an ample substitute, and that it had "spurs". Intrigued by the spurs, and wondering if they would kick my night in the right direction, I decided to order one.  I was a little disappointed, as It tasted like sweetened Nestea with a splash of vodka and lemon.  I sent it back, and ordered a more appropriate vodka martini with 3 giant olives.  Excellent.  I also ordered the seared tuna which was excellent.  I don't really recall how much everything was, but I do remember the sun was up when we left later that "night".We came to this location twice. The first one was for dinner before seeing "Jersey Boys" and the second was for a late dinner after a day/night of gambling on Fremont Street(where food is kind of ass). 

Same bread as the other Lux, and the same menu except for desserts (they make home made beniegts and pineapple upside down cake). I also had Asian nachos both times which I swear are ingenious and DELICIOUS. Yes, Asian nachos-wonton skins (instead of chips), a light amount of cheese, scallions and a delicious spicy/sweet peanut sauce with a little wasabi "cream" which wasn't very noticeable but made a for just enough heat to send these over the top. Our first night, a bunch of us shared different things from calamari to said nachos to salad and burgers. 

Our second time here, we were seated next to folks from San Angelo and Fort Worth Texas and started sharing butter/bites of desserts with the other tables and seemed to talk and talk for a long time about having teens, etc.

Desserts are worth it here for sure and though we had the same waitress both times (she was a bit weird), we would come back here again for sure.First, this Joann's is HUGE! I even confirmed with the staff that it is the largest in the area. It has a great selection and seems to staff people who actually do crafts. This may sounds like a no-brainer but, trust me, its not. As the store is massive, so is the selection. And, the sales have been great lately.  The store is well organized and has everything you could ever hope to find for scrapbooking, card making, jewelry making, needle crafts, and there are tons of fabric and home decor items.

This Joann's also offers classes on a regular basis. I recently attended a knitting class. It was a lot of fun and yep, we all learned to knit. 

If you are into crafting or interested in learning something new, this is definitely worth checking out.Excellent sandwiches!  I recommend the corned beef on rye or grilled ham and cheese.  Most guys like the cheese steaks.  The salads are decent here too.  I don't like the reheated pizza slices here but if you order a whole pizza fresh it's very good.Food was great, except for the desert.  We shared the tres leches and didn't care for it.  Bacon wrapped filet and chicken were great, sausage is awesome as well.Everything was delicious, down to the tomatoes and kale salad. All the waiters were very attentive and made us feel like royalty. A Filipino waiter came to our table and was very nice and welcoming! It makes me a little sad that I was only visiting Scottsdale, as I would love to dine here again. 

When they tell you the waiters will attack you with skewers of meat if you keep the card green, they really will come to you nonstop. They kind of rush off quickly, so state that you also want a piece if they are at your table. 

The only reason why I dinged a star off was because when my dad asked for a piece of rare filet mignon, the server said none of the pieces were rare but he would get another skewer. Another server came by a few minutes later with another skewer and cut the most well-done piece of meat before rushing off.I came on 3/18. The same day their system was updating, they were offering $10 dinner buffet for the inconvenience. I came with a bogo buy 1 get 1 coupon and paid $10.81 for 2 people. 

The selections was very standard, asian, pizza, pasta, salad/deli bar, and carving station. Not a big selection for food. However, I gave it an extra star for their coffee machine. Instead of ordering it with the waitress, there was a large section where you can customized your own coffee, espresso,etc (yes, there is an espresso machine)

The dessert offered more, self serve ice cream, or their "gourmet ice cream" section, more toppings for ice cream. There was creme brule, panna cotta (which was bland), cake, cookie, and lemon tart (very tarty).

Overall, for the price I paid, I am satisfied. 

I do recommend coming here if you are around the area.I had a shrimp po' boy when I came here and it was delicious! The shrimp was crisp and the bread was fresh.

The only problem was the wait. I had to wait over 20 minutes for a po' boy and a sandwich. Maybe it was because I went on a Friday or maybe it could be contributed to the time went into making it. None the less, waiting for food that long on a to-go order wasn't what I expected.

The owner was very friendly and even offered samples to those who did not know what gumbo.

If you're looking for a fancy Cajun restaurant this is not it. The decor was nothing to brag about. But if you want to impress your family and friends by taking them to a place with good down home cooking then definitely stop by and give them a try!Dunkin catfish was my fav but everything was good.We had been trying to get to Grady's for months and for some reason or another in never worked out...until this weekend.  We headed up there for some takeout on Friday night with a hankering for the BBQ.  

After finding the strip mall that it is in (note to those unfamiliar with the location, it's in the same strip mall as Pappy's, which has more conspicuous signage), we went inside, which was empty.  I counted a total of six chairs at two tables (not including the two chairs in the waiting area) so if you are planning to eat there, hopefully it is during a lull.  

Grady greeting us promptly and gave us a tour of the menu.  We put our meat orders in, and Grady when to the back to get it going.  While he did this, his wife (I assume) helped us as we chose our sides.  The brisket dinner I ordered came with one hot side and one cold side, but I wondered if I could get double hot (mac n' cheese) instead.  She told me no, which was kind of disappointing because the menu said something about accepting all reasonable requests.  I was later super surprised and happy when my brisket came out with double mac AND the cold side, potato salad, I had ordered.  Now that's some nice service!  

On to the food, it smelled and looked great.  I had the brisket (mild sauce), *double* mac n cheese and potato salad.  The wife had a pork sandwich and cole slaw.  She liked her food and commented that she would eat there again.  My food was good, the first couple bites of brisket seemed a little chewy, but after that all was good.  I liked the flavor of the potato salad as well, though my wife thought that it was store-made.  The leftovers were also good the day after as well.

The ranking above says 4 stars, but it is really 4.5 stars.  The service was super friendly and food was very good.  I will definitely be back.Our return to J&G was a triumph...! 

Thank you to Chris Wessling and his team, most especially, thank you to Renee and her table team for making our dining experience to wonderful. 

Fabulous describes the food attentive to every need describes the service! We enjoyed a "tasting" of several appetizers. The Butternut Squash soup was AMAZING! Not heavy and full of cream as most are, and the addition of a sliver of jalapeno pepper sliced through the squash to help clean the pallet. YUMM! Followed by the Crab Cake, yes a WONDERFUL, I hesitate to say 'cake' filled with Crab, yes, Crab not bread crumbs and filler, just Crab...so delicious. Last, but not even close to least, was the Warm Beet and Goat Cheese Salad. What a great combination. Even if you are not a beet freak like me, you'll LOVE this light ever so wintry salad. MMMMM 

Entrees were the Fillet Mignon done to perfection, NY Strip peppercorns ever so tasty served with Grilled Asparagus, and the famous Potato Gratin w/Comte. Wow some really good eating there! Steaks were absolutely PERFECT! The sides...well...just perfect as well. 

Dessert was the Carrot Cake, a personal favorite. Yes it was better than my grandmother's. So moist, tender, and just the right size for that after dinner sweet sensation on your tongue. 

All of this with a "To Die For" view of the Valley

We can't wait to go back....Renee, see you soon...!ok. . i don't really know how much this cost, but my coworkers and i definitely had to buy 4 bottles to even get in.  that said, after you get 4 bottles it's really easy to get in.  i don't really know why everyone reports that the people here are hot, because they look like the typical sleezy, slicked hair, sequined, orange skinned, just flew in from LA, crashing 6 to a room, vegas crowd.  that said, the abundance of stripper poles and outdoor access was welcomed.  *that* said, my friend got $1300 in chips stolen out of his jacket.  *that* said, he made the $1300 drunk at the awesome blackjack tables/bar/island in the middle of the swimming pool. *that* said, aforementioned blackjack tables/bar/island wasn't that fun cause it was raining.  *that* said, the staff kindly thought of us hours after we arrived and moved us indoors when a table opened up.  *that* said i was leered at all night by aforementioned creepy slicked hair vegas crowd.  *that* said, i got stuck by the thighs levitating on aforementioned stripper pole.  *that* said, i knocked over someone's drink as a dislodged myself ungracefully from stripper pole.  *that* said, the aforementioned kind staff didn't seem to mind.  *that* said, i would say overall i had a solid time.Okay, so like my friend Betty said (similarly), this place is hands down one of the best places to party in Vegas.  XS is by far the best party and best club I have EVER experienced.

The ambiance is a bit indescribable but lets just say its elegant, very grand, sexy and fun.  Hot babes (male and female) everywhere, and everyone was in good spirits -- just looking for a good time and a good time we had until closing time.

Yes, entrance is expensive -- on a fight night we paid around $50/$60 per guy and $20 per chick but it was soooooooooo worth it.  As for cost of drinks, its a high end club, cheap drinks won't be found here.

WARNING - the line is wrapped around the corner at opening time but it does move quickly.

A special note to the chicks who like to jump in the pool -- ummm... not so hot.4.5 stars 

this is the best night club i've ever been to in terms of venue.

As you can see from everyone else's photos the venue is HUGE, BEAUTIFUL, and AMAZINGLY well decorated!  As you walk into XS you automatically feel like you are VIP guest.  The pool, the lights, the cushions..everything is just jaw dropping.

Cover: 20 for ladies and 30 for men.  These prices are actually not that bad considering how nice the place is.  DOn't be fooled by the people on the street!  This one guy told us that we could use these passes that he gave us for both saturday and sunday...but when we got to the door saturday night, the bouncer told us we could only use the pass on sunday. =(

Music: this was one of the lamest aspects..they would always play blocks of different genres..techno, hip hop, oldies, etc.  Wasn't a huge fan of any genre besides the hip hop so waiting for another hip hop song seemed like an eternity

Drinks: another downside to the club...SUPER DUPER expensive..it was 16 for a tokyo tea! ahhh!Loved the atmosphere of this place. You can either sit outside where XS is (I wouldn't advise this if your reservation is late and the club is starting up..) or inside where you can look towards it. 
Staff is super nice and apologetic (they dropped my butter knife on me 2x. it's all good! shit happens!).
Really liked my food..Had the Hudson Valley Foie Gras w/ a pineapple financier. The pineapple financier was weak and forgettable but I love foie gras and it was seared beautifully. 
The bone in rib eye w/ chimichurri was very tender and tasty..
My dayboat scallops were also delicious but the potato cake underneath just tasted like a tiny hash brown. 

Still, it's an excellent steakhouse inside of Encore. So if you're craving protein while staying at Encore, make a rezzie for Botero!5 stars for service and 3 stars for food. 

I was here last night with about 20 other girls in our group for a promotional dinner thing that they called a Princess Party for Very Important Princesses. Lol. It was really cute because we all had tiaras waiting for us as we sat at our table. I was just there for the food because the whole princess thing is so not me, but I thought it was fun nonetheless.

The promotional dinner included a whole list of appetizers and a huge fish bowl of this delicious drink for all ten of us to share. It wasn't a very potent drink but it was really good. I have to find out what they put in it and try to make my own version at home.

The appetizers we tried included some sushi rolls, meatball and Kobe sliders, salad, fries and a few other things. The food was not bad, it was just okay. My favorite were the Kobe sliders, cooked perfectly with a pink center topped with cheese and caramelized onion on a sweet roll.

The service was excellent, they did a great job of making us ladies feel special and we all received a rose at the end of our dinner. It was kind of like one big bachelorette party. The whole restaurant was filled with ladies all decked out in their clubbing attire. I guess they do this on Wednesday nights and they take the girls to Surrender nightclub for some after dinner drinking and dancing. I'm not sure how they make money from these things but hey, I get to enjoy it so I don't think about it too much. Maybe its because of the fact that guys will show up anywhere theres a lot of hot young women.

All in all, everybody had a wonderful time. The restaurant is very beautiful and elegant with a lot of Botero's artwork throughout. To be honest with you, I didn't know anything about the namesake of the restaurant until I Yelped about it. Turns out I took a picture in front of a Botero piece once before, at the FS Hotel in Miami. I thought the sculpture in the middle of this restaurant looked familiar. Sculptures of plump, nekked women is definitely a Botero thing.Went here with my boyfriend for Valentine's Dinner. The menu was a special prix fixe for the occasion and was delectable.  The highlight was the chocolate mousse dessert. 

We enjoyed the sleek, modern decor and ambiance. It really set the mood for a relaxing and fun evening.

We will definitely be coming back to try their full menu.$3.95 NY steak and eggs with hash browns! from 12am - 6am only
It was a good steak for the price... sooo cheap! 
The mozarella sticks are kinda pricey and the red clam chowder was sour.

THIS PLACE IS WORTH A TRY FOR THE $3.95 STEAK! 
DEFINITELY WILL GO BACK TO TAKE MY PARENTS.It doesn't have the obligatory framed picture of the Thai royal family on the wall but I'm wiling to let it slide.  This menu offers a fresh take on the solid staples that we love.  I love the Pad Thai  here and not just because it is endorsed by Howard Seftel.Yuuuum!  A friend brought me here for breakfast and I loved it.  I love breakfast foods and it's nice to go to different places other than IHOP and places like that.  I had the chorizo scramble or something like that and it was delish!  My bf had the corned beef hash and it's REAL corned beef!  Not the canned kind!  Haha.  Oh and they have really really yummy banana nut bread that comes w/ the meals.This is one of my favorite breakfast spots in town. Everything I've tried here is delicious. You really can't go wrong. My favorite is the Bandito scramble: a mix of chorizo, jalapeno, and eggs, topped with sour cream and salsa.

Here's what separates Egg Works from the rest of the pack:

1. the potatoes.
I prefer potatoes over hash browns 9/10 times. I don't know what kind of seasoning they put on these things, but like Terry P. said, they're like crack.
2. coffee creamer.
I don't know if this is available at other places, but here they offer flavored creamer to go with your cup o' joe. I really appreciate this because I like my coffee "girlie".
3. the banana nut muffin.
Warm. Delicious. And that muffin top... Just go have one. 'Nuff said.Very nicely decorated restaurant. Service was great and food was overall good. 

We ordered: 
Miso cod - cooked to perfection, very flavorful w a bit of sweetness
Drunken noodles with beef - overrated. It give it 3 out of 5 stars. A little dry and the meat was a bit overcooked. 
Duck Curry - Never had duck cooked this well! It was juicy and the flavors of the curry was just the right amount of spicy. (ordered everything mild)I finally figured it out!!! All ala carte fine dining in LV is approximately the same price.  Therefore you may want to couple good food with atmosphere and Sinatra has great atmosphere and amenities.  From the generous leather backed chairs to the decorator tableclothes and polished cotton napkins the place makes you feel comfortable.  

The sommelier was polite and helpful and the wait staff very attentive.  The highlights of the meal included fabulous Osso Busco, carparccio, and Branzino.  

Could write more - but no need - as this place is no brainer - especially for those staying at the Encore or Wynn.

Trust me you will be happy.We have eaten here 3 times and had great experiences every time! the oysters were very good...ceasar salad was excellant ... very crisp lettuce fresh crunchy croutons (does it get any better) BEST DISH THEY MAKE .....Signature House Pan Roast both times which includes all 3 of the seafood choices-shrimp, lobster & crab (small tip: get it over linguini MUCH better than the regualr rice it comes with) You can thank me later!!! 

Also had a $50 worth of seafood for $25 coupon from weluvlocals !!! Cant wait till they offer it again!!!!!One of our fellow yelpers Rickilane had recommended this place to me a while back and I have been meaning to check it out. So the time finally came to do so and the place was empty... Not just saying it had one or two people in it... We walked in and were greeted very quickly and seated. 

I was expecting the $13.95 4 course dinner in which Rickilane had mentioned and guess what; not only did they have it, it was $12.95. I went ahead and ordered my food For my appetizer i ordered the Galanga Rolls and the wife ordered the Chicken Satay. For our soup or salad I ordered the spicy chicken soup and she ordered a salad and for the main dish I ordered the amazing Chicken Pad Thai, Rebecca ordered the Beef Pad Thai and for desert we had the sticky sweet rice with ice cream and the coconut rice pudding... 

Okay so now that your mouth is watering and you are grabbing your keys to head to Galanga, let me point out the not so mouth watering details..... Unfortunately the service is very very slow we finished the appetizer and sat for a while waiting for our soup and salad and the same thing happened course after course, eat sit wait and then start again. The quality of the food makes up partially for the service and I would love to see this place get a few servers and maybe another cook or something and really bring this place to life..Always very friendly staff. Lots of kitties for adopting - check them out! This is a pretty active Petsmart between the groomer and dog training. Great location to kill time if you're wating for an appointment too.I spotted this Petsmart on the way to a Yelp event at Don and Charlie's.  I need to get a new water dispenser for my 3 monsters.  This location is clean, neat, and nice.  The staff is super friendly.  I was greeted immediately walking in.  

I did not find the water dispenser I wanted but I did find peanut butter flavor rawhide treats on sales for my fuzzy kids.  

This location has a PetsHotel.  It is so cute, like checking in at a real hotel.  =)Great Wok was delicious!! The staff was friendly. I will return.I have been here several more times, I guess it is time for a re-review.  The food has improved and the service too...  This family owned place looks like it is doing good!!

Soy milk - YUM

Fried egg rolls - Every good!

Bun Thit Nuong - the grilled pork was good, the noodles were just right, and the fish sauce added made it very good.Went here shortly after opening on a Tuesday afternoon.

To be honest, I was a little reserved about dining somewhere that only served one type of food, however, you have to think that if a place serves one thing, they should be able to do it well, right? Well, The Cornish Pasty Company does it well.

The pastys were light and flaky, the fillings abundant and tasty. The food, as simple as it was, was done well and I'd definitely do it again. The atmosphere definitely chimes in to the british pub feel and the church pews totally add to the ambiance of the restaurant as a whole.

My only issue was that the prices did seem just a tad high for what you receive. The pastys do not come with any kind of side dish aside from a dipping sauce that's paired with each individual offering. With each pasty averaging about $9-10, it's a bit much.I'm only basing my review on the general hotel and casino since I didn't have a room here... this place is really swanky and nice now that they've done the renovations in the past couple of years. I really like the brightness and tropical feeling... the place really does have an old Vegas meets Cuba feel to it without being too cheesy.I learned about this place through my belly dancing teacher, and have been to this one and the one in mesa. The place is nice clean with lots of cool art the service is great if not a little hippie like.  I usually always get hummus some of the best hummus i have had. I would suggest not you get the hummus with ahi tuna cause when i had some i was not very good just stick to the basic. If you are tight on cash you can walk in and get a gyro for 7 bucks and it will fill you up. the portions are a pretty good size and the food is amazing! I will say the reason it got a 4 star was it is always really loud when we go. you cant hear the person sitting across from you cause its just so loud so if you are looking for a romantic quit place this is not it.Great burritos. Good price. I usually go here for lunch but that is not to say the breakfast burritos aren't delicious. Added bonus: they have those little machines you put a quarter in and get a piece of jewelry. Now I have an awesome double heart ring that turns my finger green!I was expecting more of a fast food joint. But I was pleasantly surprised. I had the mahi mahi with pita chips and all though the food was well prepared , I think the fish could have been more fresh, it wasn't bad but I definitely had fresher fish around here.I had the hummus sampler and the glazed chicken pizza. I split it with another person and it was delicious. The atmosphere was good, we ate at the bar and the place was fairly busy at lunchtime. I'll go back again.This location has the self-service postage machine!! So who needs workers when you can do it yourself!Tigerlily ? One of those bars or restaurants that would not look out of place in Sex & the City.  That is a place for girls, right?  Right.. and wrong. 

The place is opulent, pretentious and selectively fashionable - what does that mean to a guy like I visiting? It means I fit right in. The grand marble entry with the bar that screams "PINK CHAMPERS HERE!" but actually has Asahi on draft too. And a decent selection of Vodkas. (their default for a vodka mixer is Stolichnaya) 

Free Wifi is a given.

The 'vestibule' or 'antechamber'  is furnished with thick pile rugs, blue Salvador Dali-esque sofas and armchairs and 'Sleeper' wooden salon tables. And Fluffy Pink Scatter Pillows. - you know what ?! it works and they are surprisingly comfortable.
The music was a pleasant, modern mix and not played too loud, but prominently. We were able to hold a normal conversation.

We used a voucher for a Mediterranean Meat & Cheese platter with a glass of wine each. 
We got 3 Spanish cheeses, some Spanish ham and hot chorizo sausages and it was lovely (we even ordered some extra) 

The service was friendly, warm and attentive. We vowed to return.8/6/2011

Okay so it wasn't like I planned to go to this TGI Friday's.  We actually went to Gold Coast to enjoy some frugal eats (Steak and Eggs @ the cafe).  It shows how long its been since I've ventured the Gold Coast.  That cafe is long gone and has been replaced by an all too familiar chain.  

Pros:
  Open Late
  Happy hour until 4 am... SCORE !
  Friendly staff (especially the bartender...we sat at the bar)
  You can still enjoy steak and eggs!

Cons:
  You must sit at the bar for the happy hour.  (this is not really a con for me, but it could be for others so i figured I'd mention it).
  Irish Car Bombs are nearly $9.00 a pop!  
  Steak and Eggs for $2.99?  Dream on... more like $13.99!  Funk that!

Verdict:
  Overall, I'd recommend this place.  You really can't go wrong with TGIFridays.  They have a good happy hour (though the old happy hour at TGIFridays was way more bomb!) with cheap drinks and appetizers for $6.
The only thing that could really mess this up is bad service.  I didn't get any of that here.  The bartender actually comped my friend's appetizer since it was his birthday.  That's pretty awesome if you ask me!  That definitely beats having a group of servers gathering to sing you an unsynchronized version of the happy birthday song.  I'd give this location a 5 stars if they offered a steak and egg special for $2.99.  Aside from that though, I'm a fan.  Late night (or early morning..whichever) eats for cheap while intoxicated... I'm easy to please.  If you are anything like me, you won't be disappointed.

Tips:
  Stay away from the drinks not on the happy hour, they'll cost your more than your wings.

  Speaking of wings, try the traditional Jack Daniels BBQ wings.  YUM!

  Sit at the  bar and avoid the line if any.  Plus you get happy hour prices!

  Stay away from their Port Sausage.. doesn't taste good at all.  If you want some Port Sausage, go to a local island joint =)Ok I have said it before and I will say it again, I will go almost anywhere that sends me a coupon! Such is the case with TGI Friday's. The place is a little dark, but the food is very good for what it is and the staff very nice. So I say sign up on their web site for the loyalty program and give it a try, don't be so snobby. Live it up, you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!I walked over to our table with a few flavors of ice cream to sample, and when my mom tasted the pumpkin pie flavor, she asked, "What kind of frozen dessert is this? I mean, I know it's pumpkin pie... but what is it?" Basically, it's just much fluffier and thicker than standard ice cream, almost like a thick mousse, to the point where it's more of a tangent off of ice cream than anything Haagen-Daaz or Breyer's would recognize. I'd say that's a pretty good thing, though. 

Truthfully, the ice creams weren't flavorful enough for me... But holy hell, the lavosh pizza was above and beyond the pinnacle my most flavorful fantasies. Garlic, caramelized onions, chevre, arugula, crispy, nutty, heavenly.. again, nothing Domino's or Papa John's would recognize, but that's definitely a good thing.

Consensus? If you have some sort of ice cream deficiency, order it. Otherwise, just order between seven and twelve pizzas and call it a day. A really freakin' good day.A little smokey for my taste but over all the lodge is a good local option. The food is always good. I love the Colorado chicken wrap. I also love the huge beers and strong drinks. The staff is really nice an most are pretty easy on the eyes.I am a big fan of Peruvian food.  My description of it would be Asian/Latin fusion - both of which I love. Our group started off with ceviche (little chunks of white fish marinated in lime sauce), Choros a la Criolla (mussels), and Tiradito (carpaccio style fish in lime sauce).  All of it was really delicious.  I just love the lime sauce with the fresh seafood.  As my friend stated, she could just eat the ceviche all day long every day - and it's healthy!

I ordered the beef tallarin saltado - which is this noodle dish.  At Mi Peru, the noodles are like spaghetti noodles, but it's tossed with tomatoes, beef, onions, and this very light and flavorful brown sauce. It's my favorite Peruvian dish, but I prefer it from Little Dumplings on Eastern.  I usually order the Chauffa special (combination fried rice) but I was just too full already from the apps that I decided to skip it.

Both the service and food are stellar so I am always confused as to why it's so dead every time I go.  Someone said maybe they need to market better.  Either way, I highly recommend to anyone to give it a try because Peruvian is the BOMB!

Though I like the food from Little Dumplings just a little bit more, Mi Peru definitely wins in the decor, service and ambiance section.  The restaurant is very cute and romantic.  This would be a great date spot.  They also serve alchohol, which I don't think Little Dumplings does.We love to eat here when there's a game we want to watch. The service is great. Blue 32 has a menu that my wife and I both enjoy. Killer, High Def TVs are everywhere inside the restaurant.I love Macy's and always have!

You can beat a good Macy's clearance.......period. Move over Kohls, when Macy's is having a sale you simply can't beat the price and quality of the items that you find.

The INC line is my favorite and it is VERY closely followed by the great selection of Coach products that they carry. I have never seen so much Coach on sale as I have at seen at this location.

I am a new fan of the Martha Stewart home stuff that Macy's carries! Nice high quality bake ware and bedding!

Staff is friendly and helpful and the store doesn't seem to ever be over crowded. I also love the Starbucks Coffee Shop that they have at this location!

Only thing I could say is a con to this particular location is that their women's clothing department is lacking. Since the store is smaller than the other nearby locations they obviously can't hold as much. Even still, I still find that I frequent this location more than any other.First time visiting the other day.  Good service, awesome wings and rings, and lots of tv's.  I was on lunch break at work so I couldn't drink or let loose, but overall a good bang for your buck. Didn't receive any attitude when we used a coupon either.When ever you mention "the Vine" people auto matically assume you are talking about "the wings".People have told me "the best wings in arizona"  I can tell you they also have a exceptional hamburger. The menu offers all kinds of cheeseburger choices, I would personally suggest the fries as the side dish, but the coleslaw is also good.
The place is some what of a "sports bar" with tvs all over, I see a lot of small groups watching different games.
What I really like is that the place is large enough that you can always get a booth "away from the noise", LOL. 
I do notice that it is "family friendly" which I really like. 
I notice that phoenix metro transport has stops on both the n/s and e/w routes running through the corner.
Definitely  would recommendSave your $$ and don't valet - huge self-parking lot to the east!

Love this venue - it seems to always be packed, which is a good sign. They had a live band on Friday night which was fun. Seating/tables are scarce - I suggest coming a little early - or make friends w/ppl who already have a table.

Drinks are a bit pricy, IMO. I mean $36 for a dbl Gray Goose/Cran and Cosmo?? Plus I threw in $3 for a tip - that's $40!!!! Jeez

Bathrooms are also clean - this is very important to me. They may want to think about getting better signage for restrooms - maybe it's just me, but I felt it was a small treasure hunt finding the place.The visit on this past Saturday night was worth it just to hear a band with an actual horn section.

You don't hear horn sections with lounge acts in Phoenix. Amazing! It was like I was at the Dunes in Vegas in 1969. 

There are uniforms in use by not only the servers but also the patrons. Women are required to wear enough eye-makeup to cause them to resemble raccoons from a distance. Something resembling prom wear is also required. Men are to wear fitted dress shirts worn with the tails out and slightly-flared designer jeans with embroidery of some kind.

These are the uniforms required for the flirting activity, which to the outside observer resembles groups of women chattering with each other while men stand alone while holding drinks and looking "hard" and not talking to anyone.  Apparently, at some time in the past these maneuvers have resulted in the occasional successful sexual encounter, but perhaps not since its practitioners were in high school.Ok, this place fucking rocks.  
That said...really, it's so awesome.  The staff is incredibly friendly.  The manager struck up a conversation with my mom and I that must have lasted 15 minutes; it was great. 
 
The Kitchen reminds me of a mash up of Whole Paycheck, Wholesome Choice (in OC) and Nugget (in Sacramento area), but a scaled down version, plus a wine bar/ bistro.  I mean really, doesn't that sound like heaven?

Loves it.Maybe it's because I lived in Hawaii for so many years and was deprived of all the Olive Garden goodness there is, or maybe it's just because I love me some Italian-esque food -- but I'm a big fan of the Olive Garden. Each time I've visited this location, I've had excellent service, was served quickly, and thoroughly enjoyed my meal. Wine sample? Don't mind if I do. Buy-one-entree-for-dinner-and-get-another-one-for-lunch-tomorrow? Yes, please. And don't even get me started on their soup, salad, and breadsticks - YUM YUM in my tum. 

If you haven't visited an Olive Garden, stop reading right now, get up, and go get yourself some delicious eats. The end.I've visited Tibet Foot Massage a couple of times now, and figured it was a good time to finally review it. 

Both times I had Rex, and he was always polite, accomodating, and best of all, a GREAT masseuse. As with some of the other massage spots on Spring Mtn, there is always quite a bit of background noise to accompany the instrumental music playing in the background (i.e the masseuse taking a cell phone call or getting up in the middle of my massage to talk to a guest who's just walked in). I've learned to deal with that after many massages on Spring Mtn. I just tuned it out and focused on being calm and relaxed. 

It's not your 4-star establishment but for the price and the quality of massage you receive, it's definitely worth it. I'm moving out of Vegas and I'll surely miss it!I live walking distance from Scramble and let me tell you, that is a scary thought. I eat there way too often. I love their breakfast burritos because their hearty and flavorful unlike the run of the mill kind at other places. I've also gotten the breakfast pizza and a turkey club. Both were good, but the Costa breakfast burrito is still my favorite. The ambience is so relaxing and the staff is always friendly. Only problem that took a whole star off is the price. Being a broke college kid, I wish they had some items that were a bit more affordable. But nonetheless, I still love this place. Definitely a great place to stop after hiking North Mountain.Love the rolls. Have to try the tepan soon.Stumbled upon this place while trying a find another store in the area.  Oh my-- HUGE smile on my face when i walked in!  This store is an upgraded Ben Franklin.  Picked up more scrapbook stuff to add to my collection.  Love the fabric section!  So much more prints to choose from vs the stores at home.  I will definitely go back to this store when I'm in vegas again.  Thank you to the lady behind the fabric counter who gave me coupons.During my stay at Mandalay Bay, I received a coupon for a free facial so I thought.. why not? Scheduling an appointment with them was fairly easy as they were quite flexible. 

Upon entering the store, I was greeted immediately by a staff member offering to try out the samples of lotion bars. Now if you've never been here, everything is handmade from organic products. And they exude such a beautiful fragrance! (Well, most of them anyway.) The only con about that is, being that they are organic, they do expire faster than normal products. Think wisely when they ask you the amount you want to purchase!

The employees are great with suggestions if you need advice on improving your skin. They were even nice enough to give me samples of the products they used on me!

One thing that I thought was really neat is that the designer of that specific product will have their face on it! (Unless they have a scary face :X)I really really like this place, I haven't tried all of their products but their bath bombs are truly amazing! You have to try Big Blue it is the best one I've tried so far and it make my bathroom smell wonderful for 3 days!I eat here once and it burns down in a fire the very next day.  My hunt for good burgers in Waterloo/Kitchener/Guelph continues...  *sigh*

(Seriously, I hope they rebuild.  I want to go back.)Really good hawaiian bbq place! Love the meats it seems much more fresh than any other fast food hawaiian places. Order the Mix plate or the Chicken Katsu. Everything seems much more fresh and less commercialized. They also have good ramen soup and their musabi are really good.. good prcies too.. They have daily specials each day check it out! I highly recommend this place.I ordered the vegetable pad thai with tofu.  I asked for extra peanuts and green onion but didn't see any, it probably sounded like I said No peanuts or green onion.  It was good even without, though it wasn't the best I've had, it was still good.  I liked the amount of vegetable and noodle.  I was most impressed with the tofu.  I don't like when I get tofu thats fried so much it has a weird texture, almost dry yet chewy in a bad way and the inside is almost hollow.  Sakun's tofu had a slightly crispy outside and still looked and tasted like good tofu.This was an unexpected happy surprise.  Their portions are large and could feed two people, or one hungry krystal.

My co-workers had the green curry and panang curry, both veg with tofu and they said it was great.  

I'm not sure if I'll have the pad thai again, but I would like to try the curry.  I will definitely come back here.In Vegas I stayed at Caesar's so I had to walk around the Forum Shops a little bit. It was there that I saw and was immediately drawn to this place. They have so much history in there. They have all kinds of autographed movie and music memorabilia. They have pieces of history that are priceless. I really enjoyed this shop and everything it had to offer. I bought a couple of cool souvenirs from this place. The sales people were not at all pushy and really just let you look around and take everything in. Most of the items here cost thousands of dollars so it could be an opportunity to try and push a sale on you but they seemed to understand the fact that most people are probably just looking. I saw some big ticket items that caught my eye and I will more likely than not order one I just cannot decide which one. An investment that size I want to make the most profitable choice. I still had a great time shopping there and looking around though. When I was ready to leave the cashier was nice and polite and got me on my way. It was a pretty normal experience though, nothing remarkable.  I will be back for sure.I can't speak to any of the post-breakfast food here but the breakfast is definitely very good for the money.

Is it any serious gourmet s*%t? Heck no. It's a nice big, hot breakfast for a very reasonable price. The staff is very friendly as well, especially to groups. No grumbling about multiple checks, seating, anything like that. 

Try it out!We stayed in a corner suite which had a nice view out of the bedroom as well as the den. My favorite was the large tub with floor to ceiling windows. It is situated so you can relax and enjoy the incredible view below. The shower is large enough for 5 people. One cool touch were the buttons which control the shades. The service wasn't bad, but I have had better. I would stay here again. 
One disapointment was the buffet. The last time we ate here it was superb. This most recent time the food wasn't as good and they didn't offer as many choices. There was also a cocktail waitress with a bad attitude, but most were polite and quick to serve.I wish I could stay at this hotel everytime I visited Vegas. 

Positives:
Clean
New
Pretty
Aesthetically Pleasing
Smells Nice
Lots of Machines
Beautiful Room
Bathroom= All glass
Friendly staff

Negatives
Someone can watch you drop a deuce.. unless you drop the curtain down (It can be a positive if you want it to be.. if you're into that kind of stuff)
Financial drain on this poor student's wallet

That's about all! I love everything about this place. What's not to love about Vegas? Except for the hookers. But they're not that bad.This review is for how those of us mere mortals do it.  Which means, no twenty dollar tricks, no upgrades, no casino comps...just flat-out booking it myself, albeit through Priceline.  I do love a deal, and I did indeed get a good one.  Won this 5-star for just $85 per night for two nights.  That was just ten dollars a night more than I paid for a 3-star in Boise the night before. Just sayin'.

   LOVES:  Location!  Center strip, convenient  tram to Monte Carlo and Bellagio.  Love being in the shiny new City Center.

   Loved the room!  Having booked via a pre-paid site, I didn't expect suite miracles or incredible views.  What we got was a great 5-star quality 4th floor room.  It was clean and comfy and just plain nice-as-heck.  Certainly nicer than where we live, so we're all about appreciating it!

  QUIET...never heard neighbors...then again, maybe they were all on the higher floors with posh views and suites.  Who knows? We were quite happy with our mere mortal room.  Rest assured that if you are of the higher mortal category,  they offer different elevator bays for those staying on differing floors.  You will be whisked up quickly to your appropriate level.  We were a-ok with ours.

  Here are my reasons for not giving Aria 5-stars...when we checked in we were proudly told about the "free internet"...We were told how easy it was to access it.  What we weren't told was that they charge a $28 a day resort fee.  I am certainly not a resort-fee virgin, but I have never encountered one before that was more than $15 per day.  Usually the purpose of the fee is to cover internet.  Well, for that kind of money, I would expect it to work like a charm and it did not.  That being said, we weren't exactly hanging around the room bemoaning our lack of internet access.  Of course we were out and about...but it's kinda the principle of the thing, ya know? How about just charging $28 more per night up front?  

  That and I'm not a fan of the casino.  Blackjack...not Bellagio level.  Plus this is the only casino we've EVER been in where a slot machine jammed.  Husband was playing and it totally stuck.  It took forever before we could find help to get it unstuck.  Here we were at 4:00 or so on a Monday afternoon and the guy who helped us indicated that the machine was "full".  That they cleared it out in the middle of the night.  Well, by golly that is one machine you don't want to play if it never gives up anything, huh?

   One last minor reason for less than five stars was checking out.  We couldn't get it to work on our tv.  Luckily they weren't too busy at the front desk, but the gal we had checking us out was not very friendly. Left a last not-so-great goodbye.

   All-in-all however, we would go back in a heartbeat.  Where else in this country (world) can you stay in a hotel of this caliber for this kind of money?  sigh, love Vegas!We got a pretty good deal to stay in a 800 sq feet room, so we went for it   We wanted something nice for our anniversary, so we were willing to spend a tad more money... The room was really nice... it was clean, the shades were all automatic.. we had a 270 degree view of the outside... We didn't want to valet so we parked at Aria and walked over... they also have a tram that stops in Aria/Monte Carlo, Aria/Crystals, and Bellagio/Vdara.... I thought that was cool.. There is no smoking in the room, and there is no gambling either.. Upon entering there is a very strong perfume smell... Our fridge had a ice maker so we didn't need to go out to get ice.. which I thought was really great... We had 2 sinks, and the bathtub was big enough for 2 people to fit..

Now for the bad.. our room wasn't cleaned... no one came until around 4 pm to ask.  We left around 9 am and didn't return until 3:30 and everything was still messy... I was a little disappointed that housekeeping didn't come earlier..  I'd expect it too by cleaned for the price we paid.  

Overall, I don't know if we'd return.Vdara is a nice and clean hotel.  I give it 4 stars since the rooms and room service is good.  But 3 stars on everything else.  First off there is no gaming so there is nothing here to do.  They have 1 market that is really expensive.  $5 for powerade, $3 water.  It's best you get these things before you come here.  They have 1 bar.  There is really nothing here.  It gets pretty boring and to go to something you have to walk to Aria.  I tried walking to Cosmopolitan and that took forever... next time I'll just take a cab.  LOL.My Boyfriend and I stayed Vdara for 5 days in our Christmas. We had gorgeous room, phenomenal view from our room, clean and neat everything by 3days but last day of night, when we come back to our room was not clean well. It was too bad because almost perfect amazing night we could spent.The only things that kept me from giving this a five star were as follow:

*Very confusing to know where to park?  There is no self park unless you want to park at the ARIA which is very far away from the hotel if you are hauling luggage.  They do have valet which we don't mind.  We love valet but I know not everyone does.  To get to Valet is confusing too. Go into the CRystals entrance not the ARIA.  You would have to drive in a circle.  For first timers... its confusing.  The second time not so much.  
  
*The pool is small compare to other pools in Vegas.  It was kind of overcrowded and I think it was because of the size.  More like family oriented instead of party crowd.  

*Our fridge wouldn't cool.  That sucked we complained about that but they didn't really fix it. 

*The bed was too firm.  I was kind of dissapointed in this because the ARIA beds are the best that I ever slept in.  My husband said it was the same but I don't think it was.

*The front desk told us our resort fee was "taken care of."  When I hear that I think they aren't going to charge us for it but to our suprise they did... $25 each night.


Now... things that were GREAT at the VDARA.

*The smell. As soon as you walk in there is such a pleasant smell.  I love it!

*The room.  We paid $75/night in priceline for a couple of weekday nights.  It was a great suite.  The view was awesome (Belagio side... we could see the fountains).   It was clean, it was modern, two flat screens. Perfect. 

*The service was awesome as soon as we called for something they would be right up and then followed up with a phone call.  Hardly any wait too. 

*The Gym... great.  I loved their elliptical machine and they had clean towels and water ready at the machine.  


I would recommend the VDARA and I will stay there again.We loved our stay here!  The rooms were modern, new and well kept as was the entire hotel.  The staff were awesome - very friendly, helpful and pleasant.  The location is, in our opinion, one of the best in Vegas - easy access to most everything.  The pool gets pretty murky by mid-afternoon but I suppose that's to be expected with all of the suncreen and sweat (ewwww ;) and I'm sure most other places have the same problem.  The cafe charges an astronomiocal $19 for bacon and eggs, but the other deli and snack items are reasonably priced.  We loved the relative quiet (besides all the kids at the pool) and the non-smoking.  So close to Bellagio, just talk a stroll over there for a more reasonably priced breakfast :)I definitely recommend this place for an afternoon or early evening happy hour affair. They serve half priced flavorful tapas and $2 off beer and wine from 3pm-6pm. You can definitely fill up on food and drink for a very reasonable price if you take advantage of the happy hour!  I highly recommend their duck tacos and Japanese chicken meatballs...very tasty! They also offer a delicious gluten-free pizza with a variety of toppings to choose from if you so desire. The service is always good but occasionally it can be slow if they're busy.  Other than that, there's no other complaints that I think of???Read the reviews and figured I would treat the hot wife to something special. The waiting room is serene and pleasant. Very welcoming. 

The rooms are quiet and inviting for the experience to come. Soft lighting and music set the mood. 

Carol did a fabulous job. Paid attention to my wifes neck and back and shoulders. The foot work was outstanding. Overall it was a fantastic experience!Now i have been reading some of the reviews and i have had nothing but pleasant experiences at this location. There are some fresh & easy locations with freshness issues and packaging issues, but i have not experienced that at this location. It has plenty of parking despite the fact it is located in a strip mall...and it is also fairly easy to get in and out of the store despite the fact that is at the corner of Shea Blvd and Scottsdale Rd. The prices are about the same for the specials and other general food items but if your in the neighborhood this is a great fresh and easy to visit.This is a good ballpark. I noticed quite a few things that I like about it and very little negative marks. The one negative, however really sucks.

They charge for parking, lets get that out in the open. I don't go to many spring training games, but I do know that I've been to games at Maryvale, Surprise, and Muni and have never paid for parking. Hell, to Muni I can ride the train which is great. Getting out of the parking lot is a pain in the ass. The game I went to had attendance of 4,000 and it took us 15 minutes to get out of the lot. We had a few encounters with westside trash on the way driving their lifted trucks trying to cut in line and use the size of the vehicle to intimidate me into letting them have their way. It didn't work. White trash, stop breeding, please. The stupid baseball sculpture outside invokes the emotion "WTF IS THAT?!" I truly hated it.

Everyone we encountered at the park was very nice, especially in contrast to Surprise which employed some of the rudest and most gruff old men I'd ever come across. At least Goodyear had people welcoming and wishing a safe trip home. It shows they really want your business and want you to come back again. I like that. Most of the seats are in the shade, especially on the 3rd base side in the second half of the game. It seems the design has all the right seats in all the right places. They also have a great amount of lawn seating in the outfield. There truly isn't a bad seat in the place. 

If they get the parking under control, I'll be able to say this is probably the best place to watch a game in the Cactus League. For now though, I still like Maryvale for it's intimacy a little better. I posted a few pictures as well, hope you like them.One of our few "chain" establishments we go to once in a while...

we always love their paradise passion iced tea and they have a pretty addicting bread basket.....Lately they've added small plates/tapas to their already huge and sometimes confusing menu, and their beet salad was pretty good.

One thing you'd never think would end up on a Cheesecake Factory Menu would be asian steamed bun sandwiches which they have renamed "Vietnamese Tacos" and Indian fry bread which they call "The Navajo"
We ordered both items since we wanted to try their newer items and stay away from the usual burger or salad.

Both these items were quite tasty and the steamed bun"tacos" are exactly the kind that Bachi Burger serves up, but the difference is that you get 3 steamed buns at half the price of what Bachi Burger charges, and they serve 2 per order

The indian fry bread was bomb too. My wife made a good choice and she enjoyed it as well. After chowing down on their Chicken Bellagio special and
sharing a banana cheesecake for dessert, we were happy campers....ALOHA!!!I love this show. Worth a stop every time I come here.This is a MUST stop for when you are in Vegas and walking the strip! They have various shows throughout the day. It's free so there really is no reason not to stop and take it all in. 

Yes, it is featured in various movies and yes, it's as cool as you see on the screen. A true water show paired with a great soundtrack, you are bound to smile and "oooo" and "ahhhh" a few times throughout. It's really grand while you are taking it all in.

Do yourself a favor and def see it at night at least once when it's all lit up, it's a completely different experience than it is in the daytime. ENJOY!The M Buffet should be called the mmmmmmm Buffet! Its so yummy here. This is one of my favorite buffets in Las Vegas. The food is always consistent and tasty. They have over 200 items ranging from Thia curry's to Oxtale soup, to Mediterranean salads to prime rib. 

They also have all you can drink wine and beers and have a special "draft" root beer. Its really good. The only bummer is you have to go up and get these drinks yourself. All other drinks will be brought to the table by your waitress.

The buffet is a bit above average pricing ($22.99 dinner and $14,99 lunch) and you will most likely have to wait during busy hours (at least an hour or so).) But, you can always do squats in line and earn your dinner! I mean, thats how I roll willout rolling out of there!

They also have a pretty awesome dessert section and the gelato is made fresh every day. I have to say that do make a mean cheesecake too. I'm not saying I am a cheesecake expert - but I kind of am. LOL.

All in all a solid place to eat dinner with enough choices not to leave disappointed.  The service was great and the food was even better.I like buffets.  I try to eat right for the most part so a buffet has become a much rarer thing for me but I still like them quite a bit.  I really do think this is the best out of the nine or so that I have tried in Las Vegas.  I think the best time to go would be on a Saturday and Sunday for brunch.  They have pretty great breakfast food, an omelet station, and as I'm sure others have mentioned, complimentary alcohol.  I really do think the food has a good quality to it, unlike many other buffets.  I like the idea of the pre-made salads rather than a salad bar.  The desserts are pretty spectacular for a buffet and there is a wide variety of them to choose from.  My wife is a big, big fan of the Bananas Foster/Crepe dessert and so am I.  They have raised their prices since I first went when they opened and the last two times they didn't even allow us to use our players card for $2 off.  Other than that, it's well worth it and this is the only buffet I go to.By far one of the better buffets in Vegas. If only it wasn't so far from the strip T_T

The food selection was amazing and alcohol (i.e. light beer, cider, wine, champagne, etc.) is included in the meal price. At $33.99 for lunch it was the typical buffet price, I wish I could have stayed long enough to see how dinner was.

The wait staff is courteous and attentive. Bringing condiments and crab leg openers to the table as we got seated. 

Definitely going to try to make it out here on my next Vegas trip.

Potential Pro Tip: If you're in a larger group and staying on the strip without transportation, forget taxis and opt for a limo since they'll charge for 1hr and it'll get you to the buffet for a flat rate :) Totally trying this next time hahaRather short line but long wait, busy place.

I just search for buffet restaurants inn Las Vegas and Studio B did not show up.  So I did the search for Henderson, NV (the actual location) and it still didn't display.  Whatever.

We got there at 6pm on the Tuesday after the Memorial Day holiday.  The non-priority queue was just two segments of the maze but it took 45 minutes until we were seated.  I'm not an experienced L.V. buffet goer, but this seemed nearly intolerably slow.  It would have probably been less than 10 minutes in the priority line.

Their system for seating people seemed very primitive/inefficient.  There were a few vacant tables and a computerized table tracking/management system would have helped make the line move more quickly.  Such a system must exist.  It should be less complex than the systems used by waiters submit orders and produce checks in restaurants with menus.  We were passing through and fortunately had six hours before our flight out.

The food mostly seemed to be of good quality and fresh.  If you think something isn't so great, there is so much else to choose from.  I especially liked the ox tail soup.  It is a bit of work.  The meat is still attached to the bone.  I suggest putting the meat on a plate to remove the morsels of meat from the bone and then putting the meat back into the delicious broth.

I almost never give much credence to dessert offerings.  But, I make a big exception here.  I was planning on my normal fresh fruit for a light dessert.  Then I walked by the very long dessert buffet.  It wasn't just the huge selection, but that most were served in quite small portions.  You could sample a half dozen different things without feeling like a glutton and over stuffing your stomach.  Still you need a modicum of restraint not to over indulge.  I like variety with quality in a buffet and don't go for quantity as many do.

The free beer, wine, and hard cider make this probably the best value in town.  The wholesale price of wine and beer doesn't mean that it costs them a lot but it is quite a savings over normal highly inflated by the glass or bottle in a restaurant price.  The retail price of the wine they serve usually sells for about $12 for a 1.5 liter bottle.  The red wine was quite drinkable.  I didn't try the white wine because it is chardonnay and I don't like the excessive woodyness of most domestic chardonnays.  

The location was fine for us since we were just passing through and I didn't want to have to deal with a possible traffic jam around the Strip.

Overall though, my memory from six years ago at Le Village Buffet in Paris, Las Vegas is more favorable.  Not considering the difference in food, I don't remember the noise level at Le Village to be as high as that at Studio B.  Some may like the "high energy" of Studio B but it almost seemed like a relief when we left the restaurant and walked onto the casino floor!  Probably would chance Le Village when years later I'm in or passing through Vegas.  I just find the incessant audio and visual assault on my senses to be very unpleasant.My friends and I decided to meet up here to grab breakfast/brunch as the first thing we did in Vegas for that weekend. I didn't realize it was so far away from the strip until we got there. :P

The only reason I'd come back is because the buffet also includes wine and champagne. Unlimited champagne and juices = bottomless mimosas. Bottomless mimosas in my book is always a good thing. 

The food could be better, but it wasn't horrible. They have the standard food selections and none of them were amazing.My boyfriend had a conference for work here at the M Resort. It was Wednesday-Saturday and I tagged along. The room was amazing. The beds were comfortable and everything looked new and clean.

 The bathroom was LARGE with double sinks, a large soaking tub with a window view into the rest of the room/looking out at our view of the pool and in the distance-the Strip, a large shower with bench seat and even a t.v. screen built in to the vanity mirror!! I could watch t.v while putting on my make-up or doing my hair which was a nice perk. 

Restaurant food in the Resort was delicious!

The gym was fancy! Not your typical hotel gym with a few machines. Looks like they took the time to make it nice (you have to pay to use it but if you are needing a workout while on vacation it will be worth the money).


Parking was free, albeit they didn't have a place for you to pull up to the front lobby and unload. That was reserved for Limos/Taxis and Valet only. So if you self park, you have to carry your luggage through the Casino to get to the guest room elevators. But hey, it was free so I'd take that over having to pay for resort parking at $10/day like other places I've been to. 

Now, the only reason I am giving this place a 4 instead of a 5 is because they have a ridiculous schedule for their pool. It is seasonal only--so forget about swimming or using the hot tub if you visit in the off season. It's Vegas---tourist town. People like to swim, sit in the hot tub on their vacation!! It is also only open from 10am-6pm during the open season!!! The pool itself is great. It has a perimeter of shallow calf-deep water where they have lounge chairs in the water. Then the rest of the pool is only 4-5 ft deep. Perfect for cooling off when the weather is hot. Plenty of lounge chairs outside the pool and they have cabanas to rent and awesome pool side food and beverage service. Free ice water if you don't want to drink alcohol but want to stay hydrated. So it sucks if you are in a business meeting all day and then want to relax in the pool in the evening, like my boyfriend. It is 90 degrees at 6pm and they close the pool. It doesn't make sense that a resort in the desert would close their pool when the sun is still out and the temperature is hot!

Overall I had a great time and I would defintely stay there again.The BF and I headed over to try this coffee place this morning as part of the (extreme) coffee tour of Phoenix!! (f.t.w.). This place is super cute. It is in an old house of sorts and is very homey on the inside. It also has a beautiful garden/ seating area outside that would be very nice to sit in (if it weren't so hot out, anyway). So we were greeted by the relatively friendly baristas inside and ordered. The BF got a latte (my usual) and since he got it, I decided to try the Toddy instead. His latte was very good, and it was at the perfect temperature, not too crazy hot, but not cool either. That was great. He asked for 2% milk and it still tasted like a more creamy milk, so kudos to that. The coffee flavor was also prominent, but not overpowering. My toddy was really good also. The coffee flavor is great, it's cool and refreshing (as much as a caffeinated drink can be anyway), and they offered to put a little cream in it, so that's a bonus. I will most definitely be back to this place. Yay Bergies!I don't openly announce my affection for PF Chang's.  Growing up in the San Gabriel valley surrounded by real Chinese food I sometimes wonder if I'm allowed to enjoy this candy-like addicting concoction they serve here as food.  Proper or not, I like PF Chang's!  Although it's not the best food, it's tasty and it sure makes my mouth happy.

I mentioned in my previous blog that mom was visiting from Korea.  We went to Vegas and stayed at Planet Hollywood.  While my hubby was playing poker, mom and I decided to eat at the PF Chang's located inside the hotel.  It is here that my mom's obsession with this restaurant starts all over again. 

We always order the Garlic Noodles.  We LOVE this dish.  We also ordered the Chicken Lettuce Wraps that we enjoy.  We sat out in the patio and blissfully soaked in the fair weather while munching happily on our lunch.  Even our strange & annoying server who kept complaining to us about her other table of customers and kept trying to overcharge us (I had to tell her to fix our bill twice) couldn't ruin our meal.Went out for a nice dinner date. We were asked if we wanted to sit upstairs and had to walk upstairs and wait halfway on the stairs for the hostess. One thing I thought was a little bad becase what of elderly people in the middle of the stairs?
Anyways, we were seated very fast and our server Daisy was awesome. It took the drink person a while to get our drinks but Daisy was always there and made sure we were sattifsfied. We ordered 3 entree;s to share and about 10 margaritas lol the pomegranate margaritas were the BOMB!

Price is fairly high, being on the strip and stuff... but oh well. it was GOODGood wine, great sushi, and the I-Hate-Sushi menu is actually too notch as well. Can't be beat for QC.Chicken enchilada omelet.  The best omelet I've had in a long time.  Love the cherry coffee cake.Hubby and I decided to "eat outside the box" for our latest date night. This is definitely a good place to go if you typically don't have a very adventurous palate! The music was a *tad* loud and our server was on the slow side, but otherwise we had a great experience trying some new dishes. I had the lamb curry and it was very good. Hubby had the Saturday special, some kind of beef (can't remember the name) and it was very good and just a little spicy. The garlic naan and basmati rice were to die for!The new location for UL is pretty well tucked away at the end of the new AJ's Shopping center but it is well worth finding.  Sounds like there were some issues they had to get over when they first opened but my experience was great!

Went for an early dinner at about 6 pm.  The service was prompt and our server was very friendly.  We ordered a Mediterranean pizza and Penne with Wild Mushrooms in Cream Sauce.  The Penne was amazing.  A wonderful mixture of different mushrooms in a delicate cream sauce over perfectly al dente penne.   I'm sure it's a million calories but I could easily have snarfed down another serving!  The pizza combination of artichoke hearts, kalamata olives, feta, banana pepper rings, etc was great.  The only reason I knocked a star off is the middle third of the pizza could have been crispier.  Of course that can be difficult with that many wet ingredients.

One side note for all you ladies with a fireman fetish.  There is a new fire station across the parking lot and the bar area was filled with at least a half dozen firemen.  So, if that's your cup of tea, then you might find someone to help put out your blazing inferno!The casino buffet is above average for Arizona with some good entrees and soups as other critics have described. Or so I am told by the friends and family that dine with me.  I only sample the rest of the offerings because the big deal on this place is  -  the times they serve all you can eat crab legs. The staff constantly refills the crab, even setting up a second station if traffic is high. Consequently they are fresh and hot - excellent crabbing! Slow roasted prime rib is also added on Sunday. It also is very well cooked and Delicious! I have actually taken time to have some of the prime rib and validate that it is very good. Take if from someone that knows every existing and past all you can eat crab leg opportunities, this is the best in Arizona!I stopped by this Paradise Bakery location today and ordered a half sandwich and salad, roasted turkey artichoke and chopped chicken cobb, to go.  When I got home I attacked my salad with the fury of 10,000 screaming Dothraki raiders...  it didn't last long, the salad was delicious.  That's when the horde, that was my hunger, turned its attention to the isolated and vulnerable half sandwich.  The attack was over as quickly as it began.  It came as great surprise that the half sandwich had erected impenetrable stone defenses otherwise known as bread.

Sad day you say?  I think not!

I called the location to voice my complaint, the bread on the sandwich was burnt and rock hard.  By this time the store had closed, but the very sweet manager not only offered me a whole sandwich to replace the concrete half sandwich, but a full refund as well.  I drove back got my sandwich, a refund and a bag of free cookies.

The food at every Paradise Bakery I've been to has been good, but the customer service tonight was incredible.  That to me is what sets any establishment apart from the rest.  The food at any random place could be great but if the service is lacking and unfriendly I will never return.  I will be back.Excellent food, excellent service. Even the required valet service hustled as they worked for their tips. On Monday and Tuesday nights, Postino has a $20 special (not to be confused with happy hour) that includes a bottle of wine and a bruschetta board. We ordered the Nine Iron panini, a bottle of Sola Fred red wine, and a bruschetta board consisting of the following selections (check my photos, too!):

Ricotta with Dates & Pistachios
Brie & Apples with Fig Spread
Smoked Salmon with Pesto
Prosciutto with Figs & Mascarpone 

My absolute favorite was the salmon and pesto, but I definitely appreciated the salty crunch of the pistachio and ricotta, and the sweet juxtaposition of the sweet figs and prosciutto. I did not care for the coldness of the apple and brie. I honestly don't remember much of the panini except that it was "good", mainly because I was so enthralled with the bruschetta. By the time I had turned my attention to the panini, I had also had a good amount of wine.

Halfway through our meal, a manager (presumably) appeared and apologized for the amount of time it took for a waitress to take our order. It was extremely busy and we therefore did not think anything of the "wait" but still appreciated the very, very generous comp. Clearly, Postino takes their customer service seriously! 

Beware! Seating wait times are very long, especially for groups. Because we had a group of more than 8, the man who answered the phone was very polite and helpful in reserving a table, resulting in quick seating.  If it's just you and a friend, no problem! They have fireplaces you can sit next to. All in all, I definitely recommend this place. I love me some vino!Super impressive ambiance. Seemed really fancy to me, but so does anything without duct tape on it. They have great beers on tap, like several from ballast point brewery, As a bonus, they'll comp your drinks if you play the machines at the bar. The only thing that's kind of weird is that this casino obviously has a kind of mermaid and pretty fish are our friend's theme, but it also has a bass pro shop on site. This sort of obvious dichotomy makes as much sense as a vegan hunting lodge.If the food wasn't so cheesy (i mean literally) I would rate it 4.5 but then again, i don't really have the option anyways, ;-) 

Great little town next to Madison - my boyfriend n I were on road trip and didn't wanna eat @ any chains - so we took the map of Madison area and threw a dart @ it. It landed on Middleton and so did we... 

Bavaria Cafe is nicely decorated and have some yummy cakes and pastries you must try to believe. We got chicken quesdillas and it was more cheese then chicken/vegs. Not a fan of that - I stuck to the carrot cake and let my bf finish the quesadilla. He has no complaints. 

Corona for $3.25! Also try the spotted cow. ;-)Me and my wife went there after church yesterday. it was a great good food, great service, even when they had computer problems, we sat outside it was really cool.Well, the staff could be friendlier, but what do you expect from an airport, primarily to-go food, in Vegas later in the evening, right?  

Look, it's an AIRPORT.  And a not-so-new one on top of that.  Food is pricier than outside the airport in general.  They won't have the best staff in the world (like friggin DUH).  It's in VEGAS, they are serving tons of silly drunk travellers which I'm sure is NOT very fun to deal with.  

I usually have really high standards for service and hospitality, but, in this case, I say give them a f*ckin break.

Why am I giving them this many stars?  Well, their food was really good.  I expected to pay quite a bit because it's in an airport, and yet, the taste of their burrito actually exceeded my expectations.

I ordered a Garlic Lime burrito with prawns, with a bottle of water.  The burrito had a perfect balance of tangy lime and a bit of heat, with Spanish (tomato based ) rice and grilled prawns, all wrapped up, piping hot.  

Honestly, I would pay a few extra bucks to eat their burrito over other typical airport food any day.

The only thing I wish they had, were more fresh/healthy side selections.  I would have loved to tack on a little side salad or a fruit bowl to my order but I didn't see any.  But still, I didn't feel too guilty about my food choice, especially compared to Mega-Chain junk food places also stationed in this airport.

Hence, my first experience at 360 Gourmet Burrito results in a pretty happy 4 stars.  Will totally buy food from them again the next time I am stopping by this airport.Went here for the first time for a Brazilian.  I would recommend this place to anyone.  Katie is amazing, you almost forget what you're having done!  Almost :)

The wax doesn't hurt as badly as strip wax, comes off cleaner, and is much more sanitary!  I'll be returning.I love pizza places where the first thing I see when I walk in are freshly prepared and sliced pizzas just waiting to be popped into the oven and served to me on a paper plate. This place is no different. 

I didn't try the garlic knots, which I regret, but I do plan to return and give them a shot. They do serve pizza by the slice, which requires you to choose toppings. I generally grab the standard "veggie" slice, but without that crutch, ordered a slice with peppers and spinach. It was a good decision--the pizza was pretty good, not too greasy. The rest of my party ordered sandwiches. 

I will note that the restaurant was pretty warm--not sure if this is due to the constant baking of pizza or the weather in general, but for someone not immune to high temperatures, it may be uncomfortable. 

I was most impressed by the owner, who came by the table to ask how everything was and wrapped up our leftovers himself. He was very friendly and invited us back. Overall, this place has good food and good service!I love this salon, the staff is friendly and fun and most importantly Stephanie is awesome.  My color and cut are gorgeous and she is so fun to chat with. Look forward to my visits to this awesome salon.  Love Aveda products too.The Better Half and I absolutely love City Center in Vegas.  The primary reason is that this is a primo spot to hang out and people watch.  Many of the restaurants, bars, and lounges spill out into the public areas so you can enjoy a meal & drink while enjoying the entertainment that is also known as the Vegas Tourist...ha!

It's always a lot of fun to visit and hang out.  Can't wait to come back.

Return Factor - 90%My friends and i came here to eat during my bachelorette weekend in Vegas.  They were told to come an hour early so they could wait for seats...but we must've waited 20 mins max and we were promptly seated...in a room that was only 3/4 full.  I guess the hostess just wanted to pretend this place was more hopping than it was!

We, unfortunately, came here after eating a really late brunch, for an early dinner since we had show tickets later on that evening, so none of us were really hungry.  The sizes are definetly generous here.  I tried the tomato soup, crab & artichoke dip, chicken fingers/tenders, and the frozen hot chocolate.  Everything was pretty good, even on a full stomach.  I would definetly recommend the crab & artichoke dip again.  Its mostly just a crab dip, with one piece of artichoke as a garnish, but the crab pieces were pretty big.  It's smothered in this baked cream sauce and served with small slices of toast.  The tomato soup was not too bad, but just overly salty.  The chicken fingers were surprisingly good and juicy. and served with a trio of sauces (honey mustard, bbq, and ranch)

Others on the table included the ABC burger (Avocado, Brie & Carmelized Onions) and the BBQ blue cheese burger.  Neither of them were finished but I didn't hear any complaints or compliments.  It was my first time trying the frozen hot chocolate and it was good, but a little overrated.  I'd come back again on a empty stomach to see if that makes any difference.  3.5 stars!I've been to this place several times with my boyfriend just for dessert. Every time that I have been here they always tell me it's about a 30 minute wait but most of the time it only takes about half. I have sat indoors and outdoors. I prefer sitting outdoors on a nice day/night since the patio faces Las Vegas Blvd. It can get loud when dining indoors. The service is great and I never have problems with my order.

We usually get the Double Frozen Hot Chocolate for two. I am a chocolate lover so I enjoy this dessert even as simple as it is. I've tried the White Chocolate Frozen Hot Chocolate but I prefer the regular chocolate. 

Overall, it's a good place to dine and experience the Frozen Hot Chocolate. So give this place a go if you're on the strip and want an icy chocolate dessert.This was our second time visiting this place. Last time the service was horrible, the food was good, but what brought us back was the dessert. We gave it a second try, and the food was good, service was great, and the frozen hot chocolate was so delicious. 

We got the frozen hot chocolate with almonds, and we liked it better than the peanut butter one. 

I have it four stars because the food is not as good as the dessert. My burger was dry, a bit flavorless, but the bacon was just right. The fries are seasoned better than well. The hot dogs are okay, but the pizza is amazing. 

Next time we will just stop by for the dessert, since the food is over priced for what it is.This is my favorite Asian market in las Vegas because it's clean and spacious. Plus it has everything you need in terms of Asian ingredients.I have never heard of "Chipotle" before but my husband wanted to try it while on vacation in Las Vegas... It was surprisingly delicious! I got the chicken bowl with white lime cilantro rice, corn, and salsa. I didn't get a whole lotta "extras" but it was so refreshing. Maybe because we were in buffet gluttony and this was "light" compared to what I was shoving down my esophagus for the first 4 days of vacay. Oh, and it was cheap! Nice! They should open one in Hawaii :)I came here for the first time on a Tuesday night to learn the East Cost Swing.  I was filled with trepidation.  I found it hard to imagine how one could learn an entire dance in thirty minute's time, and then be expected to swing around the dance floor with swing savvy partners.

There are two types of people in the dancing world: those that can and those that can't.  When you possess a natural rhythm, you can always improvise if you know what an eight count is.  If you have no rhythm, no amount of improvisation will make you or your partner look good.

FatCat is one of those places where novice and expert come together for a swingin' good time.

Among the many other styles of dance classes offered here, ranging from 5-7 dollars a night, Tuesday night is Swing dancing night.

My partner and I arrived at 7:30PM.  The ballroom was filled with about 150 people.  A male and female instructor came out in the middle of our circle and began the instruction with the simple art of bouncing from one foot to the other, stepping back, triple stepping to the left and right.  Once we had the steps down, turns were implemented, then came the twirls, and I marveled at how easy it was.  As we were encouraged to practice with a partner, the large circle of swinging hopefuls rotated after each new step learned.  This increased the anxiety level for me, as I had to get to know a new dance partner every minute.  However, the upside of this is that each new partner taught me something new, and I learned for the first time how to let somebody lead.  

Gentle hint for the men out there: The pressure is on you.  You have to know how to lead the woman.  If she doesn't know what she's doing, like I did, you need to know how to guide and coach her through the steps.  (Which worked wonders for me)

There was such an eclectic mix of people there.  Young and old, as well as varying cultural and ethnic backgrounds.

Within a half hour, the instructor felt we were ready to embrace the dance floor.  The invitation was open to seek out a new partner, or find our old one amidst the sweating bodies.

The music makes you feel like you are on the set of "Swing Kids," the jazz is two and three-step, which gives you no other choice than to wear yourself out.  In the crowd you will spy guys and gals dressed in jazzy clothes, swinging around the dance floor.  It is great entertainment, great exercise, and such a fun date!The name Archi's doesn't scream Thai cuisine or anything Asian for that matter, but once you get passed the unusual name, this place is definitely one of the better Thai restaurants in Las Vegas (chain or otherwise). 

Tom yum soup is delicious here and you can really judge a Thai restaurant from the quality of this traditional Thai soup. The Lunch specials they have from 11 a.m. - 3 p.m. are a very good deal and equally as scrumptious!

Overall the interior of the restaurant is very pleasant and appealing for what it is and the menu prices are very reasonable. If you like Thai food you should stop by here sometime!i was a little hesitant to try another thai restaurant in vegas because it felt like i was betraying LOS by doing so. but my friends (both locals) were very convincing so we decided to finally try this place. i'd have to say this is not a bad "other thai option" if one is craving thai food and don't have the time to wait (or was unable to make a reservation) at LOS. 

the tom kha was good, the glass noodles (forgot the thai name) was one of the best noodle dishes i've had, the combination fried rice was well seasoned and could very well be a full meal on its own, and even the spicy basil pork was pretty tasty. the only thing that was amiss at our table was the red curry. it was like 3/4 bamboo shoots. will never order that again. 

i ordered spicy level 2 but next time i think i'll try a 3. 

overall, this is a solid thai restaurant.I made an appointment as a birthday present for the hub.  He ended up getting a facial done by Zora.  He loved it so much, he made another appointment.  It was his first time and it turned out to be a great experience.  The prices are reasonable, staff is friendly and helpful, and the space is cool.Must try the green bean fries!! 
The atmosphere is a little "blue", which takes the experience into the quirky rhelm but it's decent. The service was top notch and fast. My only complaint would be the skill level of the cooks, either my burger sat to long under a lamp the over cooked my food (which no self respecting owner would ever admit to) or my burger was cooked well beyond medium to begin with. Eh? Either way.. It was tasty, I'd try it again!The firearms here are the same price or even cheaper then "Discount Firearms". The staff that I came across were friendly and helpful. The guys behind the gun counter were helpful and took their time explaining EVERY firearm and it's "plus and minuses" that I was holding in my hand. Most gun stores in the valley treat customers like they are bugging them. Unless the customer already knows what he wants to purchase. Not here. I looked at least at ten different firearms and all my questions were answered. I like this store. Great variety in firearms. Some of the rifles were a lil higher in price, but the selection was excellent.Unreal!!! 4.5!! Second time eating here. I must not have been paying attention to the food the first time as it was a guys weekend. This place is off the hook!! I was talking about the Braised Beef for at least a week later and the drinks were nice and strong. I am definitely going back next time in Vegas. Decor and lighting were very nice.Strike the background music by the Commodores, "Three Times a Lady"..."yes, you're once, twice, THREE times a laaaady. And I loooove youuuuu!" Yep. After C4. After The Clarendon Kitchen. We now have Gallo Blanco. And I am muy happy about this. The carne asada tacos are heavenly! Perfectly seasoned and served in the cutest taco rack. I'm now combing every William Sonoma to find these puppies. Our mango fresco juice beverage thingie was so refreshing I wanted to jump right in! Rickie said the roasted chicken was succulent. Ok. So he didn't say succulent. I think yummy was the word. The decor is modern and comfortable. I love how they really opened up the room. It is light, airy and has great views. Including our bedroom window...ooops...maybe I shouldn't have mentioned that. OMG. We just confirmed our trip to Disney World! Gotta go! Oh. Eat here. NOW!Gallo Blanco is absolutely delicious!  This charming little cafe and bar, located on the ground floor of the Clarendon Hotel, is a great destination for scrumptious Mexican style food.  The ingredients are very, very fresh, and the flavor they cram into every last morsel is spectacular.  They make great salsa and great guacamole, and apparently the guacamole is made fresh to order.  They could stand to put their rather chunky green verde salsa in a squeezable container, though.  It was impossible to get out of the glass bottle in which it was placed.

If you want an especially good deal, hit them up for happy hour!  They have street vendor style tacos for an average of around two bucks a pop, filled generously with beef, pork, fish, etc.  You can't go wrong!  Four of us ate three tacos each, split chips and salsa with guacamole, two of us had drinks, and one person had soup, and the whole thing came to fifty bucks.  It's a fair price for such high quality food.  If you are downtown, this is worth a try.Toby Keith Bar & Grill, where shall I start? 

It's my kind of place, just walking through the front door puts a bit smile on my face.
It ain't too far, come as you are, I love this bar.

If you know these lyrics, then you will most likely enjoy this bar just as I do.  There is good country music playing, large beers served in a mason jar, and did I mentioned the deep fried Twinkies? There is plenty of room, an nice little outdoor patio, decent country crowd, and lots of 2-steppers getting down on the dance-floor.

The drawbacks? I would have given a solid five stars if not for the way the rude bouncers started kicking us out when it got close to 2am. I am not used to being treated that way, and I could not believe that is how management has their bouncers treat their customers. That did really leave a bad taste in my mouth, but I still have love for Toby Keiths. I will come back every chance I get!

Tip- Toby's has pretty good concerts. Check out the website to find any upcoming performances!so i had the chicken bella. I had the white cheddar mash. And spaghetti squash marinara.  Mash was great, right hint of seasonings, the spaghetti squash marinara, was bland. had no flavor.  Chicken was good had a parmesan cream sauce, a little hint of spice but i enjoyed it. great addition was the portabella mushrooms. my friend had the seafood festival mix. It all looked good, but didn't taste since it was all crab and lobster, and I am allergic. She liked it. we had the appetizer of Asian Dumplings, suprisingly good. I believe it had water chestnuts, and they were sliced big, so it kind of gotten in the way of the chicken goodness of the dumpling, but that's just me. This place is a little more upscale than chili's and applebee's. the food was great and so was the service. Couldn't complain or expect nothing more, than what it is, a chain that served American Fare. It is the only one left in Vegas. Because the one in Summerlin closed.Cute little place in the corner shopping center.  When you walk in, you immediately notice the way it's arranged with intimate tables and the decor is sweet with all the little personal touches.  But is the food good?  I love it.  The service is good, the staff are friendly and they took good care of us.

On today's menu I ordered a combination plate with california roll, chicken breast, and tempura mixed.  It comes with two salads, white rice, and miso soup.  It was fresh, tasty and I really liked the combination.

Of course I also ordered a couple of sushi rolls; The first was the caterpillar roll, which is eel, crab, cucumber, and avocado, and we got a red dragon roll, crab meat, cucumber, avocado, and fresh tuna.  Both of these were fresh, very good and helped to complete a really good meal. 

For a small place, we enjoy the intimacy, the service, and the food.The food there is really good & spicy. I came in a couple times & sometimes I'll have my boyfriend pick me up some food there too. They have really nice portions. 

I want to go back but I felt unwelcome w/ the lady at the counter who took my order one Sunday morning. She never smiled at me while I greeted & smiled at her. When she took my order she looked annoyed. She was nice to the people in front of me.  I don't know if it was how I was dressed or she didn't like how I looked or what. Maybe she didn't like my kids. I just don't know. It sucks because whenever I go somewhere, I always try to be nice to whoever is serving or helping us. I even gave her a decent tip for a to go order. I watched her take an order for the couple after me & she was all nice & joking w/ them. When I came back in line because I forgot to order a drink for my sister she said in an odd tone of voice, "Can I help you?' It was the kind of tone of voice like I was not welcome there.

 When I told me sister & her mother in law about it, they were surprised because they said she was really nice. Very weird. So, since the customer service for me wasn't too great, I haven't been inside since. It sucks because the food is so good. Whenever I have a craving for it, I'll usually have someone go in & pick up something for me so I won't have to tolerate the rude service.I met up with Prissy C. here before the Tumbleweed lighting and I really enjoyed myself.  I wish it wasn't in Chandler!  (In all honesty though, it didn't take us long to get there from N. Scottsdale....about 35 minutes.)  The atmosphere is great, its a nice modern bar with a large dining room.  On the website it looks like its just a bar area but there is in fact a large dining area as well.  

The wine selection is a little lacking so its more of a restaurant than wine bar I think.  There are only three wine flights, none of which interested me, and a large martini list.  (The number of martinis they have is probably equivalent to the number of wines they offer)  However, I did enjoy the sauvignon blanc that I ordered.  Their website also advertises that they have drink and app specials on Saturdays until 6:30, however there were no specials offered when we went.  

However, the food is very good.  We were pleasantly surprised by the calamari....we're very picky when it comes to calamari.  I usually don't go for the big rings of it but these were very tender and the sauce they were served in was very very good.  I chose the bow tie pasta which was well cooked and the chicken in it was bountiful.  My husband's pork chop was delicious and he was quite satisfied with his choice.  We opted to not have dessert but the marzipan cheesecake sounded divine.  I think the prices are right on par with what you would pay for a similar entree in a similar environment in any city.  (Our app, 2 beers, 3 glasses of wine and 2 entrees came to just under $100 which is totally reasonable, IMO.)This was me and my wife's First time here, and we had never been to palette before, But from what everyone tells me this place is a step up. 

We had gone on a Sunday about 2 in the afternoon with a group of friends. The atmosphere was really laid back, On first glance the outside is pretty nice if it didn't look like it was going to storm I'm pretty sure we would have sat outside. 

We were seated promptly inside the building. The inside was nice and basic tables and chairs, a older phoenix home converted to a restaurant a nice cozy place. With local artwork placed on the walls. I like to go to the bathroom and on the way back check out the art pieces.  

The waitress was really nice and very fast she gave us our menus and left us to make our drink choice, I ordered a mimosa and water, and when she came back to get our food order for my dish I ordered a Coca Cola Ham Omelet with Pumpernickel Toast.
   
First off let me say the mimosa was pretty damn good. 
Nice and strong. 
So good in fact we finished our first glass and ordered a second. 

Yes I was buzzed, but through my little buzz I noticed that our food was taking awhile to get to us. There were 5 people at our table and I know it takes time to get those orders ready. But it did seem like it took some time. I think that was the only real complaint. 

When the food finally made it to us, It was hot but not super hot I would say more like lukewarm. Not to my liking and my wife and friends agreed. The Omelet was big with lots of ham and eggs. Just to make sure of the taste I made sure to clean my palette with the glass of water I believe if you are trying something for the first time the first bite determines how everything else tastes.

Well let me say that it was good real good, but wasn't the best. I expect a Coca Cola Ham Omelet to have a distinct taste of Coca Cola. I want it to be sweet and flavorful releasing all kinds of sensations on my taste buds. Who knows maybe the mimosa threw off my taste buds. 
 
But don't get me wrong it wasn't awful, it was a good effort on the chefs part. But maybe it needs to marinate a bit more. I don't know I'm no chef but I know I like to eat.  But I will admit the flavor finally made a real appearance in the last 2 or 3 bites of the omelet. And yes I ate the whole thing cause hey I like to eat.  Would I order it again? Maybe but I would give something else a try first. 


All in all it was a good experience the food and company was good and we enjoyed it. I will be back again, but as I said trying something different. I think this place has a real chance of becoming something great. They just have to work on getting that food super hot. 
 
And a side note my wife who does not drink tried my omelet and she liked it better than her plate.Nice zingy green/mixed juices, creative fruit smoothies, and hearty wraps, lighter salads, one or two soups of the day. In a town of haggis, potatoes, fish and chips, the option of detox and immune "boosters" is a refreshing break! But for the less angelic eaters, there are also bagel sandwiches, milkshakes, and yummy looking cakes brownies and shortbreads. You can grab or go, but better to sit and stay a while with the wifi and quirky lighthearted atmosphere.When shopping is an adventure and a destination, you must be heading to Tan Phat. This is a funky Asian market that has been there for me whenever I need water chestnuts (for wrapping in bacon, and they carry five different brands! Who knew so many companies were in the business of the water chestnut?) or kitchen supplies for Asian themed dinners. One of the first things that hits you upon entering in the smell of seafood. After acclimating to that, you'll find a huge selection of canned goods, dried seafood and mushrooms, a decent selection of fresh produce and an ample amount of "novelty" edibles (you know, those intriguingly package foodstuffs that you just can't find outside of Asian markets). 

The employees are usually polite. You may have to walk through every aisle to find what you need, but that's part of the adventure.Over all, it was a great stay for what it was worth. It's very clean, quiet, easy to find; right off the freeway exit which ever way you are coming. Free breakfast was good. If you are looking for simple eggs and bacon, generic breakfast to hold you over.When staying at the boulders you have complementary use of the spa facilities. My husband and I love going to the children free pool, lounging all day, ordering delicious healthy breakfast and using the facilities. The spa has your standard spa items sauna, steam room, huge showers etc. The only thing I would change is a better magazine selection.Stepping into this bakery made me feel like a little girl again! The interior is pink and brown with very cute decorations, just like a room I would have loved to spend time in as a kid!

I came in a little over an hour after they had opened. They didn't seem to have much of a selection at the time, probably because I was there pretty early. I purchased:

Cinnamon Roll: these are huge! I probably should have eaten this right after I got home, but it was still good the next morning after heating it up in the microwave. I feel that they could have cut down on the icing.

Lemon Cream Cheese and Vanilla Cupcakes: Yum!! The cakes were moist and they didn't go overboard with the frosting. Cute decorations, I just wish they were bigger. The Lemon Cream Cheese is my favorite!

Sugar Cookie: Nothing special, but pretty good. The icing made it a bit too sweet. 

I wanted to buy a macaroon, but the woman who was helping me said that they only had one flavor, which was Almond , so I passed on it. She was friendly and patient as I took a while to pick out what I wanted. The cool thing is they grab your items from the back and I even saw them putting the frosting on my cupcakes. 

I think I finally found my new home for cupcakes!! Yay!! I'll be back for sure. Hopefully there will be more of a selection next time!great frozen yogurt!!Wow this place has the best ravioli's. One of the reasons I went here all the time was because of their huge meatballs. They were out of this world. Yesterday we ordered 3 lasagna's and a side of meatballs. What a bummer, the meatballs were no where near as big as they used to be. Same price and alot smaller. The take out order came to 47.00. A little pricey but the lasagna was delicious. Two of them were very big portions and one was smaller. I won't order the meatballs again because they also went up to $5.99 for two of them. That is a bit pricey for meatballs. Last week we ordered the sicilian lasagna again which has a layer of eggplant on the bottom. The eggplant was burnt. The first time we ordered the sicilian lasagna it was out of this world. After having to remove all the eggplant the last time I ordered it, it has turned me off from the sicilian lasagna forever! I'm afraid they are starting to go downhill. What a shame because they were my favorite Italian restaurant by far. I am hoping they get back on track again so I haven't given up totally yet.I find myself making more and more visits to this little gem of a sushi bar, which happens to be just around the corner from home.

To be fair, my first visit was for takeout, and I was honestly not too impressed. It was enough to keep me away for a while, despite its favorable location. Of course, the first time I actually decided to dine in I was presently surprised by how friendly and devoted the chefs are to making some really great sushi and making your visit welcome.

The lead chef, who always seems to be working when I stop by, has a great personality and a passion for finding some fresh fish options that you may not see at many places around town. His friendliness is so welcoming that every time I go in, I find myself drawn into a delightful conversation with him and the other customers sitting at the sushi bar.

The real draw to this place is some really good sushi (not AYCE) and a really great host that is generous with some special offerings if you are up to the suggestion.What a lovely lunch I had at the Parlor!  It was a rainy day and my daughter and I were going to lunch and the movies.  We started with the brussel sprouts, which were amazing.  Being a wimp I will ask for 'no red pepper flakes' next time...but the sprouts were roasted, seasoned and mellow.  I also had the carrot and ginger soup, which my daughter then decided she liked also.  I could eat that soup often!

Then came the pizza.  The pesto pizza.  YUM.  YUM.  YUM.  I loved the crust on this pizza.  I love pesto.  I really enjoyed the little semi-sweet crunch of the pinon nuts added.  My daughter and I were getting really full but managed to take down an 8" pesto pizza.  I look forward to this again.  

Note, the staff is really mellow.  Like, REALLY mellow.  If you're expecting fawning service, this isn't the place.  But we didn't have to wait long at all for our food, got everything we asked for and were quite happy!Fabulous pizza crust, just like the reviews said! I don't normally eat the crust, but I did eat this crust! I got the Margareta pizza, but added sauce, and my husband built his own. We both loved or pizzas. You could just tell the ingredients were quality! Tasted so good! We also tried the cauliflower as an opener. It was good, but nothing I'll die if I don't have it again. We prefer our cauliflower a little more cooked.  The service was just fabulous from the moment we walked in the door.We went and saw this show on a Tuesday and they had 241 tickets for VIP! (google that stuff)  We were right next to the stage and this show was great! Coco is very pretty and the dancing is spectacular. The guys in the show do a real good job keeping your interest.  

It is amazing what a pair of tight theighs can do... OHH Sorry.. Let me talk about the show again. LOL I would highly recommend it. They did make me coat check my Popcorn that I had bought in the mall.  I was hoping one of my guys were picked to go on stage but maybe next time. This was tasteful and calssy great couples night out.  Makes you want to be Little bo Peep~I finally made it to tasti D-lite this afternoon... I was hungry for a snack and I was in the area, so I headed on over.  I'd been wanting to try Tasti D for awhile but timing never worked out until today.

I was pleasantly surprised when I walked in.  It's colorful, packed with all kinds of treats, and the girls working there were friendly.  I saw the list of today's flavors and I sampled both the Tart 'n Tasti frozen yogurt and the Papaya .  I am more of a fro-yo girl than an ice cream girl, but I liked the mild flavor of the Papaya... However, I do see why there are some negative reviews depicting Tasti as bland and lacking flavor... I think if you don't compare it to the taste of full sugar ice-cream and you keep in mind that this is a lower calorie treat, you will like it.  At least I did! 

Anyways, I ended up ordering a medium cup of half Tart 'n Tasti and half Papaya with pomegranate and coconut toppings.  Both toppings were fresh and tasted great... and there was just the right amount to enjoy a bit of everything in each bite.  I didn't calculate how many calories my order had, but I can tell you that it tasted great and that it was the perfect late afternoon snack.  It filled me up for a few hours before dinner and I didn't feel guilty eating it either!

I noticed Tasti's topping bar after I ordered which was probably a good thing.  It was cool to see that though; i felt like a kid in a candy store with easy access to so many treats!  

I also spoke to Jonathan, the owner, during my visit.  He informed me that Tasti is working with several non-profits in the Valley, that they do birthday parties, and that they've got a ton more fun stuff in the works.  I brought home some tasti cannolis for Jared, I have a feeling he may not be as "crazy for Tasti" as I am, but to each their own...The Austrailian Wagyu fillet and dry aged Angus 300 NY Strip were awesome. The truffle Mac and Cheese is definitely a must. Pass on the sautéed spinach. The 4 types of house bread is also good. Also get the additional seared foie gras! I was not expecting much from the sea bass but it was delicious as well!

Next time I have to try the Austrailian tomahawk ribeye.I didn't care for my pasta. But that might be cause I don't like fettuccine that much... I got the fettuccine carbonara because he said it was the most popular. 

Loved the Mediterranean Sea Bass. 

The charred octopus wasn't too bad. Not amazing but decent. 

Service was as usual per fine dining standards. As expected, of course. 

I came with a friend and we did not finish our food. Took the fish and pasta to-go. Octopus was a small appetizer dish so that was easy to finish. 

Also comes with some bread but it wasn't that good. Same ole. :(Great food and super friendly staff. We went here two nights ago after reading about it on the Eater site.We were in Vegas this past Presidents Day weekend and the choice to eat at Sage was an easy one because we have dined several times at Spring in Chicago, Chef McClain's first restaurant.  There were eight of us and it was really, really delicious.  I had the poached egg, which was so outstanding I wished I could have licked the bowl and ordered 5 more.  I then had the hangar steak which was perfectly cooked and full of flavor.  In addition, everything else on my plate was bursting with flavor as well, including just a plain carrot.  Our dining companions also loved their meals, with the exception of one who ordered the pumpkin soup and scallops.  He said it was good, not great.  Then we got to dessert.  This place would have been 5 stars for me easily, but the desserts were just ok.  I am a huge bread pudding fan and although my serving vessel that the pudding was in was hot, the pudding was luke warm on the outside and cold on the inside making it dense and tough.  The other desserts were better than mine but also not outstanding and it was a disapointing way to end the meal.  Based on other reviews here, it seems Chef McClain should consider changing his pastry chef.  Otherwise I highly recommend this restaurant.It seems a lot of people were unimpressed with this buffet, so I came with little expectations but came away pleasantly surprised. During my trip to vegas I went to the buffets at M, Aria, and Planet Hollywood and surprisingly this was my favorite. While it isn't perfect, as long as you are selective with what you eat I believe this makes for a pleasant dining experience. I came here for lunch and while $20 isn't cheap, I easily got my money's worth stuffing myself with crab legs, jumbo shrimp, and raw shellfish. The prime rib was the best I had among the 3 buffets, although that wasn't saying much as none were as good as the prime rib at even an average sit down restaurant.  Pizza, which in most buffets doesn't even look like food, actually looked edible here, though I didn't try it. The asian food was entirely forgettable, but again, I don't go to buffets to eat those kinds of things.They also had an excellent selection of desserts which were nicely presented. Most of the desserts were good but avoid the fruity sauce thats on the side of the cakes because they're way too sweet.

Perhaps the thing that stood out the most at this place is the service. I was very thirsty that day and was downing my coke every 5-10 mintues, but I never had to go more than a couple minutes without a drink before our waiter came by and refilled my drinks. He also cleared our plates with great efficiency, as every time I got up to get more food the dirty plates were all gone by the time I got back. I also loved that there was no wait as well. Some people would interpret that to mean the buffet is no good, but cmon is any buffet really worth standing an hour in line for? 

Probably the weakest aspect of this buffet would be the design and decor of the place. The buffet is a bit on the small side, so it was occasionally difficult to navigate past people at different stations. They had a custom salad station where they make your salad to order, and put it and the seafood section at the front, which caused an unnecessary bottleneck. The overall design of the buffet was fairly plain as well, although they do have some window seats.

I can understand why people who came here for dinner would be underwhelmed, assuming the food is mostly the same. I too probably would be hesitant to come for dinner, but for lunch this place is worth it.I mean....
Wow. 

It takes like 5 minutes to walk the length of the "U" shaped Aria buffet, which is good, because your buffet-eating ass should get a small walk in while you're perusing the buffet-offerings. 

But then, Oh...em...gee....the buffet has everything. We did breakfast there, but you'd never know it with all of the lunch offerings. Everything from a bagel and cream cheese bar to an omelette bar, an Asian-inspired bar, crab legs, shrimp, traditional breakfast offerings, a Tex-Mex section and every conceivable pastry. 

And although $17.95 is kinda of a lot, it's not a lot for a Vegas buffet, comparably speaking. And if you like crab legs, well that's your money's worth right there. 

You also get bottomless beverages with it, so yeah. Give it a try.Lots of choices.  It was literally too much food for my eyes to handle, let alone my stomach.  I did the compulsory walkaround just to make sure I didn't miss anything.  They had sushi, chinese, american, italian, etc etc.  is it the best brunch i ever had?  I dunno about that, but it was maybe the most variety i've had at brunch.  maybe not.  
I'm a little indecisive today about my buffet history.  

So yeah, I went on a Friday which is brunchtime.  Not too crowded, but still pretty crowded.  The server was ok.  Not the best, not the worst.

I tend to take a little bit of each item that looks appetizing.  Then if I really liked something I'll go back for seconds.  Then I usually hit the desserts.

I know someone was wondering what my buffet eating strategy was.  So there you have it.  I heard the one at the Cosmo is better, but unfortunately I didn't have time to check it out.  Maybe next time.At around $40 Dollars for Brunch, I was expecting a really great situation when it came to food quality. The Aria Buffet did not let me down. They had many different stations that included LATIN, and ASIAN and and AMERICAN.. haha.. and some Mediterranean style dishes and salads too. There was a fantastic salad station which had a Waldorf Sald when I visited .. I like Waldorf Salad.. and a really nice dessert bar that included a rotating Gelato bar. 

In addition, since it was Brunch,. they had chicken and waffles, biscuits and gravy, pancakes to order..hashed potatoes and eggs.  I'm a sucker for Breakfast. I Brake for good brunch. I could have my chicken and waffles with eggs, Chinese-Style steamed buns and Mimosa! 

Pretty excellent and I would go again if given the chance. In a sea of buffets and all you can eateries ..thie ARIA Buffet stands out for me! Happy Eating!This Buffett was surprisingly very delicious! 
Bottomless mimosas for Memorial Day started things off on a high note. It is very upscale and has quite a variety for being a Buffett. 

I had crab legs, which were steamed, seasoned well and already open for you. I also had smoked salmon, garlic chicken and some potatoes. 
They had breakfast items, Chinese food, all kinds of meat and more. The decor is very nice & upscale, I would go back!Oh my goodness, I loved this restaurant! 

My friend and I split one of the Pad Thai dishes, just to have some food in our stomachs (there wasn't a lot of extra room for full stomach in our outfits... if you know what I mean...).

We both ordered the Pink Leopard to drink, that drink was AMAZING. 

There was a very short wait, so we grabbed a glass of prosecco down the hall, and they called me when our table was ready. Really great Saturday night dinner.It's easy to be snobby about Dennys, but you know what? This is better than 80% of breakfasts on the Strip, and it'll cost you $7. On my last morning in Vegas I decided to branch out and try the American diner at New York New York, and it was a pale shadow in comparison (and cost at least twice as much).

The food is bang on the money - diner fare that'll keep you going for the rest of the day - and everyone who works there is friendly and competent. Sure, if you want to have a leisurely breakfast you could head over to Mon Ami Gabi over at the Paris (and you should, at least once), but if you want to eat well and get moving, Dennys has your back.Very unique place. The food is good and they have a great wine selection with good service. If i have any complaints, it is a bit too expensive and it is noisy. The pasta is the best selection. Prepared aldente just the way I prefer my pasta. I had a lobster and pasta and it was very tasty. The sauce was over the top good. Make a reservation in advance as it is not easy to get into this place.Milkshakes are huge and delicious.  And cheap too.It's tucked away, but don't let that stop you. We order from here a lot, and their food is awesome! I've had the bacon-onion ring- bbq sauce burger more thatn I can remember, and I can NEVER make the same thing at home! Kudos guys, and keep up the speedy service!Does a review count if it's a regular weekday lunch spot steps away from where you work?

The veggie options are predictably good here.  Spicy eggplant with tofu is my go-to dish.  I usually ask for it thai-hot to get the appropriate swelter going.  

Their service is, as other reviewers have mentioned, sometimes uneven. (The restaurant is in downtown Mesa.  I imagine it's infuriatingly difficult to predict when things will be actually busy.)   However, the food is genuinely delicious, and a welcome option to break up the sandwich-heavy monotony of downtown dining options.This is a cute spot and they have amazing staff. I love sitting out on the patio while listening to their live music. The servers are very knowledgeable about the wine and always give great recommendations.I don't know how it is on weekends but I've gone twice on weekday afternoons and I love that you don't need quarters and that I can do my whole laundry basket at one time. Just a warning though. The dryers aren't very strong so make your loads a little smaller. For the price, it shouldn't be a problem.I am giving this place 4 stars simply because they have koshari!  I haven't seen koshari since I was in Egypt and this was nearly as good...I asked for it spicy and it was but not as spicy as the stuff in Egypt...otherwise delicious!Found a flyer stuck on my door the other day for Mafia Mike's pizza. Normally I find these things annoying and just trash them, but I happened to be hungry. And lazy. And they deliver.

So I ordered up a "Big Buffalo Chicken" pizza. Buffalo style chicken chunks (spicy, but not too much so) with a ranch dressing base instead of traditional tomato based. 

And I devoured the the entire pie (with help from two teenagers who declared the pizza "Effing AWESOME!!)

The wife got some Hawaiian style. Personally I find fruit on pizza to be fundamentally wrong, but she said it was fabulous.

Grab the cheesy crusty bread things too.So ever since this place has opened, my family has migrated here from KJ Kitchen. We've gone here for b-days, graduations, christmas, new year, you name it, we did it here.  Honestly, the food is pretty much the same.. still tasty and done Hong Kong style. The main reason we migrated was because KJ was just getting too popular and crowded and service was just getting poor. Since there's a competing restaurant now, I guess the customers are getting spread. The service here is definitely better and they run super super cheap tasty lunch specials. 

PRO: LUNCH SPECIALS!!!! you'd be a silly goose to go anywhere else!This is a cool place to enjoy great noodles.

1.  Spring Rolls - Had the Vietnamese Spring rolls here and it was very tasty! The dipping sauce and taste was very nice.

2.  Pho - we had the chicken Pho and also a meat pho with brisket, flank,tendons. I thought the tendon was undercooked, yet it wasn't and it was delicious.

3.  Broth - I liked it very much. It was clear, and had a nice taste of beef with green onion. Very subtle to me.  After I got the tasted down, I did throw some chili sauce into it, so, that altered it afterwards.

4.  Ambiance and others - Very small and nice, always crowded, and it a place where parking can be a challenge due to the large LVAC in the same log.

5.  Service -The staff are all young and very service oriented. You pay at the cashier and I have no idea how they remember what everyone ordered to give you the bill, yet they do!

I do love to have soda and they serve soda here in a can which is not as tasty to me as fountain and this means you will have to pay for refills......

Check this place out!There are basically 3 bars near my house.
Out of those 3, this one has the best selection of brews, they introduced me to Deschutes Red Chair, and for that I cannot thank them enough.
Its fairly basic bar food, When I go my husband and I spit the cajun wings and I get a club.  I've never been dissapointed with this at Caps.
The service is friendly, and I think everyone at the bar knows one another, very cheers-esque.have been meaning to check this place out since it opened, been hearing good things from friends 'bout it. i went for late lunch the place was empty but boy howdy i was very happy i finally went. kinda little bar/grill like on OB in san diego. who knew in the hidden strip mall next to the check cashing store?
the beer was icy goodness. the wings crispy, tasty.  we got lunch menu fish and chips and fish and shrimp taco plates. both came with the yummy fries that make life a good thing. everything was fresh and good to the last morsel.
the waiter said they have different specials thru the week, one is kids eat free and one buy one get one half off. there were posters up for the fight this weekend and they had the projector tv so sports bars vibe also.
they have beer/oyster shooter specials in the mornings so early games during football season might be a staple in the fall.
i sure hope this place makes a go of it cuz it makes me happy to leave the house.Used a Groupon. Otherwise, never would have found this place (even though they are near the movie theater, they close before most evening movies get out so no post-movie-viewing treats...sigh)

I picked a half dozen cupcakes but I was disappointed to learn that they were "completely sold out" of cake pops on a Saturday at 1pm (they'd only been open for 2 hrs and I somehow doubt that they "ran out"...do they just not make them every day or what?)

Anyway, the 6 cupcakes that I tried were each VERY good overall: moist cake with chocolate chips in the chocolate ones and frosting that is not too sweet, My favorite was the Toasted Coconut and The Dark Vader. I'll be ordering more of these for a party next week, mainly so that I can try the rest of flavors--GREAT SELECTION that I look forward to sampling in the future.

And hopefully, they will have Cake Pops for me to try.

I probably would've given them 5 stars but the service was bland (not nasty, just not particularly friendly either) and the they really should have Cake Pops available on a Saturday afternoon.What a great neighborhood bar! The beer selection here is amazing and I love how it is always cold! I also like the fact that they are always changing the beer selection, allowing all to try new ones.Back in the day when the tart frozen yogurt craze started with the wildly popular Pinkberry, who knew that would lead to literally hundreds of knock offs. Yes, even Pinkberry is a knock off of the Korean chain Red Mango, which is probably a knock off of another. But it was Pinkberry's simple healthy approach, stylish interiors and lines out the door which drew much attention to itself and its concept. So it was only a matter of time before someone would copy the success, some almost as good and others well, not so much.

Yogurtland is one of those success stories, expanding to nearly 50 locations nationwide in only a few years. While it's not Pinkberry, their claim to fame is to offer more for less. Choose your size of cup then fill it with one of the many varieties of the low calorie, low sugar, non-fat fro-yo. Then pile high the toppings ranging from fresh fruit, breakfast cereal, cookies, syrups and candy, be as stingy are as creative as you like. Once your satisfied with your creation, set it on the scale for your total. Yogurtland charges a mere $.30 an ounce so you can become quite the fro-yo artist with little investment to your imagination.

Once it was my turn to approach the self service machines I was immediately overwhelmed by the choices. Finally I got a hold of myself and made a fro-yo base of Vanilla Wafer Cookies and Cream, New York Cheesecake and Plain Tart. Though the best was yet to come, the topping station! Bananas, vanilla wafers, Fruity Pebbles and chewy rainbow mochi, I was set and at $3.60 I felt like I somehow robbed them.

Being mostly a purist I immediately tapped the Fruity Pebble and banana adorned Plain Tart. For tart yogurt its bite was subtle, each bite was as delightful as the first. The Vanilla Wafer Cookies and Cream had an artificial vanilla taste which wasnt very good. However eating the New York Cheesecake flavor was creamy and well rounded. The addition of the vanilla wafers was a hit and meshed really well with the smooth cheesecake taste.

Yogurtland is pretty hopping most nights, so take a dose of patients and imagine the endless choices that will be bestowed upon you once you reach the front of the line.Great little breakfast spot. Simple no frills good food at great prices. I love pancakes and I have to say they have phenomenal pancakes! I also like that this place is minutes from my house and right next to one of the best cleaners in the valley. 

Note of caution the breakfast specials during the weekdays are not the same on the weekends. But during the weekday you get:
3 of the best pancakes you ever want to eat
2 eggs any style
2 bacon or sausage
$4.99...SOLD!Service is always friendly and food always good. They have a great happy hour!I just became a member a couple weeks ago, i researched the heck out of fitness centers in my area. Mountainside is by far the cleanest of the bunch. Their cardio equipment is great, if there is a broken machine it gets repaired quickly. The weights area has machines that are perfect for the novice like myself. 

The staff is very nice and helpful if needed, but they are not pushy like other places i have been to. 

Needless to say i am very happy with my choice to become a member. 

*Perk - covered parking 
*Zumba classes are included in the membership and they are AWESOME!So this place is in a gas station. 
So there's that. 
But overlook the smell of fumes as you order and I have to tell ya, it's pretty solid. 

The woman ringing me up was DELIGHTFUL. I couldn't help but feel good cramming gyro and french fries in my face due to her pleasant disposition. It takes a bit longer but that's because everything is cooked to order. The menu is extensive, a weird compilation of southern and Chicago style (dogs, beef, gyro). I felt like the price was fair for the amount of food, about 8 bucks for a gyro pita and fries, and I liked that the meat was actually juicy. I do wonder if they're slicing it from a rotating deal or just heating it up, but I was also so hungry, it didn't matter as I scarfed it down.This place has some pretty good fast Italian food. The antipasti salad is amazing and we get that every time we go. they have great dinner specials for under 7 and it comes with super yummy garlic rolls. you order at the counter and they bring your food to the table. service is nice and the place is clean hope they make it in that weird location.I didn't check yelp on this restaurant because I thought the reviews may be mixed and THEY SOOO ARE!!! Geeeez!  Anyway, a friend and I ate there the other day.  I thought the food was pretty good.  The waitress was super friendly and smiled a lot.  A real sweety-pie.  Service is super important to me and they delivered for sure on friendliness.  
I had yellow rice and the garlic smothered fish with fried sweet plaintain and the stewed/boiled yucca, which I loved.  My friend had the toscenos - unrippened fried plaintain with beefsteak.  We thought the food was pretty good.  We'll eat there again.  A little pricey, but still good.
Only reason why I'm not giving 5 stars is because there was an electrical odor when we walked in.  That's my only ding.First time visit- many props for a very clean and clutter-free restaurant.
The menu seemed really quite extensive, but I had in mind exactly what I wanted to try: the Sandwich Cubano.  I ordered mine with mariquitas.  My friend ordered the Cubano with the Yuca Frita- it was my first time trying ANY of these things...  I liked the yuca better than the mariquitas... nothing wrong with them (and it isn't like I would know if there was or wasn't as I've never had Cuban food before!), just my personal preference for next time.
My friend, however, has not only a wealth of experience with Cuban cuisine, but has been to this particular restaurant before.  She was a fountain of knowledge, and I was glad for her guidance.  She ordered a little side dish of "mojo" which was $0.75, so definitely cheap enough and she recommended it highly.  It is some sort of oil with chunky, sauteed onion/garlic in it, served warm.  I dipped my sandwich and mariquitas in it sparingly, and it was very savory.  I now need a breath mint like nobody's business.
I ordered a drink called Jupina, which is a carbonated pineapple beverage.  It was served in a can with a glass of ice, and it was very enjoyable.
I have zero complaints about the food or service, which was deferential and polite, but I will say that trying to squeeze it into our lunch hour was challenging, and neither of us made it back to work on time.  Certainly the freshly-prepared food was worth the wait, but anyone going for lunch should know that it's not the fastest place - but if you want fast you go to Jimmy John's, eh?
Next time I will just let our server know we are on a time crunch and I am betting, based on how nice they were, that they'll be able to help us out!  We are planning on a return visit in two weeks, and I'd definitely give a 5-star review if we can get in and out in under 1 hr and 15 mins.Okay, here's the skinny on the GD: best locally owned pub in Madison. They have great beer selection that they make themselves. The decor is really good too, a GREAT place to gather with work friends or to watch a game. Their menu is pretty good, especially their burgers. The Cream Ale (only available in the Summer) is great, and the Velvet Screw beer is a great Winter brew. An excellent place with LOTS of space for all types of people.First off.. back home (Northern California) I have to go to either Oakland OR Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles in LA to get anything decent (I live in Santa Cruz... aka either a 5 hour drive or a 1 1/2 hour drive to get some southern goodness). This was on my list of places to go since our SBCer transplant got an ROTD at the other location.  

Honestly, for me personally the chicken and waffles were average *ducks and covers*  The waffles had little flavor and the chicken was meh....I will stick with Roscoe's down in LA.

The sides however were ridiculously bomb: 
The grits were cooked perfectly to our liking and were served with a big #$cking thing of butter.. amen...amen. The home potatoes were light, crispy and well seasoned. The collard greens were by far the best I have had in a minute..they were not too salty... not super soppy/mushy and came in the perfect sized bowl. Drinks came in a jam jar and once half consumed we were asked if wanted it either in a to go drink container (GENIUS!) or if we wanted more... I knew we had a drive with no real established potty so we declined.

Clean establishment with an autograph wall in the back (very cool). Service was good.... no complaints.The Chicken and Waffles really hit the spot.  A great place to go to with generous portions and plenty of coffee.  The service was pretty good too.Lo-Lo's is the ultimate chicken and waffle spot..not only is the food good but the atmosphere is always upbeat..as you watch TV and listen to some music that will make you want to eatWe've eaten at about every Red Robin in the East Valley and the San Tan Village Parkway one is our favorite.  Maybe because it's the newest one in the area or maybe we feel the service is just a little bit better there.  The food is the same as with most franchises, so the atmosphere and service is the difference.   The family had another good experience there on Friday evening and if you're a fan of Red Robin, recommend you try this one if you haven't yet.What a find. I love that it is never crowded but I worry it needs more business to survive.  

Excellent menu and great sushi chefs.  Huge serving for the money. Great value.I walked in here waiting for a friend to meet me for a date night.  I have to say I'm a HUGE fan of Firefly, so they had a lot to live up to.

The tapas were good, the services was attentive, and they didn't rush us out the door (which I like because I don't get to see this particular friend very often).  Atmosphere is comfortable.  The docked star is because I was 'meh' on their white sangria.  Their HH prices are great, and it was nice to sit and relax with a good friend for a bit.ive fallen in love with this place.

I have gone back a few times, and I think it is great.  I love the sauce quite a bit.  This pie just reminds me more than anything else of a pie I would get on the NJ shore in summer.  

If they dont have a pie out and ask for a slice they usually will throw a whole pie in if you are willing to hang out for a few minutes.  Lots of games on the TV. They apparently are big Yankee fans and that kind of sucks but I guess that is part of the package. 

I would rather go here then wait for 3 hrs at some other place.

Still love Grimaldis the most of any pizza I have ever had, but I could eat Vincents pie every week.I love the idea of cooking your own meat.We love this grocery store. Navigating through it is easy, the prices are great and we adore one of the clerks, Chuck. He is so friendly, funny, and promotes the very definition of a neighborhood market. Fresh and Easy is so lucky to have such a great employee!!! :)I so like me some fresh and easy. Especially the sale racks the offer daily. 50-75 % off I shop here often great fresh food and decent prices. If not on sale it's 5-10% more than smiths.  I would recommend trying it to see what you think.  Great produce and meatsFramboise on tap = delicious! The owner was awesome and it's a super cool place to come chill a ways away from the strip.

My boyfriend really wanted to check this place out because of all the crazy cool craft beers they have (on tap and in a HUGE refrigerator) and I scored too because they had a nice girly drink for me :)

Definitely give this place a try if you're in the Vegas area and want to get away from the madness of the strip for a little while! Prices are great, too!We were in Vegas for a long weekend before Thanksgiving with a group of 8 other friends. This was my husband's and I fifth time to Vegas this year and we always stay at the Venetian. This was also one of our friend's first time to Sin City. I had done some online research for places to go that did specials or happy hour. Lagasse's Stadium which used to be Jay-Z's old club 40/40 Club showed a happy hour special(M-F 3-7pm): $15 bucket of domestic beer (6 bottles), $20 cocktail pitchers and $5 apps. So we planned on hitting the happy hour Friday night before the Portland Trailblazer game. We showed up with a party of 8 and they put us in a sky box. We decided to order a bucket of beers and a pitcher of margaritas. The super cute cocktail waitress told us our bucket of beer options (bud light, coors light and Sierra Nevada). Sierra Nevada!? Really??? We couldn't believe that was one of the options! The cocktail waitress said they worked out some kind of deal with Sierra Nevada. Jackpot! We decided to order two buckets. The options for the cocktail pitchers (margarita, cosmos and long islands) we decided to go with margaritas.  The $5 app selection was pretty slim (mini chili dogs, artichoke dip and potato skins) and as the waitress explained pretty small. We tried one of each any way! The apps were small, but overall ok. We also ordered the pork nachos (not so great) and my husband ordered the chicken avocado wrap and thought it was just average. We had to send back the pitcher of margaritas, everyone agreed that something was wrong. The waitress had no problem sending it back and brought us back a pitcher of long islands. She said the bartender did admit to something being wrong with the margarita. The Long Islands were great! Our group of booze hounds ended up ordering another pitcher of Long Islands as well as two more buckets of Sierra Nevada! 
For pure boozing, sports watching and cute cocktail waitresses, our group fell in love with Lagasse's Stadium. The bar food is average, we saw some of the dinner entrees come out (roasted chicken and BBQ ribs) and the portions were HUGE! 
We went to Lagasse's Stadium that Sunday for NFL Football as well as Monday for MNF. We loved the fact we could place our sports bets there and get free drink tickets and we even played with the handheld pocket casinos, which was a Blast!
Can't wait to get back to Vegas and get some bets in at Lagasse's!!!We had landed early in the morning and were dragging around dinner time and just wanted a burger.  So simple!

The ad for this caught my eye and I remember it was being built when we were last in Vegas.  I recall wondering if Emeril even watches sports and why this was here at all...

In any case, dinner seating were some plush couches and pillows with ottomans.  With a huge series of screens in front of you.  We watched a March Madness game and got all caught up in the excitement. 

The food wasn't special but ti wasn't bad.  Decent prices (for Vegas) and it did it's job!  Great environment - like it a lot for some elegant sports lounging!  And of course, if you feel the need....there are plenty of people down the risers of sofas waiting to take your bets!Impressions from my 1st week: 
- A good selection of weight machines from Life Fitness, Freemotion, Star Trac (had never used) and a few others (Nautilus,Apex?,etc). The free weight area  (in pic above) was well stocked... but busy during prime time. 
- Most of the people working out were nice; no problems working in on sets when machines were busy. 
- A good mix of people... a lot of 20 somethings, but a surprising number of 30-50+ gym rats as well. No obnoxious slamming weights or excessive grunting (OK... if I can hear it over the tunes cranked up on my Ipod... its friggin' loud. I don't care what you're giving birth to, and am more impressed if you can control the weight on the way down while pushing that last one out (rep or baby) ). 
- The parking kinda' sucks... circling for spots.
- Lanes usually available in the lap pool 
- The cardio equipment was crowded as expected from 4:30-7:00pm... better after that. No cardio theatre/built in TVs... some flatscreens overhead. The ellipticals are Precor EFXs... not my favorite. The stride is a bit choppy and when elevated, they put a strain on my lower back. LA Fitness sets a 1/2hr max time limit on them... annoying. If anyone's waiting, I'll gladly observe a posted 20 min time limit . Having to reset time (losing mileage, calories, etc) is frustrating at slack times when plenty are available. 
The 18 star trac treadmills have  consoles had built in fans (3 recently "under repair"). There were about 4 "stair" and 4 "step" stairmasters. There are plenty of Star Trac reclining cycles (not in demand). I didn't see Cybex arc trainers... did see 2 rowing machines. It would be nice to have a couple of floor fans available for us heavy sweaters. Paper towels & cleaner are available... and janitors wipe down equipment (thankfully!).
- Lockeroom was larger than expected and reasonably clean. No competing for space to set a gym bag. 
- The front desk and trainers were friendly and helpful. Not pushy or disinterested (if you're not purchasing training/supplements). 
- My only gripe with LA Fitness in is that they closed down my old location that they had purchased from Pure Fitness a few months ago  on extremely short notice (ie: I read a notice posted on the night they closed on 1/31 . 2 people I talked to (1 was a trainer) had 10 days notice  but others had none.  The Via Paseo location is too far south for me to travel long term... but I would recommend it to others so far (I'll try to update this to keep it accurate even if it gets filtered).First off, I loved the whole atmosphere of this place! It's a real small, family owned spot that's kind of tucked away in a shopping center and easy to miss. This may just be me but the interior has a 50's diner kinda feel with the red & chrome which I thought was cool. They also keep their restaurant really clean and that's a huge plus.

We ended up going fry crazy haha. I went with the catfish and my wife picked the fried chicken, and let me tell you...they know how to fry food at this place! Both the chicken and fish were fried completely even to a perfect gold brown. The catfish was unbelievable! It's cooked just right with that "oh, so good" tender flakiness and their seasoning is dead on. Not too heavy with a little kick and just enough flavor to compliment the fish. The chicken was pretty dang good too but it had a slight flour taste which could probably even out with a little more salt. They aren't skimpy with portions either...alongside the fish or chicken, you get 3 sides and cornbread. Their mac n cheese is just ok but they have really good greens, red beans and the cornbread was definitely up in the top compared to most places in town.

Easily one of the top spots to go to if you're looking for good fried food! They have amazing food with a good selection and with the portions you get, the price is hard to beat. We went in at about 8pm on Friday and they were getting slammed with customers so I really think they could benefit from staying open a little later. It felt like we were being slightly rushed which is why I'd give them 4 stars but I'll definitely be coming back for more!I went there with my bestie to meet a friend of mine (and his co-worker) from way back when in college. The four of us sat on the patio at a surfboard table chatting it up, eating appetizers and listening to tunes. 

What's not to like? I love the beach, beach atmosphere and sand under my feet, so the Sandbar is the next best thing.The Sandbar is a place to pick up or to be picked up; I went there for a goodbye party for a coworker. We had 6 in our booth, all ordering different drinks and food. The appetizers are pretty good, the nachos are a little better than most, the fried clams are very good (tender not chewy) and there is a great Thai chili dipping sauce.

 They have a heavy pour on their drinks which is great when you're drinking Knob Creek, however they need a little work on their mix drinks the Mojitos were just bad. 

We went 01/25/13 and Kyle was our server. He was very nice at the end of the night to help sort out everyone bill. This rating should be a 3.5 but I round up.Potential ambiance of this place is awesome. The decor, paint, music spun by the DJ were all outstanding. Very dark, sexy,swanky lounge and great patio. Went to check it out on a sat night and at 1030 there was maybe ten people inside and the bartender said that was the most people in the place at once that night.   I had only heard of this place by word of mouth. They obviously need to aggressively advertise otherwise this will be sadly another victim of Dc Ranch very shortly.Dear Baja Fresh,

Thank you for saving me from so many hangovers each time that I have stayed at the Excalibur Hotel in Vegas.  Your food is not so greasy that it makes me gag, but it is just greasy enough to soak up the excess alcohol from whichever club I had partied at the night before.  Thank you for making me quesadillas with extra cheese and for including guacamole in the price.  

I love you,
Courtney24 hour Asian food in Vegas for a good price? I'm in on that! I ate at this place twice while staying at Imperial Palace. Both times I went for soup, once for the beef Pho and once for a beef rib stew. Both were very good and reasonably priced (for Vegas!). The only weird thing was they gave me parsley instead of basil with the Pho???
The customer service was great and i received my to go order promptly. Definitely a place I would recommend for late night cheap eats.I'm going to fall back on the wisdom of the crowd with this one.  Great interior design.  Above, above average Fresh Mex.


And the Lemonade is great.I drive past this every day and never realized this gem existed right in my back yard! Definitely don't come here if you want a hike. Walking to the top of your football bleachers would be harder to do.

But if you want a pretty view, and have been stuck at home all day with your houseguests, this is the easiest, most perfect place to bring them. For locals? Come here if you're looking for a romantic spot (the ladies can climb it in heels!) But don't expect privacy! It's crowded most times of the day!I know, I rarely give anything 5 stars.  Anyways, I had to let you know I've tried so many things here including Ms. G's pesto pasta salad, chicken caesar, mexican lasagne, various/sundry other foodstuffs (fish, chix, meat, preparared foods, salads) ginger sesame chicken, & lobster .  The last ones are pre-seasoned & u just cook or re-heat so it's ready 2go.  Yum-O & definitely no where's as costly as going out 2eat.I can't give this place 5 stars yet...but soon...maybe...I hope...

I wanted to take some type of boxing classes and this was the only place close to my home.  I'm really not into the boot camp type stuff that seems to be the cornerstone of every thing this place does, but I decided to give it a shot.

So last night I dragged my wife down there for our first boxing class.  It was an awesome workout and really kicked my ass.  It was difficult to make it the entire hour because you are going hardcore the entire time.  I'm not 100% sure because there are no clocks in the room, but there couldn't have been more than 30 minutes of actual boxing stuff.  It seemed to be more conditioning work than boxing drills and mechanics.   

La Mar is a solid instructor and seems like a nice guy.  He had me motivated the entire time and gave me a killer workout.

The class size was a bit too large for my taste (about 15 people) but the large facility easily facilitated everyone.  I also think they need more punching bags for a ratio of 2 people per bag instead of 3 or 4.

Anyway, my wife and I are probably going to sign up for a few more classes and see how it goes.Fresh items and great service. Definately know how to do sushi right!Why Total Wine is better than Bevmo :

1) Bevmo does not like you to get joy from being able to pick from rows and rows of single beers so you can build your own special pack
2) organization 
3) About every beer you can buy in a 6 pack you can find on the "single" shelves as well. Wait did i already state this?

I love me a good beer tasting and Total Wine lets me go bananas with my choices.

Love you TW&M !This is really not a bad Walmart as they go. There really is a huge selection of everything here. The prices are killer. Though THis time of year is not the best time to shop.
You just have to make sure that you get here early before things get crazy.
If you do come early , you have more to choose from and there are better parking spots.
The deli is quite impressive as well. A t for the workers here they really try to make everyone happy. Which is a tough job.Wolfpack is definitely something to howl about.  Big, hot, and delicious.

A little disappointed at the lack of hollandaise sauce optioned meals at this location, but there was still a ton to choose from.

Service was quick and efficient which was nice because the place was packed.Cool candy store with rows of old and new candies.  Some of it I remember eating as a kid, and some I have never seen before now.  The walls are covered with cool posters of oldies but goodies, like Lucy and Three Stooges, and then there are the bottles of soda everywhere.  

I counted so many different root beers, and I kept looking for the one chocolate soda I had as  a kid, but got so confused, i don't know if it was ever found.  

A really cool store full of nostalgia and sweet treats.Wow, a new pizza buffet restaurant in town!  Ok, new to me.  I am SO THERE!  ...Eek, it's 23 miles!  Oh well, my Yelp friends Daren & Norm have both just tried it & said it was good, so where are my keys?

Arriving around 11:30 AM, I joined a good crowd of crotchety old seniors (even older than me!), & of course families with kids.  They offer pizza, salad, spaghetti, & dessert rolls for a super low price, & it's enough really, or there's the "Lunch Special" which adds some more tasty items for only an additional 50 cents.  I opted for the whole enchilada (ok... enchiladas are only on Thursday), got situated in a comfortable booth, & charged over to the food line, dodging canes & high chairs all the way.

The "appetizer", if you please, was a delicious chicken stew.  Then the salad bar had more selections than you usually see at this kind of place, including a nice, meaty, macaroni salad.  After salad, it was on to good fried chicken, mashed potatoes & gravy, corn, Shakey's style "Mojo Potatoes", & more.  Everything was good, including the meaty spaghetti sauce.

Oh yes, there was pizza, too!  I appreciated that you could get THIN crust, & pizza with borders that didn't extend half way into the center of the pizza!  There were enough choices with MEAT, the cheese was stretchy & good, & they kept the pizza table stocked up with a good number of choices without waiting.  My favorite pizza was an odd little guy with cheese & bacon, a crispy thin crust & no tomato sauce.  It was really tasty!  The others I tried were good too.

With tasty food, sufficient choices, comfortable seating & atmosphere, a friendly, appreciative staff, & super low prices, "The Pizza Buffet & Much Much More", IS!   :-))

Lunch:  $4.99 or $5.49! - Senior:  $3.99 or $4.49!Had another excellent meal here and was able to try many different item. The Melted Pecorino Cheese ($9.50) was wonderful. Melty cheese, fresh sliced granny smith apples, crostini and honey made for many different tastes and contrasts with each bite. 

For my entree I tried the Fettuccine & Meatball ($13.95) which was a different take on the classic. Their alfredo sauce tasted fresh and bold, plus the fist sized meatball was so tender it barely held its shape. Fantastically delicious!

They also get their house bread from Arizona Bread Company, which was light, soft and had just the right amount of chewy crustiness. 

I dig this place, haven't had a bad time yet! Though the service was a bit off this last time. We seemed to be blown off once another table was sat next to us, we still had a great time.

BTW.. if you're having trouble finding parking, there is a garage just west of the restaurant to an underground parking facility.Even though it's in our neighborhood, it's just one of those places that we have somehow passed up. We thought it was a rather odd/dead area to make a restaurant, but when we walked in it was rather bumping. 

They brought over the chips and dips and it wasn't a afterthought. The chips were warm and they included a chipotle salsa, a smaller spicier green salsa and warm refried beans. Now, I never get my combo plates with beans because most disappoint me so I get all rice. As we were waiting and I took a bite of the beans it's the closest to my abuelas I've gotten. I don't any beans but hers because hers has a porky flavor from the lard and the bones she cooked the beans with. I started to ignore the salsa and I was eating the beans which really surprised my BF since he hasn't seen me touch refried beans the whole time we're together. 

I ordered a horchata ($3) to drink and it was worth noting how it's different from a soda dispenser taco shop mix. It is much creamier and you can see large pieces of fresh spices in it. 

For my entree I got the chile verde with all rice and corn tortillas ($10.89). The sauce had some kick to it and it had potatoes in it which I've never had before. The pork was very soft and juicy. 

BF got enchiladas and got one carnitas one with chile verde sauce and one cheese with mole sauce ($11.89). He enjoyed both and liked that you didn't have to order only one kind which most places tend to do. 

We had room for dessert and couldn't decide between Sopapillas or Churros so we got both. Sopapillas (3 in an order) were crispy with a soft center and they came with packets of honey (which makes it much easier to drizzle) and whipped cream. They were sprinkled with cinnamon sugar which the BF said next time he'll order without since he kinda likes it when it's just simple honey. Churros (4 pieces) came with whipped cream and your choice of dipping sauces- we chose cajeta/mexican caramel and raspberry sauce.  Pretty good and I like that they have a variety of sauces to choose from. I forgot the price for both, but they were pretty reasonable between $2-$3.

Service was really friendly, outgoing and caring. The entire staff was very pleasant from our server, to the hostess, to the bussers. 

I was not feeling well and I was really cranky when I came to eat. Sometimes that can make a meal a bit less impressive so I think it says a lot when it can break through that and improve my mood even. 

With the quality of food and the friendly service it definitely is a place I'll come back to.This is such a great park to go for a run/jog! I used to be able to just go here right out of my back yard so it was really convenient. I've seen some really beautiful sunsets running through here and I really miss that about this place.Valentines dinner...  Place was packed and the food was amazing.  We sat near the kitchen window and I was impressed with the sanitation and the quality of food that appeared to be being cooked and coming out.This is our favorite seafood restaurant in the Phoenix area. Steamed clams & sourdough bread are wonderful to start with - have had this many, many times and the bread is always warm & yummy, clams fresh - seasoned perfectly. 
Have had many dishes here and they have always been good. One of my favorites is the chopped shrimp salad - the shrimp has always been fresh - with the firm, sweet taste of fresh shrimp. The clam chowder is great too! 
The fish dishes are fresh - we have had many of them& sides very good as well - the plates displayed well. 
We have never had a bad experience with the Service here either, always cheerful & accommodating. 
My only complaint is that the last time we went there the clams were served in a bowl in lieu of the pot they used to serve them in - otherwise would have given it a 5th star.Really nice vibe in here and the beer was delicious. Super hot outside and an ice-cold beer absolutely did the trick. The service was superb and the overhead movie was pretty funny. I will return here again I am sure. Just wish you had a few more snacks. Or maybe I'll bring in my own?? Hope that's okay because I wouldn't want to miss out on your beer.Rosati's was my go to while in Kansas City so i was glad to have one close that delivers. The pan and double dough are my favorite as well as the calzone and a decent salad.I had been wanting to go here ever since it opened.  My wife was not thrilled because how good could a trendy steak joint in the mall be, right?  Well she was half right.  Honestly the place belongs in a hotel in Vegas.  The place is not intimate at all and you know you are in a mall (or one of those restaurants in a Vegas hotel).  The decor is ok but a bit over the top.  Sure, I prefer a more low key steak house, but this place was very interesting and great for people watching.

About the food:

* Bread they give you to start - I like it that they don't give you a bajilion pieces to fill up on and ruin you meal.  They just give you 2 small pieces of each of their 2 different kinds.  One was a "stuffed baked potato" bread and the other I don't remember.  What I do remember is that they were so frikkin good.  The butter stuff was amazing as well.

* Hot & Cold Wedge - One of the best and most interesting wedges I've ever had.  I originally thought you shouldn't mess with the standard wedge, but this one was excellent.

* Roasted Beet Salad - I don't really know what beets are or where they come from, but this salad made me a beet fan.  I've tasted about 3 beet salads in my entire life and this one was amazing.

* Filet - My wife and I split the 12oz which was more than enough.  It was cooked perfectly and was excellent.  It was flavorful and juicy and LOVE that it was cooked with butter and just the right amount of sea salt (I think).  Anyway, I love it.  Probably one of my top 5 favorite filets.

* Classic Mac N' Cheese - This was very very good but not excellent.  It was indeed classic and really nothing special.

* Honey glazed, braised and roasted carrots - HOLY COW!  Why couldn't my mother make these when I was growing up?  They were a-m-a-z-i-n-g!  I guess if you put enough sugar on anything it would be good but wow..just wow.

All the wait staff was excellent and very friendly.  The prices were a bit much but I expected it to be a rip-off so was semi-ok with it.

The place was pretty busy so there were tons of servers buzzing about and carrying plates of stuff past our table.  Everything I saw them carrying looked frikkin awesome.  I honestly can't wait to go back and try some more stuff!The charge for dinner the other night was about $106 and we left a $20 tip in cash.  We used our Wells Fargo card for the $106.  Then today, when the charge was finalized at Wells Fargo, I see a $128 charge.  They added an additional tip to steal money!  This has to be some kind of crime.  I'm going to email the place and ask if I could come down and view the receipt to see first hand how they screw people.

* * UPDATE 4/27/10 * *

I sent an email to an address I found on the main Fox Concepts website.  I guess it was their corporate office.  Somebody got back to me within 10 minutes and said that the manager of Modern Steak would call me asap which he did.  I don't remember his name, but he told me he was sorry and thanked me for bringing this to his attention.  It turns out my waiter added another table's tip onto my tab.  The manager told me this happens all the time and was an honest mistake.  Personally I think it is BS and I caught them doing something shady, but I've never worked in a restaurant so I don't know if it was an honest mistake or not.  Anyway, the manager said he would refund the money asap.  I'll update again when the money returns to my account.


* * UPDATE 4/30/10 * *

The $22 has been returned to my bank account last night.  All is right in the world and I can rest easy!What a beautiful place!  I had lunch here earlier this week and couldn't get over how spectacular this place is!  The food was good, the service was good, but the atmosphere was amazing!Me and my hubby went to restaurant together, because we were attracted by the beautiful decoration. The steak I ordered was delicious, but my husband didn't quiet enjoy his burger.  Same taste as the normal " non fancy" restaurant, but overpriced a bit.I went there today to stock up on wine for my rental cabin in Flagstaff on the recommendation from my girlfriend who went over the weekend. 

She RAVED about how helpful everyone was.  

Apparently, I'm not nearly as hot as my girlfriend. 

To be fair, she went on the weekend, I went on a Monday at noon, so I'm sure it's better staffed on weekends. Although no one asked if they could help, I did have one guy offer a suggestion, so really that's not bad compared to almost any huge store.  I ended up getting a great variety of wines from around the globe, 24 in all.  Prices seemed good, but I didn't exactly bring my abacus so don't quote me on that. 

If you want a massive selection, along with cigars, beer, and wine accessories, give Total wine a shot.It's been almost 8 months since I reviewed this place, & I'm trying to have an absolute favorite Chinese Buffet on the seven miles of "buffet row" on this street to recommend to friends, but it's soooo hard!  There are five Chinese Buffets along Bell Rd. here, including this one, China Garden, Shanghai, Great Wall, & Zen, & they're all good!  Each one earns 4-Stars from me in different ways, even little China Garden, the nearest to this one.

Here's what I particularly liked about New China Super Buffet today:

*  Terrific Hot & Sour Soup, with meat in it!

*  Cherries!

*  Calamari, not overcooked & seasoned just right to be tender & tasty.

*  Lobster Rolls!  I don't know how many micrograms of lobster they had in them, but they were good!

*  Interesting food variety, including some American & Mexican items, including Chicken Quesadillas today!

*  Four flavors of REAL ice cream, including the delicious Chocolate Chip Mint I had.

This is a nice place, with lots of windows & an airy look, something like Sweet Tomatoes on Ray Rd., but lacks a few things you would get at Great Wall, for instance, such as more sushi (there was a little), & Mongolian BBQ.  Good place, though!

Lunch Buffet:  $7.46/$6.72 Sr.

PS:  Yet another Chinese Buffet by the owner of Jen in Chandler coming to the old Hometown Buffet building at 17 & Bell Rd. next month, & it's sure to be excellent!    :-))I went on a busy Saturday night with my husband.  We didn't call to make a reservation until just before we left... got in at 8:45 -- our fault for not calling.  We showed up early to enjoy the bar, crowded but still comfortable.  Excellent drinks (you could actually tell there was alcohol in them!)  We got a table earlier than 8:45 and sat down.  We were happy to see the pricing was reasonable.  The only downside the whole evening was that the dining room was as loud as the bar -- but we were still impressed with the FOOD.

I had the squash soup (OHHH SOOO GOOOD) and my husband had the house salad (excellent) (both only $2 to add to our entrees).  I ordered the special of the evening, mixed grill and got to taste 3 separately delicious dinners -- generous portion for the $18 pricetag.  Fish with an excellent sauce, sausage and creamy polenta, and some rotisserie chicken.  All excellent, when I go back I'll probably get the rotisserie chicken - YUM. My husband had the hanger steak.  It had a guijilla (sp?) sauce that he loved and the meat was tender and deliciously prepared. ($18? as well)

We loved it and can't wait to return with some friend for an evening out (just don't forget the reservation!)Have eaten here three times. Wood-fired dishes are quite good, especially the chicken--steaks not that great. The squash soup was excellent the first time I had it, but tasted inappropriately sweet the next. The cioppino is the best I've had anywhere. Unlike Louisianne's, which adds pasta, this is a wonderful, thick tomato-based broth  with lots of fresh seafood and that's it. I'll be back for the cioppino. Kind of noisy. Looks like a good singles spot.Admittedly, we only came here because HnJ had a line 45 minutes long, we were hungry, and Cajun Crawfish (CC) could seat us right away. We had been to HnJ several times in the past, driving right past Cajun Crawfish (CC), due to previous poor Yelp reviews. We're glad that we took the chance, and would definitely come again.

12 of us rolled in around 9 p.m. (this place is open until  midnight on a Sunday night).  We were seated right away in the back area, near the Karaoke and the dart boards.  A fish tank was present, storing live crabs and crawfish.  The kiddies got a kick out of watching them swim about.

We ordered what we would normally order at HnJ--2 lbs crawfish each, medium or spicy, house special sauce. I changed it up a bit, getting a fresh dungeness crab. I was surprised and pleased to see that they grabbed a crab from the tank--nothing like fresh seafood.

The wait time was short, and the food piping hot.  The broth used to season/spice up the offerings was more souplike, rather than pasty like HnJ, and very flavorful.  Dipping the Cajun fries in the soup is a must, as is dipping the corn and potatoes into the broth. We asked for separate bowls of just broth, and ended up pouring most of it into the bag of leftovers that accompanied us home.

Complaints:

The chicken wings and chicken tenders did NOT come with fries.
The darts are pretty beat up, and lost their fins midflight.

Pretty minor complaints, i know, but thought i'd throw it out there.

We initially went in with HnJ on our minds.  If you seek to compare the two, there is no comparison--they are just different, with different flavors.  If you go with an open mind, and just expect good, flavorful seafood, you'll get it at Cajun Crawfish.It was a bit pricy $45 for just a basic mani or pedi, with no discount for the pair. Jonna was very sweet however and did a wonderful job. They has a very limited selection of shellac and a fairly small selection of regular polish. Lots of beige and pinks though.Deliciously flavorful juicy burgers and fries!  My boyfriend says its one of the BEST Italian beefs he has ever had.  I would like to see more on the menu, but it is a good thing that they stick to what they do best BEEF!Went here for brunch for the first time the other day.  It was a great little place for breakfast.  I was excited to be able to order a breakfast meal at noon as well after a late night.  

The place is cute, and was busy.  I ordered the Lumberjack (i believe it's called) which came with 2 HUGE pancakes, 3 sausage links, 3 eggs and potatoes.  The pancakes were DELICIOUS.  I highly recommend trying them.  I couldn't even finish half of the plate, but worth the $10 regardless!  I can't wait to go back and try one of their griddle plates!Delicious!  I had the ginger chicken (my standard when I eat Thai).  My Mom had a yellow curry tofu that was pretty good as well.  We also had a Satay appetizer that was really good and came with a peanut sauce and pickled onions and cucumbers.  Everything was fresh, the portions were huge, and the service was really fast and friendly.  A great girls lunch.This place is pretty poppin! It's true, drinks are pricey. The bartenders don't know how to make anything except the usual hoodrat cocktails... but I have to get over myself and realize that this isn't the place for a fine cocktail.

It is also true that there are all sorts of different lines to get in to this place. I'm not one for standing in lines, so me and my party ordered VIP front of the line passes for 50 bills each. We walked right in.

Awesome lighting and ambiance, a bit crowded, but I'm fine with that. Ratio was decent, and I had a great time! 

Oh, and that bass. It's monday now, and I'm still feeling it.Was there when they first opened and thought it was so so.  Decided to give it another try recently and now I'm hooked!   Hooked on the cold drunken chicken!  Several dishes I've tried have also been pretty good.  They have a large menu of food and drinks/desert.  So it'll take me awhile to try them all.  Cuz I'm hooked on the cold drunken chicken!Food was good, service was awesome. Some dishes can get a little pricey, but overall not bad. You must have the banana foster bread pudding. To die for!Love it, great $5 gyro lunch special....I'll be back!!What a fun place to go on a Saturday night date night!  My Husband and I went here because I've been dying to go based on the reviews on yelp.  Before going I had our meal all planned out in order to try the things people have most commonly recommended on yelp.  So, we had the valley butter, etc., which was so good, we especially loved the honeycomb.  We also had the braised leeks, which were tasty.  The jidori chicken with spatzel was my favorite.  It was so juicy and crispy and the spatzel with greens was amazing.  We also had the ginger cake, which was good, but not great.

I really liked sitting at the bar watching the chef cook our meal and other meals, especially because I loved to cook.  I enjoyed the fact that they had only AZ wines/beers; the wine was great and my husband enjoyed his AZ beer. 

It was a great dinner and we will most certainly be back in the future!!!Great dumplings and bulgogi. Warm servers and pretty decent menu. Will go back for sure!We used to live about an hour's drive from Napa so not only were we able to visit the "mother ship" original Oakville Grocery from time to time, an Oakville Grocery not unilke this one was opened in Walnut Creek, California which was near our home.  We were happy and frequent customers of the Walnut Creek location.  We moved away from CA about ten years ago and were sad to hear some years later that Oakville Grocery in Walnut Creek had closed.  Surprised too since it was always quite busy.

So when we were planning a visit to Scottsdale and a friend who lives here invited us to a Superbowl party with the request we bring an appetizer and a bottle of wine, we searched Yelp for specialty take out options and were happy to learn of the new Oakville Grocery in Scottsdale just a couple of miles from the resort where we're staying!

Yahoo!  Walking in the door of this store brought back many great food memories.  Shopping at this store on two consecutive days created new memories of great food.  

The first day we picked up delicious cerignola olives, wonderful sauteed broccolini and wild mushroom lasagne from the prepared foods section and a carton of banana gelato from the freezer case for dinner back at our villa unit after a long day's drive from Las Vegas.  It was perfect.

We also placed an order for arancini and some fresh made mozzarella to pick up the following day to take to the party.  We returned the second day to pick up the order and while we waited on it to be packed up we enjoyed a lunchtime bowl of yummy, tomatoey, just right for chili heat tortilla soup from the sandwich / soup / pizza counter at the back of the store.  

We used the mozzarella in a caprese salad and it was delicious.  We have to say that having consumed many arancini at the other Oakville locations (and many, many more in other venues) we didn't find these to be the best we've ever had, but good enough.  

The counter staff were all so helpful.  The aisles of specialty items were well stocked with all the things that make Oakville Grocery "the place to find 'it'". And as for the cheese case...there is not a retailer we can think of who does cheese was well as Oakville.  Wonderful.

Lots of seating too, both inside and out, to sit and enjoy a nosh.  Since the coffee service window opens for coffee and goodies a couple of hours ahead of the store itself, it's a fun way to start the day sitting at the outdoor tables.

The only drawback here is parking at this location is awful.  Just a few parking spots out front, it seems, or one has to use the garage across the street.  The limited parking could be a negative for Oakville's business when parking is so convenient at a local Whole Foods market that provides some pretty good analogs for the Oakville specialties.   But for the week we're in town, we'll "brave" the parking problem several more times for the benefit of getting our Oakville Grocery "fix".  The pastry counter beckons!I always get their breakfast sandwich special combo which consists of a perfectly cooked eggs, ham, bacon and their special sweet sauce. The service is always a warm smile upon entering. Also try their Chai Latte if you are a fan of Chai or want to become one. their dessert waffles and pizza waffles are very good as well, the smell is incredible MmmmOrdered the "sweet p" which is a pumpkin waffle with apple pie topping, caramel, cinnamon, whip cream, & ice cream, but I switched the waffle to an organic flax one & put the ice cream on the side for later. It had pretty good flavor but it got soggy quick from the toppings even without the a la mode so eat it quick! My daughters eggs & sausage were great. My husband ordered the waffle breakfast sandwich, it was good but didn't quite compare to our waffle sandwich place in Portland OR, the flavor spot!In the mood for waffles come to this place.  Wonderfully light airy and crisp waffle.  Wife clamors for them from time to time.  Be a five star rating but they don't have much selection beyond their waffles with uber toppings.  Give them a try you won't be disappointed and you'll be helping a local mom and pop shop!Best burger around. The bacon is super crispy and they don't skimp. Would be a five star if it was faster during lunch but they're always busyBest burger on MillFirst time at Fifth and Wine... just stopped in for drinks and nibbles.   Sparkling wine from New Mexico (aka champagne in France) and a small salad.   We'd go back there again.  When in Scottsdale...We love this place!      The service and food have always been excellent. Please disregard the groupon patrons ratings..  I have yet to figure out why those who buy these discounts are so hard on the places they visit. Must be some Freudian guilt thing.                 Anyway, a great place to enjoy some great wine and food with friends. The a fresco dining is nice.  The only thing that kept them from a 5-star were the poker playing dogs painting (yes, kidding). Go there... have funCome here every Sunday for my paper. Love to find the good name brand stuff too.The Golden Nugget has certainly improved since my last trip to Vegas. The Chart House space is beautiful and modern. There's a huge fish tank in the center of the space. If you're seated at the bar, it'd be quite a view. 

The menu was similar to other Chart House restaurants I've been to. We had the Hummus appetizer, which was perfect to share while we had our cocktails. We shared 3 salads: the chopped, heirloom tomato, and roasted beet. We liked them all. For dinner: 2 pasta/seafood combinations, sea bass, lamb chops, and a twist on surf & turf (seared scallop and short ribs). The only disappointment was the short ribs (tender but flavorless). The portions were so generous, no room for dessert. 

All in all an enjoyable meal.Enjoyed a wonderful lunch meeting here last week with a great view of the famous aquarium. While we were eating the aquarium was being cleaned by professional divers and the experience was surreal. I had the watermelon/feta salad and the blackened flounder with asparagus, and walked out in that sweet zone between hungry and stuffed, also known as 'just right'. Service was excellent as well.Pizza was great! service was so-so. maybe it was because they were closing in about in hour when we walked in, but we constantly had to ask our waiter for our water because he 'forgot.'  The table we sat at outdoors was very unstable, I felt as if my beer was going to fall off the table and the wine glasses were going to fall and crack as well.  But other than that, pizza was exceptional and so was the salad.Having lived in the San Francisco bay area as well as having been to China several times (where the food is no better than you can get in the Bay Area!) I can say with conviction that great Chinese food does not exist in the Midwest.  That said, Tom's Red Pepper is your best option for Chinese food on the west side of Madison (Soga Shabu-Shabu and Ichiban are probably the best in Madison).  I live 3 minutes away so have never ordered delivery (figure it'll be hotter if I get it myself!) so I can't comment on that.  But when we're in the mood for Chinese food, Tom's is our go-to choice.  The owners are there every time (I think Tom also does most of the deliveries) and are nice, friendly, hardworking people. And yeah, you do get a lot of food for your money, but unlike most Chinese restaurants in Madison you can actually look forward to eating the leftovers.I will confess that I tried U Bake last year when I was putting on a cookie decorating party for my husband's team.  I purchased the gingerbread men and sugar cookies in holiday shapes.  The cut out shapes come frozen.  The cookies were excellent  (rich tasting unlike the Pillsbury stuff from the grocery store)  and baked really well. The store had decorating sprinkles and such but I found that I could purchase similar items for much less at Woodmans.    Got a big tub of prepared frosting and piping supplies from the Vanilla Bean just down the road. Everyone had a great time.I met a small group of people here for dinner on Saturday night (4/7/12) at around 6:00pm, and was quite pleased with the experience.  It went a little something like this...

We were promptly seated near the bar area, which was OK by us.  The interior is open, a bit craftsman-like, and a little on the noisy side.  Our server stopped by immediately to gather drink orders; Brickhouse has 40 beers on tap, most of which are microbrews from around the USA, and all are reasonably priced.  

Server left to get the drinks, and we browsed the menu.  Brickhouse leans toward the southern side of BBQ - there are grits, collard greens, and spiced apples - all of which are fine by me.  

We decided to try the duck legs and the pork quesadilla for appetizers, entrees were ordered as well.  I was really tempted to try the Cobb salad, but opted for the two meat combo, after seeing other tables receive their combo plates.

Quick side note... I've read the many raves about the Bourbon, Scotch, and Whisky menu here.  After carefully studying the menu, I have to say: "Meh."  Yes, they have some OK stuff, but it's really over-priced, and there's nothing outstanding that comes to mind, aside from the Pappy van Winkle offerings.  Everything else is fairly pedestrian... So, if you're looking specifically for good whiskys, this probably wouldn't be my first choice.

The appetizers arrived - the quesadilla was excellent.  High quality (read: low moisture, low grease) cheese, and a TON of pulled pork.  The side of salsa was great as well.  The quesadilla was devoured in seconds - sort of like the neighborhood dogs that steal the Christmas turkey in "A Christmas Story."

The duck legs were good, but duck is fatty... and I'm not a huge fan of greasy/fatty food, so it wasn't something I'd order again.  Others at the table liked it, but not as much as the quesadilla.

We refreshed our drinks and shortly thereafter, the food arrived.

Light eaters take note: the plates here are HUGE.  And this is coming from a guy who can easily eat an entire apple fritter from Greenbush bakery.

My two meat combo platter featured pulled pork, ribs, collard greens, and spicy green beans, with a piece of cornbread.  If I had to guess, I'd say there was a full pound of pulled pork on the plate, along with 5-6 ribs.

I'm a bit of a rib snob, so take this with a grain of salt - the ribs were good, but not outstanding.  A bit gristly, a bit fatty, and I swear they had a hint of pine taste.  Good bark.  Just not really my preferred style of rib.  Rib lovers - go to Knoche's Meat Shop on Old Middleton, buy the baby back ribs, and make 'em yourself.  You'll never go anywhere else...

The pulled pork was superb.  Moist, smoky, lean, and delicious.  Really a winner.  The sauces (molasses, vinegar, and mustard) were excellent as well.

Spicy green beans were a bit oily, but good.  Greens were superb.  Not over-cooked, full of flavor, and really good.

I sampled the mac-n-cheese, and the rave reviews are accurate - the stuff was phenomenal.  Get it.  Even if you're on a diet.  

Brickhouse = WIN

Food = 4 stars -- solid
Service = 3 stars -- average
Value = 3 stars -- average
MISC = 4 stars -- good beer list, nice interior

I will definitely be back.  I'll order the smoked chicken, pulled pork, and mac-n-cheese.  Oh, and a sandwich... those looked amazing as well.

BBQ is polarizing and subject to a lot of personal opinion.  And in my opinion, this is a solid place, especially for a Wisconsin 'que place.I love running. When Groupon Madison offered a deal for Berkeley Running Company, I was pretty curious.  I visit Madison about 3 times a year and figured I'd use it at some point. Alas, the Groupon was burning a hole in my pocket during this trip. 

The running store is located just off the bridge in an upscale little shopping strip across the street from Whole Foods. Go figure. There's plenty of parking spaces and the store is a bit on the small side, but chock full of really nice running gear. The staff is really helpful and friendly...come on! These people run and it shows. Of course they're happy! Anyway, I ended up buying a cute pair of Smart wool socks and a Tiger Tail. Mmm...Tiger Tail on sore muscles= Bliss. 

Worth checking out if you're in Madison, but be aware that it's a short car or nice bike ride from Downtown Madison.Came here with a group of friends (4 people total). Started off with a mojito (was standard) and my friend got the ginger pear julep, which was pretty good, a little on the sweet side. Note that this restaurant is not traditional in the sense that it isn't in an enclosed area but rather just an open spot in the Aria, a beautiful hotel. 

Stand outs for the night included the creamy risotto (this one went SUPER fast), steamed mussels (delicious and you get a lot), flat calamari (whole calamari, not diced or cut up), the huevos estrellados (fries with the chorizo and egg, very good), and the tuna cones. 

Downers were the brava potatoes (they were okay) and the white ceviche. 

All in all, a decent meal and a fair price (considering it was Las Vegas). Portions are a little small so make sure you ask for bread and use it to dip it into all the different types of dishes!Tasty foods, nice service!  The reason that I didn't rate 5 stars is that it was too noisy.I really liked Julian Serrano. I'm a lover of tapas restaurants and Spanish food in general. 
It's best to come here with a group of people so you can get a little taste of everything. 

Some of my favorites were the tuna cones and the white anchovies on toast. 
We also got a huge skillet of paella. It was filled with lobster tails, scallops, shrimp, mussels etc.

Although the paella was very good, it was a little dry. 

The service was great throughout the night. Overall, I would probably go again sometime.Had their prix fixe menu: stuffed peppers, pork chops, dessert. It was all very good and reasonably priced. Our server was very good and I liked the decor.Great breakfast selection and a well sourced local and wholesome use of ingredients. The "Callejero Style" corn on the cob is one of the best items on their menu. The mesquite grill always delivers fantastic smells and titillates your taste buds. The Chilaquiles Verdes is my favorite breakfast selection, almost rivaling Chelsea's Kitchen's version...almost... Great for road and mtn. bikers.No Vegas trip is complete without a stumble to the Sugar Factory for a drink or two...or five. I haven't actually tried the food, so this review pertains solely to the drinks.

After hearing my girlfriend rave about this place for months, I decided to give it a try on a trip to Vegas. I must admit, I had pretty high standards after hearing about how impeccable their drinks are. I'm sure glad that I listened to her.

The key to maximizing your experience is to go during Happy Hour (I think 3-6 PM?) since all drinks are 2 for 1. Most drinks will run you about $14, so getting the benefit of this deal is pretty crucial. I've tried a lot of the drinks on the menu, but a few in particular stand out: S'Mores Martini, Golden Graham Martini, and the White Chocolate Martini. No matter what you choose, you really can't go wrong. Relative to Vegas pricing standards, these drinks will give you bang for your buck. Also, it's like eating dessert at the same time. Pretty sweet!

Great place to spend a few hours in the afternoon with your friends. Nice ambiance in the restaurant, friendly service, and the location is easily accessible(right in the middle of the Vegas strip). The drinks do take a little while to come out, so make sure you're not in a rush to get somewhere.I liked everything except for the service... our waiter seemed to hate his life. He wasn't real friendly... and it seemed like it took a long time to get everything. They really need to install water filters... water is gross :( 

The only reason they are getting 4 stars is because I would give the pizza 6 stars if I could. I think next time I'll just get it to go.Came and stayed at the Aria for our mini vacation just this past week. Started our club/lounge experience with the Gold Lounge. My Husband did a lot of research for hanging out at said lounge/clubs so we could get the best experience, and brought several small bills for TIPS.

We got in free, and paid the $10 "open bar" fee for women and $20 for guys. 9:30pm to 11:30 pm. They gave us little paper bracelets and a small stack of drink tickets.

We all dressed very nicely, not vegas skank (ie: huge platform stilettos so high you can't walk and don't match your too tight tube dress showing your boob loaf and thong lines), elegant but sexy. There were 3 girls including myself and my Husband and my friend's Husband. So two nicely dressed guys flanked by 3 good looking girls = a table without charge.

We were just walking around the lounge seeing if there was something big enough to fit our group, and one of the bouncers inside said it was okay for us to sit in the corner in this "reserved" signed seating. We had a HUGE mirror on the wall, a small leather love seat, a table, two chairs and a stool for our use, and we were sectioned off from the other group next to us by curtain.

We started by getting drinks. We waited patiently at the bar, as the side we were on was less visited compared to the other side. A lady bartender, "L", poured our first drinks. We find out this open bar is a highballer's dream. Meaning you can get alcohol with a mixer ie: pineapple juice, cranberry juice, soda water, coke, etc.
Being the first of the night they were very weak- with a lot of ice. We weren't surprised being the small price we paid. Also while sitting at our table, we were discussing how attractive the bartender was and as girls, we should rightfully inform her how awesome we thought she looked.

Ready for second round of drinks, as the first were super light they went super quick, we wait at the bar and a different guy serves us but "L" comes back over and this time my Husband is at my side with a fiver in hand (note the first time we got drinks, even if we knew they were going to suck, we gave her a good tip). I also had my GFs with me, and we gushed to her how we loved her figure/looks! She was very happy and thankful and started chatting away with us while pouring our drinks... and kept pouring... We got a stronger drink this time around for sure.

There are 4 single bathrooms, and by the start of the night there is no line really, but when there was a guy posted there, my Husband got to know this gentlemen too! We were making friends all over this place! Everyone was super nice! Every time we went to the restroom, we were told which one was open and was asked how our night was doing etc. Fabulous people :)

There was a DJ, and the music wasn't bad, but few people were dancing, and those who were- no one apparently wanted to dance with them.

By 11:30 "L" had invited us out to a club on Monday night and gave us her contact info, our drinks were so strong by the end we couldn't finish them, and we were having a great time!

Unfortunately, by 12 they had to kick us out of our spot, by a giant bouncer! He was so sweet though, I told him we had to leave and he was like "Oh don't go, you don't have to leave, we just have to shut this part of the bar down". We were all thoroughly wasted though on our super strong drinks.

So by 12 they started pushing any loungers out onto the dance floor area. That was the only thing I didn't like about it, but I can understand. A waitress came around twice in a gold dress, but we liked our bartenders so we continued to go to them instead of the girls. The busser boys were very obvious in their working and constantly flashing lights in our faces :/ 
And there was a crowd of people at the dance floor bar side. Full of all sorts of guy types, and uninteresting looking women. Go with a group of friends to hang for sure, don't go expecting to pick anyone up, you'll probably be disappointed. Be sure to pass the good karma around- it may lead you to good things!Jimmy John's sells tasty sandwiches. The service is quick, even during the lunch rush. I got a combo with a pickle... and received not a sliver, but a huge, deli-style pickle. Oh, and they deliver, which is nice when you need a sandwich and can't leave the office, or the couch.

An added bonus is they offer free smells. These are really nice when you're not in the mood to eat, but want something satisfying.I got a groupon for this place and got a great massage from Nathan. I wasn't expecting to make a second appointment, but the receptionist told me my second appointment would be at a groupon price as well. The receptionist was super friendly! That was my first professional massage and it was a great experience and very relaxing.these guys are great - they have are walking distance from any office tower downtown, have a good selection of coffee from all around the world and a fantastic menu of locally sourced food & delicious sweet treats.

they could do a little more with the decor.. but then i like homey, comfy feeling coffee shops best!  

be sure to check out their pastry happy hour in the afternoons for 1/2 price pastries!I rented a full size, but they did not have one ready.  They offered a free upgrade to a SUV.  So, we took it.  In and out in less than 10 mins.  NICE!  

We were suppose to bring back the rental on Wednesday at 6pm, but due to traffic in CA we missed the 6pm closing time.  We called before hand to inform them we were going to be late due to traffic.  The branch manager, William Ray said if I bring back the rental by 7:30am on Thursday, they will not charge me extra.  But I did receive a call from another person from the branch said that they will charge me when I was on the road.  I told him was William said and all he said was but you are late.  Maybe I will charge you 1/2 a day???  WTF!!!  

When I returned the rental on Thursday morning, I did not say anything to see what the charges were.  No, they did not charge me an extra day or charges.  And I was out of there in 5 mins.  I am not sure what the mis-communication was but in the end it worked out.Big fan of Yogurtland...they are definitely better than Golden Spoon!  They always have great flavors that they keep in rotation which is nice because I like to always change it up...like my women!!! haha j/k :)

I luv the holiday flavors...especially the pumpkin pie yogurt!  Give this place a try and I promise, you will be hooked!

Cheers!So, as it being my first time in Vegas I had told the ones that I was with, that I wanted to take a photo in front of the Vegas sign.

I'm glad the weather was alright. When we got there, there wasn't any parking so the car dropped us off and circled around. The line was long with people standing in it to take a photo in front of the sign. If you don't want to wait, you can go on the side and take a photo.

There's a guy working it, a lending hand if you will for families or anyone that want to take a photo with everyone in it. There is only one side that says "Welcome to Vegas" on the other side it says something like "drive carefully."We came across this club by accident by a promoter that was giving out wristbands.  We decided to try it out and ended up loving it!  No it isn't as huge as Pure or Tryst but since we are all from Austin, it was just our kind of spot and atmosphere.  The music was great!!  Didn't know it could get as good as the DJ at Pure! :)  Yes, there was a lot of "old school", but the good old school!!  It made it fun and made you 'take it back'!  We all loved it!I came here with my Mum when she came up to Edinburgh to visit me. She loves a good Thai and I had heard from a friend that this was one of the best in Edinburgh so suggested that we gave this place a try.
I like a good spicy meal and asked the chef to make a hot chicken green curry which he had no problem in doing, my Mum had the king Prawn green curry and we both agreed that it tasted great.
The decor the the Celadon is a bit plain and boring but the quality of the food more than makes up for that. 
it is a bit on the pricey side however, with the King prawn green curry costing around £11. I would suggest that the best time to come in would be for lunch where you can get a 2 meal set menu for around £13.Mmmm I love Johnny rockets.  $22 gets you 2 orders of burgers fries and a soda. Groupon had a discount so check it out.  I hate pickeles but it was just so.good in my burger.  Sometimes it can get very greasy but they made it just right this time around.Very excited yet another PB that opened and super close it's about time they came out this way! Fire roasted tomato soup and some Paradise pasta I devour the stuff!! Dont hate...appreciate! The cookies and bread are good yumgasm's alone. Who wants to come with me next time!?!?!This Applebee's went out of Business December 2013.  Was a great location and good food and Staff.I love their selection on christmas ornaments and women's robes :)Had a groupon for a hour and a half ride. Was a lot of fun. Friendly dogs greater us as we got out of the truck. They were helpful with getting on and off the horse. The horses were well trained. I think my boyfriends horse just wasn't in the mood and took her sweet time. Lol. Crossed the river twice, that was cool! 

Just an overall great experience. Gave 4 stars cause our guide got upset with me and my bf cause our horses wanted to eat and not fully cooperate with the group. Had to stop and help us a few times. Sorry! We don't know how to control a horse. Lol!This place is my new go-to for Italian beef now that they no longer serve it at Famous Uncle Al's. It's good, but not great, and purists will bemoan the underwhelming seasoning of the beef. But you can't beat the price, especially as part of the lunch combo, which adds fries and a soda for next to nothing. Even if giardiniera are extra this is still a great value. 

The ciabatta on which the sandwich is served is good enough, but the bread's not as important when it's soggy from gravy. Fortunately, the au jus that Rosati's includes is more than good enough to make up for the underseasoned beef.

Combined with the giardiniera, this sandwich is filling enough that you don't even need the fries that come with the lunch special.Two trends that need to end.  ASAP.  Really, ahorita:

1.  Bacon mixed with everything under the sun.  Bacon doesn't need an accompaniment, it's amazing all on its own.  No more bacon donuts.  Please, for the love.

2.  Overuse of truffle oil.  Dumping truffle oil on a dish does not make it gourmet.  Please stop.  For real.

Culinary Dropout is guilty of succumbing to these two trends.  That being said, the service and atmosphere make it forgivable.  Our server and the manager were hyper aware of how long we'd been waiting.  Even though it was not that big of a deal to us, it was nice to know they cared.

They mean well when it comes to cocktails, but they were a little lightweight for me, relying heavily on simple syrup and mixers to dumb down the alcohol.  Their beer list made up for it, though.  I've never had a stout in a can, but they managed to find the brewery that pulled it off.

Yeah, my ricotta gnocchi was drenched in truffle oil, but the sausage and mushrooms made it actually a pretty good dish.  And the beets were fresh and delicious.

I liked it, I'm not gonna lie, but I wish they'd stop falling prey to the trends and branch out a bit.  Culinary Dropout, you're better than that.We took my parents here on Saturday for Father's Day to try something new. We got there around 6:30 and didn't have to wait for a table. We got seated immediately. Now, I'm a nondrinker so I can't really rate the drinks but their cocktail list is insane. 

We started with the soft pretzels with provolone fondue which was TO DIE FOR. So delicious and flavorful. I recommend it to everyone. 

We also ordered some cheese and meat off the antipasti menu which was delicious as well. The cheese was very moist and flavorful and the capicola had just enough pepper to give it a hint of spice. 

For entrees, I ordered the short rib pasta which had delicious flavorful short rib in a yummy red sauce. It wasn't too heavy or too light. Just right. My boyfriend ordered the MAC burger which is basically just a glorified Big Mac only better. My mom got the smoked chicken salad and my dad ordered the coq au vin. Everyone seemed to be happy with their choices. 

We had to skip on dessert because we were so full after wards but I can't wait to come back and try some more delicious food!I've eaten at Culinary Dropout enough times that I've probably tried half the items on the menu. It's a great place to enjoy a "hip" evening on the town. The outdoor seating is especially nice and they have heat lamps for when it gets a little cold out. The pretzel fondue appetizer was a crowd pleaser. The meatloaf, butternut squash cannelloni, and chicken curry are standouts on the entree menu. The best aspect of this place, though, is the amazing service. The staff is incredibly friendly and attentive.This is my fourth time here.  Obviously I like it.  That being said, the service today left me wanting.   I believe they lost my reservation, the one where I asked to sit outside.  My party of three had menus on the table for almost 30 minutes.  They forgot to make our appetizers and noticed, when the bill came, they even forgot to write it down.

All that being said, the food was wonderful.  I had the chicken mole and guacamole.  Very good.  My guests had flautas and sea bass.  It looked very good, and they loved it.
I would go there again.  Maybe just a bad night.Food was good, Staff was super friendly ..... I'll be back for sure!!!!!!Probably the only place in Phoenix I frequented that really gave me the feeling I was in New York.  Kind of reminded me of the back room, save the tea cups of alcohol service.  The crowd there is usually upscale and older than the 21-30ish crowd that Old town attracts.  Like many places in Old town, there's only so much you can say about the good times you had there, but here's a buzz word:

"furry party" (ok not really but we wore animal masks like fools)

The oysters and happy hour menu are very good. The bar tenders are all really nice and definitely know their drinks.  - The type you can tell "make me something with XXX" (that can be annoying so if its busy be sure to toss them a nice tip).  If you are my friend Darnell Halloway you will probably ask for something pink colored. (he asked me to reference him in my reviews to improve his SEO) 


(the only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is so that it stays relatively off the map)My boyfriend and I got the falafel sandwiches with fries for dinner.  I was not a fan of the fries, but it was the best falafel sandwich I have had in the States!  The owner came out while we were eating and told us about the history of the restaurant.  It was great fun and really cool to chat with him.  When you go be sure to get the whole story for yourself!There is nothing like a dull knife to ruin your day (or a perfectly good cooking session).  What a convenient cure for such a frustrating problem.

Sharpvan is at the downtown market on Saturdays and we stopped by check it out.  This guy knows his stuff and seems to be able to sharpen just about anything.  He also has a nice selection of knives aboard.   We dropped of 2 knives on our way in to the market and they were sharp and ready to go by the time we left - wrapped up with the tips stuck in a cork to prevent any mishaps on transport.  

Now our knives are sharp and good as new.I dream about these donuts...mostly because the shop is about two minutes away from my house and I am a HUGE donut fanatic.  I must say that I do prefer the location over on Flamingo and Buffalo a little bit more simply for the fact that they have a wider selection.  This location has the basics, but even when I go early the variety is not huge.  This is still more than okay because the donuts are delicious and I can always get my hands on their tasty apple fritters and chocolate bars!  The gentleman who always works there is very polite and nice.  A half dozen will run you just a little over $5 and a dozen is about $9.50 (this all depends on if you get "specialty" donuts like apple fritters and cinnamon rolls).  Charges on debit/credit cards must be more than $5 or you need to pay cash.

I think I need donuts for breakfast tomorrow.We got upgraded to the 1bedroom suite & it was awesome! I was a little worried after all the mixed reviews on yelp. But we really enjoyed our stay. This is a nice contemporary styled hotel.

Pros:
We got our room for $85/nt through Priceline's name your price (last min)

We got upgraded at check in to the 1 bd suite from our regular rm

No wait for our room & it had a full kitchen and livingroom, not to mention the jacuzzi in the bedroom and lots if towels & TP

Cons:
There was a 2 item combo from panda express thrown all accross the carpet, right infront of the elevator when we got to our floor 
thats the first thing I saw (they did clean it when I told the front desk)

Pool was closed early due to "high winds" as mentioned in other reviews, but it wasn't windy.

Upon check out they told my BF that if we weren't out at 11am, they check the cameras and will charge a $60 late check out fee (they must have known I lag and check out late) despite the threat we left the rm @ 11:30 and weren't charged (maybe the detective was off that day!)

I tried to call the maid and front desk & my BF tried to call rm service- we never got an answer from anyone. I'm wondering if the phone lines are jacked...

All in all it was a good stay and I would def recommend this place for the price, although the Venetians still my favDescent food, great drinks and outstanding management.  The manager was so observant to what his customers needed and what his staff was doing.  Great job.When my cousin informed me that her 18th Birthday dinner would be at Thai BBQ, I was surprised.  I associate places called "Thai BBQ" with fast food, and an 18th Birthday for us is kind of a big deal.  

When I walked in, I was pleasantly.  It was a very clean, nice looking and nicely decorated restaurant.  It was very quiet - not too many customers, but still, quite quaint.

They sectioned off part of the restaurant for our exclusive use.  My aunt pre-ordered trays of food and they laid everything out with plates, etc and we would get food at our leisure (buffet style).

First off, the food was delicious! The Pad Thai was one of the best that I've tried (and I don't usually like the Pad Thai at places) and the Chicken and Beef Barbeque (especially the ones on the skewer) were very very tasty. :] Both had just the right amount of flavor that complimented the food. They definitely know what they're doing.

On top of the good food, they had GREAT service.  The waiters were always on top of things and even cleared your plate as soon as you were finished.  One waiter even asked me if there was something I needed help with or needed just because I was looking around. That kind of attentiveness comes around quite rarely.  PLUS, when all was said and done - you know, cake, presents, the works, they even helped us to carry out the leftover trays and cake to the car. Now THAT is going above and beyond. :]

Overall, I really enjoyed the food and the atmosphere and would love to go back and try it as a regular customer and not just a "party guest." lol. Oh, and there is also a Karaoke set up - although, I don't know if they actually use it. :P I'm down to find out! :DThe lunch specials during the weekdays are a nice bargain.  And what makes it even better is the selections offered, which should offer something interesting for everyone.

My favorite is probably their BBQ Chicken, and is juicy and sweet. I can probably eat 2 or 3 plates of these while I watch a DVD :p

I usually try a curry dish at Thai restaurants, but have not been here enough times yet to give that a try, but they look really good.  I tried the sate dish (pork) served with fried rice, and with the peanut dipping sauce was just plain good eats!

Their service was good, even when the restaurant is busy.  But I suggests going early to beat the lunch crowd rush.

Looking forward to going back again, now that they have $10 for $20 Dinners Groupon promotions today. http://gr.pn/hCCId1 

Service:  4.5/5
Food:  4/5
Price:  4/5
Location:  Not close enough for out-of-town visitors relying on taxi for transportations, but great for locals working/living in the SW.three full grown men shared two plates.  and we had some togo. 

The fried chicken is decliious. the most crispy buttery tasy chicken i ever bit into.  the taste is more asian however.  tasted more like garlic soysauce Korean pub fried chicken. But still it wad fried perfectly and delicious. 

we also had the meat loaf hash.  the meat loaf was really tender and juicy but it just didnt hasve enough flavor to it.  ketchup needed.Yummm! Came for breakfast on a whim when in Vegas.  My friend had seen it on the tourism channel at the hotel.  We had about a 35minute wait, well worth it!  The food is huge - TOO huge, yes. BUT delicious! So often you got a lot and it sucks, but this was great!  We ate until we couldn't eat any more, but weren't sick, just super full.  Basically, we weren't hungry for about 8 hours! More time to visit!

My friend had the buttermilk pancake with toasted coconut - DELICIOUS! The pancake was HUUUUGGEE!

I had the hash with artichoke, sun dried tomatoes, mushroom, and spinach.  It came with eggs (I had over easy) and a biscuit. I ate about HALF! 

My gf had the hash with salmon and cream cheese; also YUM!

If I went back we would def split and get an extra biscuit. But for the quality and quantity, $14 bucks is not too bad! Also: lemonade and pineapple mimosas are YUM!To sum it up in 3 words:
Epic meal time.I love hash house! The portions here are huge. The first time I went I got the sage fried chicken benediction. I ate about a third of it before I was stuffed! I like that they have a unique take on benedicts - they use biscuits instead of egg mcmuffins, include a layer of mashed potatoes, and it's topped with scrambled eggs instead of poached, but you can request poached on the side if you want. They also come with their own unique sauce rather than hollandaise.

For my second time I shared with friends and had the blueberry pancake, quesadilla, and pork benediction. The pancake was good; very fluffy and came with a good amount of toppings. The quesadilla was delicious and like the benedictions, come with a layer of mashed potatoes! The pork benediction wasn't as good as the sage one I had my first time. I also wasn't expecting the pork to come fried. It had to much breading and the meat was a bit tough.

If this place served regular human portions, I would decrease my rating to a 3. But the portions are ginormous, food is decent, and the menu has a wide selection making it suitable for groups. There is always a line, but platinum members and higher are seated pretty much right away!Ordered Corned Beef, red onions and swiss cheese and the sage fried chicken.  Huge serving!!! It's best to share it with a group.Huge brunch crowd, little bit of a wait, but totally worth it.

This place is in the Imperial Palace which is under construction right now-- a little bit of a hassle to find... We were told that the wait would be about 30 min when we arrived on a Saturday morning, but I doubt it even took 20. This place is huge, and they put out a lot of food.

All I could think of while I was there was how much food this place must throw away every day. The portions are gigantic. Really out of control big. I was starving, and I doubt I ate 1/3 of what was on my plate.

I ordered the Fried Chicken w/ Bacon Mashed Potatoes, Biscuit and Eggs. My husband ordered the Fried Chicken Benedict. I liked mine a lot. He LOVED his. The bacon mashed potatoes were the standout for me. I thought they were excellent. The fried chicken was really good too-- it's fried with sage, and has a maple reduction. 

Waitress was very friendly and attentive.

We'd definitely go back. For the price and the amount of food you get, I'd say that this is one of the best values in Vegas.I took my mom here for brunch when she was visiting from out of town.  We had a good experience, the service was great and our waiter was very friendly! Our waiter warned us that the portion sizes were huge, so my Mom and I ordered a scramble and pancakes and I opted to make the biscuit that came with into a biscuit and gravy...  we were able to try a variety of items and still have food left over.  Overall definitely enjoyed the experience and the food was great and we had fun!Service wasn't the best, but considering how busy it was, I didn't really mind. The food was awesome...HUGE portions! I got the smoked salmon scramble? Not sure what the actual name of it on the menu was. But the Bloody Marys WON me over. I absolutely loved them - plus they've got a Bloody Mary bar (also serves screwdrivers) to keep you entertained while waiting to be seated. Also tried their banana pancakes.. Amazing!!!!!HH is a fantastic place for breakfast! Been to two locations in Las Vegas and both are consistent. Plan on waiting because this place is popular and rightly so.....but it's well worth the wait. I had the dishes from the traditional breakfast to chicken and waffles. If you like pancakes, I highly recommend the Snickers pancakes....yuuuuummm!You want a big-ass burger? Look no further.

Hash House A Go Go has one-pound burgers by default. Yes, you will literally weigh an extra pound after finishing a creation that takes up most of your plate.

Will you have a food coma afterwards? Youbetcha. Is it worth it? Absolutely.I came here yesterday after a great weekend celebrating a friend's bachelor party. With 4 of us left, it only took about 20 mins to get a table.

The portions here are huge and the prices to match. If you don't want to leave in a stretcher or get a doggie bag, I would recommend sharing a plate. Two of my friends go the chicken and waffles, which were 2 giant chicken breasts with 4 bacon waffles. and we're not talking fluffy light waffles, we're talking batter dense waffles. I got the Chicken, potatoes, eggs, and bacon with a biscuit.  that was also very good.  the chicken has a great seasoning on it and lots of moisture, especially for the breast meat. potatoes had (I think) grilled mozzerella in them, which was cool.  The biscuit was surprisingly a little on the dry chalky side, but they had some nice jam and butter to help that.

If the portions were smaller and prices lower to match, it would definitely be 5 stars, but the portions and prices were just a little to ridiculous for me. But I guess that's Vegas? or maybe the expanding waistline of America.I was driving back to my friends house that I'm dog sitting for, and saw that they opened a Jersey Mikes here.  I've eaten at Jersey Mikes before, just not this location.

I really liked this place.  They have great hours, are open late and have a nice variety of subs to choose from.  They come in a few different sizes, and are made to your liking.  The gal that helped me was really friendly and helpful, and was able to carry on a conversation while she placed my order.  

I ended up going with the famous mikes, which was turkey, roast beef and all the fixings.  Quite tasty!  I will gladly return!I by chance stopped here while in my stay in Arizona.
As you can see I live in Los Angeles where smoking lounges are a rare find.
I was so delighted with Cubano's.You can tell alot of love is paid in the attention and care.
Friendly staff and a great selection of all your favorite cigars.

Great source for a gift as well they have a very nice selection of cutters and lighters.
The establishment is very clean and well filtered along with lots of leather seating with couches and classy wing back chairs.

They host NFL games (or anything you want to watch) with plenty of tv's to watch the game of your choosing.

Cubano's also has a seperate area for your private card games.
It's just simply a very cool spot.

The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because this place isn't in LA.America's is a consistently good place to grab a burro or tacos. Today I called in a take out order. The woman who took my order asked if I was aware that the Melrose Street Fair was taking place, and I totally forgot. The great employee gave me directions to avoid the traffic and road closures. Even better, she told me to call when I got there, and they would run out to my car with my order. What great service! Where else does this happen?

Food wise, the food is good, and chips and salsa are nice. I think the salsa could use  a little work, and could be hotter, with some more zip. Along the same lines, the guacamole seems to be getting a little watered down, and the consistency is more liquidy, almost like they were getting low on avocados, so they diluted it? Not a deal breaker, just different from usual

I totally recommend this spot, and if they can just tweak the salsa so the hot salsa is HOT, and not designed for the Sun City crowd.Great burger. Try the Blue-cheese.Great burger but the sweet potato fries are out of sight! Not far from where I work so it is becoming a regular stop.the steak i had was terrific.  but the best part was seeing mike tyson there.  i sent him a chocolate cake with the help of my waitress who was super friendly and accommodating.   there was a live piano player playing great tunes the whole time.Service: 5/5 (From beginning of planning the event to attending the event)
Food: 4/5
Ambiance: 3.5/5 Private rooms can use some more decor/personal touches; IMHO, it was pretty plain

We had a party of 32 ppl, and we opted for the private room upstairs.

I worked with Carly and Brandon to set up this event. Everything went as planned--overall flawless experience. 

Ordered:
Starter--Family Style:
1) Lobster Roll--4/5: My favorite
2) Seared Ahi Tuna: 3.5/5
3) Mini Crab Cake-3/5

Entree:
22oz Bone in Ribeye--Delicious! 4/5
Chilean Sea Bass: 4/5
12oz Bone in Filet: 3/5

Dessert: YUM!
Creme Brulee: 4/5
Butter Cake: 4/5
Cheesecake: 3/5My family and I eat here almost every Sunday... Though get here early to avoid the wait. Food is good, and they've tweaked their menu to show the calories of every dish as well, which is great for those who want to be health conscious. 
The prices are average, more expensive than Denny's but the food is superior than Denny's as well. 

Much better in service and food preparation than the Cave Creek one, which out of the ones I've tried is the worst one. The Bell road one is between the two and Camelback one is also top notch.Very awesome place! Nice people and they make your drinks just right. Come on by you won't be sorry!It's not as bad as the previous reviews say. I mean how bad can it be? After all, they sell video games.I think that all Victoria's Secrets are essentially the same, but I like this one location in particular because, 1) it's close to home, 2) It doesn't seem like it's always crowded, 3) Service is great!
The ladies there are actually very helpful, and friendly, I haven't encountered any stinky attitude, and they've treated me really nice. I recommend this location!Sooo worth going there versus "the other guys"..why pay regular price elsewhere?I visited the Battlefoam Corporate Headquarters while I was in AZ for a convention and had a blast. The building is in an industrial park and holds their retail store as well as about six tables that you can game on if you bring your miniatures.


"The Good"
- The staff. Kyle was manning the register the night we were at the store and he is a great guy that can hold a conversation down with pretty much anyone. Also, Romeo was there and it falls back to the old grade school attitude of you give people you respect a hard time because you feel like you already know them. There were other folks running in and out making last minute arrangements on tables and product for the next day and each one gave a smile or a "Hey" as they walked past.
- The selection of product is great. Not only do they obviously have the full selection of Battlefoam, there is a large selection of 40K and WFB. The latest kick is Infinity and the full range is stocked.
- The scenery used on the tables is top notch and you can tell made with the intention of being played on... 
- Display cases filled with beautifully painted miniatures.
- Gaming area is well lit.
- There are stools for you to rest on when you wait for your opponent to make their moves.


"The Meh"
- Once people get over the fact it is in an industrial park you will settle in. Since this is a fairly new trend and one that is growing... it will be more commonplace.


"The Bad"
- The fact I live in MD and this place is in AZ...Love Starbucks. Obviously. Dakota is super sweet and I love when she serves me. My only irk about this location is they don't carry their fat free cream cheese! :(I've been coming here for pedicures for while now, and never experienced a problem. They are clean, professional, and do a thorough job of scrubbing away the callouses on my yeti feet.

Andy can be pretty funny if you mess with him, but they don't try to force conversation. I like that I can just sit back in the massage chair and watch some Storage Wars (it's somehow always on!) or play games on my phone while I wait for the transformation to my new, soft, baby feet.I generally loathe salespeople and almost didn't purchase my iPhone yesterday because I couldn't do it online. I walked line the store ready to smack down the first pushy salesperson like an annoying knat. But my sales guy, Chase, completely surprised me. He saw that I knew what I wanted and spared me the upsell bull that makes me want to kill. He even pointed our a discount I was eligible for without me asking about it. 
In the end, Chase made this a surprisingly painless deal. I don't know if the entire staff operates line Chase, but I know they should.YummmFirst time at a Red Robin. Went in for their specialty limited time only Oktoberfest Burger. It did not disappoint. Ingredients were fresh, and the burger itself was tasty. Lots of menu choices - I only wish the pretzel bun was a regular choice. Most of all we were impressed with the cleanliness of the restaurant. Perhaps because it was relatively new, it was not very busy at the beginning of the lunch "hour". Waitress was attentive, honestly friendly, and very helpful (wish I remembered her name). I really liked that the tables were high, so you don't have to bend over to eat. (Parents should love this as it keeps your children from leaning their elbows on the table! ;)Great little neighborhood find! Loved the fish tacos. Great big portion sizes for a cheap cheap price. Friendly staff, clean restaurant, fresh food.

Easy to find at the front of a strip mall. Lots of parking, plenty of seating. Owners take pride in the food and the service. Highly recommend for a quick bite when you're in the neighborhood.Fun place to go with friends, even when you don't know how to line dance!

I went here after we had some drinks at the lounge on a friday night. 
they charge $10 for cover, but i gave them my players card # and I got thru for free so did my friends who went with me. 

i don't know how to line dance or anything like that because I am not usually a saloon kinda girl. LOL but, I think I'm going to go for the lessons lol on Wednesdays in the future :P

I had fun!!The service was excellent.  Our server was attentive and genuinely friendly.  The bus boy did not let our water get below half full.  The food is tasty.  The bread they bring out is good.  The chili oil dip for it is great.  It has a nice flavor and a little kick.

For my meal I had the philly cheese steak with truffle oil fries.  I love the flavor truffle oil gives fries.  They were great.  The cheesesteak was also pretty tasty.

For desert I had the tiramisu.  It was great.  The flavors were solid and distinct.  My friend had the cheesecake.  It was very good, and was a huge portion.

There is a good wine selection.

It is a bit pricey.  The cheesesteak was $24.  Most of the more formal meals were in the mid 40's.

There are several flat screens televisions through out the dining room.  The Godfather was playing on one, so that made me quite happy.  They also had some games on.This place is pretty great! I love there Hawaiian BBQ Chicken! Their Spam is delicious!I really like this hotel, as many others have said it is a beautiful property.

I will focus this review on my only complaint which is the lack of Marriott Rewards Elite recognition by the property.  I booked this property via Marriott and expected typical Elite treatment: Room Upgrade, Exec Lounge, Free Breakfast, etc...  The Cosmopolitan offers none of these amenities to Marriott elite members.  The only real benefit to staying here is receiving Marriott Points.

I do like this property but the typical "Marriott Loyalty" does not pull me to this property.  For someone that stays 75+ nights per year in Marriott properties, a big reason to continue staying at Marriott properties is the upgrades and perks.  I received none here so the next time that I am in Vegas I will likely stay somewhere else.With all its sleek, stylish, art-inspired, sophistication, I have fallen to its artistic ambiance. This is a place for art lovers. The way it is designed and decorated seems like one would be "in the wrong" but you "are in right". Moving scenes showcased in rows of columns in the lobby. The parking garage, I must say is spiffy with its marked "red light" lighted parking space if occupied by a vehicle and a "green light" over the parking space if unoccupied and one better zooom in that car you are driving to park it before someone else cuts you through from that parking space. Each parking lane have a sign telling you how many parking spaces are available...number comes up in big bold light! of available space! No sense driving through the parking lanes if you see "0" (zero) means no parking space available. Don't you feel like being some place else when you can't just park the car? The access to the hotel from the parking garage is via entrances that are adorned with artistic murals. Clean sophistication greets you as you enter the hotel of several main floors. Oh and beautiful people abounds inside the hotel. The rooms are sleek sophistication as well with a view of the "Strip", the Bellagio fountains and endless view of Las Vegas beyond your eyes can see. The Ice Rink at the Boulevard Pool is a joy to scrape that ice skates on ice overlooking Vegas skyrises and lights. Love the pink cascading crystals of the "Chandelier Bar". Feeling that James Bond Girl persona in the "Vesper Bar". More at being in Vegas, here u feel the high-end vibe, feel like a million!Just the right amount of wrong! 

Thanks to my bf who gambled at the Cosmo a couple times, we were given comped rooms at the Cosmo for our last trip to Vegas in August. I've never stayed at the Cosmo prior and so I was pleasantly surprised with our stay. 

Check-in was a breeze and probably the quickest check-in experience I've had at any hotel. They also offered a $50 upgrade from a Terrace suite to a suite facing the Bellagio fountains with a jacuzzi tub. We passed on the offer since we figured we wouldn't be staying in our rooms for very long. The hotel clerk also mentioned that for hotel guests, entrance fees to all the clubs were comped from Monday-Friday! This is a huge plus for guys since it can cost a guy upwards of $75 just to get into Marquee on a Friday night! 

As we walked through the hotel up to our rooms, we saw many artwork and statues along the way. The whole feel of the hotel definitely caters towards the young business professional. Once we walked into our room, we were surprised how big it was! There was a tub, shower, bar area, living room area with a fold out sofa bed, and the main bedroom was separated at the end of the room with a king sized bed facing a spectacular view of Aria, and right below us was the pool. The entire room was beautifully decorated with ornate wallpaper, and Art Deco style artwork. 

My only concern for the room was that all the lighting were programmed in uniform so if you were to turn on the lights in the bathroom, the lights in the rest of the room would light up as well. This created a bit of a problem for us since my bf and I couldn't figure out how one of us could use the restroom without turning on the lights in the middle of the night to wake up the other person who's sleeping. 

As part of the hotel amenities, there's a gym and a pool area for guests. We were able to spend some quiet time relaxing by the pool, which I enjoyed glazing up at the spectacular views. The pool was separated from the day club so there were actual lounge chairs available without having to book a cabana. We didn't find the time for the gym which I'll definitely schedule for a short workout in the future since I heard they have a boxing ring in there!Went to Expert Taylor after seeing some good reviews on Yelp and because they had the lowest price for all tailors I called to hemm some suit pants. Staff is very friendly and provides great customer service.

Went with 3 suit pants that needed work and the first estimated finished date was a week later, I asked for one to be done a couple days earlier so I would have the pants for my first day at a new job and they agreed without charging any extra fees. I show up to pick up the one pair and all three were done! Made my day...and the transition to the new job a lot easier.

Quality of the work was good and their flexibility just made it that much better.Five stars to the rehab team, 4 to nursing and social service/case management staff.  The facility is beautiful and clean.  Cef and his rehab group helped my little sister in her struggle to regain her motor skills after her stroke at a young age.  However, we had some issues with some of the nursing staff and had to demand my sister get another nurse one evening. It was taken care of right away but should not have happened to begin with. They do have some really caring charge nurses and CNAs though.  Some CNAs need more training on how to deal with specifically with stroke patients, especially on transfers and bed mobility. You cannot ask someone who is still recovering from a stroke to just stand-up or roll in bed when they can't move half their body.  In some cases, they don't even realize half of their body is their because 
of hemineglect from the stroke!!!

Thank God I have a healthcare professional background or else my sister would've been sent home and not continue her rehab as she so badly needed. It took some talking (and begging) before the case managers finally agreed to send her to a place to continue her rehab. She is now walking without a cane and is learning how to drive again.  Even though she still does not have functional movement of her involved arm, we are still very grateful for the staff's help in her journey to recovery!Love the yogurt and toppings but I wish they would get rid of that smell and maybe add more flavors but other than that id say it is the best fro yo in town(:This location is the best in Vegas. You can actually sit down and eat lunch on tables and chairs and not leave smelling like meat. I like Capriotti's but wish the other locations had better seating like this one. 
This location was very clean and doesn't make me feel like a dirty trucker eating at the counter. This is also a convenient meeting spot when I'm meeting clients in Southern Highlands.
I first loved the Bobbi, Thanksgiving in a sandwich sans the "moist maker" aka gravy (for you Friends fans), then went to their meatball... S. Highlands has the BEST meatball...tender, and just really fresh tasting, then I tried the Capistrami...not a fan at first because there was just too much going on, but then I learned how to order it right...hot peppers in the pastrami, extra swiss cheese, and hold the Russian dressing because the coleslaw is enough. Delish!
I know they have good cheese steaks but I like making my own at home.
Depending on the other locations, you better be prepared for errors and omissions on your orders...especially if you call it in.Well this was my first time at Cabo. Like most restaurants serve breadsticks Cabo supplies you with tortilla chips, salsa, and bean dip while you decide on your meal. For my appetizer, I had the bacon wrapped shrimp. Like most places with this dish they put cheese in between the bacon and shrimp.  The presentation lost some points with me because some off the cheese was seeping out. But they served it with crispy fried onions and a tangy sauce, close to honey mustard but with a little kick. 
For my main dish, I had the chicken fajitas. This dish came with grilled chicken and vegetables, flour tortillas, Spanish rice, bean dip, sour cream and guacamole. If you don't have an appetite when you come here, order this dish and share with someone else. 
Lastly, for dessert I had the deep fried ice cream. Nothing really special about this dish.  It's one scoop of vanilla ice cream surrounded by crispy tortilla chips coated in sugar and cinnamon.I was little apprehensive about stopping in this store because of the horrible non treatment I received a couple doors down at Tracy's Watermark, and I was afraid because of the location I might be met with the same kind of boutique snobbery.  Thankfully,  I was wrong.  I was greeted immediately upon entering and took my time browsing.  I love stores like this that are full of beautiful and interesting things to look at.  They have great gift ideas and decorative items to add a unique touch to your home.   Aprons, cook wear, candles, plaques with cute sayings and seasonal items to name a few.  Who doesn't want to buy a Christmas ornament in April? A varied price point although some things I thought were high like the $60 salt and pepper shakers that I could find at TJ Maxx .  The employee working checked on me a couple times and answered the couple questions I had. I bought a couple of things and I will be back.  

Tracy's Watermark should get some tips from Thyme in the Kitchen!  They know how to treat customers here!This place is on the eastside, and tucked away into a strip mall.  It's not a trendy, hi-end spot...these guys are real artists doing real work.  

Jerry, owner, has a calm, positive energy...and true artistic talent.  His brag books are impressive (he's got hundreds of custom fonts), and he apparently does Ne-Yo's body art.  In his workspace, he's got  books on various world cultures and the history of symbols.  I'm pretty sure he even had a copy of the Tibetan book of the Dead.   He's studied in Thailand, China & Japan, and mentioned that he's been invited as a guest artist to shops in Japan and the UK.  These guys know their craft and take it seriously.  

 I have to gripe because we had to wait 2 hours before even sitting down.  But once in the chair, they were quick, efficient, and had gentle hands.  I paid  $70 for a nice touch-up from his apprentice on a decade-old tat.   And I will be back next week.  I explained to Jerry what I wanted for my next tat...he got it immediately.  He's designing it now and I know it will be stunning.Very close to my home, within walking distance!

It's very clean, modern decor,friendly and a HUGE selection of polish, essie,opi etc.
Some of the customers can be seedy, when I was there some angry fat woman got upset because the manicurist was "rude" to her (she wasn't the fat lady was not kind and seemed to be angry at everyone) 

It's priced to match all the other nail salons in Vegas, I'll return for sure.The staff is very friendly even though they very busy.If you're looking for antique clocks, this is the place. I've never seen so many beautiful grandfather clocks! There are parts and pieces for clocks everywhere! They are not the cheapest parts, but they look to be of fine quality. The man who owns the store was very friendly and informative. 

I came for the antiques, and I must say that this place is stocked to the brim with amazing antiques. If only I'd a bigger budget and a way to transport some of the things he sells. I was looking for a nice antique lamp. They have lights of all sorts for sale. Everything is beautifully aged. Being antiques, they are pretty expensive, but if you're looking for authentic antiques, this is the place to be.It's Subway, you either love it or hate it. Depending on my food craving I am both. 

I love that this location is so close to my house and can easily pick up dinner on the way home. I have never had a problem with how they make the sandwich or the taste. It is very clean and never super busy so I can get in and out fast. Which is something I need if I am that close to home.I went to this grocery store today (Sunday) because I was told that on Sundays they have specials on all there fruits and veggies. I went and everything was well priced. They also have a bakery and you can actually see people baking and making the cakes and other pastries. In addition to the bakery they also makes their tortillas fresh in the store. They also have a mini restaurant inside ! This place is definitely a one stop shop and it is inexpensive.The selection of tile, and different flooring options are great. The prices are cheaper then what ive seen at Bigger stores. The employees greet you right away and help you find what you need. Great hours as well.They are always nice, and price match.Very good sandwiches, but very overpriced.

The base of the sandwich here is Eddie D's signature bread, which is easiest described as a ciabatta.

I've had two sandwiches here. The first was a daily special called the Sausage Diablo. It's a hot Italian sausage, split and grilled, and topped with freshly sauteed peppers, onion and tomato sauce.

The second sandwich I ordered was a riff on the Reading Terminal Market in Philadelphia. Semi-off-menu, I ordered up a roast pork sub prepared the way they make their eggplant sandwich, the Meadow - topped with broccoli rabe, roasted red peppers and sharp provolone. Au jus on the side.

Since Eddie D's names their sandwiches after Sopranos characters, and since my off-menu creation is essentially a "Pork Meadow," let's refer to it as the Jackie Jr.

The one hesitation I have about this place is the price. $8-11 is too much to pay for a counter-service sandwich, even a good one like this.Incredibly friendly, I had 2 others in front of me and was out by about 15-20 minutes so not slow. Just went in for an oil change. They arent expensive and they have different levels of oil changes depending on the car. From $15 to $50. Mine was $22. While I was there one guy pulled me to my car and let me know my battery was going and should be replaced. A lot of places like this try to sell you more things and I feel its what he was trying to do which is why I gave it 4 stars.Best fried zucchini and onion rings! After ordering, the food was brought to the table quickly. I will be going back!I love how this place is down the street from me.  It's a little on the expensive side if you only want something like a cheap combo from say a place like McDonald's.  I do have to say a lot of my 4 stars is based on the ambiance and service they provide.  I say ambiance because this place makes me feel very nostalgic and will usually remind me of being back home in the Inland Empire.  The service imho is outstanding with workers doing rounds picking up plates from you making sure you've enjoyed everything...
    But a yelp review albeit based on service also has to be based on how good the food is.  I have gotta tell you this is by far my favorite burger.  The Farmer's burger has everything you want and then some.  Avocado + bacon = mouthgasm... and their zucchini are real good, but careful don't take 'em home they do tend to get soggy...
    I give 'em 4 of 5 cause like many places that have transplanted themselves from other regions of the country, it makes me realize everything taste better where they're originally from.  This place is no different.Thought I should update my review since it's been a few years since my first review and Dr Tabassi cared for me through another pregnancy. It seems like there's been a lot of new staff since my last pregnancy and I only have positive things to report. Dr Tabassi is a wonderful doctor, incredibly caring and was always available no matter what issue I had... including a late night call back after an impromptu root canal in my first trimester that left me in excrutiating pain. Her receptionist was very helpful, including calling me back to let me know if we needed to move an appointment if the Doctor had been called into a delivery. All of the nurses are friendly and caring, including the lab staff.  Wait times were far improved, I had a few long waits but that's to be expected when you're dealing with labor and delivery. I can't say enough good things about Dr Tabassi, I often recommend her to friends in need of an Ob/Gyn.On your first visit, both a mat AND a towel are complimentary (to rent). Bring at least 16 oz of water (I brought 32 oz) as it is hot and you will be drenched in sweat. I liked the 7:30 pm class, but I believe all the classes would be exceptional. The employees are all very nice and helpful.Had a beef chimi at robertos a few nights ago, I was really hungry and its a lot of food. It was perfect and filled me up. The prices at robertos are awesome, the food hasn't disappointed me ever! And the service is usually spot on. Only waited a couple minutes, and they let me customize the chimi and sides just the way I wanted it which is huge for me (I don't like lettuce or tomatoes on anything!!!) Quick in and out transaction, food was really good, and its location and price is good for me. 
4 solid starsauthentic?  i think not.
delicious?  i think yes, and the serving is generous.
China One over Panda Express.  The End.Its rare to find exemplary service that not located on the strip, even more so to find people who would go beyond to just helping you but also serving you.

My life-line (my phone) to the world recently was having problems due to an upgrade and I figured it was no big deal if I just took it to my local sprint store, where they would be able to troubleshoot. An hour later in the store & I'm wondering what could possibly go wrong with a brand new phone, right? It would appear that my unit had a defect. They had been on the phone with sprint tech support, trying every possible way to get my phone to work.

At this point I had just come home from work, exhausted & figured I'd call it a day. But the next I just got this nagging feeling that I should try to take it there once again. So day 2, I see all the staff from the previous staff & I could tell that they weren't all happy to see me again onsidering I had them spend an entire hour the prev night.

BUT! That aside I was greeted with the utmost courtesy & promptness, that they quickly shot to the techs & within seconds of arriving my phone was being cared for. 20 minutes later lo & behold, they presented a solution that worked! They had breathe new life to my new phone! They confirmed there was no defect, just an error that was really hard to detect.

Prior to this I've possibly nagged every sprint agent, online, on the phone & this one particular sprint to find a way to get my phone to work!

All I can say is that I was well informed of every approach & situation they had taken, instead of brushing me off with a generic line, that's a big deal for me. I could see their worn out faces after working on my phone tirelessly & incurred no costs!I started off annoyed that they wouldn't seat us on a Tuesday night at 7:30 until all of our party of 6 was there. Generally, that is not the practice in Las Vegas. However, the giant aquarium nearby (with a tube for bathers to slide thru among the sharks) makes for a pretty entertaining place to wait. And, in fairness, once we got seated, it didn't seem like there were empty tables.

Once we were seated the service could not have been better. Our waitress struck the right balance between friendly and intrusively friendly. There were always assistant wait staff to fill water glasses and take plates away. One never had to look for the waitress for help with some item. I liked that our waitress told us the specials and the prices. I don't like to ask what the price is but I do like to know. I was a little annoyed that some of the menu items were "market price."

The complimentary hot bread was not really great; it usually isn't in Las Vegas.

I had the salmon which turned out to be the value meal as well as the allegedly heart healthy one. It was $29 and came on a bed of mashed potatoes, and with three big asparagus spears cooked just right, along with some diced tomatoes and capers.  My wife had the 16 ounce prime rib eye steak at $46 by itself. I had one bite and had to admit that it was delicious. It was rare with a charred surfaces. I avoid charred meat out a concern that it might be unhealthy, but it sure tasted good. She also got a monster $9 baked potato that was shared. 

One of my sons had the $10 roasted beet salad as an appetizer which we passed around. It was impressively good. Another had the pepper crusted tuna which was a generous portion at $36.

I would have preferred slightly softer music. 

It was a tough decision whether to give this a four or five star rating. I think you can expect consistently good service and food, albeit it pricey.We went out with a couple of our friends and had a great time. This was our first time here and I do have a few complaints as well as praises.

1) At first, when we arrived at the hotel, we were informed that we couldn't valet unless we were staying at the hotel, and that the garage sign said it was full. We drove around for about 10 minutes before asking again about the garage, and were then let in after telling the guy at the gate that we had reservations. When we got into the garage, it wasn't even close to full.

2) We called ahead and made reservations and then had to wait almost 30 minutes to be seated. There were people that just walked up before us, with no reservations and still got in before us. What's the point of making reservations?

3) The saving factor was that once we were in, the customer service was good and the food was excellent. 

My wife and I had a whole lobster, which ran about $90 by itself. We had the crab cakes for the appetizer, which we shared with our friends. They ordered oysters that they shared with us.

For the main course, we both had blackened ribeye and a baked potato. We had other food that we tried as well, but when it was all said and done, we spent about $385 with tip. Our friends spent $140+ tip.

It was definitely worth it if you're looking for somewhere very nice to eat. We sat and talked for about 45 minutes after we finished the meal and they continued to serve us water and iced tea (what I had). Not once were we rushed.

If I didn't have the parking and reservation complaints above, they would have gotten 5 stars from me.Finally found an OBGYN that I feel comfortable with in LV. Earnest, efficient, gentle and thorough. Oops.....the most important....ON TIME! I hope this ones a keeperHad a leak at one of my properties. Called out my usual plumber, who quoted me $2600 to run a new pipe from the street to the house, and that's with my other vendor cracking and re-laying my slabs for my driveway.

Called Accurate Leak Detection, and they found that the leak wasn't anywhere near that line, and in fact, was under the front yard with an irrigation pipe. It had a few leak spots, and they fixed all of them, and installed a new valve for $500. 

I was a little worried at first, since they were late for the first appointment, but after that it was smooth sailing. I do find it a bit funny, though, that they have a Yelp Loves Us thing on their website, but I'm the first review... Oh well, at least they've given me something good to Yelp about. 

Not bad for review #150!20 dollars for a spa pedi - a great price!

the place itself is pretty nice.  doesn't have that strong nail salon smell that you'll find in some spots.  the folks working there were incredibly nice and went out of your way to make you feel comfortable.

they did a great job on the pedicure the little flowers they drew on my toes were a cute addition.

service with a smile - i recommend this place!Went here to eat before hitting the club and cant say I have ever had better egg plant pizza. Didn't sound to good but after taking that first bite, WOW!!!!

The bruschetta was very very good and so was the free bread.

The service wasn't so great. Our server had a big party so he never checked up on us. Which I understand if you get a big party but dont forget about your other tables. 

The bussers were more helpful. Always asked if we were doing ok and serving us water.

Other than That it was really good for.

Definitely will return again!Solid, solid Italian food in Vegas!  We made reservations for a Sunday night but we didn't need them as it was pretty empty at 8pm.  We ordered my favorite Roman pasta dish (cacio e pepe) as an app and loved it!  I have never seen this on a menu in the States so I was really impressed that they had it.  The cheese was fresh and the pepper gave it the perfect kick...I'd order this as my meal next time!

Then we got our dinners - my husband got some dddeeelicous meatballs and pasta I got pasta with meat sauce and it was GOOD.  Like, so good I wanted to go back for dinner the next day!  The pasta was al dente and the meat sauce was thick and flavorful and stuck right to the pasta.

Our server was quick and attentive.  We never had low waters and he was always around if we had a question or needed something.  The ONLY thing I didn't like about this place was that they didn't give bread unless you asked for it, and we actually had to ask twice before they brought it out to us.  Prices were pretty standard for a Wolfgang Puck restaurant, and the quality of food was worth it!I've been home from vegas for a few days now, and I am still fantasizing about the lamb with fettuccine, and the goat-cheese stuffed peppers. 9 of us went to dinner for my cousins 21st celebration, and none of us left dissatisfied. We did the set family style menu. I could almost hear the grumblings from my sister, the worlds pickiest eater. Even she left happy. Sure, she didn't like the lamb or the goat cheese, but she said the ravioli and the chicken was to die for. What can I say, when I eat, I go for the weird stuff, not the stuff you can get anywhere. So I trust her judgement. One of our appetizers was an antipasti tray (its where the goat-cheese pepper came from ) and it was amazing. The meats, cheeses, and peppers were all beautifully prepared. 

The service was good, nothing spectacular but overall very good. Our desserts came out disproportionately late...as in 45+ after our main course was cleared. And were not even offered coffee first. Additionally, I was a little weirded out by the location,,,I am not the biggest fan of feeling like I am in the middle of a mall (oh wait, I was). I think the ambiance could be a smidge better. 

Overall, wonderful experience. I'd come back in the future, but by the time I get back out West, I will have another 30 restaurants I'd like to try first.Good food, Good service, Great experienceIt's Tempe AZ... not Irvine or Laguna Niguel, and frankly, I was ready for Mexican. I really wasn't expecting a decent short list of Middle Eastern cuisine cafes. But yet, I found that short list on Yelp. Lucky for me, the yelp reviews for Pita Shack were all good. And even luckier, after driving into Phoenix around 630p, I was tired, but tired with an appetite. I lucked out..... fresh food, fair prices, and because I didn't give in to the burger joints from Indio to Phoenix..... I had an appetite. And... PS is only a couple minutes from the Embassy Suites, Tempe.

This is a small shop, with a clean kitchen, and they cook everything to order! Don't expect fast service (although it isn't a long wait either)... because they're cooking from scratch, so to speak. While the falafel mix is ready to go, they form your falafels, and then put them into the fryer. Your kabobs are cooked to order. The only thing that was already prepared was the lentile soup, which was excellent!

For a total of $24 with tax, I ordered the Combo Kabob Dinner with steak and chicken, rice, salad and soup, the 6 pc falafel appetizer, an "abundantly filled" gyro sandwich. While I'm not going to say the overall quality was better than our local Panini Grill chain, for a family run restaurant, I feel they're a very solid 4 star. 

My wife's side is Lebanese Brasilian, and I'm around spectacular Middle Eastern food on a regular basis. I even have my own hummus recipe... so for me to feel comfortable and satisfied with Pita Shack can be taken as a strong endorsement. When I'm in the PHX area on business, and if I'm staying at the Tempe Embassy Sts., I'll probably choose PS before any other local place.Good croissant sandwich, cute place. Great service, nice people.Very nice ambiance and views.  Incredible food.  My only complaint is that I ordered the 6-course tasting menu, and each course was heavier than the last-- it would have been nice to have something light in between to help me not feel so overwhelmed with richness!Ordered delivery. Pleasantly surprised. The lady on the phone was super friendly & helpful. Delivery was fast, hot and delicious. If you have a sweet tooth, highly suggest one of their yummy cupcakes.After a great first visit several months ago, we've been back to Narai a few times, both with the kids and without. Unfortunately, they haven't been able to live up to that first experience. The service has really went downhill a bit -- but it seems like that's true most places these days. Food was still very good, but I would suggest sitting indoors if you prefer better attention.The lobster roll was so yummy I actually finished the whole thing! Had a bite of the sliders my girlfriend ordered and it was also very tasty.  My fiancé ordered the prime beef, he didn't enjoy it as much as he has hoped.. It was a little bland and chewy. Standard quality cocktails, nothing to write home about. Overall satisfactory dining experience.Shotgun Betty's rocks. I've been there twice and had fun both times. The first was during our 80's Bar Crawl and the second during my Jungle Mania Birthday Prowl. 

We weren't charged a cover either nights. The very, very young wait staff and bartenders take turns dancing on the bar. I prefer the bartenders at the Dirty Dogg Saloon because they are older and more skilled, but I had a good time at Shotgun Betty's regardless of the bartenders young age and lack of dancing skills.

The music is great (rock and country rock) and the age of the crowd varies. I will definitely return.A chic, hidden bar/restaurant tucked away off Candlemaker Row, Under the Stairs is not as pretentious as some of its George Street counter-parts. With comfy sofas and armchairs set around a wood burning stove, this bar offers classy drinks, continental lagers and tasty nibbles. If you're after something more substantial, it also has gastro-pub style meals, which, if I'm honest, are sold at gastro-pub style prices, with a main course costing around £10-15.
As it's a small trendy hang-out it's probably worth booking ahead if you're eating, but as a place to have a quiet drink and escape the bustle of the Old Town it's ideal. Definitely worth a visit if you can afford it.Been here a buncha times and always had a good meal. My friend suggested it after I complained to her about crappy burgers at Zinburger and how much my fiance and I just wanted a good, solid, delicious burger. Enter The Grind. 

My now standard order is the wings, the Steakhouse burger, and the sweet potato fries. It's been spot on every time. The only thing I would suggest is that you be very clear how you like your meat cooked. I usually say "medium" because I like it a bit pink in the middle. Their medium is actually pretty well cooked. Yesterday I talked with our server about how I like it and she said she'd tell them somewhere between medium rare and medium. It was perf! 

And that's another thing...the service is always good. It's never been crowded when I've gone there so maybe it's different when it is. My overall experience has always been good with the service there. I also really like the ambiance...kinda dark, lots of tv's with different channels, relaxed, casual, friendly. My kinda place. Definitely one of out favorite spots in town. :)She blinded me with science! Okay, enough with the cheesy 80's lyrics.  Yelp and a Vegan friend lead me to this place. I was at Sunset Station for an event, so I had to stop by on this hot Saturday afternoon. The place was full, and there was a short line. No biggy, it gave me a chance to really check out the menu. The menu was a bit confusing, but once I read it all, I was good to go. The 3 women working the store were super friendly, and let me know they would be right with me. 
I had a coffee, almond milk, chocolate chip small scoop. I am not Vegan, but this dish is, which makes me happy because it was super delicious! The flavor was good, not too sweet, but enough like ice cream to make it good. I could taste the coffee, which was nice, and it didn't have an almond milk flavor too it at all...which is okay, even though I love almond milk.  It took a few minutes to make, but really it was like watching a show when they were making it. I could have sat in there for hours watching, but then, that would be creepy. I am giving a 4 because it was a bit pricey for the size. Yes, I am sure liquid nitrogen is expensive. I would like to try it again before I determine a higher rating. 
Overall I was really impressed, and the non-vegans in the store seemed very pleased, and the staff was super helpful to a man who came in just wanting your typical "American ice cream".I go to this sushi place on an insanely regular basis - not only for dining in but also to-go. It's a super easy place to get to in the Biltmore area with ample parking not only in the free lot, but the lot that provides 2 free hours with a token. 

Their sushi is pretty legit - I know that there's a few places around town that are better, but this place is pretty easy to get to, great atmosphere, and decent prices. Their spicy tuna is one of my favorites in the universe. Or just the state - but still. I always thought the quality of the rolls were pretty awesome. 

Great date restaurant - an upscale atmosphere, but try to sit outside or in the booths - as the tables are sat way too close together for a private conversations in the dining room. However, if you sit at the bar you get complimentary edamame and miso soup.

For the most part, you get served in a reasonable amount of time. I've only had to wait for a long time a few different times, and the server was very apologetic. Overall the serves are very well-versed in sushi and saki and can be a really helpful resource. 

Also, awesome bathrooms. Which, of course, I always have to comment on. 

Last tip; Try the sparkling sake that comes in a pink bottle. Perhaps my favorite sake ever made.is nice for a relax date or get together with ur friends... is laud so u must scream a lil bit to be heard HA... sushi is very nice, drinks r so good, the service is also good. good looking place
in the week days, from 4-6 sushi/alcohol happy hr... damn is nice... but be prepare it gets packed and is a long way waiting, so get there early to be sit at 4....I prefer the sushi here above most other sushi places in town like Ra, or Kona. Tastes fresh, creative rolls, tasty drinks, great environment for happy hour with coworkers, or a fun date. Good deals for happy hour, though the rolls I like the best never seem to be in special- boo!
Tip- duh- sake bombs!
Tip- the lollipop shaped sushiGreat place for Happy Hour but is great anytime!  I have made several stops here for happy hour and I have not been disappointed.  Half-off pitchers of sangria is a must!  The Veggie Tacos and Warm Spinach Artichoke are my favorites.  The Sweet Potato fries are an excellent choice too!  

I would definitely recommend this place for breakfast too!  You cannot go wrong with anything on the menu.  My favorite is the RnR BYOB Breakfast Burrito and Endless Bloody Marys.  

I recommend this place for breakfast, lunch or dinner.  This is a fantastic place to start your night off in Scottsdale!Love the reverse happy hour...5 stars there  Yet, my first time for dinner trying to show a little bit of phoenix to an out of town guest was a disappointment. We walked in and no one greeted us, then we waiting 10 minutes and some seconds for a server. This is after 2 people came to the table to say our server would be with us soon. Drinks, chips and dip, even water would have been nice as we waited. THEN....we waited again after we got drinks to order our dinner.  But WOW, the food was great. Yes I'd go back. The food rocked!Outstanding food, solid service despite the fact that it was maybe a little slow. We had the prosciutto plate starter which was very good and also came with cornichons (French pickles).

Our entrees consisted of crepes -  I had the crepe savoyarde which consisted of diced potatoes, raclette cheese, bacon and onions and my friend had the roquefort crepe - were both outstanding...I also ordered a side of ratatouille was to die for.

It was of course Bastille day, and there was a nice musician playing the piano and accordeon.

All in all, a fun and delightful experience. The one star fell off due to slow, nonetheless friendly service...just please don't address your customers as You Guys...You know who you are - Come on  have a little class!Popular for a reason. Got some for take out, and let me say: hello, tasty pizza! Great crust (would have been 5 stars, but they were a bit too burnt), quality toppings, and super nice staff. Desserts (tira misu & creme puffs) also very good.I don't eat burgers that often but I do get cravings time to time.  I'm pretty basic when I order so I tried the classic burger with extra pickles. :) The one thing that stood out to me was the bun.  I believe its an egg bun.  Very yummy.  I also ordered a side of the veggie frites.  They were a bit on the salty side for me but still tasty.  I would probably make a return trip if I get another burger craving.Great place, exceptionally clean, great flavor selection, but outrageously expensive.  A bowl of frozen yogurt with a few berries on top should not cost almost $8.  I know it's par for the course at every frozen yogurt shop, but it's ridiculous!!  It can not possibly cost that much to make that stuff!Funny that after all these years visting Las Vegas I had never been here before. My friend YM from Lyon France suggested it. They have a killer happy hour with excellent margaritas and really cheap eats. The 3$ tacos looked excellent. 

We had dinner the night we were there and the guacamole was worth the extra $$ its fantastic. All the food was great and the portions were huge. El Segundo is an oasis of value and excellent service in a sea of overpriced casino restaurants add it to your list next time your in LV.Was out and about shopping at Fashion Show one day, and we decided to try El Segundo Sol.  Perfect choice! They have good food with a great view- right on the strip, and they have a great happy hour, gave us an opportunity to try a variety of items and see what we liked.  Great margaritas!!Went on a Saturday night for a last minute meet up with some friends. 
First, free valet there is awesome. So thankful that I don't have to drive around looking for somewhere to park. 
We ate earlier so just ordered some drinks at first. Our friends, however, had a lovely spread before them. BBQ wings, hummus, and some sandwhich (not sure which). They had never been to the Vig but were quite happy with the food and ate almost everything. They loved the baba ganoush so much that they asked for more along with more pita bread. The waitress want nice enough to bring another helping. 
Our friend wanted to try another wine, she asked the waitress to suggest something a little dryer. I was impressed because the waitress was able to suggest an alternative that my friended ended up loving. She was well versed in their wine which was fantastic!
As our first group of friends left and we got a text from a group of girl friends that were just arriving so we decided to stay. They all ordered a Take Bethany Home and let me try. It was pretty delish and definitely unique! It is a blend of cucumber vodka, watermelon puree, fresh lemon, and agave nectar. Who knew cucumber vodka would be good. My Irish husband was over the moon because Jamison was on special whe month of March because of St. Patty's day so he got a shot of the 12 year to sip on and by this time we were hungry so we ordered the bbq wings we had seen our friends eating. They were fantastic, great flavor and a little spicy. I didn't even put ranch on them! Very good
As far as the night atmosphere at this location it was very low key. I was surprised because the other vig gets very crowed. The Uptown location was full of patrons but not so full that you couldn't walk around of find a seat. We even managed to get the bocce ball court for a bit.
I am going to go to for brunch one day for sure!I really enjoy this park. It's close to my house but easy to get to from 215 on the west side from either Durango or the Sunset exit. It's got a great childrens play area, many picnic tables  with shade and a couple of Baseball/Softball fields. The public restooms are usually open and clean as well. 

I like to do my Cardio here because it has an sidewalk that wraps around the outside and measures almost exactly a mile. It's plenty wide enough when you pass people going the other way, no need to step off onto the grass to get around. 

This park also boasts a "Disk Golf" course. It's only half a course (9 holes) and I haven't tried it yet but it looks like a lot of fun. They seem to use a special kind of Frisbee though and I'm not sure where to pick them up. But would be a great way to get some exercise, enjoy the outdoors and people/dog watch.Oh Rio! You are delicious. I really enjoy burritos, quesadillas, salads with tortilla strips, and yada yada. I could spend forever telling you the food is delicious.  I know this place is a little pricey, burrito + drink =9.99, but their portions are monstrous. I cannot pick up my burrito and eat it like your suppose to. Nor would I even want to sit next to someone who tries to eat the whole burrito from here without cutting it up in pieces. They give a good amount of food for the price they charge I think. Their process of taking your order too is pretty efficient. When I first came here when they opened, everyone was excited to be there and they answered all my questions about "Whats that?", "Whats this?, etc.  They were patient and the staff is usually still excited to be there. During lunch time I would never go, unless your dead serious about having Cafe Rio right then and there. Only because everyone and their mom is there at noon. I usually go around 2pm and get out in 5-10min. You can sit outside and in, and a massive favorite of mine is their ice. They have Sonic style baby cubed ice and I love that! Its my favorite kind of ice! :) 

The one bad thing and it could totally be just me, but their enchiladas kind of suck to me. I have had better. But their quesadillas are my favorite so far.Great place and so convenient.  We were searching for a pottery place that opened earlier than 12, this is the only one we found! The girl there was helpful and attentive, continually asking us if we need anything and helping other families with handprints and designs for gifts.  
We picked our pieces and the routine was quite easy.  Big selection of paint colors, paint brushes, stencils and design ideas.  But hey when you are a kid you pick your piece, you do what you want to it! oh and you also pick what piece mommy is doing too! The place is clean, has a bathroom if needed, and has coffee and water.  
There is a nice selection of pieces, even for the holidays from plates/bowls, to character statues, piggy banks and mugs.  
The only reason not five stars is the prices are high for a kids activity.  If your child wants to do more than one piece or go often this adds up!This is a really nice place I went on a groupon and had Fahimeh do my hair she did a full set of low lights and a hair cut my hair has never looked so good. Its a small shop but it has just about anything you could want from a salon. I had my eye brows done they look great. Only thing I would change would be the hair sink you put your head in to get washed it was a bit small and uncomfortable other than that very friendly people I will be back.Vittoria on the Bridge is the newest bambino on the block from this Italian, family run business. Right in amongst the hub of tourists, night time revellers, and locals that is George IV Bridge, Vittoria is in prime position for enticing people wandering past to venture in and get some hearty and traditional Italian classics wrapped around their forks. The menu is huge, and is different for breakfast , lunch and dinner, with an extensive choice of pasta, pizza, risotto and meat and fish dishes.

Although I don't think this branch of Vittoria has as much character as the original Vittoria on Leith Walk, or the chic La Favorita, it's certainly a reasonably priced and reliably decent restaurant to attend for quality Italian food, and you can't really go wrong with anything on the menu.Vittoria's staff are super friendly and will work hard to slot in your party even if you call only a few hours in advance. They do get very busy, though, so plan ahead if you want to eat at a particular time. 

The service is excellent and the atmosphere somehow manages to be both bustling and chill at the same time. Occasionally the wait staff might seem rushed but with a full house that can be overlooked -- they consistently deliver in all other areas.

The food is good. I can't say AMAZING because having I constantly compare Italian restaurants to a place in Florence and a place in New York and never have any other Italian places come close...But taking away those two stellar exceptions, Vittoria's food is probably the best Italian in Edinburgh -- if not Scotland. Really lovely pastas and starters, only to be improved by increased portion size (please?).

This is a great place for a birthday or to start a night out. Highly recommended.Goodness at your fingertips. Flavorful breading and awesome sauce will get me working out at the gym much more to keep the cholestrol down and continue to indulge in this fried goodness.

The sauce brings it all together. Its an aioli (fancy mayonaise) with a chili pepper kick to it.

Order extra sauces so you don't run out near the end due to dipping the fries and the buttery toasted bread in along with the chicken strips! Chicken strips! Just saying it makes me smile. Chicken Strips!My first time trying Raising Cane's.  I got the box, and I liked the chicken fingers, the dipping sauce and the coleslaw.  I am not a big fan of Texas toast in general so I can't gauge how good it was. I am not a big fan of their fries.  Overall, I like it.One of my favorite meals out here in vegas.  Tapas are always a hit with me because you get to try so many different things while not over stuffing youself (hey gotta watch the figure so I don't baloon out of control and have to watch my diet later on!)  We went on a wednesday night and I wasn't sure if it was open becuase there was no one else there!  But this gave the waitress an opportunity to be uber helpful/friendly!  She recommended the mac and cheese which was easily one of my top three that i've ever eaten.  (and I'm vegetarian and just out of college so i've had my fair share of mac and cheese both gourmet and easy mac)  Then we also got the tempura alcachofa (artichoke hearts) which were a little too oily for me, but i guess I should have expected it being that they were deep fried tempura style.  Then we had the mofongo (fried plantain...noticing a trend here with the fried stuff...) which was kind of bland until i realized I hadn't eaten any of the plantain but just the various vegetabels around it  haha.  The main part was tasty enough but kind of small and left me craving more plantain on the plate.  Then we did have dessert of a warm chocolate ganache cake which was supposed to come with Fig ice cream which I was really exccited for.  Unfortunatley they were out of the fig ice cream and just served us vanilla without telling us...(hmm shady)  they were also out of another dessert that I really wanted to try.  I was a little surprised becuase they didn't seem altogether that busy with only one or two other parties coming in.  But maybe it was an off day.

The best part about this place was the attached art gallery.  After eating we were able to walk around the gallery  (nothing huge but nice enough to do a little round after eating)  This helped settle my stomach and peaked my interest with some interesting pieces to look at.  I can't really afford them all too much right now being in grad school on student loans haha.  But very fun and interesting to look at.  I will surely make an attempt to return when they have an event on a friday or saturday evening, as it is always nice to get a new experience outside the usual clubbing in vegas.Im rating this 4 and not 5 all becuase of the RUDEST (heavier set older lady) Ive ever had. Everything else...Decor Food and all the other wonderful Busboys and Servers were super awesome! The food...great. Drinks...love the vodka gummy bears. The fire dancers and Dj...off the hook! The other younger smaller chick that helps us...u are amazing...thank u for ur help! Other than this rude ass lady who told me i couldnt sit somewhere when clearly NO ONE was reserved for the table...I cant wait to come back....hopefully i dnt see u again cuz ur ruining ur own money!A small place but excellent food. Great vegan menu.  A must try is fried artichoke heart. Superb. Cocktails are creative and festive. Very hipster. I have to go here in the summer and sit outside to enjoy the area and drinks further. Can't wait to try other things on the menu. I'll be back.I absolutely love the food here. I've never tasted anything I don't 100% love. The Tokyo ramen with beef is my go to, but the Shoyu and Tonkotsu ramens are delicious as well. The location is great, and the hours aren't bad. I do kind of wish they were open a bit later, I think they'd do well with all the college kids in town!  My only downside to this place is the service. For the most part, you encounter rude, blank staring college kids who are counting down the minutes until their shifts are over. I've never had the pleasure of being greeted by someone friendly! I return for the food, but the service needs a serious improvement.1. Baked Rigatoni is where its at. great marinara with cheese mixture.
2. Lasagna is average at best.
3. Salad is great. different than Olive Garden. Clams good too!Blink and you could miss this treat. HK Yum Yum is a Chinese restaurant and takeaway, offering a great range of dishes. I first tried HK Yum Yum when a friend recommended it to me. My immediate impression was not one of amazement but I'm glad I trusted that friend!

Squeezed into a small space, with a few tables and a counter taking up a lot of space, it can get a little cramped. But don't be put off!

HK Yum Yum also suffers from a slightly dilapidated exterior. All this means this Chinese can appear to be another unappealing, to-be-forgotten takeaway. But it's not...

In fact HK Yum Yum has a great selection of dishes across a fantastic variety. It really is all very tasty! This is not typical takeaway food. Furthermore the prices are very reasonable. That there hasn't been a great amount of attention to its decor may just be a sign that it's more focused on its traditional food and perhaps a touch more genuine many other Chinese restaurants.

To add, once you're in the shop, the staff and very friendly as are all those others like you who have braved the experience.

Don't be put off, try this lovely little restaurant which despite appearances is a cut above the rest.The food was good and the service was amazing, but it says they have a daily soup and I have been there before and they used to make a new one almost every. They still have on the menu that they have a daily soup, yet they have not made one in months.I first came to know of this deli last year thanks to Yelp. When you first walk in through the doors your eyes just get so big from all the goodies they have. 

We decided to order two latte's and two Sicilian sandwiches. Well first of, let me just say, that latte?!, well OMG!, that was some damn good strong coffee, had to drink 3, haha. As for the Sicilian sandwich, well that was damn good too!. Nice to know you can find a good Italian sandwich here in Vegas. Usually I got to Santa Monica when I'm craving a good sandwich and coffee. Since then I've been hooked on this Deli. Now I come here for my coffee and sandwich and all my other Italian needs like my deli meats, cheeses, pasta and of course my ladyfinger's.I stayed here last weekend, and was pleasantly surprised by the quality of our room. Spacious, well appointed and clean. Make sure to request the North Tower versus the South Tower. The location can't be beat, and I love the coffee cart across from the registration desk. I wasn't blown away by the pool area and our cabana, but that's a minor complaint. Great value!Darn you economy!  The wife and I are really watching our pennies these days.  They sift through our fingers rapidly.

But when I got an e-mail offering cheap mid-week rooms in hot August Vegas, I knew we needed to get out of town.  A year ago, we had stayed at Bally's and upgraded to a jacuzzi suite for an extra $100 a night.  Those were the days.  So we booked a $59/night room and headed out in the putt-putt Prius.

Now here's the trick that I learned from reading some other website.  When we got to the check-in counter I put a twenty right out on it in full view.  The sweet girl behind the counter decided to upgrade us to that same crazy suite -- this time with a view of the strip and the Bellagio dancing waters -- for only $50 a night.  Sold!  It was clean and great.  Jacuzzi was fun.

Other hotels look fun, and some of them are just as cheap, but we always seem to have a great time at Bally's, especially due to its sweet location.  We had a fabulous time.  Saw Penn & Teller, ate cheaply, got away with the whole 3-night vaca for around $1000.There are three basic levels of Las Vegas hotel.  There are the cheap places like Excalibur, Tropicana, and Imperial Palace.  There are the nice places like Caesar's and TI.  And of course the luxury hotels like Wynn and Bellagio.  Bally's hits that perfect low-to-mid sweet spot.  

Nightly rates were only $10 higher than IP or Excalibur, but the overall experience was considerably better.  Naturally, the place isn't as nice as a newer hotel, and in some ways it really shows it's age, but only the most critical would consider it "run down."  The casino is well organized and easily navigated, but of course the real benefit of Bally's is that it is in the heart of the action.  Across the street from Caesars and Bellagio, connected to Paris, and a short walk to the Venetian, TI, Harrah's, or Mirage.  There's also a direct monorail stop if you prefer that, although from the center strip location I didn't really use it.

The rooms and furniture are clearly old-school.  The desk in my room was a little scratched up, the end table had some well-concealed 70's-era cigarette burns.  But it was all very functional and generally tasteful.  Bally's slogan is "Stay Classic", and they really play that up... although the place is very comfortable and modern, there is a distinct classic Vegas feel to the place.  It's a good classic feel, unlike the Tropicana or downtown where you feel like you're staying somewhere that Vegas had forgotten.

If you're looking for an affordable hotel on the strip, spend the extra couple of bucks and stay at Bally's.  I can't imagine staying anywhere else, at least until I manage to afford Caesar's or the Venetian.Great hotel for the price. Much more affordable than other hotels, but you sacrifice some of the glamour.

We arrived to Vegas at 9am. Check-in isn't until 4pm, but they will hold your bags for you for free if you arrive early. Watch for timeshare solicitors right when you walk in. If you want some free tickets, have 3-4 hours to spare, and can give a firm no, you could talk to them. If not, avoid wasting your time.

You can get a mini-fridge for the room if you ask when checking in. We upgraded our room for $50/night, but we didn't really need it considering we never really spent time in our room. In retrospect, it was a waste (though might be something others would want). Room was clean and spacious. Safe was included (someone else wrote that they had to pay extra?)

Good central location on the strip. Drinks ARE a little expensive, but if you are gambling, they are generous with their comps. All in all, it balanced out. I wish night time room service was an option.great place to take the kids. wonderful place to hikeI was quite taken with Flux.

With its airy fairy fronting and gift shop kitsch appeal, it stands out in an area lacking in shops of this variety. Although they are more common uptown, Flux is a saving grace for presents down at this end of Leith, where the shops otherwise consist of Homebase or the Ocean Terminal.

It sells some lovely, cute toys designed for children, but what strikes me most of all is its ethical stock collection. There are recycled products to be found in here, including new and ingenius creations made out of glass and old wood. A lot of the designers showcased in here are locals, and they have contributed to everything, from homewares to jewellery. Speaking of, the jewellery in here was delicate, ornate and had bespoke qualities, and a large quantity of Flux's ranges were made in sunny Scotland! 

Quirky, contemporary but quaint in its own unique way, Flux offer you something a little bit different from Scotland. Great for visitors who want to bring something beautiful and unusual back home, and equally as handy for locals looking for a high end present, Flux should be the first stop for people with expensive - but good - taste.I've stopped off to re-fuel at Urban Angel a few times in the past few weeks. Each visit has been without any complaint whatsoever and instead I've been stuffing my face with really good quality tea and seriously tasty cheese scones. They are the best cheese scones I've eaten in Edinburgh to date. YUM. 

I had a solo excursion there for dinner and the sardines that arrived in front of me were cooked to perfection, perfectly seasoned and came with a light, tangy salsa and salad that complemented the fish perfectly. The meal was just splendid! Excellent quality of food for the price - I definitely hope to make this a more regular haunt. 

Also, for the tea drinkers amongst us. Their pots are enormous and the tea is loose, so a really great cuppa awaits you here. 

For some reason I'm leaving the fifth star off... Can't quite figure out what it is... 

Anyway. Urban Angel. Yay for cheese scones!I have seen four performers at South Point, three stand-up comics and a music concert (Kathleen Madigan, Henry Cho, John Caparulo and Tower of Power). There isn't a bad seat in the place, and the acoustics are good. The staff are among the most helpful and friendly I've run into anywhere. They seem genuinely interested in making sure that you have a good time. The cocktail staff can get a bit frazzled when the place is full and they have a lot of orders (maybe a bit understaffed in that area). Overall a place I enjoy going.By far, this is one of the best buffets in the Phoenix Metro area with a fairly extensive selection of food types.
No real exotic recipes within the various sections, but the flavors, while pretty basic were well prepared and overall above average.
The seafood section was like a vortex for me with its smoked salmon offering. 
Remember that scene in "Trading Places" where Santa Claus (Dan Akroyd) stuffed that huge fillet of salmon into his costume?
That's how the salmon is presented, and just like Santa, I found myself furtively scouring the room as I contemplated grabbing the entire fillet and making an insane dash for the exit.
It was that good!
I'll be back.Yes, I love buffets, especially great ones. This one in Scottsdale, basically within 20 minutes of home is shockingly good.  I went there on a Friday night yesterday for dinner before a concert. They had Asian, Mexican, Seafood, American, Cold Deli, Hot soups, Hot rotisserie meats, stunning variety of desserts, even some sugar free, Gelato. I had 2 heaping plates with chow main, duck, lamb, beef wellington, lobster claws, crab legs, grouper, cod, shrimp, shu mai,clam chowder, won ton soup.  So much more I wanted to try but wanted to be able to walk out :)  For dessert, I had a fruit tart, berry trifle and berry layer cake.  All good.  And they all stayed in my tummy.  I was satisfied and more.  It was worth the $ and a splurge.  I had good service. They added gratuity when you paid so it was convenient if you didn't have cash. I would return.  the only con is the allowance of smoking inside the casino so if I went into the restroom, smokers would exit.Nice park! Had a blast with the familly. Frisbee golf course looks like it could be fun!Very nice restaurant. Lively hostess. Great customers and lovely ambiance. Oh and the food. It was good too.I joined @PatrickEm and @PaulValach at @TheDucePHX for brunch this morning.

I had their cinnamon pecan french toast, but without the pecans.

It was simply amazing!

Amanda was our server, and she epitomizes what I think a server should be. Keep her around, Duce!

Also had fresh-squeezed orange juice. Delicious!

I think the Duce would do well to add a few fans, just to move the air a bit.

But I really enjoy this place, and will definitely be back.Lately, I've been visiting many Mexican eateries, fast food, authentic, chain restaurants, you name it. It's one of my food phases I go through. 

This month, that phase is tacos. I'll have to say Rubio's Grill Gourmet Taco with Garlic Herb Shrimp was awesome. The blackened Ono taco, not so much. I'm sure having a fried fish taco would have sufficed, but I gave it a try. Not surprisingly, fish was pretty dry. I can't dock too many points, though, it's hard to expect good grilled fish from a chain, no offense. 

The staff was very friendly and very efficient. The store is kept clean, and of course I always love their salsa bar. I think this store is probably well run compared to other Rubio's.

I'll be back for more tacos till my cravings subsides...I had the steal burrito especial. The price was a little more then I would have liked.
A little to small for that price but, it was still good. 
The place was clean and the staff was acceptable. 
I would have to say that this 2nd place to Phat Phranks but, its still not bad. 
Try it at least once if you're in the area.I had to bump up my Edinburgh Airport star rating after reading Jenny L's review and realising that it houses the... only... branch of Eat... IN SCOTLAND. What on earth?!? Eat's in my very exclusive list of favourite chains! (Note to self: make a Yelp list of favourite chains.)

I like this airport. It's small and simple, it's pretty much perfectly formed, and whenever it was mean to us it was also kind to us. For example we ended up having to go to the back of the dreaded Ryanair queue when we realised they weren't calling for Fuerteventura flyers, after we'd already waited 20 minutes. Mean. But that extra 15 minutes meant I got to go upstairs and get the fruit juice I can't wake up without followed by the black coffee which gives me my second extra chirpy wave of wakefulness. Nice.

Once we'd finally checked in and gone through the semi-cattle market of security, breakfast called, and even that was a mixture of mean and nice. For example, Chris M's 'eggs benedict' experience at Eat. Pretty mean. But then again I got to laugh at it. Nice. No, not really - I got to eat amazing porridge. Nice. Everything was pretty simple and self-explanatory, and purchasing my mother's Touche Éclat from Duty Free was a doddle and came with plenty of help from the staff. My only qualm? That I had to come back to Liverpool John Lennon Airport instead of here. Because this happened. http://www.yelp.co.uk/biz/liverpool-john-lennon-airport-liverpool#hrid:-Yngr4VIQtFI7VgedSCS8wWas here for 5 days on business, didn't use the Casino. The place is great. Food, Rooms and Service exceeded my expectations.it's been years since i've been to the king's theatre so when i attended go back for murder with the yelp book group i was pleasantly surprised.  someone had mentioned to me that the theatre had been refurbished after being briefly closed.  and indeed it had been!  the lobby remains the same with the nice old marble floors and stairs leading the various levels of seating.

we wandered into the stalls and sat down on some newly uphosltered seats.  they were red and plush and there was loads of space in between the rows so i could put my bag down and still have space for my feet.  quite a nice feature when you're a girl who carries a large hand bag. it also looked like all the cornice work had been cleaned and fresly painted and the private boxes newly upholstered as well.  i think even the floors might have been new!  so everything was very new and shiny!

i can't make much mention of the other areas as i only sat in my seat, i didn't buy concessions (although these seemed a bit highly priced), get a drink from the bar, or use the toilets.  but the rest of the yelpers that did use these parts seemed to find it satisfactory.  in terms of the play, it was only ok a bit dry and didn't seem to have the same dramatic build up as the book it was based on.  this is hardly a comment on the theatre though.

so yes, the kings theatre is lovely and newly refurbished so very enjoyable to go for a show.  if something takes my interest i'll definitely make a trip back there.Not so thrilled about having "fried" hot dogs, prefer them to be grilled, but food was still very good!!   Nice family-owned, cozy, joint with GREAT service!!  Will definetely visit again when in the area!!Despite the lack of clams, this Asda still delivers on almost every level. There's nothing better than a good wander round a massive supermarket, picking up snacks and sundries you don't want or need, and while I tend to prefer Tesco on this front, Asda is still a more than worthy competitor.

It's hard to walk past the deli counter or those rotating cooked chickens without being overcome by the temptation to gorge, and the deals you can find on DVDs books and games sometimnes have to be seen to be believed. Tremendous.I never thought I'd see the day where I'd actually like anything to do with public transport. But they do say there's an exception to every rule, and Waverley is just that.

It's clean, for starters, and not in the dodgiest part of the city centre possible, like in so many other cities. And the shops inside are surprisingly good, too. Maybe they ran out of space on Princes street and had to overspill into here? Whatever the reason, there's an M&S Simply Food, a well-stocked Boots, a W H Smith and a pub as well as more food places than is really necessary.

My one complaint? It's always freezing! And the lack of bins. Yes, I know, people could hide bombs in them etc etc but I always feel really bad just leaving my empty Costa Coffee cup on the seat, even though they do have very efficient cleaning staff who pick it all up.

There's a taxi rank just inside it, which is always a bonus, and there are always loads of taxis available. If you're getting a but from the station though, make sure you've packed your gym gear as you have to lug yourself and your case up Waverley Steps to get onto Princes Street.Nice drive in... Clear picture and great sound. Cheap admission and great concession stand. Only thing that was annoying, the cars in front of us were taking a lot of pics and using the flash as well! How rude! There was already lightning didn't need the flash show as well. 

It's super empty on this Monday night which is okay by me and my husband on our date night! :) gotta go for Tuesday family night admission is $2 cheaper!I know Bachi is short for Hibachi and all, but does no one know that bachi means idiot in Cantonese?  Seriously?  My girl busted out laughing as we past this place after eating at the Japanese restaurant next door, figure we'd give it a try next time.

We ordered the ronin burger, the steamed buns with pork belly, sweet potato fries, truffle parmesan fries, matcha green tea, and the toffee cake for dessert.  

The ronin burger was delicious with the egg yolk over the med-rare kalbi, but the steamed buns were a bit pricey for two small pieces even though it was good.  Both fries were pretty good eats.  I'll stick with my matcha green tea smoothie from Jamba next time, the tea was too grassy for my taste.  And unfortunately the toffee cake tasted like something pre-packaged, just ok.

We'll definitely come back to try some of the other burgers.Bachi Burger is creating alot of buzz and for just being open for about 3 weeks now, the fan base is growing everyday. Growing up in Hawaii, a hibachi (local-style charcoal grill) is very common in just about every hawaiian household, and is how the name came about.
upon entering, you are greeted by local bruddahs and sistahs, yup owned and run by Hawaiians, so it made this Pearl City boy feel right at home:) Looking at the menu, my eyes were getting bigger than my opu(stomach) I wanted to try one of  everything, but we settled for an Apple-Lychee soda, A Cherry Yuzu Soda, and an order of the Short Rib Steamed Buns. Both sodas were very refreshing and the short rib steamed buns, FRICKIN' ONO! I could have at least polished off 3 more plates,easy. They forgot the boiled egg as described in the menu, but I was too busy enjoying the melt-in your mouth wagyu short rib paired with the bite and tanginess of the horseradish yuzu aioli
So for our entrees, My wife ordered  Kiki's Burger and I ordered the Ronin(you had me at fried egg!) You also gotta understand, When you speak Uni, Foie Gras, and Truffle, you are speaking my language, so of course, we ordered some truffle parmesan fries to go with the burgers. I'm no truffle racist, so the scent of black or white truffle permeating the dining room is music to my nose and stomach. the fries arrived to our table and immediately we dug in..."burgers will be right out" says Lance or waiter and local boy from Waialua....Right now I have tunnel vision savoring each bite of the truffle parmesan fries with crispy bits of sun dried tomato, and paired with the addicting sun dried tomato aioli...another sista comes up saying" did you guys order anything else?" we say yes, a Kiki's and a Ronin" at this point, we're at the bottom of the cone holder, and no burgers in sight....The waitstaff all have a look of "Houston we have a problem!" Then another bruddah comes up and says your burgers are coming right out." 5 minutes later the burgers arrive...The Kiki burger is a beautiful explosion of mushroom, bacon onion, and gruyere cheese, slather some of that garlic chili on the brioche bun.....DA WINNAH!!!!
My Ronin burger was okay. the slaw was a little bit lacking,and the texture of my burger was like biting into a dense meatloaf. The egg wasn't doing it justice either. On top of that, no fries to go with our burgers:(  Then that familiar smell permates the air again, and ANOTHER bruddah arrives at our table, and says "The chef thought you might be hungry so here's another order" Nice save from the timing issues! So with always having room for dessert, we go for the Portuguese Doughnuts, AKA Malassadas with the Coffee Gelato and I ask for a side of the White Chocolate Yuzu Gelato...Sorry, but the Gelato were the stars for dessert. Anyone from Hawaii knows that Leonard's and Champions are the Malassada standard...Too bad you can only get it on Oahu :(    I only know of one person who makes White Chocolate Yuzu Gelato, and after further investigation, I was correct...The Gelato comes from** Ice Boutique and World Pastry Champion Patrice Caillot...All in all, great concept, just maybe a little fine tuning on the food end as well as the service staff too. We'll return once the "opening kinks" are ironed out:)

** Ice Boutique is a Wholesale operation here in town, and to enjoy Patrice Caillot's other fantastic flavors, you can pick some up at Whole Foods....ALOHA!!!!***Sucks that Bachi Burger is closed on Mondays- I am a witness to many cars driving up,reading the sign and then sadly driving away....***

On a Sunday we were needing our Bachi Burger fix so we quickly fulfilled our needs....
We were seated right away-it was busy but a table became free for us instantly just like it was written in the stars....
I'll just talk about items I got that I didn't talk about in my last review :

- Fried Chicken Appetizer- Yummy with good dipping sauce- all I needed was a scoop of rice and this could've been my meal.
- Shrimp Chips - So good, salty-crispy yumminess...
- Crusty Crab Burger- I wanted to try something different than my usual Ronin Burger so I chose this-it was good but a little too seafood tasting for me- 
-Kiki's Burger - The BF liked this one but had to ask for extra sauce
-Calamansi/Lime Soda- To wash all this yummy food down we tried two of their house made mix soda's- this was tangy refreshing
-Lychee/Apple Soda - This one was more on the sweeter side than the other drinks- It was OK but I prefer the Calamansi Drink instead...

Yummy visit and will be back and Oh I have to mention that service has extremly improved and is quick....My only update from before is that the Kiki has toppled the Ronin as my favorite burger!I've been to this location and the one near the theater with the unfinished parking lot and this one is noticeably better.

had a nice revelation with the oxtail fries and the ronin burger was just what the doctor ordered.

really enjoyed the menu offerings but one knock was the lack of shrimp chips because apparently they stopped serving them.

bring back the kropek!Premium burgers with lots of fixings at affordable prices makes this place a Vegas must-try!

After hearing so much about Bachi Burger from fellow Honolulu Yelpers, I added this to my list of Must-Try's when visiting Las Vegas.  I've heard that the restaurant's owner originated from Hawaii(?), hence the menu's Asian and local influence.

Upon setting foot in the restaurant, I noticed that majority of the patrons were Asian.  Not to be stereotypical, but it seemed like a good sign to me as a fellow Asian...haha

Most of the burgers are very affordable, in the $10 range, though I did see a $25 burger which came with foie gras to justify its price tag.  The downside is that all burgers don't come with fries, which we had to order separately for about $4 per order.

I think what makes these burgers so awesome is the unique variety of toppings/fixings you get on your burger:

I got the KIKI'S BURGER which is an Angus beef burger with sautéed shiitake, enoki and eryngii mushrooms, caramelized bacon, sweet onion marmalade, gruyere cheese, and garlic chili aioli.  Supposed to be a popular choice.  As a mushroom lover, this burger was pretty bomb.  Not the best burger I've ever had in my life, but definitely up there!  The burger was juicy and the toppings were delicious and offered a variety of textures and flavors!   And the bun was heavenly soft yet still with enough substance to guarantee proper bun to fillings proportions.  My only complaint is that the burger was cooked in that sweet onion marmalade which was tasty, but a bit too sweet for me...

KIKI'S BURGER - $10 - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas?select=i_aUXCrIGFF8VPotGNsfnQ#i_aUXCrIGFF8VPotGNsfnQ

My BF got the MIYAGI-SAN BURGER which is a grass fed wagyu beef burger with a fried egg, bacon, crispy onion rings, chili mayo, and furikake.  Also supposedly a very popular choice.  He really REALLY liked his burger.  I didn't get to try it myself since I was getting way too full from my own burger and fries, but it definitely looked like a burger any man (or woman) would love!

MIYAGI-SAN BURGER - $10 - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas?select=i_aUXCrIGFF8VPotGNsfnQ#aMTZaqmcmkR_sifO0NEgtg

We also got sweet potato fries and the parmesan truffle fries to share.  The truffle fries were pretty good but the cheese made it a little soggy.  The sweet potato fries were also very good, but didn't justify the price tag for me.

SWEET POTATO FRIES - $4.50 - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas?select=i_aUXCrIGFF8VPotGNsfnQ#qcyiyggpwYcyI4XJdNihiQ

PARMESAN TRUFFLE FRIES - $4 - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas?select=i_aUXCrIGFF8VPotGNsfnQ#7erf_MxA6MMN-ueKQkzcUg

Service was just okay, though I may be influenced because a bowl of ranch sauce bounced off the floor and some of the sauce got all over my legs, shorts, and in my BF's eye when the waitress was taking away our plates.  Obviously not her fault, but she could have been a little more accommodating about it...

Bottom line, delicious burgers with unique ingredients and flavors!A hidden gem.

Friends invited me to catch a band a few nights ago. I'd heard of the place before, but had no idea where it was located; so glad I decided to venture over.

+ Huge parking lot behind the venue
+ Great stage for bands
+ Massive wrap-around bar
+ Primarily a blues-type place
+ Fun mix of people; made for good people watching
+ Feels like a great neighborhood bar, where everyone knows one another

+/- Very limited tap selection (perhaps 6?)
+/- Taps were $4.50
- Guy bartender was a bit slow and aloof
+ Female bartender was prompt and friendly

Yep, it's a little off the beaten path, but I liked this place. It's bookmarked.A student-friendly take on the whole style bar thing that would have looked and felt quite modern and interesting about 8 years ago, but now just feels lazy.

Just like the slovenly, disinterested staff, whom oddly enough I actually warmed to due to their sheer indifference. Having worked behind bars myself, and felt exactly like them doing it, a trip to Koko invariably ends up feeling like a trip down memory lane.As everyone has said in the previous reviews, Salut is a bit of a bizarre shop to have in this area. Situated in the heart of Studentsville and a stonesthrow away from the city centre, the French orientated convenience store seems like its gearing itself towards the wrong kind of audience.

Saying that, it's a very charming store, and will attract business since it serves up good quality groceries and continental pastries.

Towards the front of the store, you are met with a generous dairy section and many croissants. They have some delightful pain au chocolat offerings, and some European high quality fruit juice.

As the other ladies have said, the rest is like a newsagents, selling the kind of mod cons you would expect from such an outlet (tinned foods, etc). But even though it can seem pricey for what it is, the produce seems to be of a very good quality, and there are some lovely little deli jars sure to attract a lot of interest from shoppers.

The staff were perfectly pleasant when I was in. Overall it's a nice little supermarket/deli, which is exactly what it promises to be in the title of the shop.Even though this was the most flying visit of flying visits, I was really impressed with the Holyrood 9A and would make sure to go back next time I'm in Edinburgh.

A great little pub with ultra friendly staff, good service and a place that felt like it had a decent amount of atmosphere in it even though it was mid afternoon. 

With a menu that boasts a huge selection of gourmet burgers, I managed to narrow it down to the Haggis burger or the Pork and chorizo with guacamole. It's safe to say I made a wise choice by following my love of mexican with a hint of spice as it was super tasty, but the haggis one is definitely on my list for my next visit north of the border. 


Great espresso too!They have really nice hand pulled noodles, with various choices of soup broth, or sauce and ingredients based.  They make the noodles here themselves and it is its key ingredient.  I like their beef noodles soup which comes with broth and pieces of beef.  One complain which leads to their 4 star is the lack of pieces of meat.  Noodles aplenty but the condiments and meat are not enough.  I had only a few pieces of lamb with my lamb noodles soup.  Do order their combination appetizer plate which comes with pieces of cold cut meats.  Also, the wait is very long if u come on the weekends and during lunch time.  Remember to flag down a employee and get a number, its pretty chaotic with no one at the front, but U need a number so U can get a seat when they have one.  But I will be back, for sure, thanks to their good noodles and tasty broth.The Setting:  Group dinner Saturday night, no res (but had a Vegas hook-up in our group), sat after ten minutes.  

The Vibe:  3.5 Stars
True to the theme at Cosmopolitan, this place is swanky.  Fancy finish out, pretty people, and music that is a bit too loud for dinner.  I assumed the loud music had to do with the hour, but some guests that were leaving as we arrived said it had been loud the whole time.  Seemed a bit aggressive, even for a restaurant one door down from Marquee...

The Food:  3 Stars (Appetizers), 5 Stars (Entrees)
This is literally the first meal I've ever eaten where the entrees outshined the smaller bites by a big margin.  It is usually the other way around!
The GOOD: 
1.  10oz Filet, Truffle Butter topping - melted in my mouth, amazing!  One of the better steaks I have had in my life, yet it was topped by....
2.  14oz Bone-in Ribeye, Foie Gras butter topping - If I could rate something 6 stars, this would get it!  Our friend who got it gave us each a bite, and then had to fight us off stealing the rest of it.  I got one more a couple more bites to evaluate for this review, but didn't need them.  The entire table was salivating, and they liked their own steaks!  Perfectly flavored, perfectly cooked (medium rare - ), it was worth every penny and probably more.
3.  Dover Sole - got strong reviews from the group even though we wondered why he ordered a non-steak...
The OK: 
1.  Foie Gras French Toast - nothing against this dish itself.  The Foie Gras was quite good and the toast tasted fine.  But getting about 3 bites of it for $24 was pretty much a waste.
2.  Caesar Salad - our buddy didn't care for it, his friend who tried it said it was nothing special.

The Service:  4 Stars
This would have been 5 stars if he hadn't messed up one guy's drink and another guys after-dinner drink order.  Water glasses were kept full, he was highly knowledgeable about the menu, and he basically got carte blanche for any mistake he might have made just for recommending the bone-in ribeye with teh foie gras butter.

The Bottom Line:  If you don't mind the music/ambiance being loud, this is a great steak place, honestly one of the best I've ever been to.I have a bit of an obsession with scones at the moment, and decided to visit Wellington Coffee after reading some positive reviews about their scones. Oh and coffee of course which I enjoy as well.
So one Saturday morning I decided to walk to town and hit the shops - but before that I needed some energy. Wellington Coffee was the perfect stop over for this purpose.
The place is very small but luckily I managed to squeeze myself into a window seat.
They had a small selection of cakes which all looked delicious and homemade. 

I ordered a medium cappuccino and a fruit scone. My order was swiftly brought over and the coffee was obviously made with TLC - it had a beautiful decorative leaf motif and tasted lovely too. I instantly regretted going only for the 'medium' coffee as it was actually a rather smallish cup but hey, this is no Starbucks :)

Then the scone.. Ooh la la. I enjoyed it a lot. It came with a cute little pot of raspberry jam and some butter. The scone was crumbly, but not too crumbly, Perfection on plate!

Coffee and scone came to a total of just over £4, which perhaps is a bit steep - but considering the high quality I  didn't mind. 

I will definitely return.Our fave India restaurant closed in Goodyear, so we decided to try this India Garden.  The restaurant is big and open.  Bollywood music videos were playing on the TVs.  When we got there we were the 2nd table of people in the whole place.  They serve both menu and buffet.  We opted to try the buffet since it looked good.  We headed for the buffet.  The dinner buffet consists of twenty different items.  I got the Basmati Rice, Tandoori chicken, chicken masala, Vegetable Samosa, and Kheer.  Everything was wonderful.  There was a lot more in the buffet, but I over did it.  Oh, also naan (we got the garlic naan) is included with the buffet, they will bring it to your table FRESH!   And hot chai tea.  All that was $10.99 per person.Hooray, another good Indian place opened up in the SW Valley to replace the late, lamented Sutra!

I've been going there for some time, but haven't wanted to review it after my Sutra jinx. Now they've been open for a while and always seem to be doing a brisk business.

I really like this place. Immediate, friendly service, good food, great prices. 

As some have mentioned, the buffet can be a bit limited at times, particularly if you're looking for a 100% vegetarian meal. I'd skip the buffet and order from the menu. Favorites include vegetable and paneer pakora, aloo gobhi (spiced as you like it), and bismati rice. Don't miss their fantastic lassis, served sweet plain or with mango (also served salty, but that doesn't strike me as yummy).Coming from California (most recently Long Beach), I have a picky taste when it comes to my Thai Food, which happens to be amongst my top 3 faves.  That said, coming to Las Vegas, I have tried a few different spots and have not been very impressed.  So when I came in to have a bite at Surang Thai, I was quite happy with my meal.  

Food is great.  Particularly, I had spicy shrimp fried rice and Pad Ka Pow (spicy basil and grounded pork).  

Customer service is great.  I had recently come back from Thailand, where all the food was amazingly tasty AND cheap.  So I had a friendly conversation with our server.

Overall, it passed my taste test and when I have a chance to drive over to that area, Surang Thai is my preferred Thai spot of Las Vegas.Went there last night, had so much fun.
 the crowds were not that bad, around 9pm it was starting to get really busy.
the food prices were fair.. and very good choices
 Had a blast on the rides and enough campy lounge singers to round out the night , 
Good timesI love this little cafe. I've been occasionally going here since I graduated High school 3 years ago. I usually get the Taro smoothie boba. I've gotten some food here too but i really enjoy their drinks more. 

I like the colors of the chairs and walls here, makes me feel relaxed and makes me want to sit down aha. The people who work here are very friendly and they know how to talk to just about anyone. Sometimes when i want to get a drink it's full sometimes it is not. The price is very reasonable. and you can also get a stamp card that after 10 drinks you receive one free.

Check this place out if you want a nice cold drink if you haven't before!Good place for a greasy burger.  It's loud, loud music and loud kitchen but it works.  Good atmosphere!This place allows you to try their hundreds of flavors of mustard, along with a museum in the basement.  Currently, they also sell small hot dogs and pretzels to help whet your appetite for the liquid gold of mustard.  They even support local by including Sprecher's Root Beer and Cream sodas.  You can not go wrong by visiting this place.  It's history, humor and lots of fun.  Check out the mustard themed items they sell as well...Poupon U sweatshirts are a winner!Checked it out on a sunday night and the place was DEAD. Six people including the waitress. But, that didn't stop us. We sat under a hood; all the tables have Korean BBQ setups. The inner Decor was nice and modern, but I have a huge problem with the lighting and the chairs. People listen up: if you have a restaurant put in comfortable chairs, Please!

Our waitress was friendly and dressed in a Japanese school girl get up; interesting. She suggested ordering a few things and then maybe ordering more if we're still hungry. So for the first round we had the fried shrimp, ahi poke, beef skewers, and sushi salad. The fried shrimp were wrapped in a shredded phyllo or noodle and then fried. Pretty tasty. Ahi was piled on top of a bunch of shaved daikon which was unremarkable. However, the Ahi was spicy, fresh, and firm. The beef skewers were finely cooked but just were ok. There wasn't anything wrong, just plain. Simple is good, but they were boring. We thought the sushi salad could have been more inventive. The quality of the fish was great, but it was mixed into what appeared to be that industrial restaurant salad; you know the one with iceberg, red cabbage and carrots. We finished our four starters, enjoyed our drinks and decided we needed salty-greasy to finish us off.....

We then dove into the french fries with spicy aioli and dragon balls! The dragon balls were interesting to say the least. Two spicy tuna meatballs that were breaded and fully cooked. The flavor was nice, but the breading was really hard. On the border of not being able to be cut.  
The fries were hot and salty just like we wanted.

overall, I liked the place. I hope that as word gets out more people will show up. If we go back I would try the korean bbq for something different.Yea for having an aquarium in Arizona!  This was really neat and something different to do in our landlocked state.

 I loved racing my niece around to look at different tanks with her (and beat her to the next one). The main tank was closed (lame) for preparation of sea turtles (wicked), but there were plenty of other things to do and see around this place. I loved the exhibit where you could hold different sea creatures, mainly starfish and hermit crabs - oh and so did my four year old niece. The best part of the aquarium is that they stamp your hand for readmission which is awesome because then you can go out and explore mall. We went through once, left, had lunch at the Rainforest Cafe, and came back again a second time before we finally departed Arizona Mills.

Would have been 5 stars but the ocean tan/main tank was closed. But, whether you are four, (or possibly) 27, or 64 years old, this place will keep you occupied and make you temporarily forget that you live in the Sonoran Desert.I will only surrender to XS, for now.  I'm keeping this review at 4 stars only because the venue is too beautiful to be given 3. 

Surrender is like the kid that's still a little noob that's trying to work its way up there.  In the meantime, everyone is still waiting in that mile-long line at XS.  Sigh, everyone wants to hang with the cool kid. I don't blame them. 

As my friend would say, "all the rejects from XS goes here." Ouch.  Let that burn for a little bit.  

We rolled 10 deep with all girls to Surrender and we were on guestlist.  We got in within 5 minute...easy peazy like it aint no g thang.  Finally got to see what the hype was all about with this new club.  Usual cover for girls $30, guys $40. That's just silly now.

Unfortunately, it just wasn't what I expected.  

Venue: Surrender is beautiful.  You can never go wrong with anything at the Encore/Wynn. Classy and elegant. The dance floor is pretty small with poles up on little stages for go-go dancers to dance by the bottle service tables.  However, these go-go dancers don't make use of them poles! Show us some trixxx!  At least my daring roommate went up and busted some good ol' tricks that woke everyone up, security decided to be a party pooper and took her down.  I guess in a way that saves me from seeing girls trying to dance sexy aka humping the pole.  

The club is definitely more of an outdoor lounge where you can sit by the pool and chill.  I came to Vegas to dance, not to get my snooze on.  However, the interior decorations were snazzy! The dance floor area was decorated with leopard print carpet, rawr.   

Crowd: Pretty diverse, but I hate to say it...not that good looking. Tons of short asian guys and middle aged douche-lord types.  Sorry bout it.  Maybe it was an off night.  Not too many fierce lookin hunnays either.  The crowd was pretty tame since the dance floor is pretty small so there was only so much room to move around.    

Music:  ::awkward pumpfist all night long::  The dj was just not cracking.  He put some form of *unce* to every single song  so I ended up feeling like I was in Jersey Shore awkwardly fist pumping.  A little unce is fine, but it went allllll niiiight long.  At least my arms got some good exercise?  They might as well add techno lights and you got yourself a rave.  I need my jams with some good ol swag I can sass my hair to. Maybe a few shablams. 

Dranks: As a girl in Vegas, I refuse to spend big money on them dranks, ya heard?  It's hot, people are dehydrated so we went to the bar to get some water and dranks.  Newp, they're not allowed to.  Naw! But you can fork up money for their tiny Fiji waters. The bartender wouldn't even give a cup of ice. Cmon now! 

So we decided to leave due to boredom, went to gamble for free drinks, and headed onto the real afterparty at XS at 2am. Man, and they were still partying like it's 1999.Came here on a Wednesday. Came in VIP, no wait at all, with a host (let me know if you'd like his contact info). Otherwise cover fee is $30 for girls and $40 for boys. We had some predrinks out in the casino and then there was free champagne for ladies until midnight. 

Lil John was in the club that night. The pole dancers were gorgeous and hypnotizing. The place was hot and packed. People were literally dancing shoulder to shoulder. Everyone seemed to be around their 20's and were really cool. It was so much fun dancing.

The place is clean and very pretty. If only it were warmer, it would've been nice to hang out outside longer. There were palm trees, cabanas, a pool, and this outdoor gambling area- great to check out in summer.  Lots of bouncers strolling around keeping the place in check. They don't let you sit down unless you have have bottle service, but I find that silly when there are so many empty tables. 

The nice man I danced with got me a Fiji bottle of water for $8! But that small amount is not enough when you are super thirsty. So as a tip, just grab (if it's crowded enough) those cups of ice from the counter before the bartenders pour in alcohol. Or just use to the restroom and get tap. LOL Better to keep hydrated than to faint!

Overall, this was my first time clubbing and I had a amazing experience. I'd love to come back when the weather is warmer!I'll start this review off by staying that I hate clubs and always thought they were ridiculous - Surrender completely changed that.  I decided to go out for my 30th birthday and had one of the best nights of my life.  

The club is stunning both inside and out, the music was killer (Knife Party), and most importantly there was a lot of good looking people having a blast.  The only thing that I semi had a problem with was the differences in drink prices - I ordered the same thing multiple times and each time it was a different price...

Other than that, I will be back and I highly recommend people to go!  (We went on a Thursday) 

On a side note (I thought it was absolutely hilarious) when we were waiting to get into the club the bouncer was coming around checking IDs.  The guy behind me tried to use a fake ID and argue with the bouncer that it was real.  The bouncer proceeds to get another ID from the same state and shows him how his is fake - tells him "nice try".  After being nice and giving him the fake ID back the guy tries to pay him off so he could get in the club and the bouncer straight out says "now your trying to bribe me? I could have you arrested for that" and calls security on him.  Point of the story, don't try a fake ID here!  (Also t-shirts and tennis shoes will get you removed from the line)Pretty good sushi and it's less than 5 min away from my house. Clean and nicely decorated restaurant with up to date music playing. I always get ayce and it's pretty cheap compared to other places, only $20. The spicy tuna cracker is the best:)This place is really sweet I really like the guy who works there who is chatty and helpful especially because my knowledge of whisky is limited. He also will let you sample a lot of different whiskies and explain the subtle differences without being patronising.

The set up is really nice, with wooden floors and the wines and whiskies all labelled clearly. It makes such a big difference when the people running a place are also passionate about what they are doing, something which is evident in Woodwinters.Yelp 100 Challenge * 22/100

My coupon collector of a girlfriend (you know who you are, Candy!) got us a $5.99 deal here a couple of weeks ago. Abundant salad options with extra charge on certain toppings, although you only get a one time go at it. The salad bar is a one way glide towards the cashier where you pay a one time fee for it. It is after paying that you can bask in the unlimited supply of pizza, soup, muffins and non-fat frozen yogurt in the interior of the restaurant. 

Great options. We kept heading back to the soups - Mexican Meatball soup for Candy and cheddar brocolls/potato leek for me. For once, I could take in mouthful after mouthful without feeling too conscious (or too bad) about the calorie intake. Clean atmosphere. Efficient staff (one woman accidently dropped her tray & all that came with it. Soon enough, the staff was sweeping it and everything was gone in a jiffy). Healthy options. Great place for family and friends.I like Zia a lot, and I have to say this location to me is better than the one on Eastern. 

Went here today so the boyfriend could trade in some movies which actually did not take as long as it usually does, around 15-20 minutes. Not bad by Zia standards. When you need to trade in CD's or DVD's for cash or some new music or movies (or in my case, vegan cookbooks and weirdly-awesome ice trays) this is the place to go. If you are not a fan of waiting, ask how long the trades will take because sometimes it is a LONG time. Today was a good day as it did not take long. We did make one purchase that I found in the book section which was quick and easy with the Zia credit the boyfriend racked up. Wait times here are usually far less than the other store and the selection is about the same. It is a huge store that is great for browsing for kitchy items you never knew you needed until the moment you picked it up, and movies and music galore.This may be a little farmer's market with a limited amount of fresh produce stands like in many bigger locations but remember we are in the desert and not many green places are growing stuff here..  But  the strawberries and corn that have been trucked in are really tasty and one stall also sells those "pineapple" watermelons.

My favorite stalls are Miguel's Homemade Salsa..not salty at all and with a nice little buzz on the lips and tongue when you eat it.  Also Bon Breads are the bomb!! My favorites are the Bacon and Onion loaf - Great for sandwiches and even better to make grilled sandwiches with.  The bacon flavor just permeates throughout the loaf.  My wife has a fondness for the Feta Bread.

I like tp go to go to the Fresh 52 market at Eastern and not at Tivoli Village.  Tivoli Village is very dog friendly.

Try either location.America's Best Dance Crew!  Yeah!  ABDC! Yeah!  I never knew they had a Vegas show, and I didn't hesitate to jump and buy a pair of tickets.  For a good moment there, ABDC was the coolest thing since chewing gum with a sideways opening on the package.  However Jabberwookeez or Jabberwockies is spelled (the spell-check isn't picking up the second one.)

We all know the background behind these guys.  They're a breaking dancing group from California that won first place on a MTV show called America's Best Dance Crew.  From there they gained nationally wide known popularity, and seen in various segments of all media.  The group's trademark is the masks they all wear, an emotion-less all white mine face.
    
I have always a fan of "bboying" or break dancing.  It's always an exciting scene to behold in front of someone performing it live.  So why not see a live performance on the most epic stage in the world?!  As one of the shows at the Monte Carlo, our walk wasn't too far from where we were staying.  

Something that shouldn't be missed appears prior to the beginning of the show. While many people were still getting seated, there was a member of the Jabberwookeez crew doing some humorous preshow festivities.  He's dressed in a janitor outfit and the usual mime mask.  A lot of the comedy was very reminiscent of a clown, and he involved a lot of audience participation even while they were getting into their seats.  It was truly entertaining.  

The show was more than I expected.  There was a standing ovation and the general consensus of the audience was an obvious positive one.  I definitely recommend this for people not as familiar with breaking dancing.  The dance routines will be more than rock their socks off (haven't used that since 2nd grade).  The dancing even for a fan will still amaze you because of the coordinating mix of music, usage of the stage and background, and the constant sets of dance choreography.  It's not just dancing you'll see on stage.  Its art in life demonstrated in movement and music with a hip hop twist.Excellent service and wings were fantastic.  Love the sour cream fries!  A little noisy, but it is snowbird season.This place is very trendy, good service and food. We're looking forward to going back to see what the live band nights are like.My picks:
Fire & Ice Martini 
Bbq Chicken Flatbread
Apple Wood Smoked Bacon Cheeseburger Slider
Beet salad

We went the day after the soft opening, the bartenders were still practicing making all the drinks.... so those were a little slow.  However, the food was really good.  I can't to try dessert next time.  The drink menu was really fun and different.  I may need to go back several times to work my way through it because they have a lot.  The Fire & Ice Martini is my new current fav!Great friendly staff.  Awesome snack on these hot days especially for the kids.  I only dropped a start because they are a little heavy with the syrup.  The kids surely don't mind but I prefer a better ice / syrup ratio.Chinatown's got a nice homely feel. We received a warm welcome when we walked through the door.

We weren't hungry enough for the set menu's (coming in at £20 was good value though) so we ordered A La Carte. I got the Spicy Rib's on recommendation from the waitress. 

It was alright, the meat was tender but the sauce was a little too salty for my tastes so I left half of it.This is a huge branch of Superdry, the biggest I've seen in fact. It has an equal amount of clothing for both guys and gals which is unusual as usually Superdry tends to favour guys clothing.

I spotted a few nice tees and hoodies that would be great for summer nights walking along the beach but at £50 a pop I decided it was a bit out of budget for something I didn't really need. The tees on the other hands were a reasonable £20.

If you're into Superdry then you will love this massive branch, you might not like the music so much as it was terrible dance stuff that was blaring out full blast.Put aside the jovial name, these guys are serious about beef. Their devotion pays dividends as the various cuts of beef on offer are all top quality. 

Although the prices of fillet steaks often limit the choice to a 'special occasion' their stewing steaks and burgers are pretty reasonably priced and after my attempt at a heart beef stew using their offerings, I was thoroughly satisfied. Apparently you can buy their products online including some 'Well hung and tender' boxer shorts...criminal!This place is good to come by and hit a couple balls in the batting cages . $2 = 1 token. 1 token = 14 pitches . Go karts are adult fun size fun, fast good track . They do have a wall to mountain climb . Great place to kill time on boring Friday nights .Tried out this place for breakfast, and was seated at a table for 10 when we had 5 in our party. The restaurant itself is designed beautifully, and they pulled all of the patio doors open for a nice view. I ordered a build it yourself omelette of sausage and jalapeño, which came with a side of breakfast potatoes. The dish usually comes with toast, but I asked for extra potatoes as a substitute. The omelette was a bit dry on both ends, but the potatoes were perfect. Crispy on the outside, soft on the inside. Our waitress was very attentive and had our water glasses full during our entire breakfast. The pricing of my breakfast was 12.99$, so it wasn't too bad.My boyfriend and I come here on practically a weekly basis. I love love love their Nutella latte and he loves their iced white chocolate mocha. It's not like Starbucks and the coffee actually tastes like coffee. The flavors are on point and who doesn't love a nice little design to look at before the first sip! 

The atmosphere is so chill and calm, but it can get kinda crowded. They have live music on occasion and it's a perfect spot to just relax and enjoy the moment. They have books, magazines and a little work station for laptop use. 

On a nice night, it's pretty hard to find a place to sit outside but sitting inside is just as good! Definitely a go to place for one, two or a group.Easily one of the best coffee place in Vegas. Moving from Portland I am pretty picky about my coffee and this place delivers. I think they would benefit from a 2nd location as this one gets crowded. I will say everything is a bit expensive but it is in Summerlin and I imagine the rent in Boca Park ain't cheap.Sadly, Sambalatte is overpriced. However, their priceless ambiance makes it worth it. The decor and small details gives an ordinary coffee shop a large personality. 

I've had the Nutella latte and the Nutella hot chocolate but personally think that the hot cocoa had more flavor. The latte lacked the Nutella flavor IMO.

Restrooms are clean, hours are pretty good, and the location is in an awesome complex. I'm excited for them to be opening their second location at Monte Carlo!I went here for lunch with Rand H. and the choices were large (roughly 100) and with everything being good to great. I did not have anything I did not like. A couple of things that stood out were the onion rings,baked salmon,Japanese carrot slices witch are yellow and sweet nothing at all like a carrot.The lunch i had was good and I would go back to this place. Yay I am a fan.


























iCome here a lot and finally remembering to give it some props on yelp! Swordfish tacos are my item of choice right now, and I always wash em down with a Stone IPA or two, or three....been here once back in 2004!!


 I liked the idea of being able to drink at a sports venue. The game was Australlia V Scotland, and the seating is mixed usually so there is a good banter .. our view wasn`t bad for the ticket price.


 The merchandise marquee outside the ground was cool and its wasn`t money you use for drinks but tokens. Which you get by swapping with your money at another place.


 Come to think of it must be time to go again see if its changed much.


 Enjoy your day ;-)Really great place to eat and drink. we have been in 4-5 times since they have opened. 
Service was a little spotty the first time we were in but it has improved every time we go back.The Quartermile is one of my favourite places in Edinburgh. Connecting the Meadows to Forrest Road, this walking and cycling path is constantly buzzing with activity. 

Over the last couple of years the Quartermile has gone under some renovations with new flat being made where the old hospital was. Also, there is now a Sainsbury's, a Starbucks and a Swedish cafe called Peter's Yard. 

These additions to the area has made this area very busy during everybody's' lunch hour, especially with school children and students. However, during the evening sometimes there are some musicians who play into the night, including those who play the violin and saxophone! Very nice when walking home on an Autumn's evening! 

At the bottom of the path at the Meadow's end is the most well known Big Issue seller in Edinburgh. He is always there in the mornings and always has a cheery word to say. You will get to know him if your someone who walks through the Meadows daily.Not sure why this place has such a bad rating, it is just like any other Lee's and its in the heart of Las Vegas Chinatown. If you can tell me a better place to get a Vietnamese sandwich, then perhaps I could see why you might not like this place but even then, the sandwiches here are awesome. 

Whenever I go to a Vietnamese sandwich (Banh Mi) place, I always order the grilled pork sandwich (thit nuong). This is not to be confused with the BBQ pork sandwich which is made out of the red Chinese style pork meat. The grilled pork is pork marinated in a concoction of lemongrass and various herbs that give it a great rich but fresh taste. That along with the toasted baguette, pickled carrots, radish and serrano chilies make an awesome sandwich. 

FRIENDLY TIP: If you're feeling a woozy hangover from the night before, which can happen pretty often in Vegas, grab a Lee's sandwich and take a bite. I've learned that nothing calms my upturned stomach more than toasted, fluffy bread. Oh and grab a Cafe Su Da (Vietnamese coffee) for the drive home - that coffee was made specifically for champs. :]Very clean and spacious place in the midst of china town. Very helpful, speedy staff that makes fresh baked goods, smooth, tasty smoothies n iced coffee, delicious vietnamese, american, euro style sandwiches, dry packaged goods and more. We pre-ordered our sandwiches during lunchtime to beat the rush, easy ordering, fast, accurate pickup and yummy sandwiches & goodies. FYI: Cash only and if you forget, Lee has an atm there for you.Was walking through the shopping center and decided to stop in for a bite.  The atmosphere is great, I had a feeling of being somewhere totally different like I was in a little sandwhich shop in japan at 2am looking for some good food. The menu was a little confusing at first but figured it out and then asked whats good? We were recommended the combination #11. so we went for it. two #11 sandwiches with a soda to the tune of just $10.10. not bad for being 10" sandwiches! ! So we get the sandwhiches and start eating them only to realize a very different texture in one of the meats. I check it out to that it has head cheese!!! haha I never had head cheese and must say that im glad I didnt know that it was in there because I would have never tried it. The taste was a little strong for me but what got me was the texture and I had to take out the rest shortly after. Besides that the sandwhich was great, meats were tender, veggies tasted great and added alot of flavor to the sandwich and the baguette was to die for!! I would just eat the baguette lol! All in all a very good experince at lee's. Will definitely be back and will explore their menu!I see there are a lot of up and down reviews about Rumor. 

This place was great and did earn 5 stars, even though I'm only giving them 4.

The room was very spacious and mostly clean. Everyone on here is whining about rooms being dirty. If you don't want to stay in a room that's dirty, don't stay in a hotel. No matter what, there is always going to be some amount of dirt. Compared to other rooms I've stayed in, this one was pretty clean.

It was very modern and fun, and a great room for the price. We got the upgraded room, with a huge tub and mirrors, plus complimentary champagne for about $100. They forgot our champagne at first and made up for it by bringing us chocolate covered strawberries.

They let us in the room way before check-in time, per my request, which was nice. Check in is at 4pm, they called me at 10:30am and said my room was ready to check in.

Overall, this was a great experience. I don't know what it's like during summer, it seems like it may be busy. Our stay was peaceful and very enjoyable.

Pros: 
Swanky room with fun decor
Affordable & Clean
Most of the staff went above and beyond to make our stay great
Free adult movie channel

Cons:
The tub has a bit of paint chipped off it, but no big deal
The guy to check me in was a bit rude and off-putting, but the lady I checked out with was excellent (I believe her name was Crystal?)
You have to walk through the lobby to get to your room, no matter what. There is no "private" way in
The free adult movie channel had stuff from like the late 90's, straight up old school porn

For my wife's birthday room, it was excellent. We will totally be back, maybe many times if the other stays are anything like this one.

Like I said, the place deserves 5 stars, but the guy(s) who checked us in seemed like they didn't want to talk to me (maybe because I didn't have boobs?), and this is why they get 4 stars. Not really a problem of the resort, but of that one staff member.

I do recommend this hotel, it was a lot of fun. Did I mention we did a photoshoot in the room? It was a perfect room for that, and a nice change from most of the boring and drab rooms that are in this price range.This is my neighborhood frozen yogurt shop.  The '80s vibe is pretty nifty - I especially appreciate the "Simon"  & "Don't Break the Ice" games, Rock 'Em, Sock 'Em robots and "Pacman" machines available.  The yogurt itself is good & tasty, and there are a nice bunch of toppings available.  The sweet topping, such a cheesecake bites, brownies, Heath bar bits and other chocolate-y delights are readily available, as are nuts, but I sometimes yearn for more fruit than just the normal strawberries, blueberries and lychees that are available everywhere.  I must love I Love Yogurt... I'm on my second "frequent eater" card already!I judge a Vietnamese place by its pho and pork combination rice plate. The pho was not overly seasoned and the noodles were tender and didn't stick into clumps. The grilled pork didn't have enough seasoning and garlic, but wasn't bad. Would definitely consider this as an go to place for some good Vietnamese comfort food.Came in for lunch after seeing the solid reviews on yelp.  The parking lot was full but I lucked out scored a parking spot.

I checked in and received the two spring rolls which came with fresh lettuce, cucumber and mints. I went with the Pho special and the broth was really delish. The portion was good sized and finished the whole bowl including all the soup!

Service here is great compared to other places BC the man and woman checked in several times and even offered extra sides for the spring rolls. 

I'm a big fan of Bun Bo Hue so I'll be checking this place out next month when I return to LV.This is one of my all time favorite lunch spots near my work. My girlfriend introduced this place to me a few months ago when I was craving Viet food. She encouraged me to try the bahn mi sandwich.  I immediately fell in love. 

As I got to explore the menu.. I quickly found this spot to have some the best pho I've ever had.. from living in California to now recently residing in Vegas. The rare flank is awesome especially when you get it served on the side instead of already mixed in the broth allows you to drop in at your leisure to get soft "rare" slices of beef. Quality soup.. very flavourful! ..Great cure for hangovers! 

I really enjoy the bbq pork rice dish and the spring rolls are amazing (always fresh). The peanut dipping sauce for the spring rolls is definitely on point and is a must try if you eat here. Also the prices are very reasonable and just a great place for friends and family to get good local Vietnamese food!After a long night of drinking, nothing beats a large bowl of pho.  It sure does cure any hangover problems one might have.  I found out about this place through a friend.  Usually we would go to Pho Kim Long or Pho So 1, but this place is awesome.  Not as crowded and the broth here is amazing.  

Ordered a Pho Dac Biet, with a side of the green onion oil.  The green onion oil is usually a secret.  Not many people know about it.  I introduced it to my friends and they said it made it the best bowl of pho they ever had.  It makes the broth more richer and flavorful.  

Also, must get the egg rolls for an appetizer.  It's so hot and crunchy.  Tastes healthy with a lettuce wrap.  Don't forget to add sriracha hot sauce to the fish sauce and you're good to go.Delicious.  My wife is a fan and she's hard to please....Stayed here on Feb 10/11/12 was over all good experience.
Was judging horse show, so, hours a bit strange.  Desk staff very polite & helpful.  Due to injury, used small suite w/disabled capacity  $10 more.  Very comfortable, good bed/pillows/amenities.  Clock radio wouldn't allow wake up.  Lots of TV channels.  Following afternoon, was shy coffee, shampoo, soap, etc., went to desk & resolved(housekeeping problem).
Breakfast was OK on first day-not really different than most good hotels.  Second day, Biscuits & gravy good.  Lady taking care of breakfast room OUTSTANDING.  
If this hotel wants to host horse show folks, they might consider animals, and taking a security deposit.  As a judge, I do not bring animals.  In normal travel I do.
Would certainly come here again.I loved hanging out here as a student, nice atmosphere, friends about, and can't beat the prices!  Sometimes overly crazy, but also sometimes quiet to sit and play scrabble.  Recommended - as it is a quintessential of Edinburgh attached to the esteemed university.If you've never been to Wildflower before, it's a cute, nice soup, sandwich, salad, bread, pastry place. This is a big, bright location. 

Lovely, savory food that always seems to be made with nice ingredients, and great bread - we often come in for a meal and treat ourselves to a loaf of something delicious to go - today, sourdough with rosemary and sea salt.  It's pretty reasonably priced, and the food is interesting. 

Try the spinach salad (I get it with no bacon), or the egg, tomato & feta breakfast sandwich on ciabatta.This was my first time at polished! I saw them on yelp and Instagram. Their owner is great at marketing this salon because it Was the most packed I've ever seen a nail salon. Bobby did my nails so fast I was in shock! I also got my eyebrows done! I thought she made them a little too thin. But I didn't specify . My whole day was only 27$$! So cheap! I'm used to paying 50-100 at the salon. They will be my new vegas salon from now on! :)My wife is one of the pickiest eaters I've met, but for some reason she loves the vegetable chow mein here and the spring rolls. Now, I've had both, the chow mein is forgettable to say the lease and I'm pretty sure the egg rolls are just frozen from 7-11 or something. But, she loves it and I'll get her whatever she wants. 

On the nights she's craving her chow mein and spring rolls, I just get an order of their egg flower soup and a side of rice, i mix them together and add a little low sodium soy sauce and a healthy dose of sriracha. It's very good and filling and cheap.

There isn't much more I can say about the place, it's cheap, quick chinese food. It's a little more expensive then panda express and a little better, but don't expect gourmet. I'd say it falls somewhere between panda and p.f. changs, but a lot closer to panda express. 

Coke products gained them an extra star on my review. Sorry look at this as a 3 star review.Ate here for the first time Monday, and we're going back today!! I got a deal on Voice Deal of the Day, so I was hoping it would be good.

I tried the Al Pastor (kinda like BBQ Pork) Quesadilla. A-MAZING!! It was soft, juicy, crispy, and crunchy all at the same time!! Great flavor combinations with the pork, cilantro, pineapple and guacamole.

I also tried the chips/salsa/guacamole.
Loved the chips and guacamole made me yearn for more. BUT... the salsa was so flipping nasty!! Seriously tasted like they opened a can of tomato sauce and called it salsa. 

They don't have a huge menu selection (basically Al Pastor and Carne Asada) but it's still worth the visit.This pharmacy brings to the mind the Outkast song,  So Fresh,So Clean! It's got an air of disinfected, which is probably a good sign in a pharmacy. However, I'd just been into W Kings & Son, which felt a little bit like someone's (fancy) living room so I wasn't too enthusiastic about it.

It's one of a few independent pharmacies in the city centre, and the service is quite personal which is a plus. There's a great range of products and medicines, so I can't imagine there'd be anything lacking whatever your ailment is. I feel like I should insert some sort of disclaimer here..Server Sara from Bakersfield (by way of Sacramento) was the best thing to happen to us in Vegas.  Or as she would say, "I'm from ghetto Bakersfield, not the normal town."  Super great service, and she said most people don't even tip. Wow.  What's up with people?

It can't be easy to work in a bikini every day with a smile, but she does it.  This is a collection of three pools, all of which are great, and one adult, topless, men pay to get in, pool.  A very fun poolside in an aging resort.I LOVE THIS PLACE!

I frequent Vegas often, but I had an unplanned, overnight stay on Sunday, due to a layover. I ended up going to Firefly for a late dinner w/friends, around 10:30pm. We waited less than 10 min for a table for four. Their menu is on the lengthy side, but it was very easy to scan through, which surprised me. There are a lot of words, but descriptions get to the point and just tell you the main ingredients. Good enough for me.

Things we ordered: (Ready, set, DROOL!)
-Ceviche of shrimp
-Firefly fries 
-Mushroom tart
-Steamed mussels
-Ham and cheese croquetas
-Steak and mushroom skewers
-Crispy duck roll
-Chocolate "tres-leches" cake
-Passion Fruit mojito

Drooling yet? YUMMO! Everything was great, but my favorite was the mushroom tart. The mojito was very refreshing, the service was great. I can't wait to try more tapas from their menu! When I'm a fan, I'm very loyal. I will definitely make it back to Firefly again soon.Came here for the first time for a friends bday. I had heard soooooooo much about this place from pretty much every one I know so I was pretty excited. The place overall is very busy, noisy, and dark. All the servers and waiters were very courteous and never forgot one of our orders. Excellent. All the tapas that we ordered were pretty much delicious so I won't bore you with the details of what to order however I did notice that most of the tapas were on the salty side especially the firefly fries and the sliders. Granted they tasted delicious, just wished they cut down on the salt a teeny tiny bit. Ordered 2 mojitos which were also good. Just the right about of alcohol for me. I would definitely come back here for more girls night outs.I came here with a group of yelpers. Not a UYE or anything, just a super casual dinner. 

We got there right at 4 pm when they opened and Vanessa N. right off the bat says "it's happy hour from 4-6, we need a pitcher of white and red sangria." I just met her, but I knew I liked her already. By the time everyone showed up, I had already gone through 3 glasses of red sangria. 

Anyone who has been to firefly knows that almost everything is yummy. I always order the bacon wrapped stuffed dates. They are sweet and savory all in one. The pork empanadas are flaky and the pork is flavorful and moist. The spicy beef salad was also yummy. Beef was tender and dressing on the salad had a nice heat, nothing too overwhelming. The only bad dish was the tuna tartare. I usually get this dish, but today the tuna was really fishy and old. Lisa G. ordered the same thing and we had to send it back. 

Out waiter was a little flustered when it came to the bill since we all wanted separate checks, but we worked it out. I had an awesome time with everyone (Vanessa, Anthony, Loren, Lisa, River, April and Doug). Sorry there's no initials for last names, but you know who you are. Vanessa and I did have to finish off Loren's white sangria. My thing is, I'd rather waste food than alcohol. So we were not about to let an entire glass of sangria go to waste.OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG!

Yes, I'm living in the past. I hadn't been to Firefly until a couples weeks ago, mostly because I had an bad first experience with tapas and after hearing about all the health violations at the other store I remember giving myself a pat on the back for never touching the place to begin with. 

Everything there was delicious, except the tuna tartare that I tried from Marie T.'s plate which was fishy tasting enough to be sent back. I had the shrimp diablo which was fantastic, and the fries which were possibly the best fries I've ever had. I was thinking I needed to order 3-5 dishes to really fill up, but to my surprise I only ordered 2 and I was stuffed. We also ordered pitchers of sangria which were as phenominal as everyone on Yelp has already mentioned. 

My guy and I live in NLV and there are very few places that we make special trips for, but this is a place I'll be dragging him sometime soon.So the music is top 40 and loud, not my favorite but on a hot Vegas day, with the right people it seems to be just right... 

The waitresses are super sweet and fast. 

And the people in the pool, super funny with their beach balls and "dancing".

So this place isn't anything like "Wet-Republic" or "Tao Beach" but I think that is exactly why I like it. No pretentiousness/doucheness.

Oh yeah, and it's free. Not to mention they have happy hour...If you can get past the litter and the loitering teenagers, Portobello is a wee delight!

Essentially it's a mini seaside in the suburbs of the city - a 20 minute bus ride from the centre and you're there.  Set on the open banks of the Forth, there is a long stretch of sand, an amusement arcade, a chippy, sea and a Wimpy. And as for sun? Well, if you're lucky! You are in Scotland after all. It's easy to forget that when you're enwrapped in the seaside feel of Portobello, but nevertheless it's still a bit chilly!

I would advise against visiting at night and it's not the most glamourous area in the world, but it's still quaint, old fashioned and a lot of fun for the kids. It's in a reputable enough area and there is a wee shop around the corner for the beach where you can buy a bucket and spade. So what are you waiting for? Wade in!We spent an enjoyable evening at this "new" comedy club last night 7/30 . Both comedians were good, but the headliner, Butch Bradley was great. Loved his unique style. 
The former Comedy Stop has really been cleaned up.( I wanna know who cleaned the years of old nicotine off those old chandeliers???) Fresh, nice & new club decor and table rounds instead of the long skinny jammed in tables that used to be there. It is certainly the nicest comedy venue in town.  (They are really making big improvements to the entire Tropicana with a lighter and brighter feel which is nice cuz I thought the only answer for this old and dated Trop would be the obligatory Las Vegas implosion. ) They had a very talented pianist before the show and between comedians.......but I wasn't there to listen to music. I was there to laugh....and laugh we did!
The only downside is the ticket prices. They really need to bring down the price to build a following.Their prices are higher than most of the comedy clubs in Vegas.  With the sparse attendance, maybe they will figure that out. Overall though this was a very fun evening and I will take out of town guests. Good job Brad!Came here for lunch with my bf keith. The service was good very friendly. Nika was great. Had a tossed salad an for some reason they started putting yard clippings in it aka spring mix, but it was Good. The zinger tacos were fantastic. Love the taco holders. All in all a great meal...I'm a fan of mom-and-pop restaurants, particularly where you go in and the people make you feel like family and are friendly.  Starving for hot meal, I dashed across the Meadows to Hong's, a tiny Chinese restaurant located about 2 blocks south of Melville in the quiet Marchmont area.  Sandwiched between produce stores and boutiques, Hong's offers a cozy dining room for table service, along with take-away / carry-out service.  Their menu is extensive and well-priced for the portions.  I recommend the combo special which is just under 7 pounds and includes a can of coke, giant bag of fried chips (don't know the name but they're tasty), an entree, plus rice.  having a penchance for spicy foods, I inquired if they would make a particular dish spicy--and they happily obliged.  The wonton soup is solid, but the chicken mushroom dish (which also includes scallions) was great.  I'll definitely go back whenever I'm in the area, and if not, there's a cheap delivery service for only 1 pound.It's a pity that this restaurant is hidden off the beaten track, because the food here is very tasty and the service is very good. 
I have only been to three Thai restaurants but this is by far the best one I have been to and the food has been consistently good on the four times I have been there. I have found a firm favourite dish in the red curry, which always tastes delicious.
The restaurant provides good value for money with the servings you get and also offers BYOB, which is an added bonus on the wallet.
The décor of the restaurant is pretty simple but this shouldn't take anything away from the fact that this is a hidden gem in Edinburgh.The Saturday lunch special is an incredible deal: $5 for a gourmet pizza that serves two. We had the quattro stagioni (prosciutto, artichoke, mushroom, olive, and egg), the napoletana (arugula, cherry tomatoes, garlic, olive oil, provolone, and shaved parmesan), and the margherita (fresh mozzarella, mascarpone, plum tomatoes, and basil). All three were generously topped with quality ingredients. A word of caution about the quattro stagioni, though: it comes with an undercooked poached egg in the center that the waiter punctures and spreads over the pizza at the table.I loved this place... so much that I made our Valentines Day reso's here.
We went for my birthday a few weeks ago and i really enjoyed the experience.  Even for a Monday it was a bit busy.  The place is decorated nicely and yes it is noisy, but just be sure to expect that and you wont be upset!
One confusing thing was the servers uniforms... the place is pretty nice but the servers wear t-shirts with the Francescas logo... maybe they could step it up a bit in that department.  But that being said, our server was amazing.  He was super friendly and personable (?), without being annoying or overbearing.  He made excellent suggestions as well.  We started out with drinks, he a greyhound and I, a glass of wine.  They DO have a great wine list.  We then split an asparagus, tomato and blue cheese salad that was AMAZING!   Seriously, whatever light oil/vinegar combo that was on it was perfect and I will definately be ordering it again!  For dinner I got the spaghetti and meatballs, which was their Monday night special for only $9.99... They were really good, the meat was perfect, the sauce, perfect.  I loved it.  Ohhhh, and they give you excellent warm bread upon arrival which was also to die for.  Dennis got the pork roast special, which is not something he would normally order but the server did an excellent job of describing it and ensured that it was great, seeing as how he got to try a bite before work.  The boy loved it!  We both raved about the food here for days afterward and I am really looking forward to seeing what they have to offer for Valentines day!I went again for dinner. I enjoyed my local-fruit cocktail, veggie burger, and the deviled eggs. (However, why does somewhere like this -- that seems like an innovative place that loves it veggies, only have a veggie burger as an option? Oh wow, haven't seen THAT before) Waitress was nice. The atmosphere is still pretty spectacular.This Lakeland location is in the most lovely space. Bright, airy, and full of light, it's not at all crowded and all the gadgets and kitchen goodies can be easily seen and explored. We stopped in for one specific thing, easily found it, and enjoyed a good wander around.Just went here over the weekend. Saw Felicia Michaels & Gene Pompa, I would not say they were the funniest pair I have ever seen, but it was fun. It started about 20 minutes late, and the owner ended up doing a couple of acts, he was funny in a strange way. Honestly for $15 it was well worth the money, and the venue is very intimate. I do think the drink prices are kinda high, but pretty much the norm for this type of thing. I would certainly go back.Small, intimate and friendly, Al Dente offers really good quality Italian dishes. Their cappelletti in brodo was one of the standout dishes from our 2011 restaurant visits.

Overall, we said: "we were well impressed with Al Dente. We thought their food was really good, with a strong emphasis on keeping things simple and letting the flavours sing."So glad to be introduced to Nobles at a recent Yelp brunch. Gorgeous interior, inviting atmosphere. Will definitely keep it in mind next time I'm in Leith. It seemed like a great place to stop in for a drink, and brunch was definitely a hit, as well. 

I had the full vegetarian breakfast, which was huge and very well done. I appreciated the big pile of spinach - a creative addition to the standard inclusions of veggie sausage, veggie haggis, mushrooms, tomatoes, potato scone, and eggs. (Did I leave anything out? I feel like I did. It was a lot of food.) Coffee was good, and the waitstaff kept the big carafes of ice water on our table full. I will never get tired of free ice water.Lee's Cream Liqueur is such a fun concept offering a tasty product. A group of friends and I walked over to Lee's after an event at Cartel. It was just before their closing time, so I was nervous that we would be hurried to make our selections, but the ladies working were so nice and offered us samples of their different flavors. And when we sat outside, they told us to take our time and not worry about hurrying to empty our table.

Most of us ordered the Chocolate Black Russian Kahlua, which came garnished with a generously sized wafer. Delicious, creamy, and just the right amount of alcohol flavor! A couple people ordered the Butterscotch Long Island, and I snagged a bite. It was also great and not overpowering.

The only reason I knocked off a star is that the layout of their shop is a bit sparse and could use some more seating and maybe even a fun couch for larger groups; but I understand that in Old Town most people will just get their ice cream and walkabout, anyway.

Make sure to bring your ID! You don't want to miss out on the alcohol-infused fun. Lee's is a great new option if you're looking for an offbeat iced treat.Definitely will go back, because Sunday was crowded due to football, it was nice to see. Awesome outside patio, large enough for a private party of about 150 friends!!!!

Beans were great, cole slaw pretty darn near perfect, fresh HOMEMADE 7 delicious.  Found out taht even theirdesserts are home mnade anf that almost everything on the menu is homemade!!!!  Great for a restaurantof that size.  Had brisket with the homemade sweet and hot sauce, it was great.

Nice size dining room andaway from the bar!!!!  A private banquet room as well.  Friendly, fast service staff, greeted promptly and everyone seemsto know everyone, nice neighborly feel.So my wife took me to the Westin for a father's day get away.  Part of the weekend included paddleboarding .  I love the water and I've always wanted to try it, but living in the desert can make finding good places for water sports tough to find.  Well, she was able to find Paddle To the Core.

After a Quick five-minute lesson, we were on the lake.  I am pretty athletic and I know how to row, so it was pretty easy for me to get the hang of it.  My wife is not so athletic, but she too had no problem.  We lucked out being there on a day with no wind.

At $30 for an hour of paddling, I recommend everyone try it.  It is a ton of fun and I think most would want to do it again.  I'll be back again.  If you sign up for their 5 Star card, you get a board rental for $20.  

Try it.  I'm sure you'll like it.I really like this place. There aren't that many lanes, so if you plan to go on a Friday or Saturday night, call ahead and reserve your lane. 
This place has a lounge area with a good sized bar and couch area. Over where the 10 lanes are, there are about 4 pool tables, another bar, and another table and couches area. The end of the lanes have screens above them to watch sports or music videos. They play good music very loud. I had a really great time. 
My only complaint, we reserved lanes for 4 hours, and when the 4 hours was up, they wanted us out immediately. They started bussing the tables just taking drinks away. I was busy changing my shoes and didn't notice the busboy grabbed my drink. Excuse me, I just purchased that. I let him know that I understood they wanted us gone, but should ask the person sitting there which drink is theirs before throwing it away. As we were leaving, I was at the other table in our area and the busboy asks me if any of the drinks on that table were mine. I reminded him that he threw mine away and he should probably be asking that question to somebody else. It really annoyed me. 
I would definitely recommend it for a Sunday fun day. I didn't feel like we could really relax and have a good time on a Saturday because it was too busy and the staff was looking to make money rather than have their guests entertained.For over two years now I have been giving blood at this donor centre. Located not far from the university of Edinburgh's central campus on George Square, this is a great place to give blood. 

The staff are all very friendly indeed and always have some great banter when you are on the drip. Indeed, this helps any nervous people coming into the centre as well. And when you are finished one can nibble on a selection of biscuits and have a coffee or an orange juice. However, one piece of advice I should pass on is that you should not drink the day you give blood, after a couple of pints down at Fountain Park my mate found out that giving blood and drinking fosters do not go well together! 

Giving blood is a great thing and goes towards helping people, and even saving peoples' lives! Three times a year, doesn't sound that much to be honest! So go on, go and do your good deed for the day!Went here on a whim on opening day @ the Forum Shops on 8/5 coincidentally for my husband's b-day. At first, we had plans to go elsewhere, but after tasting the samples, we gave it a go for dinner.

The restaurant itself is really cool and reminds me of Willy Wonka's Chocolate factory with brown decor everywhere, and pools of chocolate mixing in the front and a tiny shop to the side. Just so happens that Mr. Brenner was heavily influenced from watching the movie to become a chocolatier, but that's beside the point.

We were seated in front and got to watch samples be given and shot into customer's throats, literally. It was funny. They have these chocolate syringes that cost about $5 and other little goodies such as cookie shakes and those lovely pralines to die for that they sell in front to reel 'em in. It worked.

Well, as for dinner food, I ordered the Asparagus Crepe and my DH, the Sesame-crusted Salmon, my 2-yr. old got the Crunchy Mac & Cheese w/ marinara in a syringe w/ a side of cheese (?). His was fairly decent, not out of this world. Mine plain sucked. I only ate half as it was pretty tasteless and barely had any asparagus w/ mainly cheese and spinach which made it all soggy. I however, adored my child's dish (which she barely ate and instead took my waffle fries) It was one of the best Mac&Cheese dishes I've ever had in a restaurant, crunchy on top, gooey inside, and just that right amount of sharp taste i like w/ the asiago cheese. The marinara complemented the dish well. 

Now, desserts are what had me give the 4 stars, (minus the one for the meals themselves). We ordered the combo w/ the Lava Cake, Chocolate shot, and ice cream w/ a side of chocolate sauce. For his b-day, they gave this measly piece of chocolate w/ a little tealight. (I was cool w/ that considering they had just opened and were very nice to us). The cake was awesome along w/ the ice cream which helped out the heaviness of the cake. The shot was very good but for me, that chocolate sauce killed it for me. I could have drank that whole cup alone despite it being a "sauce". It was like a melted milk chocolate bar! I swear. 

So overall, we were pretty satisfied w/ our experience as customer service went over and beyond to treat us well being it's first day. We asked the server if Mr. Brenner was there, and as we were walking out they whispered "He's over there in the striped shirt in the back."  We saw the bald headed man and wished we had sat longer as he was greeting guests when we left. Hopefully they can work on the regular food, but of course the desserts will remain the star of the show. I would totally not mind if it was solely a chocolate dessert shop as I have a feeling the restaurant part may not go well. That's just a prediction since it just opened. 

Recommendations: 
-DESSERT-that's what we'll go back for to try from the multitude of selections they had. 
-The Chocolate Shop-too tiny but so cool. Pricey but worth it. TRY the Chockies and the different Pralines. Our favorite was the Pecan and Almond. The Hazelnut was so-so.

For all you Chocolholics, it will be quite an experience.This place is awesome, if you love chocolate this is the place for you to go. On top of that, their regular food is actually quite good and both all of their chocolate and non-chocolate foods are good. The only complaint is that their tables are too damn small to use. They're just annoyingly small, that's the only thing this place needs to change. Their breakfast and teas/coffees/hotchocolates are to be had with every meal, regardless of time of day.Not a fan of sweet breakfasts and wasn't really feeling an omelet at that point so for brunch I got the goatcheese and chicken waffle salad. DELISH. 

I also got a white russian too... omg. THIS....was THE FREAKING BEST. 
I mean, who cares I'm drinking at 10 AM? 
It was a huge treat to drink this. It comes with all the kalhua in one glass and a teeny tiny erlenmeyer flask filled to the brim with this rich melted white chocolate and whatever was in there. Mix it up- delish. I can't tell you how delicious it was. 

We ended brunch and shared a waffle with bananas and icecream and I just wasn't too impressed with that. Meh. 

I had a sip of the mocha that came in a hug mug and that...was divine. 

Next time I go, I'm just going to have a liquid breakfast/lunch and order me some white russians and other coffee/hot chocolate drinks instead! 

**tip** iced mochas whether it's milk or dark will probably disappoint you, they'll become watery, and you can't really enjoy that pure chocolate flavor.Dear Mr Brenner,

I just wanted to let you know that ever since I took my wife to your fine establishment, all she could talk about was your desserts!

Let me explain. Some friends of ours told us about your happy hour specials. So we went on a Tuesday night at 9 pm. Once we got to the bar and saw our choices on the happy hour menu, we couldn't make up our minds. We loved the fact that some of the appetizers and desserts are only 6 bucks. Since it was our first time, we decided that a couple hundred more trips should be able to allow us to experience every one of your creations.

I decided to go with the Max Brenner Sliders while my wife went for the Philly Sliders. For dessert, we decided to share the S'mores Concoction. 

We were a bit hungry so we were thinking of ordering some more food after we put our order in. But when our two orders got there, we didn't have to because these "appetizers" that we supposedly ordered were pretty much meals by themselves! Both sliders were scrumptious and filling. 

As for the S'mores Concoction, two words came to mind after tasting it. Rich and Decadent. It's comparable to a person just trying out drugs for the first time and is curious about other drugs. Well, I can say this dessert is the gateway to all the other desserts on your menu! So if you have a sweet tooth, you just might overdose here.

So ever since we were there the first time, we have been back several times, even bringing other friends and family with us. If we don't have kids with us, we hit up your 3 to 6 pm or 9 pm to close happy hours at your bar because you have to be 21 and older. 

So in closing, maybe you should have a chocolate lovers stamp card or something because I know for sure we would have filled up about 2 of them.Oh, Victoria Street. Beautiful quaint colourful Victoria Street. It entices you with its quirky colours--it's possibly, the with the exception of Cockburn Street, the most colourful street in Edinburgh. It's, to be honest, almost the twin of Cockburn Street. Quirky, colourful, and full of shops that will tear large holes in your pockets. 

Victoria Street is one of the many ways (in Edinburgh, there are always many ways) to get to the Grassmarket, but specifically from George the IVth Bridge. Victoria Street's home to the Grain Store, Swish, Demi-Johns, the eternal Christmas Shop, Oink and more. 

It is picturesque, terribly picturesque. If only they hadn't built that hideous hotel at the top of the street...It first time here at Teriyaki Boy Healthy Grill. I looking for something on the healthy side after doing an one hour bike class. I always notice this place on my way too and from class. So figure why not give it try! Teriyaki chicken it kind of is what it is for me. Not that big of fan but look at it as more of an inexpensive meal. I normally go too Teriyaki Madness since its closer too my side of town. Always enjoy mixing the food palate up.

I ordred the large teriyaki chicken bowl. I enjoyed! I thought the chicken was grilled right on nice char grill marks on both sides and nice moist. I like the vegetables they served sliced carrots (unlike more mass market or dime dozen teriyaki chicken bowls either shredded or big chunks sometimes not even cooked but raw), zucchini (again usually broccoli find), and course traditional pieces of cabbage. The teriyaki sauce not fan of overkill. So for me liked fact they have enough covered the chicken and get into the vegetables. The white rice was cooked perfect.

I surprise that the menu was pretty diverse from the appetizers, the alternatives comes too brown rice, or subbing different things in it. They even offer Jay Cutler size bowl. If you don't know Jay Cutler he won the Mr Olympia before. So its big boy bowl one that if your hungry should think about ordering. 

Talk about small place and unfortunately located right next too LVAC so they get lot of post workout meals. I just barely found spot too eat on the counter area. If theres a  negative always positive? You can feel fit, healthy, or feel like busted sweat at the gym at Teriyaki Boy.I love donuts. I seriously love donuts and Bosa makes some of the best donuts around. We usually stop in late-night and ask for whatever is warm and fresh. The owner is usually baking after 11pm. I love their old-fashioned style donuts with chocolate frosting, maple frosting, or crumb topping. Hubby loves the fritters. I'm not too much of a fan of the cream filled style, but do enjoy the jelly filled. If you go at in-between hours or middle of the day, your donut may feel a little stale, but still very tasty. Late-night ... use the drive-thru. They're open 24 hours a day for your donut dining pleasure. Yum.Delicious, smooth and rich!
Needs more flavours.Flaming cheese is a good show! A little scary but good fun! Very lemony, and cheese has a good texture if you like greek cheese.  The tzatziki sauce is awesome. It has small diced cucumbers, and is not overly yogurt-y, or sour cream-y.  I had the chicken and lamb kebabs...Lamb med rare. and it was cooked perfectly. Juicy and tender with a great flavor. Not overpowering at all. I also like the rice pilaf that it came with. Good dish to share.  The only thing I wasn't too fond of is the dessert. We goth the baklava.  It was the rolled kind (not as flaky..more dense) and I think it was made with corn syrup, rather than honey. It had a ton of cinnamon shaken onto it and was a little too sweet with a strong cinnamon flavor.   Overall, the food is good and our server was so nice! I will definitely come back for the lamb.  They said they may start doing belly dancing/music for entertainment a couple nights per week, so I will be on the lookout!This taco restaurant was great, not amazing as people say though. My all time favorite tacos, especially for cabeza is still El Chato in Los Angeles. 

I ordered:

1 Chorizo Taco - good, but not memorable. It lacked a punch.
1 Cabeza Taco - delicious taco and the green sauce was spicy.
3 Adobado Tacos - the texture was crunchy and the meat was flavorful. It wasn't spicy at all though unfortunately. I felt the meat could have been a bit more tender. When they serve you this meat, they cut it off the spinning rotisserie and crisp it up on a pan. I think the crisping on the pan part of it is unnecessary. 

All in all, I'd definitely come again.The worst part of moving from sd to Vegas was the lack of bomb mexi food.thank god tacos el Gordo followed me out here. I can continue to get gordoThis place was on my list when I flew out.  I wasn't disappointed.  Worker at the casino also recommended this restaurant.  Very clean, fast workers.  Can get crowded, so don't be shy-get up to the counter and order.  OK, I was one of the few English-only speakers there.  The folks behind the counter are bilingual and quickly figured out my lack of Spanish.  Great food.  adobada fries are a must.  The tortillas are so good.  Meals come with grilled onions (scallions) and a pepper.  Desert was a street taco.  Wonderful menu that had cabeza and lengua.Brother's pizza is one of the best pizzas I've ever had! Definitely doesn't taste the same in every bite as Pizza Hut/Dominos. So if that's what you're looking for, don't go here! But every bite into their pizza is different and keeps me wanting more. Sure the service isn't amazing, but they weren't rude either. That's all I ask for.My first experience with Bliss/Rebar was during a Phoenix Pub Crawl.  After already having visited several other pubs and bar it was refreshing to find a place where the large group could all sit together and hang out instead of being scattered.  It was quick and easy to get drinks and the patio seating was a welcomed environment. Since that time I have returned numerous times to visit both the bar half on a first friday or to hang out with friends and also to chevk out their restsurant half. Living down the street Bliss/Rebar has become one of my favorite local places to visit. 

My friends and I love to come here for Sunday morning brunch. There socials on mimosas and bloody Mary's are exceptional. We usually take advantage of the $10 mimosa during brunch.  When there are four of us it is enough for everyone to have two glasses worth.   Their brunch menu is quite amazing, breakfast nachos, pancakes, breakfast sandwhich(on a pretzel bun-a little taste of heaven there), and so much more.  I haven't tried one item on it that I have not enjoyed.

I have also been here for dinner many times.  The Mac and cheese is amazing! Love the spicy chorizo version, although I like to add bacon to it.  The meatloaf sand which is delicious, love that the meatloaf is wrapped in bacon. Their salads are served with giant romaine lettuce leaves so you can turn your salad into a lettuce wrap if you like.  I haven't tried it yet but I'm looking forward to the quinoa and lentil salad. I would recommend trying any sand which on a pretzel bun.  It culinary wonderment how the pretzel bun can compliment any sand which or burger into melt in your mouth magic. The fries are shoe string size and can be flavored in a few ways. My favorite is still the salt and pepper but the garlic Parmesan is a close second.  The draw back to having fries is that it is an extra charge $2, since the offered side is a small salad. While this is healthier for you, if I'm going to eat a burger or sand which I don't want a healthy salad as a side. 

The drinks here warrant a mixed review.  While Bliss/Rebar offers a daily, including weekends, happy hour from 3-6:30, the caliber of the drinks is nothing exceptional. I have tried just about all of the specialty cocktails there isn't one that stands out to me as exceptional.  The drinks themselves do feel a bit watered down and lack that punch you expect to have. The group therapy is a fun drink to have with a couple of friends.  It is served in a extra large champaign style glass/bowl and multiple straws. While sharing this drink was fun the nearly $20 price tag is a bit steep when 75% of the glass is ice. :( The daily drink specials are fun but I usually have to point out on my phone what they are to the waitstaff.I have been here several times; however I have only tried the chicken Nachos.  It seems to me the ingredients they use are very "natural" and fresh.  The chicken taste pretty good and has a little bit of spice to it.  They also have a salsa bar with about 3 salsa options, clilantro, onions etc.  Service has always been pretty good.  They generally ask if I want free chips and salsa which is an added bonus.  Maybe a little over priced for some items, but I think the quality of food is probably a little better then other mexican places that offer the same selections.Pork Belly. Smoked Salmon and Creme Fraiche. It's like Paula Deen and Wolfgang Puck got together, downed a bottle of Pinot, made culinary love and "wa la"..this is their baby. A thin crust with the freshest ingredients. I must say y'all...(for the Paula) fans...it was fabulous. And "BAM" for the Wolfie fans as I am craving this as I review. 

We walked into Brick on a slow Sunday evening. Didn't expect a big crowd as it was the holiday weekend. We bucked up to the bar (that's how I roll) and had immediate and friendly service from Santos.

My friend Kirk raved about the tuna tartare and he was spot on Mary. Served in a chilled martini glass with lightly cinnamon dusted fried won tons. This was a crunchy, fresh, delicious culinary experience. I even added it to my Oprah grateful journal. The "corn cakes" (more like pancakes) with more silky smoked salmon were good. Hard to follow heaven in a glass. I cannot for the life of me remember the third appetizer. Hmm...is that not a good sign?

I know I sipped a bit of Kirk's Spritzer. Yep. Spritzer my gays and friend of gays. But this wasn't your mama's spritzer. This had Hendrick's Gin and it was fabulous! 

Undeniably named after all the brick walls, Brick also had a modern, fresh feel. When I think of Brick I think of lick. As in finger lickin' good. Can't wait to return!The atmosphere and people itself deserve 5 starts.. What a great bunch of friendly happy people.. And in Vegas that's RARE these days... I'd make my way back a couple times a week but it's a little too pricey for that but perfect for a random breakfast morning... The French toast was on point.. The orange juice was way too thick for my liking- I felt like I was eating an orange... From a cup. The ordering and paying process is a bit confusing, you're not sure if you sit down and wait or go up to the counter.. We woulda sat there for an hour ready to go if we didn't see other people walking up to the register... But all in all it was good and I'll be going back =)No wait, no lacerations, and clean eyebrows. These are the basic requirements I ask for in a threading establishment. I then come to find out that I can purchase 4 for the low low price of $25 if I act now. Before doing so, I looked at my eyebrows for several minutes to see if I was happy with the job. Sure enough, I liked it even though the arch is higher than I normally go for. As long as they still resemble a man's brow line I am happy. Please do not make me too beautiful, the world would not be able to handle it.

Enough with the self loving and on with the details. I walked in without an appointment and was greeted warmly. After being ushered into the chair, the lady had her way with my stray hairs. She was quick, diligent, and precise. I was twitching often. It must have been from my last experience because I was squirming. After asking if it was my first time, she told me that all this movement was no good. She must have thought I had a nervous tick. I just didn't want to be hurt again. Is it too much to expect warm, kindness, and a gentle hand? She might not have had the last of the three, but she knows her business. I got a laugh, some idle chit chat, nice brows, and a deal all in one.This place is a little dive-y, and the hours are very Apache-Junction (they close at 9:00 on a Saturday?!), but the food is excellent and they deal with the seasonal crowds that enter AJ in January through April.

The Southwestern Burrito (I think that's what it's called, the one with cactus in it) is huge and tasty.  The cornbread is heavenly.  The margaritas are great.Yes, their burgers are great!  There, I said it.  I'm not a burger lover.  So, take that with a grain of salt.  I'd usually stay away from chains, but on a long drive through Phoenix, I just wanted to drive by and see what downtown looks like.  It's a Saturday after all, and the usual crowd I figured would be away.
Come for the burgers; made in different ways the way you wish.  The fries are great, too.  I didn't get a chance to read Yelp before hand, so we ended up ordering two small fries.  The brown bag was so heavy with about 2 lbs of fries.  The good part, they are good, too.
I liked that they served several types of tea.  Plus point for that.
I was worried about the signs posted all over the restaurant, though.  Is this really their ambiance else where?  Someone join me in telling the chain to get rid of the testimonials by newspapers and magazines on the walls.  It's okay to be good, but tacky to use clippings all over your walls saying so.In 'n' Out, I don't know how to tell you this, but . . . I've found someone else.  No, no, it's not like that, it was nothing you did!  Your burgers with their fresh toppings are delicious... but sometimes I just need a little change of pace, maybe something with grilled onions, grilled mushrooms, and bacon... mmm... bacon.  Oh, sorry.  You want to know the name?  I don't see why that...  You insist?  Okay... it's Five Guys.

Oh!  You're upset!  YOU'RE upset!  Well let me tell you what - Five Guys' fries are delicious, whether they come in Cajun OR regular!  And I NEVER liked your fries, In 'n' Out!  I just pretended to like them, but they're skinny, kind of limp, never flavorful, and you don't get very many.  Five Guys cuts 'em thick, salts them up, and pours an extra scoop into the bag, how do you like that!  And they give you FREE peanuts to munch on while you wait.  You never give me anything!

What?  No... you're right, Five Guys is a more expensive taste.  That's true, it is over $10 for a burger, fries, and drink, as opposed to your $5.  And I do have to park in a garage that loosely resembles a labyrinth designed by Escher.  But if you eventually make it up to the restaurant, they VALIDATE.  You have NEVER validated me!  Oh, that's right, you have surface parking, but don't try to pretend that's a feature with the temperature hitting 100!  You're ridiculous.

What's that?  Does Five Guys have milkshakes?  Uh... hm.  Milkshakes.  I never thought about that.  They don't.  Would you mind if I got my burger and fries from there and then came to you for the shake?  No?  Fine.  You're so overprotective and hyper-traditional sometimes.  Live a little.

I hope we can still be friends, In 'n' Out, but I just think I need to see other burgers.  Please don't pelt me with limp fries when I turn my back.Nice oasis in the middle of the Palazzo gaming floor. Drinks were not that superior and the service was just A-OK but the lady DJ definitely  knew what she was doing and played a great mix of music including Jazz, Latin, Rock, etc mixing it very nicely which provided for a great atmosphere of relaxation, smoking a long cigar,chatting with my friends and watching various characters come and go. That's entertainment!Great food! Fresh ingredients and flavor! Maybe a little better selection on desserts...Hey I asked for a 7 on the 1-5 scale and it was nice and super spicy. Got to like a place that is willing to "warm up" my food for me. I had the wontons and Chu Chee dish and they were great.I think Gabi puts it very well in that everyone had mixed feelings about Lifetime Fitness and At One yoga merging.  I had been a member of The Village for about 13 years when I decided to leave and join At One Yoga.  I really loved the atmosphere of At One and was happy with my choice.  When I heard about the merger I wasn't sure what to expect but was trying to keep a open mind.  I do really like the new facility... the female locker room is very nice and clean with the same amenities as the village locker rooms.  I love the fact that I can do some cardio and/or weights and then attend the yoga classes led by the instructors that I LOVE:).  The only thing I miss about the old at one yoga studio is the HOT HOT yoga classes... I wish that they could figure out how to work some of those into the class schedule.  All in all thus far I am happy about the change:)The Student Union is really a useful place to study and eat. So if you don't mind a little noise, chow down on Panda Express, Starbucks, Taco Bell, Metro Pizza, Subway, Greens To Go, or Jamba Juice. If you need a small little snack to last you through class, you can grab one at the vending machines or the POD, which has a variety of to-go items and essentials like Tylenol. 

The food isn't that special, but since when was school food ever good? 

The second floor has some quieter, more private seating where you can study. It also houses the ballroom and most of the meeting rooms, where most student organizations and events gather. 

The third floor contains your student government offices, so if you have a concern or question...now you know where to go! There's no seating up there, it's not a study area! 

If you need to be on campus and you're dying from hunger, this is the place to be! Just use your Rebel Card to save on tax!I've been here a few times and I've had great experiences both times.  I used to work in an animal hospital, so its nice to see them practicing to the standards that I was held to.  All of the staff is super friendly and you can see they have a genuine love for animals.

One thing that I am not a fan of though is that they do everything with the animals in the back, away from you.  So they come in, chat for a minute or so, then take your animal in the back and do whatever you came there for, then come out and talk again.  Personally, I'd much rather see what they are doing right in front of me.  Plus, once your animal leaves, then your simply sitting in a waiting room with no magazines looking at the screen saver on the computer.

I will return, but next time I'll probably ask for them to do everything in front of me instead of in the back.  Hopefully it goes well!During my bachelorette party, some of the girls and I bought travel zoo vouchers for 1 hour massage and side treatment $89. I got the mini 20 mins facial as my side treatment. They add gratuity and taxes on top so total was approx $125. I was a little apprehensive about coming here after reading the reviews about the rude people who worked here. Much to my surprise everyone was professional and friendly. We arrived and were given a tour of the facilities. This is one of the nicer spas I have been to. I stuck my belongings in my locker, changed into my bathing suit and a lady came to get me for my facial. She steamed my face, then gave me a light facial. Next was my 1 hour massage. Macy my masseuse told me to get nekked and get under the covers. I did as I was told and practically fell asleep until I accidently kicked her when she was trying to massage my ticklish feet. After my massage I joined my other friends for a dip in the Jacuzzi, steam room and pool. We also enjoyed complimentary juice, water, apples and granola. It was almost time for dinner so I jumped into the spacious shower stall for a quick shower. It is real convenient to shower there since they provide q tips, blow dryer, deodorant, lotion, etc. I definitely recommend this spa!Sometimes you just need a naked rubdown... and this is a (legal) place to do it. (Note: I'm joking, keep your boxers on, people!)

Things to know...
-If you sign up for a players card, you can get 2-for-1 massage offers in their monthly mailer
-Locals always get 30% off
-Gratuity is already on the bill
-Included in a massage is use of their pool, lounge and locker room. 
-Avg. 60 min massage runs around $150

The massage itself was great. Th masseuse was a total pro and provided a completely relaxing experience, even while working out some crazy knots in my back. Chilling in the pool after and watching SportsCenter was icing on the cake. Def stop in if you're hurting in the HRH.Having just returned to Wisconsin after eight months in Hanoi, I was eager to try the local Madison Vietnamese Restaurant scene and was happy to find Pho Nam just around the corner.  I've now been their twice and have been very pleased.  

Their pho is very good.  The chicken pho has a tasty broth and generous slices of white breast meat.  The "extras", herbs, limes and sprouts, are all fresh and very high quality.  Definite thumbs up on the pho.

We also tried the springrolls and, while tasty enough, they weren't fresh (which is the antithesis of Vietnamese cooking).  They were good sized and full of good, quality ingredients, in spite of being "pre-made".

I also tried the my xao which is essentially meat/vegetables served over egg noodles and it was very good, although Pho Nam fried the egg noodles (as opposed to serving them simply steamed as was the case in Hanoi; a regional variation maybe?).  I prefer the later, but wasn't disappointed.

One of my favorite things about Vietnam was the iced coffee there, so I was very happy to see "ca phe sua da" on the menu at Pho Nam and it didn't disappoint.  Fresh, Veitnamese coffee served with sweetened condensed milk and served on ice is fantastic and Pho Nam does this very well.

The service was fine if not somewhat inattentive.  The restaurant itself, in a strip mall, is clean and bright.  Prices are decent.  

All in all, I'm happy with Pho Nam and will return again whenever I need a little taste of "Hanoi".where did this place come from, I guess i'm not from Mesa so  I would never find this place on my own.  Step inside the Mekong Palace, it might look like another strip mall and as soon as you step inside your in  extreme Asian territory.  
I really can't ready everything.  

Ok keep walking it might seem deserted later in the day but the food court was poping when I was there.  there's defiantly a nice selection of small business and restaurants.  Mainly the Dim Sum and the Soup place is why I go there.  
Vietnamese place serves Hot Pot. meaning you buy veggies and meat and then everyone heats up their own soup. Installed for every seat at the tables is a little warming plate to cook your soup.  Kind of cool. Whatch out a few dollars here and there can really add up but for the most part very affordable. 
You also have to make your own sauce so make sure you do that right.Otto Enoteco Pizzeria's was delicious. We went here for a friend's birthday party, and it was great, we had the back room to ourselves, which was nice. In addition, the thin crusted pizza came out perfectly. We had a veggie one and a pepperoni one, both were delicious. Our friend's also ordered the cheese platter, which could easily be shared with 3-4 people easily. It wasn't that great, so you could easily get another appetizer instead. But the atmosphere and pizza are great here.Otto, formerly San Marcos is a favorite lunch stop for us in Vegas. It's the cheese, all about the cheese . 5 different choices for about 25 bucks and a nice wine by the glass list makes this fun. Add some olives with the spreads served with the platter and you have a nice afternoon meal. Great people watching from the bar and watching the staff work the cold setup right in front of us was entertaining. Those guys work clean. 

We have never had dinner here, but it's the cheese  that brings us back. Perfect Parm Reggiano buffalo milk mozzarella, and a blue cheese creamier than mothers milk starred on the nifty presentation board.

   .It's really about the cheese!!!I don't miss a lot of things about Chicago, but one of the few things I do is being able to walk into just about any bar and see Guinness Draught.  The bottles and cans just aren't the same.  Buffalo Wild Wings gets points *just* for the Guinness.

Otherwise, it's a sports bar.  They have wings and tenders and burgers and mozzarella sticks- bar food, but it's done well.  It's consistent, if not world-changing.  They've got more than enough TVs (flatscreens and and projectors), and lots of beers on tap, including my favorite, Guinness.  Staff is friendly, personable, helpful, and quick.  My server, Maygan, just moved from Peoria University, so we had a bit to talk about.

And unlike the disaster of a parking lot situation that hobbles the Chandler location, it looks like they've got plenty of parking.

And did I mention the Guinness Draught?The patio is great for peolple watching and the beer is cold.  I see some here who didn't like the food, but it never crossed my mind to ever eat there.  Just drink and have a good timeBeing new to the downtown, I am not familiar with all of the good places to go for lunch.  On top of that, there aren't many within walking distance of my office.  It takes a good ten minutes for me to even get my car out of the parking garage and soon the summer heat will be here and I'll have no desire to leave the building at all.  I was very hopeful about Zeez since it's only 4 blocks from my office.

I checked the menu out on-line and was in the mood for shawerma but when I got there, I opted for the Phoenician Chicken sandwich.  This is a shredded chicken on a roll.  The chicken was very tasty and the bread was fabulous.  I'm glad I switched it up at the last minute.  The staff was extra helpful and the place is very clean.  There were about 8-10 tables and they weren't too busy - mostly government types (like myself) since it's across the street from the courts and jails.  There is plenty of room for more tables once this place gets busy and I expect that it will be once the new Court Tower opens in February of 2012.

The sandwich came with some pita chips and a little hummus and a pickle.  It was pretty good as well.  

Next time I think I'll try the shawerma. :)Like Roberto's, but better food!  Best chile relleno I've had since L.A. 20 years ago.  They get horchata right too:  Not too watery.  It might seem silly, but more than half the time I've been to Roberto's the horchata is too watered down.   Great hot sauces at the sauce and vegetable bar.  Beef burritos have lots of onions and green pepper --  I like them that way, but if you don't,  then you'll probably want them to hold the peppers and/or onions.  Counter s staff are always friendly and helpful, unlike Roberto's.  There's a reason every time I come in here there's always locals ordering.  They do a taco shop the way it ought to be done!I drove all the way across town during my week in Vegas just to try this shaved ice place out. We caught up with them at a little farmer's market and I got a bowl with coconut, watermelon, and cotton candy. It was good, but definitely not the best I've ever had. Still glad I drove over to try it out.Oh BabyCakes! 

I went here on a Saturday morning around 11:00 and only waited about 20 minutes before I was seated. I consider that pretty good timing for a great brunch place. 

I heard all about the Red Velvet Pancakes so that is what I ordered. BabyCakes also has tons of other types of pancakes too. Smore's, Banana and Bacon just to name a few. 

I also ordered the Huntington omelet which come with bacon, cheese, avocado and pico de gallo. This thing was huge and delicious.  

The service here is great too. 

Overall 4 stars. I am taking away a star because the ambiance seemed a little plain. If you disagree, try Sabrina's Cafe in the Italian Market in Philadelphia.Red velvet pancakes were really good. The cream cheese icing sauce made them too sweet in my book. I just dipped a few bites in the sauce. The whipped cream that came on top made them sweet enough. Service was fast and friendly.I like this location because it's not too busy and they always has tables outside the store so I can enjoy the latte and cigarettes with my friends.Great owners. Super staff. DELICIOUS seafood. Prepare to get messy and enjoy yourself for a bit. Peelin shrimps and crackin crab shells takes time and skill, ha! Large, family style, picnic tables with butcher paper. Beers, wines, sports. Yum! Lookin forward to see them build on the west side!!!Been here several times, like the smaller feel of the farm for my toddlers, always have a great time!Stumbled upon this brand new restaurant adjacent to Bally's Steakhouse this past weekend.  What a hidden gem in the land of overpriced strip food.  Feeling slightly under the weather, we ordered a bowl of pho. The chef must have been tutored personally by ramen girl's soup nazi because they have got this down to perfection.  The vietnamese spring rolls are also some of the best I've had.  Only disappointment was the pad thai which was swimming in too much sweet sauce.  But the prices more than make up for the one dish not too our liking.  The dishes are reasonably priced by Vegas Strip standards.  We ordered 2 dishes, an appetizer and a bottle of Sonoma Cutrer and the bill was under $100.

The ambience is cool with comfortable wooden booths next to a water pond. The service is exceptional  When the word gets out about this restaurant, it will be crowded because there aren't a ton of tables.   If you find yourself on this side of the strip, definitely seek out Sea.Stopped by for lunch with a few coworkers to get additional opinions and to order something off the menu with some kick to the spice level. The other three (one of whom had never eaten Indian food, none of whom had been here before) ordered the lunch buffet, and I ordered the Chicken Madras (chicken cooked in Madras curry) at 8/10 level heat.

I was very pleased with the Chicken Madras. A nice blend of flavors - savory, spicy, a bit of sweetness - combined with a pleasingly spicy kick that complemented the flavors rather than overwhelming them. The naan (we had one basket of regular, one basket of garlic) was excellent as well, served warm, crispy, and chewy.

Everyone enjoyed their food, and the other fan of spicy foods also liked the bit of Chicken Madras she tried, finding it spicy-flavorful but not overpowering.

Service was prompt and courteous, and the overall experience went well.

Given my second experience here, I'm bumping my score up to a 4/5.I went yesterday, Saturday, to their buffet.  It is not a big buffet but it was very good and had a variety of choices.  The Tandoori Chicken Wings were Out Of This World GREAT! And, the curry dishes were very good.  I even tried one called Goon Fish Curry and it was probably the best of all.  Very good curry dish and the fish was very tasty. You can get regular or garlic naan bread with your buffet... I got the garlic and it was really good, hot and fresh. The place is very nice and clean. I went once on a weekday and once on Saturday.  The buffet is on Wednesday through Saturday and the weekday wasn't very busy but there was a nice crowd on Saturday.

I will definitely be back!I'm enthusiastic about any place that manages to both be conscious of the caloric values of what they put on the plate AND the variety and tates of foods offered. And that's what Seasons 52 does.

Nothing on the menu goes above 450 calories or so, and the server will guide you on real values.

The menu changes through the year, focusing on what is truly in season (thus the Seasons 52). 

I had the flatbread for lunch and found it delicious and filling at only 400 calories or so. The service was quick and the surroundings were nice. Back in 1992 I was a starving student, so I don't recall how "nice" restaurants looked back then. Maybe they looked like this?

I think we need more of this. It's a health-conscious restaurant that doesn't seem like penance. I plan to go back.This place is pretty damned good and I'm disappointed that I didn't try it sooner. I didn't understand the concept of fresh, healthy upscale eating so I was surprised that everything was so delicious while minimally impacting my ever-expanding waistline. It just goes to show you that in this world of poisonous, processed foods it is still possible to enjoy your food and be healthy so well done to these guys.

I started off with a beer in the bar and started with the Blackened Steak and Bleu Cheese flatbread. The bread was thin and crispy and topped with two of my favorite things. Really delicious.

For my main I had the grilled scallops with asparagus and tomato mushroom pearl pasta. The scallops were AMAZING and so tasty without being bathed in butter. My plate was served up so beautifully arrange with the asparagus spears arranged in a grid over the pasta, it was almost a shame to eat it...almost.

Healthy then went out the window when we went through more than one of their Mini-Indulgence desserts. I had the key lime but my favorite was the raspberry with chocolate chip cannoli. Still fewer calories than a slice of cheesecake.

The atmosphere is very nice, the service is great and like I said, you really can enjoy some delicious food with out so much butter, fat and additives.

A good solid choice for a nice dinner or lunch.Always fab toddy!My best advice to you is to get yourself down to Vietnam House now, immediately, before word gets out, it gets busy, prices go up and it moves to a larger premises, which would diminish it's perfect, bijoux charm.  Upon arrival at Vietnam House, we were greeted by the genuine, ebullient welcome of the owner, Jodie. The interior is small, but bright and perfectly formed, with a window booth for seating larger parties and five other tables which seat up to four people, albeit somewhat snugly. As we pored over the menu, struggling to decide which tempting treats to indulge in, Jodie kindly invited us to put our wine in the fridge beside us to stop it getting warm. It was almost like being in a good friend's house and told to make yourself at home!

Eventually we decided on fresh spring rolls, followed by Pho Chay (tofu noodle soup) and Com Ca Kho (braised fish with steamed rice). Our lollipop-style starter arrived perched on skewers, a quirky twist which was in juxtaposition to the quirkless simplicity of the dish itself. The overwhelming freshness of the ingredients sang through, soft rice pancakes wrapped around rice noodles, the pork and shrimp harmonising perfectly with the Vietnamese special peanut sauce - my only criticism being that there was not enough of the sauce, leaving the overall dish lacking punch ever so slightly.

Our light starter was followed without too much delay by our fragrant mains. My companion had been advised that the large soup was quite substantial - no exaggeration by anyone's standards! A sizeable bowl arrived, accompanied by coriander, bean sprouts and other accompaniments, to be added to the hearty soup, according to taste. After some experimentation, it was decided that the (once again) outstandingly fresh tasting soup, which spoke simply yet eloquently of the balanced blend of ingredients used, was best enjoyed with a smattering of sprouts and a clutch of coriander on top.

The braised fish dish arrived in a bowl, accompanied by a smaller bowl of fluffy steamed rice. The large chunk of white fish swam in the snug comfort of the rich red sauce, inviting, fragrant and full of eastern promise. My initial confusion as to how to manage the fluid dish (do I put the rice in the bowl with the fish, if so, how do I eat it with chop sticks?!) gave way to sheer joy at the lightly spiced, full flavour of the dish. The fish was delicate and perfectly cooked, lightly flavoured by the cooking process and excellently accompanied by the sauce. The sole criticism of the simply served dish, is that the unpretentious presentation of the fish on the bone, inevitably involved bones... If you're here on a first date, don't have this dish - picking bones out of your mouth isn't a good look!

Due to pre-wedding diet and time constraints, we decided to forego desserts, so this commentator cannot guide as to the quality of the finish. Next time, I will complete the task! Our bill arrived and I can honestly say that I have rarely been so pleasantly surprised by the inverse proportion of price to quality. The bill for two came in at about £24 including corkage - phenomenal, given that the meal was tasty, fresh, excellently executed and served with the homeliest, warmest and most genuine service I have experienced in Edinburgh for years.  In summary, I repeat - this secret will not be kept for long, so get yourself down to the Vietnam House now, before word gets out.Quiet, pretty park tucked away on the SW side of Summerlin. Lots of grass. It must've been built with baseball/softball in mind. Multiple baseball fields, and even a batting cage. But there are tennis and basketball courts as well. Nice children's play area. Bathroom was clean and there were plenty of shaded spots to sit and relax.I can't believe that I missed Teuchters for several years - this is a hidden gem of a pub. Always warm and inviting with a great selection of whiskies and guest beers, and the beer garden is fantastic in the summer.

The food is good too - the mug of chips are in my mind the best chips in Edinburgh.Great gourmet comfort food at reasonable prices. A great atmosphere and wait staff makes this a great all-around find!Great neighborhood spot! Love the deign and at atmospher.
Service was amazing and the food was great. 

We had the chicken meatballs ans Zucchini pancake for aps - both great!
Child's quasadilla wasn't as popular but our server noticed, apologized and asked to replace it, they took it off our bill.
Our dishes were D-lish! The cast iron chicken, searen salmon and shepherd's pie. The clams weren't as good but still enjoyable.
We really enjoyed it and we look forward to going again soon !Flannys is hands down my favorite place in the valley to grab a beer, a burger, and hang out with friends at lunchtime.

I can't speak for other times of day, but it's generally quiet at lunch.  They have a constantly changing beer list with something for just about everyone, and the menu is moderately eclectic for bar fare.

Yes - the staff can be a little gruff.  But they are never rude, they haven't messed up anything we've ever ordered, and all the food is better than it should be.

I highly suggest stopping in, grabbing a flight of random beers and some street tacos.  Always seems to work for me.My husband suggested coming here when we started talking about getting bikes. I was pretty excited to check it out. There was a sign in the front starting something to the effect that their bike inventory changes daily. I must have caught them on an off day. Oh well, more reason to go back.

Tons of office equipment...chairs, huge desks, filling cabinets. They had a lot of computer monitors and some new in box printers. I don't know a thing about computers but I wouldn't really trust buying one from here. That's just me though.

If you buy something and don't have the means to get it home you have 7 days to pick it up, which is nice. They also have auctions.I complained the entire way up.  I did.  "Is it safe?"  "I don't do zip lines."  "It's not a question of whether it's fun:  it's a question of remaining alive."  I stopped short (barely) of hyperventiliating.  

I hope I entertained the folks in line because I was at my most annoying.  Only when I heard that the guy behind me was from Skerries, Ireland (a town where a friend lives) did I stop.  Then we had to have our picture taken with him, and now our friend knows I'm kind of a freak.  (Maybe he knew that already.)

I had a good time.  I'm not sure it was worth $20 but it was fun.It is a blast and worth every penny.  Line moved pretty fast, people in the sales office were very nice.  Guys up on the roof top were a little grumpy, but it was 114 degrees out that day.  Lady at the end couldn't find our pictures took about 20 min and 3 people later to find our pics.  Would have rather spent the money on another ride, but wife wanted a picture.I was so glad to see it was in Fashion Square because I was tired of walking around there. I stopped to get a sample of their tea and I was hooked. I think I hung around quite a bit to drink as much Free tea that I could. I had a group of kids with me though and they were following in suit. I asked questions about the tea and what to put it in. They gave me a lot of information. I informed them I was going to order tea online when I got back home so they were pushy on me and I didn't want to stay in the store to long because there were a lot of breakables in there. Over all it was cool in a nice petite setting.Best little tucked away spot in the hotel.I appreciate your extra soft 2-ply bathroom tissue! :)If you are looking to get off the strip and chill at a trendy spot this is a must try.  The bar/lounge area gives you a lot of versatility for people watching and mingling.

The happy hour offers 1/2 off on all appetizers.  Score!We eat here pretty regularly -- the food is consistently good and there are a good variety of options covering many regional dishes, including many great vegetarian options as you would expect for Indian fare.  I've been to India and Indian enclaves throughout Asia, and the food is consistent with the real thing.  The heat/spiciness is also consistent with how they serve it in India (i.e. hot is HOT) -- they ask for your your heat preference, so for your first visit you may want to dial it back a notch from what you might normally request locally.

The place is big and clean and bright, but as others note there's not a ton of character.  Service is friendly, and we come enough that they recognize us and welcome us back.  As some have noted it can be a bit slow at times (not always), but I think it's consistent with the food being prepped fresh to order.With a name like Spotted Donkey I was expecting this to be the kind of place where they offer $2 Coronas and Taco Tuesdays. So I was surprised when I walked in to discover that this was actually a nice, sit-down restaurant - like the kind of place you might take a date. (Not that cheap tacos and beer can't make a great date, but you know I'm sayin')

Some co-workers and I were working late in the area so we decided to try it out. I would describe their menu as traditional Mexican food with a twist. To start we ordered a quesadilla with pork to share. It was outstanding! First, it was huge. Second it was loaded with pork - they did not skimp. Third, it was delicious. The pork was nice and tender and drizzled on top there was a garlicky sour cream that really made this entrée great.

For our meals, I ordered the tacos (2 beef, 2 shrimp), co-worker 1 ordered the burger, co-worker 2 ordered the chopped salad. The tacos are like street tacos - small corn tortillas. I really liked the shrimp  - had a good little kick. The beef were good too but the shrimp was better. My co-workers gobbled up their choices as well. The one with the salad said it was one of the best salads she has ever had.

Overall, the service was good, the atmosphere was nice and the food was very tasty. I would go back for sure.We eat here often.  I love the menu and portion sizes are, in my opinion, perfect.  The fish dishes are always good, and I dream about the hummus.  I'm also a huge fan of the spaghetti squash, which is hard to find anywhere else.  The skinny margarita makes the meal complete.Great place to eat well and eat healthy.  the food options are great and light but satisfying at the same time.  The Red Chili Shrimp is so good.  but the restaurant favorite seems to be the Spaghetti Squash Casserole. The drinks are good and have nice refreshing options like the acai pomegranate mojito.I came here for a dinner with family, it was about 15 of us. It was a great atmosphere ( we sat outside) food was delicious, and the service was fast! We had a great time here.Took mom here for a late birthday lunch, but was a little skeptical since a few people have told me the food was not very good. When we got to the restaurant, we entered across from the hostess booth, so we walked across the inside of the restaurant. Very nice layout, bright colors, and you could see everything that was going on in the kitchen. Very impressive. The only thing that was a little off was the hostess station. There was no real order, and a lot of people were just standing around. I flagged down the hostess, who didn't know if she was supposed to be seating people or if someone else was. We opted for the patio since we could be seated right away.

Our server was amazing, and he reminded me a lot of our friend in Portland. He knew the menu in and out, and also new the portion size of the street tacos probably wouldn't fill up my boyfriend. Just an over all great server.

The food was amazing also. We started off with the hummus, worth it. Very flavorful and the texture was not watery or smooth. Loved it. We also got the specialty drinks, a little pricey, but also very good. When our food came out, it was again, all very delicious. 

All in all, we most likely would come again. The prices are a little high, ($90 for 4 people, no alcohol) but since the food is made healthy and also packs a flavor punch, I guess it's worth it.good fresh food place. i'm not a big salad eater. but the sandwich i got was amazing. try it out, the place really wasn't for me. but it's great, go see if it's for you.We were there with my girl,on Sun 7/17 - we had a great time by the pool!-) Sun,drinks,beautiful woman next to me...what else to ask for ???..-)))Prima has a friendly staff, great pizza, and fresh ingredients. You can get a large cheese pizza for $8.99, with $1.50 toppings. That's about the same price as a DiGiorno. They also have giant salads, which are easily split between two people.Great festive atmosphere, love Mexican food and this one is a keeper! Be sure to get there at happy hour cause appetizers are half off as well as $1.00 margarita's never had a bad experience and been there quit often  two thumbs upThis was a fun experience.....assigned seating is nice.  I would like to try the D-Box seating for an action movieVery strong menu that is well executed. We had the marinated olive appetizer, which was generous but maybe a little bland. The Arancini were outstanding - the smoked mozzarella gives them an almost meaty flavor without any meat. I had the chicken parmagiano, which was good. Other reviewers have accurately described it as schnizel-like - pounded thin, breaded and fried with the marinara served on the side. Great flavor, generous portion though the marinara could use a little more punch. Pasta was not included but can be had as a separate side. Dish comes with a small salad. Wife had the short rib tagliatelle, which was amazing - almost like a bolognese but richer and more savory. As a first-time customer, the chef brought us a surprise sample of the panacotta, which was very good. Cocktails were creative and tasty. Wine selection was strong and there were a lot of options by the glass. While we were there for dinner, there seemed to be a solid set of offerings for happy hour (at the bar only), though the bar and dining room are not separated, so the TV and noise from the bar seemed inconsistent with the romantic and intimate atmosphere that the dining room seems to be trying to achieve. We had two cocktails, two starters (plus the bread they bring) two glasses of wine and two entrees for a bill of about $106.Well worth the price. It was one hour of pure relaxation. I went in with a severe neck ache, courtesy of my job. Left without any neck pain.   
Everyone was very nice. Clean facility. So quiet. 
My husband and I had the private room, which to me was a bonus. 
We cannot wait to go back.Food and service were great.  We went for breakfast.Hatch is SO Madison, and I mean that in the best way possible.

They have unique pieces by loads of local artists and craftspeople. Items range from jewelry to Christmas ornaments to pottery to gorgeous handmade cards. They've got a nice set-up on Willy St. in a space that fits their cute, eclectic vibe. Last year I nabbed a necklace with a charm-sized map of Madison. CAN YOU SAY ADORBS. This December they've got an awesome event coming up called 50 Artists Under $50 (http://hatcharthouse.com/2013/12/02/december-at-hatch-50-artists-under-50/).I would probably give these guys 5 stars, but to me 5 stars is for exceptional service. 

I had a front porch light not working and I of course tried changing the bulb with no luck. Then I noticed that when I turned the light fixture itself, it would turn on- momentarily, so I figured it must just be a loose wire. 

I then started to unscrew the light fixture so that I could check the wiring (I've never done this before, but it looks simple enough on youtube) but decided to call an electrician when I noticed the light fixture wasn't coming off very easily. 

I didn't want to end up with it just hanging out of the socket because I pulled on it too hard. 

Well, I made an appointment with Eco Electric on their online appointment setter here: http://ecoelectriclv.com/appointment-request/ . 

And that's where they lost a "star". Meaning that they didn't call me to confirm, but they did email asking me if a specific time spot would work. 

I didn't notice the email until about 10am that morning (I emailed them at about midnight) and I called, but they didn't seem to have any record of me in their system. 

That Said... 

I still give them 4 stars because they worked to still get  me a same day appointment and they did. 

The electrician, Joe came out and seemed like a good guy. He though that the problem would be a super simple 5 minute fix, because he sees a lot of sensors go out in these homes. 

Unfortunately that wasn't the problem. The problem turned out to be that I needed a whole new light fixture because it was extremely corroded on the inside where the actual bulb screws in. 

So he still ended up replacing the sensor, at a very discounted price since he was there and still has to charge for the service call, and he said that the sensor would probably go out very soon anyway since he sees that so often. 

So after installing the sensor, what he did was explain to me exactly how to just go to Home Depot and install a new light fixture of my choice, which is very- very easy to do, and this would be cheaper than having him do it. 

Some might be thinking, "Well, you ended up having to fix the problem yourself. Why would you still rate them 4 stars", and my answer is simple... 

Because despite having to pay for the service call, Joe was very honest and wanted to ensure I didn't spend an extra $80 or more for him to install a new fixture, when I could just go down Home Depot, pay $25 for one and install it myself in just a few minutes. 

This also taught me how to fix the problem myself in the future for the back porch light or any other simple light fixtures. 

Bottom line, I feel confident these guys are legit...IPic is a fun experience for a date and a good meal.   This place is great to get your grub on and catch a cool flick.  At first we couldn't find it, but eventually we found our way, its upstairs and is a little swanky but you would expect that when watching a movie in this manner.

I ordered the fish and chips and they did really pretty good.

We got the Premium Plus Seating which is extra but I would recommend, since you are already there, you might as well as take it all in...and we did. The seats are extremely comfy, you can kick back and enjoy the show as you lounge back.

Also, the service here is delightful good to you, bar none.  IPIC YOU!I've never been to a place like this before.  All I can say is that I don't think I'll be able to go to a regular theater again.  I've been here about five times and I never regret paying the premium for everything.  The fillet sliders are great.  They also give you free popcorn!  How can you say no to free popcorn?  

Okay so it's a little pricey for the premium seats, but it's a treat if you don't mind the cost.

P.S. Be prepared to dish it out (see what I did there?) if you decide to watch "Chef" while being asked by a server what you want to eat as you watch the movie.So, I'm a vegetarian but we wound up here post Billboard Music Awards after staggering around trying to hail a cab. Hailing a cab in Vegas apparently requires a guidebook.

Despite the cow house that Holsteins is, they have an "Urth burger". *giggle*

The ambiance is pretty tan and nonviolent. Yes there's a big pink cow off the side when you walk in but beyond that, it doesn't scream STEAKHOUSE! in your face. There are little white outlined cows on glass partitions between booths but it's otherwise rustic mod, casual dining. 

We had no reservations but were seated promptly. It took awhile for the waitress to greet us, but to be fair we were probably extra anxious because we had just sat through three hours of the BMAs and were about to eat the table.

As other Yelpers mentioned the food did come out pretty quick after we ordered. A little weird if I think everything is kinda sitting there udder (get it?) warmers but we were hungry so... whatevs.

The macaroni w/truffle was divine. Order it. The modest portion is good to eat alone, or nicer if you share it. 

Everyone else seemed to enjoy their pulled pork bites, meatballs, guac, and sweet potato fries.

My Urth Burger was HUGE. It didn't taste like a Morning Star, Boca or any other patty I've tried. That's usually a good thing because it means it's homemade, but I would be surprised if was here. A completely fine vegetarian option. 

The cider here is popular. They ran out of two types. There are crazy shakes on the menu that I'll have to try the next time I return.Came here for dinner with a group of 13. I must say, they took forever and a day to seat us. However, everything else after that was smooth sailing.

We were greeted with white truffle popcorn when we were seated but the waitress must not have gotten the memo that 3 small tins of popcorn (which were great) would not satisfy 13 guys' long wait/pre-meal munchies. However, she was on top when it came down to our orders. 

I got the Fun Ghi burger, which they pronounce fungi but should be pronounced more like "fun jee"....anyways, the burger was $17 but should have been more of a $14-15 burger.   The mark up must have been from the "truffle oil" that they claim they put in it but I couldn't taste truffle at all. Came with streak cut fries but I would recommend getting shoestring fries. 

When ordering your burger, order it 1 step more rare since they tend to overcook the patties. I ordered a medium rare and was served medium, NBD.This is probably one of the very few places I'd recommend on the strip. It has really good burgers shakes and fries. The Golden Standard Burger was really good I've also tried the Rising sun it's good as well just not my type of hamburger.  Slightly pricey but you're paying to eat on the strip and this place has better standards when it comes to quality. 
It's def a happening spot as well 
When family and friends come into town this is probably where i'll be taking them on the strip.Awesome burger place. Not only does it serve some of the best burgers, but they also make some of the best malts and shakes ever. Their cocktails are also very creative and tasty as well.

-Gold Standard Burger

This burger is composed of a variety of high quality ingredients, which serves to highlight the deliciousness of the burger. The aged goat cheese provided a gaminess to the burger, which really elevated the flavor profile. The bacon provided a smokiness, which is reminiscent of a smokehouse. The dry aged patty really brought out a beefiness that is not ordinarily found in most burgers. The tomato aioli, arugula, and other remaining components was able to bind together and make it just a great interpretation of a classic burger.

-Billionaire Burger

Another casual but awesome burger restaurant in the Cosmo hotel.We came here craving burgers and thought this place looked great. A little bit of a walk if you're half-drunk and in stilettos, but I made it and live to tell about it. 

Burgers here may not be huge in diameter, but they are DENSE. Really delicious combos of flavors...I think it's hard to go wrong when you're ordering here. 

We had the S'mores boozy milkshake, which didn't really stack up to the price tag, but was tasty nonetheless. The house-made marshmallow on top was an awesome touch. You can easily split one of these with a friend and get more than enough. 

The service, decor, and people watching here is great. I would definitely return, at the very least to see another bachelorette party get heckled by the grossest tornado of bros (a bronado?) in the world. 

Go!We really enjoyed the food and atmosphere. Onions were great! Gold burger was perfect!One negative:Very loud restaurant with music and the games blaring.  Was hard to hold a conversation with my husband. 
Positive: good food and great service.Average burgers! Cheap prices! Went today and it was happy hour so half price shakes and fries. Had the chocolate covered strawberry shake. Tasted amazing. Every time we come we're never disappointed!Good sushi. Very creative rolls. Very attentive service. Thursdays are ladies night:)Let me first state that, even though I'm a fat chick, I am not a fan of buffets.
I find them common, over done and nothing really new.  
So finding myself stuck at the Cosmo for the HP CES Press conference and my son starving we decided to go to the buffet for a late lunch.  
I really wasn't expecting much because of the afore mentioned aversion to buffets and the lateness in the afternoon (almost 2pm) 

It's nice, even at age 55, to be surprised.  We walked right in, and got a great seat.  It was busy but not overly crowded.  Our waiter was right there to take our drink orders and to let us know what stations were available. Having survived the 2nd day of CES, I rewarded myself with a mid day cocktail, the Mombo Italiano-- a hand crafted Bloody mary with infused garlic vodka  I'd go back JUST for the drink at 12.00 each. 

Here is what sets this particular buffet apart: 

They have, for all of you watching your weight, portioned containers of very interesting food.  With little signs that say how many calories & how many carbs per portion.  Brilliant marketing since there are so many who fail to recognize they have fabulous curves.  I had the Mac & bleu cheese--yum and the wild rice with lamb and goat cheese.  

The carving stations.  yes multiple.  I could dive head first into the Asian style bbq pork.  It was melt in your mouth.  

The staff was friendly and made suggestions of what were their favorites.  

I have to say, as I'm writing this realizing the best part of the 2x we've been there, was the staff.  I do like the food selections and the twist with the portioned servings... also made me exercise to walk back up and get another serving... knowing it was 220 calories each.  

I did save room for dessert, a wide selection indeed.  Rice Crispy treats dipped in chocolate? yummo.  

Living in Vegas, it is only for out of town guests and work that I go anywhere near the strip but last week, with no company and no clients, we opted to actually go to the Wicked Spoon for lunch.  If nothing else, for a Vegas local, that says a lot.We loved the Wicked Spoon Buffet!  The price was great considering the hotel that it was located in, and the quality of the food ($17 per person for breakfast).  

They had big bowls of fruit & berries (a MUST for me!), made to order omelet's, lots of different breakfast meat options (bacon, ham, a variety of different sausages), pastries, cereals, yogurts, etc.  

I was so excited to see the eggs benedict, although my only complaint was that I couldn't find the hollandaise sauce.  I don't know if it was on the egg already, and I couldn't taste it, or if they had it sitting somewhere for self-service, and I didn't see it.  Eggs benedict need hollandaise sauce!! :)

Other than that, we will most certainly be back!!I am not a fan of buffets...really, however I stayed in the Cosmopolitan for 5 nights and as a platinum Marriott member they comp you free breakfast here.  Thank you.

I love their small plates (kind of tapas like) concept as I could try many things but still keep it relatively healthy.  They had smoothies, fresh fruit, cook to order eggs, slab bacon, gourmet pastries, yogurt parfaits, potatoes of all kinds...and the list goes on.  The weekend brunch was a little kicked up and busier but I was a frequent guest here during my stay...well at least every morning.Best buffet in Las Vegas.  Small portions of food come in little pots.  Everything was good from the salad to the main dish to the yummy dessert.  HeavenBuffet inside the Cosmopolitan?  Check.  

Wicked Spoon is slightly different from your usual buffet.  Many of the items are actually served as if you are dining at a tapas or small plates restaurant.  Curry in tiny metal pots, fried chicken in small baskets, and pastor tacos on small square plates are just some of the items served this way.  

It's a pretty unique concept for a buffet, and it certainly helps eliminate some of the mess some of these items can create.  When's the last time you saw a clean tacos station at buffet place?  Here, it is all prepared for you and all you have to do is add the condiments.    It's also a good way to "portion control."  The small plates prevents going overboard and it prevents them on making a buttload of food, except... I can only imagine how high the water bill is to wash all them plates.

Mostly Americanized versions of food from around the world.  Asian, French, Italian, and Mexican are some of the easy ones to spot.  Everything's fairly solid and not bad, but I do have to say the Asian selections is probably the weakest: Korean BBQ rib tasted a little off to me and the Thai curry is bland. The pastor tacos mentioned earlier is prob my favorite out of the ethnic food group.   

There's also a carving station, with prime rib and the BBQ ribs as the standout.  I'm particularly fond of the fried chicken.  It's nothing crazy but I love using the chimichurri sauce with it.  There's a meatball in marinara and goat cheese that I'm a fan of as well.

The desserts are probably my favorite.  Love the gelato here, especially the mango and lemon pomegranate.  The manga tasted like those Asian mangos and the lemon pomegranateis just tart enough.  There's also a lot of chocolate covered items such as marshmallow and strawberries.  However, I was extremely disappointed that on my 2nd visit to Wicked Spoon, they didn't have the macaroons, cause them macaroon shells were bomb.

Definitely need to try the dinner next time since both times I've been here, it was for the champagne brunch.  The champagne brunch is a good deal since the price different is only $7 from the regular brunch price.  Both times also came on a Sunday and never really had to wait that long, but still suggest to come early!so prettttty... and so yummmy!!

I usually hate buffets, but I looove Vegas buffets!

They have everything in mini-pots, and its so adorable (and clean)!  My bff and I got the brunch/drink special, which is unlimited mimosas/bloody marys/champagne along with our meal.  I think it was only like, 10 dollars extra?  What a deal, right!? 

Usually, it is very difficult for me to eat at a buffet because of their limited vegetarian/vegan food, but the selections here were pretty diverse!  Service was great too -- we got front-of-the-line because one of my friend's was in crutches (and the line was longggg eheheh). 

I didn't have much room for desserts, but I tried the ice cream/gelato and it was amazing! nomnomnomnomWe went for brunch.  I was lured with promises of red velvet pancakes of which there were none.  I quickly got over that.  The food was stunning and delicious.  Everything was done well. My favorite dishes were the Wicked Fried Chicken and the Cauliflower puree. The desserts were premium. 

None of the above applies to the Asian section.  The Asian dishes were completely sub-par and not up to the standard set by the rest of the buffet.

The $22 entry price came with a complimentary glass of champagne, mimosa or bloody mary.  They also place of fancy bottom of (purified) tap water on your table.Beautiful decor, excellent service, almost great food.  There could have been a few more -fresh- selections.  The little shrimp cocktails were delicious.. No funky iodine taste like a few places I've experienced.  The beignets were luscious little balls of happiness.  Not your ordinary buffet for sure.  I had to pass on marrow bone .. Didn't want to have to explain that to my cardiologist.  I'll be back.Absolutely loved it!

A little on the pricier side ($35 per person) than the other buffets on the strip but it was so worth it. I went around 430 and only waited for about 10 minutes or so. When I left the buffet at 7 the line looked like it was going to take hours to get in!

Really liked how the food is already portioned off for you so it's not like you're diving into this giant thing of mush (gross!) And the portions are light so it gives you a chance to try everything that you want.

Like everyone else, I loved the mac n cheese bar. It takes them about 3-5 minutes to get it going. The sushi bar could have had a few more options.

Dessert bar literally had me going in circles. I could not pick anything because there were so many delicious choices that I had to choose wisely since I barely had any room left! 

Waiter was attentive and every time we went up to eat, our plates were cleared and water jug thingy was filled. Perfect experience.I came here for dinner before lounging one night--bad idea because I left with a bloated stomach. But anyhow...good buffet but if you want seafood, don't come here. 

I thought Wicked Spoon was pretty hidden consider it was like endless walking toward the back of the Cosmo. The cashier line take forever to move but after that, everything was fast and nice. 

I love how majority of the food are placed in little pots and bowl ( portion control).I thought is great considering I want to try everything and won't over scoop on one particular item. Oh, they also have bone marrow, and their pastas are delicious!

Their desserts are delightful, my eyes glittered just from staring at the seleciton. 

Their price is also reasonable considering they don't have that many seafood choices--mainly meat, carbs and dessert. Oh yes, great service!Finally after a few trips to Vegas, I got to try out Wicked Spoon!  I already had a pretty good idea what to expect from this buffet since all my friends have been here already and posted positive reviews and delicious food pics.  My first foray with WS was for Friday Brunch.

I liked how everything was served in small portions so you could try things without picking up too much.  The best things I had for brunch were the Kalbi Ribs, The Smoked Salmon, Beet Salad, Eggs Benedict, their Mac N Cheese and a good amount of stuff from the Dessert Station.  I wasn't too fond of the meat selection from their Carving Station though.  The Bacon Slab was pretty bland and the Tri-Tip was tough even though I had a medium rare piece.

I'm not a big buffet person, but Wicked Spoon was a really fun buffet.  I can't say it edges out the Wynn, but they're both pretty close overall.  I wouldn't mind going back again to see what they have for dinner.Wicked Spoon Buffet took my Las Vegas Buffet virginity and I'd like to confirm that it was a very tasty experience. The restaurant itself is very lovely and large and their presentation of food in mini servings is unique.

Conclusion

I hope to return for dinner! Check it out if you're into buffets done a little different.3.5stars

Ambiance: keeps in theme with the Cosmopolitan Casino/Hotel, very modern decor with feminine touches. 

Price: About $40/person (cheaper if you're a rewards member)

Food: For a different and unique Vegas buffet, I'd highly recommend Wicked Spoon. They offer tapas style American comfort food using novel ingredients (i.e. cow liver shepherds pie). I'm torn on their dishes' lack of freshness as you can tell they've been sitting on the counter for a length of time, but you expect this for a buffet. However, they do have some great made to order stations (i.e. mac 'n cheese bar) and the novelty of the offerings (you can get bone marrow and ramen in the same meal?) makes me want to overlook this flaw. Overall, definitely worth a trip if you're looking for something different from the other Vegas buffets! 

Service: Great! no hunting down servers for extra drinks/napkins etc.We have eaten here twice. First time was good. This time was great. I think the food has improved a bit. They have a strong offering of meats, seafood, fruits, desserts, and Chinese food. There seems to be a lot of British-influenced food. For the price, you will have a very satisfying meal. It is pretty laid back in the restaurant. Service at the table is mediocre because the servers are dealing with a lot of people. Caesar's used to be my favorite - because the decor is a bit fresher and lighter than the somewhat scarey Halloween inspired orange and purplish interior of Wicked Spoon - but this food is certainly on par and probably a little superior in variety. Between the two I would be happy at either and would probably just go to the one that was most convenient at the time.I'm disappointed that my second visit witnessed the absence of some of my favorite dishes from my first visit.

What I was impressed by was the mac and cheese bar. If you ask anyone who knows me, I HATE mac & cheese with a passion. I decided to try some fresh mac & cheese so I had the guy (who was extremely pleasant and hospitable) make me a bowl with cheddar, mozzarella, and double parmesan! Added some mushrooms, onions, shrimp, and sausage and I can't believe I actually loved it!This is probably one of the better buffets vegas has to offer. 

We went for brunch and beat the long lines. The choices are much more exotic such as the eggs benedict, gnocci, duck legs, Etc. They have a good salad bar, yogurt and granola, breads and spread, etc.

The dessert section had ice cream, little cakes, panna cotta, a lovely passion fruit cake, croissanta, donuts, chocolate covered strawberries, and more.

While buffets aren't the highest quality of food, wicked spoon does a good job of keeping things fresh and interesting.Beautiful bar. Drinks are little pricey but nice and relaxing environmentLove this bar, love their version of the Cosmopolitan (it's the best), do not love how long it takes to get service if sitting at a couch. Very very cool atmosphere, the place is surrounded by crystals hence being in the middle of a Chandelier. A must see if you go to Vegas.It is Halloween night and we just finished a nice dinner in one of the restaurants upstairs.  We ask our very nice waitress where she would go in the Cosmopolitan to get a drink and people watch.  She tells us Vesper.

We head down to Vesper, find a seat at the Bar and have a great experience.  The bartenders were very nice and poured excellent drinks.  When we encountered a wine that had been opened a little too long, all we needed to do was let the bartender know and he replaced it with a new one immediately.  

Great service, awesome people watching.  Thank you.Prices are very high and the plates are small- but it is so good!
My favorite thing by far is the Pan De Cristal Con Tomate Fresco, which is toasted bread with a very flavorful tomato sauce on top. It's addictive. The best place to sit is at the island bar, where you get to see them make appetizers and most seafood plates.
If you are really hungry and want a lot of food, but don't like high prices, this is not a place for you. But, if you want a small meal full of flavor and don't care about the price, then you should seriously consider coming here once in your life.My wife and I were eager to try this restaurant having just finished a five year stint in Washington DC where we became big fans of Chef Jose Andres.  China Poblano didn't disappoint.

We sat at the Dim Sum/Noodle Bar (there's also a Taco Bar as well as regular dining tables) overlooking chefs meticulously preparing different dim sum dishes.  My wife ordered a margarita, which comes topped with a salt foam in lieu of the traditional salt-rimmed glass, while I ordered a Singapore Sling.  Both were quite tasty.

While we looked over the unique menu we ordered up some lengua tacos (don't knock 'em until you try 'em), which were one of our favorites at Oyamel (a Jose Andres restaurant in DC).  The tacos were as delicious as we remembered them.

Meanwhile, the dim sum chefs in front of us inspired us to try some lamb pot stickers which had a nice flavor highlighted by some cumin and other seasonings.  A gentleman next to us was eating some type of Chinese sandwich which looked and smelt fantastic. We decided to get one for ourselves to see if it tasted as good as it looked.  Sure enough, the Rou Jia Mo sandwich was simply awesome.  My wife and I agreed that it would make a great late night snack...especially if you had a few drinks.

The one downside about most of the dishes at China Poblano is their size.  If you go on an empty stomach, plan on ordering a few dishes.  Of course, that also means you get to try more dishes which is something I can live with.

Now that my wife and I are based on the West Coast we go to Vegas often, and now that Jose Andres has a great place like China Poblano here I'm guessing we'll be frequent visitors.I was excited to try another of Jose Andres restaurants. Of note, compared to many of his other restaurants, this one is a bit more casual. 

The drink menu is excellent with many fresh and creative cocktails that are inspired by a fusion of Chinese and Mexican. They also have a large variety of different mescals. 

This is definitely a small plate restaurant, so order at least 2-3 plates per person and share to experience as much as possible. The shrimp mojo and tacos ( try the cochinita and lengua) were great!  The tuna ceviche was more of a poke and less seafood ceviche, but still good. 

A bit pricey compared to his other restaurants for the lesser experience but otherwise a fun place to have a casual bite.ah Marquee..  the new IT club in vegas.

i came here just last weekend 3/4/11 & Dirty South was spinning

Tips: 1.) get there EARLY !! seriously the line starts forming around 830, we got there exactly at 9, and managed to get in the front of the line, easy entrance for girls, and it was free! $25 for guys since we were so early

2.) dress code - FANCYYY. my friend wore a blazer jacket but didn't have a dress shirt on the inside (such a noob move), just a regular shirt & they wouldn't let him in.  Also no tennis shoes at all...even if its all or 90% black, strictly dress shoes

3.) don't LOOK/ACT/SEEM drunk. they are nazi's about this, one slip and they kick you out.

otherwise, Marquee is a really nice club, has 3 stories, the main story where the dj spins has a spacious dance floor and banging speakers, perfect for those hands in the air moments :)

my favorite part of marquee is the outdoor area, really big, where the pool is and it over looks all the brightly lit vegas buildings around it, gives it a really nice ambiance, and it just so happens the weather was perfect when we went.

#1 likes about this club is, there are so many bars around, you never have to wait long to order a drink (unlike XS where it takes 1 hour just to reach the bar) at Marquee, the bartenders are nice & quick & no hassles around the bar. perfect !

really nice club, maybe not as flashy as XS but definantly a TOP 3 club you must go to in vegas!For the second of our friend's bachelor party we decided to go all out with the table service and everything. We got an outside table and it was amazing. Our table had an amazing view of the strip as well.

It was kind of far away from the dance floor inside and I wish there was one outside as well. The main dance floor gets very packed and bouncers pretty much direct you to the sides in order to get into it. The other floors also get very packed, especially below the main floor in the hip hop room. That place is small and gets really stuffy.

Our waitress Brittany was awesome. Super fun to be around, she got us all excited for night and was very helpful in getting us what we wanted. Even though I think some of us got a little 'touchy' with her when drinking too much. She was very gracious with us.

I'd definitely recommend coming here. Energy is great and people are generally pretty nice.MONDAYS! oh my god. amazing. best time ever. drinks are typically expensive but if you go at 10 and are a chick it's open bar til 11! try to get into VIP also!I really wanted to give 5 stars on food alone but the service was just okay.. I got the rosemary filet with asparagus and it was probably one of the best steaks I have ever had.  We also got the sampler dip platter, that was delicious as well.There is a saying "simple is hard" in the food world. What that means is to try to keep the food as fresh as possible, you know from garden to table. And don't over think or complicate thing.Milos is just that. Fresh and simply prepared with Fresh, super fresh ingredients.
LUNCH. They have a pre fix 3 course lunch menu for $20 bucks. There are choices for you so your not forced to eat what they want you to.
I had Grilled Octopus, Greek salad and grilled sea bass from the Mediterranean on one occasion.
The Octopus is a $10.00 supplement but worth it, and it went perfect with the salad.
The next time I went I had the Lobster spaghetti a $15 supplement but again totally worth it. 
The octopus was melt in your mouth tender and dressed with Greek olive oil and a hint of oregano and capers. The Greek salad was garden fresh tomatoes, feta cheese, red onion, kalamata olive and dressed in good Greek olive oil and oregano.
The lobster pasta has a whole Maine lobster in it believe it or not. With a light marinara, and lobster stock and big hunks and chunks of fresh lobster. The sea bass grilled with very little of anything was wright out of the water fresh, light and delicious. and for dessert a air light walnut cake. 
I sat out side which was fresh air refreshing sunny and warm. A great 2 lunches.As a Greek, I will vouch that the food is outstanding, probably the best, freshest， and healthiest Greek I have had in the states. I recommend the octopus at lunch and the sea bass as well. Combine the yogurt and fruit for dessert. 

Unfortunately, both times they have been out of the lobster, which is what I came for (and this was right at opening). The third time I showed up at my reservation time and was told all systems were down and that dining would be unavailable for an unspecified number of hours. The crowd waiting outside was bummed as well. So I'm three for three on no lobster. Maybe someday.  Would be five stars without a doubt if they can fix their logistics.Great coffee. Press is a part of my daily ritual. Large coffee every morning before walking into work.It just cracks me up that this Pizzeria is still not getting any publicity on The Cosmopolitan's own website.  But that's not such a bad thing really, as it keeps the location mysterious and 'in the know' plus it makes it kind of fun in discovering it.  The spot is literally hidden from view and the only way I found it was when I saw some dude come out from a dark hallway with a big box of pizza.  

I ordered two slices and they were delicious!  You especially have to try their White Pizza with Ricotta and Mozzarella Cheese.  It was my favorite slice.  Take a look at their slices......(http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=F_5_UNX-wrAFCXuAkBZRDw&select=ncKnJNu1chqnamZNqPvfxg) they're huuge NY Style thin slices.  Very good and actually pretty filling.  The slices can range from $4.50-$6 depending the toppings which are a little pricey but considering that the slices are extra large and are very tasty, the price is pretty much justified.

It's nice to see more quality pizza joints open up on the Strip.  With this spot and La Pizza, I'm glad that I can pick up a slice for a cheap lunch or even for a late night snack.  If you have a big group, you definitely can't go wrong with ordering a pie from here.I'm not good at keeping secrets, especially when it comes to food.
But I'm gonna try my best in this review. 

Secret Pizza is a small joint, located down a long, secret hallway lined with music record covers on the third floor of the ___________hotel. Since SP is not listed on the hotels website or in their directory, nor do they have any signs indicating they are even a buisness, they can be hard to locate. 

Since SP is open till the wee hours of the morning, most people usually stumble in here in the early AM to cure their drunken munchies. Not me though. I stumbled in here right when they opened at 11am to cure my I just woke up and I'm hungry as hell munchies. All they serve here is pizza and beer. Simple. Delicious. You can buy your pie whole or by the slice. These are the slices my wife and I bought;

1 white pizza slice http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/iCQpiavjjPzJ5_3gPD5Ebg?select=24ppCiDbltVR9nt4spAUFQ
1 sausage & pepperoni slice http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/iCQpiavjjPzJ5_3gPD5Ebg?select=UGqPkyYuVIsLsjIN-UaEkg
1 sausage & Pepperchini slice http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/iCQpiavjjPzJ5_3gPD5Ebg?select=AwEEKS68Y2WnPRDIJYzHNg

Since we got there right after they opened, each slice was just coming out of the oven. After waiting a few minutes to let the huge slices cool, I remember my girl Michelle T's warning about burning my mouth, my wife and I dug in. All three slices were great. They had lots of cheese and toppings, flavorful sauce and a nice, crispy crust. At $5 a slice, this is a great spot for a quick, tasty meal. 

If you can find SP, you definitely need to check it out. Just look for this hallway http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/iCQpiavjjPzJ5_3gPD5Ebg?select=JHsPAfv3yu3RrFNFO9qzFgAfter wandering around the 4th floor of the Cosmo for about an hour and goofing around in the completely empty ballroom area (you know, making casino angels and whatnot), we realized we were on the wrong floor and that secret pizza is really not AS secretly located as I thought it would be.... ANYWAY, we came here twice while in Vegas and it did not disappoint. It was actually much better than some of the expensive places we had. Slices are about 5$ and are quite large. We had a slice of cheese, pepperoni, and white w/ ricotta. The pepperoni was great, they were spicy and flavorful. The cheese was not so great. The white was really good, very garlicky. This place is a great find on the strip! I'd go back for sure.Not that secret, which is good because my hungover body desperately needed pizza and liquids--

Like, for how things go in Vegas, good value. Should have more places like it and fewer like FIRST at the VenetianGood thing I did my homework and knew about this hidden gem. And when I say hidden, it's actually hidden. No signs. Not even noted on the floor guide. I guess they weren't kidding when they named it Secret Pizza.

When I found Secret Pizza on yelp, I bookmarked this restaurant. Suggested my girlfriends to go here during our vegas trip. We decide to go on Saturday night before marquee so we went around 8:30 pm. Got to first floor of Cosmopolitan and looked at the floor guide by the escalator. Looked for "Secret Pizza" but nothing. Scanned the board again and didn't see a word of pizza. I got slightly scared that maybe I had the wrong hotel in mind and asked the hotel employee and he joked that it's a secret pizza so it's a secret and he can't share the location. O_O I was one step before panicking and he told me it's on the third floor. phew.

Secret pizza is tucked away behind walls. Can only get to it if you walk into a narrow hallway next to some restaurant. No signs or anything what-so-ever so keep an eye out for a narrow hallway that makes you question where it is leading to! Barely any line at 8:30 pm. Too bad I was already too full from all the beer I drank but still took few bite of the pizza. Like everyone says, it's thin crust pizza with mountains of cheesy goodness. Sure, the pizza might turn out a bit greasy cuz of all the cheese but don't be shy. Just blot it with some napkin and brace yourself for some nice NY-style pizza. :D

PS. Their white pizza is the best. Treat yourself and indulge in the greasy goodness!The pizza is better than any other choice you'll have after leaving marquee and may possibly save your life by soaking up all the liquor you've had. No sign but just follow the smell and the line of people coming out of the hallway from the marquee club exit.Secret is out. No signs pointing you down the hallway. Waitress suggested it. Would never have found it on my own. 

Great NY pizza. $5 a slice. Perfect dyer a few drinks. Quick. Easy. Gotta try it. 

No where to sit so you will eat standing up. But worth it.Pretty solid pizza joint, ny style, big slices, a bit pricey as my slice of pepperoni was $5. Located on third floor beside sushi rest. Worth a trip tho.Ahh Secret Pizza, how I adore my alcohol induced memories of you...

At $5.50 for a decent at best, cheese pizza slice and 50 cents extra per additional topping, my cheap self would not purchase this if it were located anywhere else. But alas it's Vegas and when you're craving pizza at 3 in the morning you kind of just dgaf. That being said I come here over and over again. 4 STARS!!Love this place!!! The ONLY reason they don't get 5 stars is becuse they do not take health insurance so I had to pay them out of pocket and be reimbursed. The service was 5 stars, the Dr. was very pleasant 5 stars! The selection of glasses to choose from was 5 stars and the fact that they took their time to really help me find the pair that was perfect for me was awesome.Great special occasion place. The wood oven focaccia was so good we ordered 2 extra. Our entres were of decent portions and incredibly delicious. Service was just as incredible as the food itself. A little bit pricy, but as I said. A great special occasion place.We really love the ambiance at Tanzy, the decor, the tables, the warmth etc.  I tried the pasta bolognese this past weekend, and thought it was especially delicious.  The service was outstanding and we really enjoyed our visit.  The only thing I was bummed about was the cocktails.  I ordered one of the lemon-lime blood orange martinis, and had a difficult time choking it down.  For $11, I think they should use something better than infused Svedka vodka to make the cocktail a little smoother.  At that price point, it should at least be Stoli or Absolut.  Other than that, we thought the food was good and the portions were hefty.The Henry is The Cosmopolitan's 24-hour restaurant, and while they do have a "limited" late night menu, we found it just about perfect. It's a small restaurant, facing right into the entrance of the casino floor, and without much separating you from the noise and passersby - so it's fantastic for people-watching. The service is great, the bar menu is fun, and they have a nice mix of breakfast food, burgers, and appetizers overnight. We went a few hours post-race, after finding a giant line at Café Vettro and lots of people angry about the limited late-night food options on a Sunday. Yes, it was 2am... but it's Vegas!

His plate: Buffalo Style Chicken Wings, fries

Her plate: "The Henry" breakfast - three eggs (scrambled), chicken apple sausage, sourdough toast, and breakfast potato; Mambo Italiano - garlic roasted vodka, house made Bloody Mary mix, basil

The drink section of the menu is called "Peace Offerings" and is full of fun options, though I'm glad I got the Mambo Italiano - it was great! It's also worth noting that the other breakfast meat choices were slab bacon, smoked ham, country sausage, or taylor ham - quite a nice selection.

This was a perfect post-race meal - the eggs were nicely cooked, the chicken apple sausage was delicious, and what more can I ask for than fresh sourdough toast? D's wings were good, and the fries were nice and fresh. When we come back to Vegas, this'll be our late-night favorite, I'm sure - much better food and more fun than Café Vettro, and the prices are the same.Definitely a unique place in this world. Something you have to see in your lifetime!

Be prepared for the ultimate culture shock. You can seriously see ALL different types of the human race here. Between awkward business professionals in suits, "drunk of their mind" chicks wearing almost nothing, total white trash, rednecks, bachelors, and more, you are in for the ultimate experience! 

The resorts/casinos here are a hit or miss. Some of them are total dives! I simply can't understand how they are still profitable. They must serve the clowns that enjoy stench bucket lobbies filled with smoke, cheezy dancers, and constant gamboling.

I swear some of the casino floors look like a Chuck E. Cheese for adults with all the bright, flashing lights!

One of my biggest pet peeves here is those stupid clowns that hand out those "hot girls want to meet you" cards!! Seriously! They swarm you on every corner. They will even have four of them in a line trying to get you to take them. Come on Las Vegas, clean up your act! Most of the cards with pictures of women with no clothes on end up as litter on the ground anyways. Outlaw that stupid BS! If people are looking for those kind of services, they can easily find a way to use them! Those stupid cards aren't going to change their minds! 

I did notice there were none of these stupid clowns outside the Wynn and Encore properties. Maybe it's the demographic there? Or maybe they actually have a policy against it. Either way, I would stay there for that reason alone!!

As other Yelpers mentioned, even though neighboring properties look close, they are actually a long walk! Pedestrians are often slowed down by the constant overcrowded  sidewalks and are redirected over these bridges with TONS of stairs! They are not right at the intersections either, mostly trying to force you into shops or casinos. Keep in mind, there is always a way to get back down, you just have to find the stairs. 

Bring comfortable shoes if you plan to walk the strip. Also, many of the so-called trams and the famous monorail are sometimes not practical. The stations are located in the VERY BACK parts of all the casinos. By the time you walk all the way through one casino (especially if you are staying on the West side of the strip, you have to cross the street and enter another resort to pick up the monorail), get on the monorail (they charge for tickets too) and walk all the way down from the casino you disembark at, you miswell should have just walked to your destination the whole way.

Some of the cab drivers are absolutely nuts!! I seriously thought this one dude was going to roll the Ford Escape we were driving in on some of the turns. Our ride from the airport wasn't that bad though. Splurge for a town car one night to make your experience more enjoyable (we took one from the Cosmo to Wynn for a fancy dinner at SW Steakhouse). 

Enjoy your time on the strip!Some days it's better than others... If people weren't so rude, obeyed the traffic laws and actually paid attention to the stop lights there'd be a lot less headaches & swearing.Holy yum!  To sum up my favorites, the DOCG Pizza is simply incredible, the duck pasta is to die for, and the wine selection is spot-on.  The restaurant has a low-key, but energetic environment in a cosmopolitan atmosphere (yes, pun intended.) Whether you're on a romantic date or out with a group of friends, it's the perfect spot to appease everyone. 

Insider Tip:  I've heard they share a kitchen with Scarpetta next door, so you're going to get the same great ingredients, but with a more fun and versatile menu.I love D.O.C.G.  They have a great atmosphere and vibe. The restaurant is a tad on the smaller side, but you can either grab a table or sit at the bar. 

Italian is at the top of my list for Fav foods, so D.O.C.G has quickly became a favorite dinning spot for me when I am in vegas. Everything is always presently nicely and tastes very fresh and authentic.

I love the pizzas. the spooressata picante and the mushroom are awesome. For pastas the gundi or the pappardelle are two great choices. The also have an awesome appetizer the I enjoy but cannot quite remember the exact name. It is meatballs served with a red sauce. 

They also offer a nice variety of dessert and coffees to finish off your meal.

I definitely recommend this spot.I admit that I review a lot of Starbuck's. I see Yelp as my Diary. And since Starbuck's is a part of my life, I enjoy sharing my experiences at their locations through Yelp reviews.

  Not every Starbuck's is identical. I strongly feel that one of the reasons that Starbuck's is so popular is because each location has its own characteristics. This Starbuck's is the serene location off the Strip corridor. It is located in the boom docks of the MGM Grand all the way in the lobby of The Signature Towers. To give you an idea of how big the MGM Grand is, it is located in the vicinity of Harmon and Audrie Streets. 

  One of the reasons that it is so serene is that it is a relatively unknown Starbucks to people not staying at the Signature Towers. For newcomers finding this Starbucks is a similar activity to finding Secret Pizza. From the Strip entrance of the MGM Grand, the walk to this Starbucks is genuinely a hike. It requires walking across the labyrinth of the casino and Studio Walk. Where Studio Walk dead ends near the pool, there are two doors on the left. I believe they say Signature Towers in small letters. Beyond the two doors, there is an elongated hall that overlooks the Grand Garden Arena, and crosses over Audrie Street toward Harmon. This is the area where Starbuck's is.

   I have gone to this Starbuck's whenever I was on the South Strip, and needed to get a break from the crowds. Even on the Strip, I like to spend some quiet time to myself doing things like reading or writing. In this mood, this is a fitting Starbuck's. Unlike the majority of Starbuck's on the Strip that are adjacent to a crowded corridor or casino, this location is absorbed into a court yard. There is sufficient shade and tables. The main sound is the birds chirping away. On the times that I spent here, birds outnumber party people. 

   On account of the fact that MGM Resorts operates this Starbuck's, the prices are more inflated than the off-Strip locations. I believe that a venti Frap exceeds $6. Bottle water exceeds $4.

   I am a fan of this location. It has relatively nothing to do with a caffeinated beverage. It has a lot to do with being a serene place where I can escape the crowds and  fast pace of life for a few minutes with a Starbuck's beverage when I am on the Las Vegas Strip.

***This is review 62 of the 2013 Yelp 100 Challenge***Good food but pretty expensive, particularly for lunch!Great place to come after about 9pm otherwise a little slow but if you get there after 10pm you might have to wait in line. Lots of beautiful woman who are actually nice and approachable. They have lots of different champagne. The bartenders need to be a little faster or more experienced but over all a great place to come and get a drink, dance and have a good time.Went here for bubbles & brunch last Sunday. What a great deal! Truly is bottomless bubbles. We got orange juice and sipped mimosas for hours. A wee bit tipsy by the end, but what a good time. Had the banana nut bread as a starter, SUPERB. Delicious fig spread and the bread was moist with a slightly crunchy outer edge. Had the spinach and goat cheese omelet - was a smidge bland, but still tasty nonetheless. Service was excellent and it was refreshing to see the decor in daylight. I felt very relaxed and a little girly. :)This place has absolutely the best re-fried beans in the valley. Its quite small inside but all the food I've had there is great and so is the service. The chips and salsa are good but not great that's the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars.I found TMTT through fellow Yelper's and was satisfied. Rather then having my wife's new car done at our residence, I opted to have done at there shop in Tempe. Shannon was great and although forgetting to mention they would not warranty the tint over existing tint  (New car and wasn't sure). She took the vehicle in and removed tint/Added desired darkness.The BF and I came to try the newest addition to our hood. 

The flavors of the yogurt were good. I particularly enjoyed the key lime, green tea, pistachio. Only flavor I wasn't into was the french vanilla, but I think it just didn't go with the toppings/other flavors somehow. I appreciate they keep the toppings bar clean and stocked. 

My one complaint is the way the layout is. The line is formed against the wall of yogurt and when it's a long line, my flavors have to be picked out and put into my cup and I have to wait for people to do up their toppings. I kinda wanted to try a little taste to decide on a flavor but there was no little taster cups for those (it says you have to ask- and who wants to go to the register and disrupt the line for that?). My yogurt was still okay by paying, but it already started to melt because it was out. It also made me feel like rushing my toppings....I didn't want to be that asshole holding up everyone. I like the layout of Menchie's way more where you feel free to go to the machines and toppings bars yourself and the line was at the cash registers only. It ensures getting people out faster and that people who like to take their time or try samples of the yogurts can.

This is the closest yogurt place by my house and is pretty good. However, I think the layout is gonna be a problem on a busy summer day and I will end up at Menchies.I love NY institutions, but didn't know anything about P.J. Clarke's until I saw an ad on Las Vegas Magazine.  Established in 1884, this Vegas version at The Forum Shops at Caesars caught my eye for the "Oyster Riot" Happy Hour they have from 3-6 Sunday-Thursday.  You get fresh shucked oysters for $1 each!  I had 6 and they were very good.  Not only that, you buy a drink and get one free, including wine by the glass.  The Tater Tots were also tasty. 
The ambiance does have a NY vibe, but I wish the music stuck to the classics and standards.  I only heard one Sinatra song when I was there.  Next time, I wish to order a Cadillac Burger, since it was recommended by Nat King Cole.  I hope I will be enjoying it while listening to a Nat King Cole tune, and not a country song.We wandered into TK's while checking out the Scottsdale Quarter last weekend. They have a pretty simple, straightforward menu with good standards and a few twists. Overall, nice atmosphere and good service. There were a few little hiccups, but our waitress was very attentive. 

I had two margaritas... the first was very good, nice and lime-y which is why I ordered a second one. The bartender must have been very heavy handed on the agave syrup or triple sec because the next one was way too sweet. The waitress brought me a generous handful of limes to fix it up. 

We ordered the shrimp appetizer, which was shrimp drowned in a yummy sauce with leeks and bacon. We split the pulled pork sandwich, good bread and nicely flavored pork. I really liked the apple slaw on top. We also had onion rings and fries on the side. The fries had the skins on (which I love) and the onion rings had nice big onions and weren't too heavily fried. They serve homemade ketchup which my boyfriend liked a lot and described as a ketchup-salsa. I am somewhat of a ketchup fanatic and found this ketchup to have a slightly bitter after-taste. 

TK's has a great location and seems like it will have staying power.Good food and great atmosphere! Ok so we went to Citizen for my husbands birthday and there were 6 of us. We were seated quickly as we did have reservation and our server was pretty awesome. Some of our friends actually knew the guy which was cool and we received an industry discount which was really nice and not expected at all. I didn't drink that night since I was the driver, but I heard the drinks were great just a bit on the small side.

 As for the food I tasted a bit of everything. For apps we had the pork belly pastrami (a bit too fatty), chopped salad (awesome), fernet steak salad (not a fan too sweet for my taste). For entree's I had the scallops which were good not the greatest and I shared the duck with my friend which I liked better than the scallops which were quite rich. My husband had the crispy stealhead which I really liked, but he was not that keen on it. Our other friends had the chicken and waffles, mac n cheese, and lamb burger and they said they were all fantastic minus the fries which I tried and were a very strange texture almost like they were rolled in cornmeal not 1 of us liked those at all. 

All in all it was a nice place with great service and good food, but a little over priced for the taste and quality of the food.  For this many stars on yelp I was expecting City Hall experience and my tastebuds to be dancing with excitement. I would recommend for gathering with friends and would go back!This is a great place for sophisticated, but reasonably priced food!  We've been here a couple times and everything that we've ordered was delicious.  You can't go wrong with the scallops and the duck.  We will definitely go back!These place is a hidden gem off Durango and  Desert Inn.  My eyebrows have become unbearable to look at so I got on yelp. They suggested this place and I am glad I did. The wait was not that long and their were three people ahead of me. Every one in the salon was nice and friendly.  They offer complimentary water, soda, juice and coffee as soon as you walk in. They are inexpensive and also sale glasses,  purses and perfume. I am definitely making this place my new eyebrow threader. Lisa did a fantastic job.This place Is pretty good. I like the fact that you don't need to worry about it being overcrowded which is very nice. It also has a swimming pool which is great especially if you don't want to heat your pool up in the winter time with the extra cost. Staff seem nice and the membership fees are rather reasonableI just love any excuse to do some shopping and since we were here for the Yelp event..shopping is a must!
This is by far one of the best malls in all of Vegas ans it sure is the prettiest. It is home to one of my favorite places to eat:Cheesecake Factory. And I just love Donald Pliner as well as Kiehl"s.
And just FYI: if you do valet it closes at 11..High end mall to shop around. Always fun to walk around nonetheless and browse.I wish I had a living room like Loudons': open, airy, filled with natural sunlight, and someone to serve me lattes and refreshing peppermint tea in artsy teapots. If that was the case, I might never leave home again.

Boasting free wi-fi, numerous power outlets, and a café menu to satisfy most any gustatory need, you could readily spend an entire day both wired and wireless here. In fact, I wouldn't have been sad if we had.

Definitely don't miss out on the Rock Lobster Chocolate truffles while you're here. You know how they say that 'good things come in small packages'; Loudons has the proof in the form of these little nibbles of ecstasy. It's just icing on the cake!Pleasantly surprised.

Nice but casual atmosphere. I like how there were TVs to watch the games but it didn't have that dirty sports bar vibe. 

Fast, nice, and efficient service.

Reasonably priced beers. And really good selection of bottled beers. Wish they had a bigger selection of drafts.

We had the fried mozzarella which by husband loved and I thought was okay. I loved the texture of the breading around the cheese but I wish the breading was a bit more seasoned. 

My husband had some wings which he thought were really good. And he was happy they made them "extra crispy" for him. I liked that you can order them by the half dozen for just $5. Most places you have to order them in larger quantities which sucks cause I'm a vegetarian.

We ordered a large pizza with Kalamata olives, artichokes, and tomatoes. We liked the pizza for the most part. The cheese tasted delicious on it. I liked the texture of the crust, just wished there was a little more flavor in the sauce. Luckily if you order tasty toppings it makes up for it.

The value of the pizza was amazing. $12 for a large, $2 a topping. 

They only had 2 specialty pizzas on the menu, both chicken, which I found puzzling. I was hoping for a few veggie varieties.

Overall, I'm psyched we found this place. We ordered a ton of food and 2 beers for $43. I am looking forward to trying their happy hour.I love this place. Huge fan. I have stayed at Ravella twice (August and New Years), and both times it gave me a very weird, but peaceful feeling. Somebody mentioned the "Twilight Zone" in another review, and I think that is a good description. The hotel and its grounds are absolutely beautiful. It is a great place to just go and relax. Unfortunately, the effects of the economy are obvious. Ravella seems very underbooked, understaffed and The Village is full of abandoned storefronts. It is kind of depressing, but it is also very quiet, tranquil and beautiful so that makes up for it I guess. On New Years Eve though, The Village got a decent crowd. It was kind of eery. Like, where did all of these people come from? They can't be staying at the hotel! It's empty!

[Most of my "not so goods" are about The Village, not the Ravella itself]

The Awesome:
- Beautiful hotel, beautiful grounds.
- FREE WIFI! And it is FAST!
- Decent price.
- Very friendly and helpful staff.
- Ample parking.
- Beautiful views. First time we had a balcony over the courtyard, and this last time we had a patio with grass.
- Very peaceful. Feels high class to this t-shirt and shorts guy.

The Mediocre to Not so Good:
- Very difficult to get a meal or even a cup of coffee past 10pm. Only option is Harry's in the Montelago Casino. The few places in The Village that are still in business are not open after 9 or 10.
- Like many others noted, the AC does not cool the room, not even in the Winter.
- Paper thin walls.
- People were smoking in the room next door to us, a non-smoking room.
- The Village is pretty much deserted.
- Nothing to do in the evening.
- Far from the strip: shuttle runs too infrequently and ends too early.
- Bizarre layout; more like a mansion than a hotel.
- The Village has a sewage smell at times. It reminded me of the lagoon at UCSB.

The Terrible:
The New Years Eve package. The dinner and breakfast were both awful and not worth the money by a long shot. Beer and wine were free... but soft drinks cost $3.00 for HALF A CAN of Coke! I was not allowed to keep the remaining half of the can. So, it is $6 for a can of Coke. That being said, the Coke was definitely more expensive than the wine we were served. Even worse, they brought a child a FREE glass of Sprite. WTF? We left most of our dinner for the waiter to take back. Afterwards, the head waitress or whatever came by and asked us "We like to get feedback. What was your favorite part of the meal tonight?" My mom and I just looked at each other as we struggled to come up with an answer. I said "salad" and my mom said "the grilled vegetables." The poor dinner/breakfast really put a damper on NYE at Ravella.

This is a great vacation destination, but come with few expectations. You will need to make your own fun, or just relax. You can still go to the Strip and have some fun, but plan on spending the whole day there, and then come back and enjoy the peaceful surroundings. Despite the annoyances I mentioned, and the terrible NYE package, we will definitely return. 

BTW, this would be a great place for a romantic weekend, as long as your significant other isn't utterly annoying, because there is nowhere to run...Really? A Victorian(ish) Bakehouse in Leith? Oh yes & me very much likey! 
After their recent expansion, Mimi's Bakehouse has flourished and now more people can enjoy the wonderful treats and food choices on offer. Do take NOTE: There are still waiting lists for the more popular times (!). Even though the boudoir ambiance is catered towards women I did like the especially designed, cheeky pin-up wall paper and the French madame inspired seating snuggle corners. 

Pink armchairs.. yup.

We went for a breakfast on a rainy winter Saturday morning. French toast and a full Scottish breakfast included of black pudding and of course haggis.
And to top it we had a prosecco once our fare was devoured. 

The place is welcoming, clean and unusual. The staff is lovely and well efficient. This being on my doorstep I certainly will not miss out on their many treats!

Did I mention the burlesque ladies on the wall and washroom mirrors :o)First of all, let me say I cant believe this place got so many bad reviews on here other then the first review. Second of all let me say that the only thing i've had here are the burritos and tacos so maybe that is why. 

I have been here about 5 times now so I can comfortable say that the flavor is consistent and the quality is the same every time. My first trip was their opening weekend and my latest trip was last Tuesday. On Tuesdays they have 99 cent tacos and 1.99$ burritos. 

I would say that it is a tie between the Arizona burrito and the Green Chili burrito for top burrito i've ever had....they are amazing...add sour cream to the green chili burrito to really bring it to life. 

I've also had the beef taco, carne asada taco, and pork taco....all were good, but not as good as the burritos. 


I recommend you try this place on a Tuesday and get the Green Chili burrito and judge this place for yourself....if its bad, you are out 1.99$...if it is good you just found a great burrito place like I have. 

Again...im shocked this place has received so many 1-2 stars so far....The people here are really sweet and helpful. They have a good, supportive, atmosphere. Come in if you want to get your WOD onWhen I arrived at their food truck at the Foodie Festival Sunday afternoon, they were already out of buns. Bummer! 

So I ordered their Sticky Nanas, banana potstickers topped with white chocolate and caramel. A little bit of deliciousness!

Not sure if they have just a food truck, but I think I'll definitely track them to try their buns. I heard they're awesome :)I'm giving the Arrogant butcher 4 coveted stars for 2 reasons: first, its hard to find a decent happy hour downtown with $4 glasses of wine, let alone great wine, and these guys have PurVine as the house special.

Second, as if we were in Paris, they have this delicious mussels appetizer with chunks of sausage and french fries piled on top. Thank whomever the brilliant Frenchman was that thought of this, a true chef d'œuvre awaits

The only entree i've had here was less than thrilling, the short-rib stew. It came out piping, skin-off the top of your mouth, hot... When ordering short-rib anything I kind of expect...well...short ribs! Not only was this concoction far from tasty (quite bland, really) there was hardly any short rib to speak of, mostly beans, etc. For some unexplainable reason I've ordered this twice with equal disappointment.

They have some interesting looking daily specials like king crab cioppino on friday that I plan on checking out. I'll let you know.

BOTTOM LINE: See ya there for happy hourAs much as I love my Mom, I had to seriously fight the urge to steal her food.
Was it because I didn't completely love her sweet potato tortelli with mushrooms? 
No. The sweet potato filling, the brussels sprouts and mushroom were wonderful compliments to each other. The sauce was savory and butter-y but not over the top, it didn't cover the taste of the veggies.

No what saved my mom's food and kept family peace was the shrimp, sausage and chicken jambalaya. I was skeptical ordering jambalaya outside of NOLA but this was excellent. This seasoning was spot on and the meat wasn't dried and overcooked, which I find frequently in bad jambalaya. Proof the chef knew what he was doing ? The okra maintained their firmness and didn't become soft and slimy like okra frequently does.

Not usually a dessert person I really liked the blueberry cheesecake streusel. The graham crackers did nothing but make a mess but I loved the creaminess of the cheesecake. For another take my brother found the consistency  too soft, he didn't think it would stand up if done as a traditional cheesecake (see pics).
My sister-in law seemed fond of the bathroom , venture with confidence.

My mother returned a few days after I left and had the jambalaya, so I guess she's a fan too.

Near the baseball, and basketball arena this should be a definitely spot to check out if you're ever in Phoenix.The NY strip steak was prepared perfectly and was excellent. Everyone enjoyed all the food at our table, including all the desserts. The big standout for me - the service was terrific.A new fan of this place.  Just wondering around downtown, and did not want the standard run of the mill food.  This was a great alternative.  Had the Chicken Club and San-Tan Brew.  Great staff and great all around experience.  It will be a standard for my trips to Phoenix in the future.Super delicious crust on the pizza if you eat it within 5 minutes of arriving at the table. Ingredients are fresh and very tasty. The wait was non existent as we walked in early on a weekday. Pizza came out fast as well.Seating: When I arrived in Vegas and got in the taxi, I grabbed a booklet from the backseat that had a lot of coupons in it, and in there I found a coupon for $20 off tickets to this show so that was a good start. I'm a bit spoiled when it comes to shows and prefer to sit as close up as possible regardless of price, so I bought the VIP tickets which came out to $50 a person with the coupon. We sat in table 3, seats 1 and 2 which is right in front of the stage. This is one of those shows where I HIGHLY recommend sitting a little further back. The preferred section would have been better, slightly cheaper, and you are still just feet away from the stage! The reason I think a little further back is better is that being up close, you could see all the weird faces they were making to achieve those falsetto voices, especially Robin. I could see every wrinkle on their faces, every bead of sweat, every funky movement of their mouths to get a certain note...it was....just weird LOL. It took away from the illusion of it all. The venue is tiny, so if you want to go with the cheapest tickets and sit in reserved seating, I promise you that it's a perfect view as well.

Music: I don't know if they didn't warm up or what, but when they came out singing, their first 2 songs were a bit pitchy. I was just hoping that the whole show wouldn't be like that, and it wasn't. After those first 2 songs, things were in tune again and they did a great job of hitting the notes and really sounding like the Bee Gees! The guy that plays Maurice has a great voice but doesn't get to sing solo a lot which is a shame. The man that plays Barry seemed to be the strongest of the group, musically. Video of the Bee Gees often played in the background which was fun to see. They set aside a dance floor where they encouraged people to dance. Our crowd was very tame and no one wanted to get up and dance, so that was a little awkward but the show went on. They played most of the Bee Gees greatest hits that everyone knew. At times, I swear I was seeing and hearing the real thing.

Overall, it was a fun show. I'm in my 20s but grew up with the Bee Gee's music because my mom was a big fan and was a young girl when they were making music. We both enjoyed it and it gave a glimpse into what it might've been like to see them live.Was pleasantly surprised , a well organized show that brought back memories.Located on Valle Verde and 215 in Henderson. Its located in the same shopping center as Kohls. Parking is not great when in the afternoon but much better if you go at night.


This cigar shop is also a place to sit back in some comfy big ole leather chairs, watch some gig screen tv, kick back andenjoy that cigar that most girls HATE! Unless they really love ya or will indulge you and smoke one with you.

They sell wide variety of cigar brands and the staff is very friendly and helpful in assisting you to choose the right smoke for you. Their walk in humidor is big and well stocked. 

Prices are standard local cigar store price. Not high strip hotel prices.

They have beers, wines and soft drinks available too. If you're hungry they dont mind if you bring food in. Plus they even have a few poker tables you can use. Just call to reserve them.

Ask for Brian and they make alot of accomodations. Great little small business going the extra mile for your enjoyment. 

If you're looking for high end factory type cigar lounge this isnt it, but if you wanna get away and hang out with regular people. This is 5 stars of that.

That's the way I like it!!  ENJOYA friend referred me to this place. Really liked the food, service could improve a bit... Waiting for just a water or a soda should not take more than five minutes when it is slow, and please write down my order, don't pretend you'll remember it all...*sigh* Anyhow, grumpiness aside- When they tell you the food will be HOT, don't expect it to be mild. This has real thai spiciness all around. Great use of curry and sweet chili sauces. The use of sweet & spicy is my favorite combination. Mango with a spicy sauce. Interesting twist. Spring rolls were hot and fresh. Wonton was good. I really like this place, just want better service next time.I was given a free meal at this location and went ahead and redeemed it.  The food was good and the service excellent.  An improvement over the last time I was here.  My only recommendation is for them to not cook the fish until it is hard and crispy.  Just lightly fry it.  Good job.THis place is delicious ! I prefer this type of froyo over mojo and yogurtini, I enjoy the flavors they offer at this location over others. Every time I come to Zoyo, I get the cake batter, and I believe that nothing tops this at any other location; but that is just my personal opinion.The perfect sesame crusted tuna on my salad and a French Manhattan (a Manhattan with some Chambord mixed in) that will keep me coming back for more! Fair prices as it is but if you want to save some dough, keep an eye out for 20% off coupons in North Central News and specials on the 13th of each month!The pork buns alone were worth the trip, helped down by a couple of saketini (the lychee one was my favorite). The Ramen was good, not the best I've had, but overall a good experience!

A great little neighborhood gem and we're looking forward to a nice warm day so we can eat out on the front deck.Ambiance and server were great! Food took a little longer than we had hoped for but it was a packed Saturday night. Spicy pulled pork buns and pork dumplings with spicy sauce were very tasty! Miso Ramen was good although I'm no connoisseur  but I would definitely go back.For some reason as a family we only go to this place for breakfast, about once every 2-3 months. It's consistently great albeit a little on the pricy side.  That's our fault though because our kids like smoothies with their breakfast which really adds to the cost.  

Once in a while if I am out and about and want a healthy alternative to fast food, I'll go through their drive through and get a protein shake.  It's quick and convenient and a better choice than typical fast food.

Went recently for happy hour to meet friends and their happy hour menu (both food and drinks) were really great!  Will have to do that again soon.Went there last night with my guy pal.  Having never eaten Cambodian food,  I felt some degree of trepidation but thought, "What the hey.  Why not?!"  We ordered two dishes to share.  Unfortunately, since the menu items on their website aren't posted, I have no idea what the food dish names are, but the one dish was beef and the other was chicken.  The beef dish was served on a bed of veggies.  Both were quite good and were seasoned to perfection.   We tried the tapioca dessert.  I was stuffed so barely did a taste test.  It was okay; I'm not a big fan of tapioca, but he liked it.  It is a family run operation.  Mom and Auntie cook and son and cousin serve in the dining hall.  We talked to son, Yut.  He told us the history of starting the restaurant. My suggestion for them is get better signage.   Unless one has one's eyes peeled, it is hard to see.   I'd definitely go there again.This is a hidden gem in central phoenix. The beef noodle soup, which is my go-to meal, is a milder and garlicky version of pho. When the soup is combined with their light as fluffy bread sticks, it makes a great and pretty complete meal. I also recommend their spring rolls and beef skewers. My friends all love their boba drinks and basil seed drink. The only item I would avoid is their iced tea - it tastes like a floral perfume. 

This place is a great place to eat, but the 4 star instead of 5 is due to SSSSSSLLLLLOOOOOWWWW service. DOn't come here for lunch on a workday, because you'll be here forever. Oh, and the bathroom never seems to have paper towels.Four stars for the burgers and the multitude of topping options!  One of the best bacon cheese burgers I've had...added green peppers, mushrooms, lettuce, tomato and barbecue sauce.  mmmmmm.  Now lets talk about the fries--I recommend not ordering them.  Save room for the burger.  The flavor is only okay, and they are real greasy and soggy.  Oh, yeah for those of you who enjoy eating shelled peanuts, you can snack on those while you're waiting for your order number to be called.  Service is pretty quick though.  

I'm getting hungry just thinking about the bacon cheese burger! :)I've only ordered delivery from Ichiban, but since we discovered them, we've ordered probably once a week.  I'm definitely not able to speak to authenticity, but without reservation I will say the food is great. 

I've been trying different things each time, and haven't had anything that I wouldn't order again!  The only constant in my order is potstickers, I think they're fantastic.  
Delivery time for 3.5 miles away is stellar.  The last time I ordered (7pm on a Tuesday), I had my food in less than 20 minutes, which seemed ridiculously and awesomely fast.  I also appreciate the option to order online!Well we had a living social coupon for this new locale in our neighborhood....and we were not disappointed. The coupon was for 20 bucks worth of yogurt and we only paid 10 bucks for it. We received two 10 dollar gift certificates and a couple of weeks back we finally decided to use one of them. It is self serve like several other froyo establishments throughout the valley....they have some nice outdoor seating....and they also have 3 flat screen TV's on the inside. The yogurt itself is very good....i had the regular tart mixed with the mango and I have to tell you is was outstanding. This by the way was my second visit here...just wanted to clear that up because earlier I mentioned we were just using one of our certificates...but actually this was our second.

The first trip we made I tried the root beer float with strawberries and fudge sauce....and while it was good....it wasn't great. However like I said earlier the tart with the mango is a must try for everyone. They change the flavors weekly....but I don't want anything else but the tart and mango. So if your ever in my hood and want to try the this locale let me know what you think of the Regular Tart and Mango if they have it that week of course...LOL. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!I went here last night and it was a pretty fun time. I went with a bunch of friends at around 9 oclock and it was busy all the way until we left at around 1 am. This place is huge! It is in a good location (close to my house) and has plenty of parking. It is a really big bar with a dance floor and a bunch of pool tables. My party of 7 easily got a table, despite it being busy, due to this place being really big. They had a mardi gras party last night that was pretty fun. All the servers were dressed up and they had a free king cake and gave away prizes for people that found the babies in the cake. They had great drink specials, 3$ long islands, hurricanes, and you call its. The first hurricane I got was really good... just enough alcohol to where it still tastes good. The second was terrible.... tasted like cheap rum.... way too much alcohol (and maybe i'm the only person in the world that would complain about that but... yuck). Some people got some food and said it was not so good. They got chicken skewers, queso dip, and an appetizer sampler. I would say that this place is not really a place to eat.... The music was pretty good, a mix of country with line dancing and whatnot and hip hop with regular club like dancing. I thought the place was fun and I would definitely go back.... just not for food.Came here with my friend after eating at Grand Lux Cafe. It was late night and we wanted some desserts and alcohol. 

We got the Banana Split Waffles and each got a glass of wine. I'm not going to complain about the price because I live in Vegas and know that when you're on the strip... you should expect higher price. Overall I would say that I liked the Banana Split Waffles. There was a lot of chocolate with waffles though. If I ever decide to go back, I will ask for no chocolate syrup with waffles. Bananas were caramelized and there strawberries were sweet. The dessert went perfect with our wine. 

I was probably there for about 45 mins to 1 hour. I saw my waiter about twice I would say. The service was ok overall. They don't really give you much attention unless you call for them. 

The environment was really nice. We sat near the outside area. You can see the Bellagio show across the street. Since we went around midnight in January, the weather was perfect. I would say I had an overall great experience or at least that's how I remember it (the alcohol helped! :D). 

There is a parking garage here like most casinos.The only thing I 'knew' about boba is the tapioca pearls can be a choke hazard.  I wasn't 100% convinced that any fruit concoction with black stuff 'floating' on the bottom could taste good.  My friend convinced me a small drink in my favorite flavor would be good place to start.  Yum pineapple that taste like pineapple! Mmm... the tapioca pearls remind me of gummi bears.  I get it, boba is meant to be savored not slurped up as if you haven't had anything to drink in a year.  Since that first taste, I've gone back to try taro, watermelon, and lychee.
I seem to be hitting 'off' days because I wish the staff was a bit friendlier.  Maybe when they decide I'm a regular.Well, this place, filling an erstwhile giant hole in the ground on Madison's near-west side, is a Taj MahTarget. One wonders what its impact will be on Metcalfe's/Sentry.At Yelp, sharing is caring. But let's be honest, sharing about getting the 'brazilian' area lasered seems a bit TMI. Its our private parts, after all.

As it seems I have no shame or filter for the private things in life, I shall share my laser experience at AZ Laser Hair Removal. If you really don't want to hear about how I permanently removed all the crotch hair, this would be a great time to stop and click elsewhere. Seriously, it might get graphic.

The way I see it, what AZ LHR&SCC (yup the title is too long) lacks in decor, they compensate in results. In terms of a "spa" feel, they definitely lack the 'right ambiance': the laser rooms are very empty and ghetto-looking, the lobby area is tiny and they share a bathroom with the rest of the building- which means you have to go out the back and through some weird corridor to find it. Not the classiest place on earth.

But- the laser works. I got the 6 sessions through Groupon and I am almost done (1 or 2 sessions away). If you need some context for my credibility, let me assure you that I have received LHR on my full legs, arms, armpits and crotch. I have tried every laser, pre-post treatment recommendation and they were all done in different places. You think that would make me an expert, really it just makes me sad about how hairy I thought I was.

Anyhow (getting sidetracked here), the laser at this place DEFINITELY HURTS. Especially in a sensitive area (hoohah) and maybe even more so if you are not used to hair removal lasers (which I was). The Candela Yag essentially works by sending pulses of the beam to a small round area. The light is intense but the heat and the "zap" feel is what gets you. The technician works small area by small area by spending just a second for each "zap". You might survive some of the thicker skin areas- near the stomach-, but once that tube goes near your nether-regions, get ready to bite on a pencil or something, cause it WILL hurt like hell. If this TMI wasn't enough, let me just warn you that before enduring the touch of hell, I needed to ice my ladybits for 20-30mins prior to the appointment, to get it all nice and numb and somehow minimize the pain. They also recommended a pop a bunch of tylenol... just in case. Although I iced the crap out of my panty-area, I still endured pain, but I can't imagine how much worse it would be sans the ice. I don't even want to think about it. *shivers*

I'm not a glutton for pain but I am a sucker for results, and I was happy to see that the hair DID fall off and got patchy by the first treatment. Hair grew much thinner and much patchier.  There are some areas that are still growing thick, but they are so obvious now (in contrast with the rest) that I can show the technician those areas and ask that she focus on them, to make sure that the overall results will be somewhat even. At the end of the day, I can endure 15mins (yes they work very fast) of torture for a lifetime of results, so I kept coming and I am now giving them 4 stars. -1 for the crappy decor and some patchy areas that are not done yet, but all somewhat minor things. 

I'm sure no one OPTS for pain, but as women, our pain tolerance is higher than any other creature out there, and surely we can survive a hot laser in our crotch to forever look hairless and hot down there, because we are women and we do these crazy f-ed things. BRING ON THE PAIN!My first time riding the Big Orange Bus was for a work offsite from Old Town to Greasewood Flats. It picked us up from both locations on time and with no problems. Most recently, we called the Big Orange Bus to pick us up in South Scottsdale to go to Mill Ave. It was a Saturday night, so we expected it to be busy and made sure to call earlier so that by the time we were ready to head out, it'd be here. They told us that they would call back in 30 min. with an update. Almost an hour later without hearing anything, we called back to see if they were still coming. The guy who answered the phone said that they had already picked us up. Sorry buddy, pretty sure you didn't since we wouldn't be calling you if you had. The driver called 5-10 min. later saying that he was almost there. For $3 a person, you really can't complain. That definitely beats taking a cab, especially if you have a bigger party. We also needed to be picked up at the end of the night and it didn't take too long for a driver to find us.

I would definitely recommend them, especially if you're looking to get from Scottsdale to Mill Ave and you're with a big group. I'm not sure how much it costs for a private function where you're looking to drive a further distance. Just make sure you keep an eye on the time so they don't forget about you!In terms of food, I think Ri Ra is definitely a 4/5. The Irish potato cakes are delicious - I highly recommend these as an appetizer. The potato cakes themselves are light and fluffy, and the accompanying sauces are so flavorful.

The Guinness BBQ burger is really good. It has a great smoky flavor and the sauce is great. The chicken curry is really good. It isn't too spicy, but it has a nice flavor.

The staff is really friendly, and the restaurant is really nice and relaxed. I just think that the prices, even for Vegas, are a little high. For this reason alone I might skip Ri Ra in the future and spend the same amount of money at a place that I feel has better food for the same price.

Overall, good food, nice staff, and fun restaurant, if not a little overpriced.Very nice spacious rooms with large bay windows.  Conveniently locked 5 blocks from us airway stadium.  Check-in at 12 and had a great initial experience.  Room cleaning service was the reason for 4 stars instead of 5.  After the first night, room was not cleaned when we got back at 4 pm.  Had to call to request room to be cleaned.  Asked for more towels on way back to room on third day the room service person begrudgingly gave two towels.  Really strange how upset the person was at giving up two towels.  The room itself is really nice.  Late check out on Sundays.   Free meter parking on sat and sun and after 5 pm on weekdays.  Would definitely stay again if in Phoenix.I'm not going to knock the business of what PF does. They are great, I won't lie about that. The staff there are very friendly, and very professional. I just wanna point out some things though;


1. Very reasonable price. $10 a month membership? Can't go wrong with that. $20 dollars a month will get you the Black card (which is what I have.) I do go to LA every now and then (PF in Inglewood CA, which i will also review soon) and do not want to skip gym time, that's why I have it. 

2. Well, if you are trying to gain muscle and up your strength like me, then you will notice by now that PF is and is not really the place to go. If you can't afford a gym such as 24 hr fitness and cross-fit gyms, then PF or Gold's gym would be the best recommendation... But they really can use more free weights...  I think PF kinda caters more to those that focus on cardio which is fine if you are trying to lose some weight. 

3. There are no classes such as (yoga, zumba, weight training, etc) however, there is a man that is a fitness trainer. But don't get too hyped about it... Really he is there to teach you how to properly use the equipment. There are tanning booths too for all you lovely tanners. Lol I don't use them since I'm naturally a tan color. But there is this AMAZING hydro massage bed that I love using so much after a hard workout! You use it for about 7 mins. And can control the pressure and how far up and down the back of your body you want it to go.

5. Bathrooms stay clean, which is good. Lockers? Could be better... I have to admit... Inglewood CA Planet fitness has better lockers and so should this one here...  Being able to see what the person owns in the locker is no good, (unless everything you own is black.) A few are broken... So you have to be careful which locker you choose. Showers are okay, I never use them really since I'm a bit shy. Lol

6. I kinda disagree with one thing though, not trying to be screwed up or anything.... But I seriously believe that PF should really get rid of the pizza, and cupcake giveaways.... There's no point in giving something like that to anyone trying to become fit or trying to lose weight... Its temptation to some, easy to avoid by most people. And the toostie rolls? Come on..... That's candy. Even though it doesn't hurt to eat one, still... The point is to encourage people to come here and reach whatever goal they want to reach. But then again, I don't know if it could also be a good thing for others to learn self control. Lol

Other than all of that! Great place, cool and clean environment, nice people you meet that are very caring and considerate, and friendly staff. I will miss this place cause in a couple months I will be leaving PF for Gold's Gym. Gotta upgrade. Nothing personal! LolAfter reading the reviews about this place, we were a bit nervous.  But, we love Grimaldi's and the concept behind Coal Burger.  They use organic grass fed beef and promote a green style of food production.   We ordered a couple of Cheese Burgers for the kids, Green Chile Burgers for the adults and some fries and sweet potato fries.  The burgers are probably around 4 to 5 ounces which is an appropriate serving.  All of us also chose a whole wheat bun.  After about  5 minutes, our food came out.  It looked good, smelled good and most importantly tasted really good!  The burgers were cooked medium, cheese melted and gooey and the buns were the perfect size for patty.  The green chilies added some nice flavor.  The sweet potato fries were o.k..  I find that they are often dry wherever we go.  The french fries on the other hand were great-cooked to a slight crisp and perfectly salted. I think some people might not be used to taste or the price of a grass fed burger. They have less fat, more nutrients and just are not the same as a grain fed burger.  I also think the first reviewers might have suffered from going right after the place opened.  I believe you need to give a place time figure it out before venturing inside.  All in all a solid meal.Classic Vegas!ABSINTHE is a show that is wholly meant for anyone who himself is already an extroverted type of person. In other words, re-consider attending  this show, let alone buying upfront VVIP seating, unless you are COMPLETELY comfortable with the chance that you may become more than just a casual audience member at anytime during the performance. Combining the drag-on-stage interactive performances of shows like Cirque-Du-Soleil's Zumanity, and the edgy drive-by audience ethnicity insult comedy of comedians like Russell Peters, ABSINTHE is without a doubt the most irreverent show a visitor to Veags could see if they're looking to be made a fool of in one way or another and are gluttons for that type of abuse. 

     In many sections of the show between the acrobatic performances, the MCs of the show (a woman by the name of Penny, and the 'owner' of the show The Gazillionaire) take extreme care in both shocking the audience at large with sexually over-charged humor (Penny's sock puppet show is the epitome of "Adults Only") and aggressively ribbing any introverted folks foolish enough to purchase VVIP seating. For example, if you happen to look even remotely "black" (there are many cultures asian/middle eastern/etc. that can fall into this category at first glance, especially when wearing a ball-cap, like I happened to be that night), and you are in VVIP seating, you're now the westernized, prototypical  "Black Guy". 

     This also applies for other "at a glance" racial judgements as well (eg: if you happen to be any permutation of Asian: "Chinese Guy", et cetera). Other types of superficial insult  humor is delivered based on the look of groups seated together and contrasted based on age, gender and dress/appearance; this is drawn generally from those seated in VIP/VVIP areas of the tent. For example, in the show my wife and I attended (ABSINTHE's 1000th "Zombie" celebration performance/rave), there were two gentlemen seated together at a cocktail table next to a party of two young ladies. 

"The Gazillionaire" and his female Co-MC Penny proceeded to not only call out both groups as being "gay", but also went into explicit detail as to how homosexual both parties were for each other. This ribbing was made all the more abrasive due to the alleged age difference between the two males seated together. Of course, it should also be stressed that all of this raunchy comedy is also self-deprecating, as the MC's and performers consistently ridicule themselves comically as well; it's truly no holds barred. If this particular type of joking, even in good spirit, is considered offensive to experience first hand, you should avoid getting any type of upfront seating.

All of that being said, you'll notice I haven't said "not" to attend the show. In fact, despite all of the issues I've raised in the previous paragraphs, ABSINTHE is still a visually wonderful performance to behold. In fact, one of the upsides to VVIP seating is how close you are to the performance. For example, if you're a fan of burlesque and the human body, than you'll love how close the performers get to you. From disrobing (it's not uncommon for clothing and props to land on/beside VVIP seated guests) to outright flashing (I was flashed by Melody Sweet towards the end of the show), the performers seek to include the audience as much as possible in their interactive art: for better or worse. 

  Then there are the performances themselves. Despite the considerably cramped space, the acrobatics performed are virtually beyond belief. Combined with artfully sculptural and cinematic lighting (something that even ABSINTHE's website photos doesn't capture well, so you'd have to see it in person), the view feels like something from a Tim Burton or Joel Schumacher film; twisted but hauntingly beautiful. From the high-energy Rollerblade performance and the comical acrobatic performance of the fictitious visiting performers from "Reno, Nevada", to the sultry singing of Melody Sweet, there really isn't anything else as special and unique as ABSINTHE in Vegas.  

In summary, extroverts, people that are comfortable in their own skin, and/or just about anyone who has a high threshold for group participation despite the risk of possible ridicule/ribbing should all attend this show and get ready for the punishment. For everyone else, you should still attend I just wouldn't recommend any type of upfront seating if you're very modest/easily embarrassed. So why only 4 stars and not 5? The only reason this show got 4 stars has nothing to do with the nature of any of the performances (not even the aggressive insult comedy), it's because this type of information that I'm providing in my review was not provided at the ABSINTHE website. Had I known what I was getting into, I feel I could've made a more informed purchase decision.Looking for good sandwich place in downtown Mesa? Look no further! This place serves up wacky sandwich combos along with all your traditional favorites. The caprese sandwich is to die for and I hear that the Thanksgiving sandwich will transport you back to November any time of the year! Looking for something a little lighter/healthier? The salads are also fantastic! I like the Spinach salad - the dressing is to die for and it always comes on the side so no worries you can dress to your desire! Located directly on Main St, the location is small and there is street parking available out front. The lunch rush is pretty thick in this location so go get your lunch early or later - avoid the lines when you are pressed for time! A true little gem in downtown Mesa!I had the dinner AYCE on a thursday night for ~32. Although it says only 1hr, we ate for 1.5 hrs. no rush.

- No wait time. I came here before and I had to wait 45min to be seated, so we left. This time we were seated right away. It's hit or miss. 
- 1 TV. If you want to watch a game, they have sports on at the bar.
- Fancier than sushi mon. If you have eaten there, the sushi plates look a lot prettier.
- Ordered and served to me. Service was quick to average. Took 5 to 10 mins to get my orders in. Got them in bundles. 
- I recommend the ecstasy with orgasm sauce, spider, volcano, lemon roll?. avoid fukomaki. It wasted tummy space. 
- No salmon skin roll or any kind of hand roll? did i miss something? I got it at sushi mon. :/
- For non-sushi, get the gyoza, grilled yellow tail, and pork belly. avoid the shumai. it's really tiny and mushy.  
- After awhile, sushi got mushy, red dragon. Probably bc I was getting stuffed. lol.I drank it down was a really hot miso soup that hit the spot. 
- Great desserts! I had tempura ice cream and strawberry mochi. There's  also green tea ice cream and creme brulee. way better than sushi mon. 

^___^!LuV LuV LuV - This sushi bar! 
I usually don't get to sit at a bar and eat sushi since i've always got the baby with me. But when I get the chance to sit at the bar, " TONY" tears it up!!! 
I tell him! " I'm a Hungry Beast" and he says " no Problem, you little CockaRoach" j.k. 
He says, " I got you! I give you the goods tonight!" Since I love ALL sushi Nigiri Style hands down I trust tony gonna give me the goods...And he delivers with a BANG!
So, I recommend sitting at the bar if you get a chance. 
Why do I love the sushi here, well not only is it very fresh but it also has a Quality that is hard to find here in the city. I also like the portion to rice ratio because sometimes they give you more rice than fish and I really do not appreciate that. 
I also like the side items! The Pork Belly is a delicacy here that I will never not have! Also the Spicy Tuna Cracker Rice is good! 
mmmm... It's all good and I am just dreaming about all my favorite sushi here!!
I like Mango for desert so they actually had a really nice Mango Mousse this last time that I went. I also like to look at there daily specials to make sure i'm taking advantage of the All You Can Eat!!!I like beer, but I've realised I'm far from any kind of connoisseur on the matter. In fact I tend to like the light beers, and Guinness, and that's about it. Still though this bar is pretty cool, and it has a wide range of their own brand beers that you're allowed to sample to see what you like, and they do pizza which I've yet to try! The bar has a good mix of tourists and locals alike. My only minor complaint is the female bathrooms are a bit squished when there's more than two people waiting in the queue, but I'd get over that.I went to Windsor w/ a group from work at lunch time.  We were greeted promptly and seated outside on their shady patio.  Our waiter came to our table quickly and took our drink order.  He also answered our menu questions and gave his opinion on a couple of dishes.

The food came out quickly and hot.  All I can say is "AMAZING".  I had the halibut sandwich with mac n' cheese as the side.  Very good taste to the halibut w/ a little kick that was unexpected, but loved.  The only suggestion I can give for this sandwich is to lighten up on the greens and please, please, please, take the stems off of the cilantro!  I am in love w/ the taste of cilantro but the texture of the stems was off putting.

Overall, this was a great restaurant w/ wonderful atmosphere.  Service was good and we left satisfied!  The 4 stars is just b/c the talented chef should consider reducing the amount of greens on the halibut sandwich and make sure to take the stems off the cilantro.

Well done!  Can't wait to go back when I can indulge in some adult beverages!Since I can now post on here again, I'd like to say that this place is great.  Pulled chicken sandwich.  Macaroni and cheese.  Do it.  Great restaurant.Very cool place with almost a California feel. Food was awesome, service was good and they had some nice craft beer options. We really liked the feel and they had a huge outside patio that made you feel like you were sitting somewhere fun in LA. Price was fair, not too high but not cheap either. We will be back!I knew it was a good sign when I walked in and was the only non-asian to be seen. And indeed, Pho Saigon did not disappoint. Have I had better Pho? Maybe, or maybe not. This is just about as good as it gets. Fresh, authentic, delicious, and super cheap. What else could you ask for?Inexpensive Ice Cream and according to my 15 year old, "better than Dairy Queen!".What a great bar.  I mean, awesome idea!  Sometimes you go to a bar, and its nice... you get good music, drinks, whatever.  This place, however, you can't get bored!  Even if you're not huge on games, there is something for you.  Stepping into here, I feel like a kid again.  Simpson's arcade game, Tetris - arcade games that evoke my childhood!  They have a bunch of new Xbox games too and the tables that have the old school games (like Mario 3 - the Wizard, come on - you know what I'm talkin about! Haha).  You can play games at the bar, which is a pretty nice idea (if the bar isn't crowded!)  Otherwise, it can kind of make getting a drink pretty slow.  

Ask them if they have any drink specials.  Last time we went, they had 3 dollar Shock Tops and Longboard beers.  Can't go wrong with specialty beers for 3 bucks.  3 BUCKS.  Other than that, I think the drink prices are on par with the other bars around the Fremont area.

The music here is pretty good too.  I really love the huge screen behind the DJ booth and all the graphics they have.  It could get kind of entrancing if you're feeling a little tipsy.  =)  Ambience is great and I really like all the art painted on the walls.  Its cooool.  

I'm excited to share this place with all the visitors that come through Vegas.  Such a unique and fun experience!  (Cute idea for a first date btw).I really liked "Insert Coins". Alot of hype surrounding it, and I finally made it down there for a couple of rounds of Burger Time, Ms. Pac-Man and House of the Dead. 

I don't get downtown very often, but I find it to be a ritual of sorts to get into Insert Coins when I am anywhere near Fremont Street. A few good beers, some Street Fighter at the bar and some old school pin-ball machines later.. and I'm all happy and feeling like a kid again.. I realize it's not everyone's idea of fun, but beer and video games with a DJ and people acting a fool on the dance floor.. that's my kind of spot!Delicious food but long wait to get a table (I was here on a Saturday for brunch, of course) When we did sit, food came fast and service was good! Must have the pancakes!Amazing food, great service! This place is a great find in west Mesa. Everything is made fresh and the thousand island dressing is amazing!I went to a Majerle's near US Airways Arena after a Suns game, and it was a lot of fun, but it was very packed inside.  Unlike the one in downtown Phoenix, this one in Scottsdale is more spacious.  The place has a great amount of sports running from hockey to basketball.  There are televisions at almost any angle you are sitting, so you never have a bad seat in the house.

The food is pretty decent for bar food.  I got a chicken salad of some sort when I visited.  I didn't have a beer that night, but my friends kept ordering away, so it must have been good.

Dan Majerle would be proud of this establishment that has a great sports vibe.This is my first Vegas spa experience, so I have little to compare it to. It's not the most beautiful or shiniest or anything like that, but the amenities and services are great. 

There is a full cardio and weight area before heading back to the spa. It always was being used whenever we would pass, but it was never over crowded. If I had any discipline I would have used it.

I had the sampler package - 25 minute sugar scrub, 25 minute massage and 25 minute facial. It was $160. It's more than I'd like to pay for any of those services for that time period back here in the Denver area, but it's a good deal for Vegas spas, as I've priced them.

After the 25 minute sugar scrub I got to shower off in a shower with 4 rainfall shower heads. I wish I had more time after I was all done (i.e. my husband didn't want to hit the Strip right away) so I could have just stood in the shower for half an hour or so!

The massage was amazing. Far better than my therapist at home, which tells me I need to find a new one at home. She found my trouble areas and hit them hard. It was exactly what I needed.

I had Sandy for my facial and she was great. Fun to talk to and my skin felt amazing afterwards. I wish I had time/$ for a 50 minute facial!

If you have a spa appointment, you have full access to the club all day. I didn't have time to use it again, unfortunately. They have warm, hot and cold tubs, showers and a changing and hair area stocked with hair supplies and tools. 

The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because it is a bit dated with decor. I had a great experience and hope to do the same next year!Themed after an old fashioned ice cream parlor, Churn is a hot spot for locals to grab a scoop of hand made ice cream, which is made on site. When I visited Churn, the line went out the door and winded to the back of the shop. While I waited, I preoccupied myself by exploring; along with the display of candy and other kiddish delights, there was a cool cassette tape wall, which had about a hundred cassette tapes mounted to the walll. It was only about a 10 minute wait before it was my turn! 

All I need to say is S'mores Sundae!!! For $6.50, you get scoops of chocolate ice cream, hot fudge, graham cracker pieces and marshmallow fluff torched until nicely charred. Simply scrumptious!

I also ordered a scoop of Peach & Honey on a pretzel cone. I didn't care too much for this flavor but the quality is definitely there. It's something good to try once but I probably wouldn't get this flavor again if I were to come back.So far, so good.  This is a nice, quiet casual restaurant, and it's in my area.

I've been here a few times and had the following so far:

Combo kabob plate - steak, chicken and a seasoned ground beef. All were well seasoned, moist, tasty .Served with very tasty rice. The dipping sauce looked and tasted like mayo, plain not seasoned, mayo. What the ??!!
Anyway, I got over the shock and enjoyed the rest of this meal.

Another time, I had the falafel and they were perfect to my taste. The tahini sauce was very good.

Their pita was hot from the oven fresh and was served with a olive oil flavored with thyme and sesame seeds.The perfect example of don't judge a book by its cover! My SO and I decided to give this place a go because of its great reviews. We were the only customers at the time, because we had lunch at 4pm. Otherwise, the owner (I presume) just had some regulars or friends sitting at the bar, talking to him. They were really kind people too.

As we sat there, I admit we had our doubts. The restaurant itself has seen better days. It was in the heart of Kitchener and people stared at us through the window, then at the restaurant sign. We didn't know what to expect and I feel a bit guilty, because now I do genuinely like this place.

He could tell instantly it was our first time trying anything of this sort and tried to walk us through it a little. We were definitely surprised at the size our platter was. We ordered the beef and lamb tibs (which was delicious). It came with so much injera - the absorbent sourdough flat bread. No cutlery, you just pick the meat up with the bread. The meat was so good. You could tell they were lean cuts of meat, but they weren't tough. It was cooked well and the sauce kept it from going dry. Now, we don't like the taste of sourdough bread, so that was just our own fault for not doing research. But by what we saw, everything was really authentic and well-made. It came with a simple side salad of shredded romaine. I don't know what was in that oil-based dressing, but it was really good and I ate all of it.

Since it was just him working, it was sometimes hard tracking him down because he would be cleaning something behind the bar or in the back. But when he had his back turned, a friend would always see us and tell him we needed something. I thought that was really nice of them.

We ended up having to take the rest home. The owner helped us pack it up and the box was so heavy! He told us he really appreciated us coming.I just stumbled across this hidden jewel today by accident! I saw it and decided to walk in and grab a menu to check out their offerings. 

The smell was irresistible, I then decided I must order something and give them a try! 

I had my Sister and friends with me and we were hungry so it was the perfect time to taste some of the goods! 

We ordered the special $7.99 for a 16' pizza with one topping, so we ordered two an Italian sausage and a pepperoni. 

The toppings were generous and delicious! The sauce fresh and flavorful indeed! 

The crust was good as well, tasty with a nice consistency for all of you crust eaters! lol 

The restaurant is very hip and is a very comfortable environment to dine in and eat as well. 

Not only can you dine in and enjoy a meal, they also provide delivery and take out. 

The Owner is super nice, not to mention easy on the eyes! :) 

The staff is Amazing and friendly and the food is great! 

I can't wait to get back to try one of their strombolis or a gyro or a greek platter or sandwich! So many delicious options!

Check this place out!!!!! 

They are new have only been around approximately 6 months or so. 

I will be back for sure!!!Great burger! This was my first time in, I made my own burger with a side of onion rings.  Lots of options and fun names for some of the items. The onion rings were good and it's a big burger so portion was perfect.  I ordered to go and sadly they forgot my bacon but the burger was great without! I'll be back for sure.Waiting in anticipation of this opening for months now I stopped in on the 3rd day it was open. It is a simple place with free peanuts while you wait. The line moves very quickly and you get the food quickly as well. 
I ordered a basic cheeseburger and it was $5.69 , then regular fries for for 2.99 and a soda for $2.20 after tax it was $11.50 ish. Yes it is a little pricey for a burger joint and I know this part of town is going to say that a lot on these reviews but, the basic burger is big with 2 hand made patties and 2 pieces of cheese. There are a quite a few topping to choose as well. I just got mayo pickles and a-1. Very good, greasy and tasty. The fries were ok not amazing, they are fried in peanut oil and are fresh cut. I did however have way more than I needed for not getting a large. 

I will probably go a few more times on special occasions but, not make a habit.I came here on a Saturday night with 2 of my siblings, my boyfriend, and 3 friends. The first thing I noticed was that the place isn't very big, but the interior is gorgeous. There are giant picture frames on the walls with voyeuristic pictures, girls dancing and tumbling around on nets attached to the ceiling, a pole dancer in the corner, a large swing next to one of the bars, and girls wearing masquerade masks. Even though the place wasn't that big, I was still able to walk around the crowds of people with ease. Of course, a lot of the clubs in Vegas have very nice ambiances, but what set Gallery apart for me was the mix of music they played while we were there. They played a lot of old school hip hop! Run-D.M.C., Sugar Hill Gang, Slick Rick, LL Cool J, Outkast, etc. It was probably the best experience I've had in a club so far because of the music they played. We got free drink tickets too, so I was really get my groove on ;) 

I really hope the night we went wasn't just some sort of  "special" night and they actually play that kind of music all the time, because that would automatically make Gallery my favorite Vegas nightclub. 

Tip
*Men's dress code: must wear a collared, button-up shirt & dress shoes.Someone local suggested this place to a friend of mine. We met for lunch while I was in town for a short visit. We were seated right away, and our server quickly came to get our drink order. As an appetizer we tried one of their mushrooms from the mushroom bar. The angry shrimp mushroom was to die for. I had the grilled veggie sandwich for an entree. The sandwich was very tasty & filling. 
Other reviewers have had issues with service. We had nothing, but great service the whole time we were there. The restaurant wasn't very busy (probably since it was lunch on a weekday). When they get busy, service may slow down.Saw Christopher Titus here, found out it was a charity event.  The comics were funny.  Meaghan was our server...AMAZING!!! She rocked.  It sucked that one of the tallest people was sitting in front of me ( I am barely over 5') and the chairs were close together and all the drinks seemed to be $11 or more.  The food and drinks were good but for 5 of us, 1 drink each and 1 app each, was $135 plus an added gratA big group of us came here on a Friday night for happy hour after work.  It was great!  I loved the openness and we could sit without bumping into other people.  There was an area for kids to run around with a playground for them.  It was perfect outside!  (Although I don't think I'd come here during the summer....it must get awfully hot out there.  There's not really anywhere to sit inside)

You have to go inside to order food and I also ordered all my drinks inside.  The bartender was very nice and helped me decide what to drink since I am picky.

I didn't love the food selection because it was mostly greasy bar food and I was in the mood for something lighter.

It kind of had a Monastery/Greasewood Flats vibe to it.I love that bike rentals are back. There are kayaks, paddle boats, pontoon boats, and a few other things to rent. I have been out kayaking twice and used the paddle boat once. It's really fun. Kayaking is difficult on a windy day though. Luckily, I'm up for a challenge! They also sell water, Gatorade and snacks at the rental booth.I've had lunch here a couple of times and dinner once.  I love the patio seating and people watching.  The food is good, and the service is better than you would expect from a chain.  I love the different items on the lighter side menu.  Great place do dine with friends.I love restaurants that make you feel like you've watched a little too much of the Food Network...

The biggest benefit was the fact that there is a portion of your menu where you can choose one of their specialty sauces and pair it with your favorite pasta.  So I rooted through my memory of Alton Brown's 'Good Eats' shows trying to remember the uses of each type of pasta...and then remembered I'm not a pasta afficionado.

Prices are a tiny bit higher than say Olive Garden, but if given a choice between the two, I'd come back to La Bona Pasta.  Why?  Beccause they are 

F
R
E
S
H

The kitchen is wide open for you so it's not like they could drop a piece of chicken on the floor, or pick an orfice on their body and return to preparing your food.  They do everything right there!

Oh, and if one was worried about the fact that the prices are a couple of dollars more than a chain restaurant, one would only have to click on the following link: 

http://couponclipper.com/loc/LA-BONA-PASTA 

Which offers a 'buy one, get one half off' on lunch or dinner.  Fabulous!  I couldn't print it so I showed the coupon from my phone and they didn't hesitate to take it!  I would recommend printing it though, I think it might be easier for them.  It's good until next month but I'll bet they issue out another one when that one's done and you can be sure I'll use it!

Now Foodward!  My friend ordered the Carbonara with fettucini, and I got the Sauce a La Bona Pasta with angel hair.  We each tried the other's dish.  While the Carbonara was well executed (what could you possibly have a complaint about a lovely creamy sauce and PANCETTA??), we both agreed that we liked the signature sauce even better.  The Sauce a La Bona -or whatever it was called; who cares about the name it was Yummy!- included a creamy marinara sauce with bits of moist chicken, broccoli, and porcini mushrooms.  It was perfect with the angel hair but I could see it with fusili or farfalle as well.

We finished off the night with the tiramisu, which was definitely homemade and definitely one of the best I've had.  I didn't like the sauces they put on the plate...I know they did it for decor purposes, but I would have rather had a light dusting of cocoa on the plate, a little whipped cream, with a sprig of mint.  It would have complemented the cake much better.  

So to sum up this experience, I was more than happy about my meal and am extremely jealous I don't have a place like this closer to my house.  So La Bona Pasta, if Litchfield Park's rent is a little too much for you, we would be more than happy to have you move North!!Service was OK, nothing exceptional. Price was fair, food good, ambiance relaxing. I will be back again when I'm in the area.Great Thai, Great Prices and very nice staff.  I have been here multiple times for lunch.  It's a hit with our office!tip:  get an arepa, then cross the street to get some frozen custard!

At around $4, it's somewhat pricey for a rather small but plenty tasty arepa.  Beef tongue arepas were very tender, but was cooked through so much that you won't know its beef tongue or beef brisket. comes with green sauce which was fantastic.

also have sugar cane drinks (asians love that $h!t)I was stuck without a car and didn't want to cook so I found Salsa Blanca online and saw that they delivered.  I ordered combination #10, the chili rellenos, an alacarte taco and some guacamoli.  The order-taker said it would be 45 mins to an hour, so I set my sights accordingly.  It arrived in 15 minutes!  A very courteous delivery guy came to the door, very upbeat and appreciative of my business.  Generous amounts of guac and the chili's were delicious.  I felt the portions of rice and beans were a little bit small but were sufficient.  Other than that, YES I will order from them again when I have the opportunity.Pizza is a subjective thing. What I like you might not. For me, an important distinction in good pizza is the quality and taste of the dough. And while East Coast Pizza isn't the best I've ever had, it is very good and I'm glad it's nearby. They've got some creative toppings to offer, too, though I usually stick with a plain cheese pizza because I enjoy the crust so much. 

They also make a very good Greek salad. 

People who work there are friendly and pleasant and I often see the owner, too. When ownership cares enough to be there, the experience and the product is usually much better. 

I'm a regular customer and I certainly recommend East Coast Pizza.Great PIZZA!!! every time we have gone in or had it delivered. Not a fancy place but then again great pizza joints never are. Become a fan and give them a try, we did and love their food.Good Food,  fun decor and good service.. Javier behind the bar can serve you a frosty tall one from the 20+ draft beers they have on tap.  Sit at the bar and keep your beer cold on the frozen chill rail built into the bar.. what the heck.. if you behave.. you just might get a small snowball fight going.. I mean very small... TACO TUESDAYS Rock !  Broasted Chicken,  Great Burgers and BBQ with a
 friendly staff.. My wife and I have been going there about once a week for months now.. getting to be a habit.. The owners, Mr. and Mrs. Morgan are there and ready to greet you, thank you for your business and answer questions.. Where else do you see that ?My husband and I got impromptu free tickets from a fantastic local website and off we went to see Mike Hammer at the classy 4 Queens. The show is very low budget. We sat on chairs with circular leather cushions that may have been hand-me-downs from Hugo's Cellar in the 70s, but I digress. The show was definitely worth the free price tag! I may have even paid $10 or $15 to see it! Some of the magic tricks are the same as the Harry Potter Magic Show that I take my kids to at the library once a year, but as other reviews have mentioned, the show is about comedy. It doesn't quite contain any blow-your-mind magic tricks like you "might" at David Copperfield, but he kept us laughing and entertained the whole time. 

Some may get offended at his jokes, and i would certainly never bring my kids, ever ever ever, not unless they're 21, which would still probably be a little awkward. I would certainly recommend visiting if your'e looking for a less expensive show compared to those on the strip, aren't easily offended, and enjoy bawdy humor and simple magic tricks. My husband and I signed up for a players card after and headed to Magnolia's Cafe for some prime rib. We walked out of there paying $15. That's a $15 date night with dinner and show. Super worth it!Just got back from Vegas, had the Curry Beef (they were out of chicken), Fried Porkchop Udon, Fried Chicken Udon, Fried Shrimp wonton as well as Shrimp Wonton in udon, desert we tried the Mango, almond and Roti (flaming Ice cream). This place had a strange smell when you enter, but got used to when you are in. The food was good and decent, it had a Japanese/chinese/hawaiian taste to it.. I know Udon is Japanes, but all of these other flavors confuses yet heighten your senses.  Overall it was food, a family of four cost around $40 and you were stuffed when you leave.. get in their early as they ran out of favorites fast.. the hamione Rice and chicken curry ran out when we arrived around 7pmBig Wong can get in this belly anytime.

Their menu is simple, easy and cheap.

After reading several reviews and seeing several of yelp friends visit this place, it was time for me to give this place a try. 


What I loved:

The desert rotis.
The plain rotis.
The chicken curry.
The shrimp wonton soup.

What I liked:
The salt and pepper chicken wings. 
The beef and tendon ramen.


What can I say? Good, decent food at cheap prices. I will definitely be back time and time again. To go ordering is simple and so fast and painless.One of my favorite spots for a salad! My favorite is the apple chicken salad, but the other salads are delicious as well. They also have great omelets. Love sitting on their outdoor patio where you can sit in the shade or soak up the Vegas sunshine! The service is always top notch, but can be a tad slow when super busy. But understandable.Our arms were twisted after a Yelp event to meet up for some drinks. 
I wasn't hungry so I just got a Mint Chocolate Girl Scout Cookie Martini that was incredible! My husband ended up ordering a Drunken Kobe Burger with a side of House Fries. He loved the burger. I wasn't into it, but the Cabernet Demi that they put on the side for dipping was addictive. It was more like a gravy, dip your fries in it, that's all you need to know. Do It!
Our waiter was excellent. Prices are good for the quality.
I will definitely go back for more.Good neighborhood bar - neat atmosphere. Pizza yeah... Go for it. They have a good crowd and Karoke. Free Wi Fii too. Staffs are cool and welcoming.Holy Crape! 
2 words... The Avalon... Perfectly sweet from the pear, crunchy from the walnuts and savory from the goat cheese. This is my absolute favorite! When I left I talked about this crepe for like 3 days straight not missing an opportunity to tell everyone I came in contact with about it. 

Today I tried the Caprese w/ chicken and it was excellen, maybe a little pesto-ie... (Still not as good as the Avalon!) My guy had the Marco Pollo for the second time so I'm assuming he really enjoyed that. 

The first time we went I asked for the Mimosa trio. I thought, what could be better than an assortment of flavored Mimosa's! But sadly I was wrong. The flavors were like flavor shots which made the mimosa's entirely too sweet. 
Today I opted for a traditional mimosa which was much better. 

The only thing negative about this place is that it tends to get busy and you can get stuck with a 30 min wait, but... It's pretty worth it.I was definitely skeptical about going to this restaurant only because I figured crapes were more of a sweet snack then an actual meal but I am totally just delighted with the food here I had the Greek and it was delicious it was nice and savory and it was a really big so you get a lot for your money and the service was great friendly and helpfulI've traveled the world refining my palate for Cuban ropa vieja (shredded beef in savory wine sauce), and use this dish as a basis for comparison to find good Cuban food - like pad thai at Thai or palak paneer for Indian. I digress...

The ropa vieja at Feli's holds up - delicious, stewy, with the right amount of tang, to make your tastebuds sing like Ricky Ricardo. The food here, in all seriousness, was delightful. The ambience was lacking - didn't feel at all authentically Cuban, but the service was great, and the food is what you go for. Feli's is the only Cuban joint within 100 miles, and it represents well.This taste so much better than Boiling Crab. This place has lots of tables and lots of space. Good enough to get down and dirty with your shrimp and crawfish!I prefer this location to the older/original only because there is less of a wait and more spacious. I also tend to be a little claustrophobic when I am eating.

I always have a go-to when coming here: Crawfish w/ The Hot & Juicy Special in HOT. Muy caliente. Be careful, Hot will get your sinuses running and that's only a level 3 (out of 4)- Trust me, I like my food spicy! Medium also has a kick to it.

I love that sauce, so much that I will usually order fries to use to soak up the excess. Corn is also delish slathered in that sauce. I also always ask for lemon, salt, pepper- must be an Asian thing.

Crawdaddies don't really fill me up so I will usually order some shrimp as well. They don't really seem to absorb the sauce as well though...

Everything served here is finger food and very casual. I caved in and started wearing the plastic bibs offered- can't risk staining my clothes. It's bad enough that the smell of garlic permeated anything that enters the premise. I literally have to wash the insides of my nose with soap when I get home or I will be smelling garlic for the next couple of days.

I also remember entering a contest and being a finalist in their 2012 calendar, I forgot what the perks were, but it would've been nice to  win and maybe get free crawfish out of it. lolVery good, good value, friendly staff! I prefer the shrimp, but the crawfish is just as good. I highly recommend this place to anyone who enjoys sea food. Btw be prepared to eat a lot of food! Portions are good!Great food, unassuming storefront, clear hd tv, good beer selection, clean, nice staff.  A gem in the valley.  Comfortable for dining in or take out. Also, good old school milkshakes. Burger and bottle for $6. Happy hour. Yum!What a great place.

I had the strawberry chicken salad which was pretty decent.

My friend had the steak bites (which look great although I didn't try them) and the fries (which were really good).

They have a great beer section. I had the strawberry blond which tasted like Flintstone vitamins.

The best part was the gorgeous, awesome and friendly waitress Cassie. 

I'll go back for sure and am planning to try the steak bites.

CheersYeah, a brand new buffet!  Suns here finally opened, after months of delays, & it's real good now that we have it.  Robyn N. & Mike C. joined me to give it a try today, & they were serving 136 food items, plus dressings & sauces, in this big, comfortable place featuring both booths & tables.  

Some things besides the wide selection that impressed me today were the delicious Hot & Sour Soup, the tasty Bok Choy, a nice selection of just-made Sushi, & the wide selection of other seafood!  There was a great vegetarian tofu dish as well, with various veggies & mushrooms, all in a rich gravy.  Eight real ice cream choices go along with a good number of other desserts to make sure you leave full & happy!  Our table service was excellent too, & the staff members friendly.     :-))

A high 4-Stars for Suns Buffet where Lunch Buffet is $8.39/$7.56 Sr.This location is closed.  The website says they will re-open in a week or so on Fremont Street in downtown LV.

Decent pizza and cheep beer.  Hope it stays that way when they open downtownI ended up at Thai Basil by accident. I headed South on Central and was looking for the Thai place on Adams and Central (apparently there are more than one there too) anyway I forgot at that point you are on 1st. Well I was parked and the place looked nice so I ate here. I was seated and given the lunch menu. They promptly brought out a glass of water, silverware and a cup of broth soup. The menu was pretty typical Thai Lunch Specials for here. I noticed the BBQ Pork and that sounded good so I decided to give that a try. The soup was mostly broth but it was tasty and just the right temperature. I was surprised when they brought out the order what looked like two thin sliced pork chops on a bed of greens (Cabbage...) a pile of white rice a Spring roll and two cups of sauce. I tried the spring roll first because I am a huge fan of them. I was instantly disappointed. It was not only room temperature but it lacked much of any filling inside. The dipping sauce was ok but it would have been nice if they had some hot mustard on the table to add a bit to it. Next I cut up some of the pork and dipped it in the BBQ sauce. All was forgiven. This was very good, cooked properly and very tasty. The service was very good and the price was certainly fair. It is not one of the best Thai places in Phoenix, but it is very good and I will be back again.Can't believe I've lived in the Valley almost 10 years before my 1st visit to Filiberto's.  I've tried several things on the menu, but this is the bottom line - the places are SPOTLESS.  The food is cheap and real and good.  I'm partial to a tostada when I'm in a hurry.  I'll get an enchilada plate if I'm in the mood to sit down.  Both fill me up.  The salsa bar is always a nice touch, although I don't think their salsa is the best.  Quality fast food and a good price.This is real NYC style pizza. The only reason I dont give it 5 stars is the prices. It is spendy for pizza. I will go back if I have the chance... or a coupon.Very authentic tasting tacos and quesadillas. You know the food is good when 95% of the people dinning in a Mexican restaurant are Mexican! We just got to Vegas and it was Cinco de Mayo and there was no better place to start off the festivities than an authentic Mexican restaurant.

I had the carne asada tacos, DELICIOUS!! The staff was great and really friendly and the restaurant had a really cool atmosphere and prices are very reasonable.
Will definitely stop by next time I'm in Vegas.Will def go back on my next Vegas trip! Only shared a large carne asada fries with my fiance and we could barely finish it! Very yummy! The one problem I had was that the lady sweeping the floor swept the dirt/food pieces onto my feet....no "sorry" or anything. Kinda rude.I am so sad I could not give them five stars. The best authentic Mexican food this aide of the border.  Flavors burst into your taste buds as you try to remember what tacos you ever tasted better then these. NEVER. EVER. Teajuana bases flavor.  El Gordo has the cooking down to a fine science.  Like most Mexican restaurants they need a gringo to fix the traffic jam of customers trying to spend their money.  Walking into this Maze of people you think of a Chinese fire drill. Walk in four feet and it looks like the 405 and the 710 freeway meet.with a little more planning this place could triple their income. Poor design.  Not customer friendly.  Each item, different line. Booooo!  I would love to complain to someone that would make a difference. Make the right move for your Mexican audience.  They will come.Still really good flavor but not as good as Cali :(. The meat seems to be different but the guacamole, marinade, and salsa make up for it.  But after a long night in Vegas I'm sure it hits the spot.I like this place.

I was with the previously mentioned group of EVFN'ers. We can be a loud, obnoxious group at times and we tend to keep servers confused by playing musical chairs.

But Brandon was cool, he even handled the people hassling him about his shoes with ease. (And seriously, his shoes? Who cares?). Ashley was excellent, and pretty easy on the eyes too. Of course that shouldn't really matter, but it does...

I had the Haddock fish and chips, which was *excellent*. I wasn't sure what to do with the curry stuff that came with it but damn, anything with curry and whole chunks of garlic has got to be fabulous. I just ate it with a fork and dipped my fish in it. Whether I did that right or not, it was delightful.

A decent (though not overwhelming) beer selection. Pub-like atmosphere, good food, good service. What's not to like?I've been there two times, both times I've had about a 7/10 experience. Their food is really good, I've always enjoyed what I've gotten. Their grande burrito is humongous & pretty cheap for what you get. They ran out of chimichangas  last time so I got the sobres I think it's called-which were really good.

The complimentary chips were cold last time I went there (granted they were busy) & they won't give you refills on chips unless you pay- so if you have a large group or a few hungry friends expect to pay more.

The margarita my sister & I split tasted like strawberry soda with a cup of sugar added in. So pretty darn sweet. 

All in all, good place to try near the Capitol & relatively affordable. I recommend.This is a great quick service Greek restaurant for eating in or taking to go. Good healthy options & quality food. I go here for the chicken or steak kabobs regularly with a side of grilled vegetables. It always tastes good, and makes eating healthy pretty enjoyable. This gets 4 stars out of a possible 4 stars for the type of restaurant they are. I am a regular here, and will continue to be.Food was decent; flavorful. My son LOVED it here. Pricing is a little high however the "plates" are big! Will come back againThe food was solid, and they have wine. Need I say more?

Ok, I will. I was downtown for a conference at the Hyatt and this was the perfect lunch spot! I love spicy Thai food, and they understood my kind of spicy! They had so many choices, particularly for vegetarians (like me!). Yum Yum - if you're in the hood, definitely go!To my suprise the show was great!Fanciest Chipotle I've ever been too!  This brand new location has a refreshing new look to the decor and a new menu item.  They offer cilantro lime brown rice.  Loved the flavor of this new rice.  I will be adding this new location to my stops for my burrito fix!I went here to catch up with a friend who just moved here from Seattle. We both really liked this place! I like that they have free music shows sometimes and the food is good (not the best food ever, but good). When we went, they had 5$ Sangria and it was really tasty. I got the carne asada burrito and I liked the flavor, but the meat pieces were a little too small and it was a little too beany BUT I enjoyed it. I would definitely go back.Have you ever experienced that moment where you realize you're not half as cool as you think you are? Yeah... well Crescent Ballroom did that for me. 

The first and only time I've come here, was to play Bingo. That statement alone should be enough evidence to myself and anyone else who will listen that my days of coolness have passed. If they ever existed at all.

This place is pretty sweet. I had dinner before Bingo because grandpa (me) knew it might be a late night and I didn't want to eat after I left here. Doing something like that would lead to a night of indigestion and no sleep. Psssh... who needs that in their life. Am I right? 

I tried the carne asada quesadilla and it was unexpectedly good. I would eat here again without a doubt. 

The Bingo was played in the concert area. I'm not gonna lie... it was fun. The event was put on by Jackalope Ranch and emceed by the National Comedy Theater of Phoenix. They did a great job. Funny people. Especially this guy Marcus. Hilarious.
 
They were all about audience participation. Like it or not. I was actually glad I never won a hand of Bingo because then you had to go up on stage and try to match wits with a trained comedian. I don't need that in my life. I'm the kind of person who thinks of a comeback 3 days later. It was a lot of fun though. 

Crescent Ballroom seems like it would be an amazing live music venue. I checked the calendar and there was not one band that I knew. Oh, wait... except the Toadies. You know the "hipster" line, you wouldn't know who they are... Well they're right. I don't. 

Bottom line is that this place is cool. A solid 4. Hopefully one day a band I know will play here and I can bump it to a 5. Until then I'll live in happy acceptance that my days of coolness are behind me.Incredible "Chinese sandwiches"!  (I promise I'm Asian).

There is no other way to describe the excellent, deeply flavored pork belly, chicken, and roast duck, perfectly balanced with pickled and fresh veg, sandwiched in a Chinese steam bread.   (I know, its called bao).

It sounds like this food is served from a food truck right?  It's not.  It's served from a hair salon and day spa.  Very logical.  

Regardless, the quality of the food and its presentation are excellent.  The steam bread, perfect.  Gently flavored, moist, chewy and pillowy at the same time.  The pork belly is well rendered.  Juicy but not greasy.  Tender pork, fatty heaven!  The roast duck, dense and moist, with smoky ducky goodness capped by crispy skin.  With the addition of the veg, each bao achieves the sweet, sour, salty, bitter flavor and textural balance.  Other versions are also offered including a vegetarian tofu and mushroom bao.

Really good eats that can be appreciated even by those who think Chinese food is General Tso's Chicken with shrimp fried rice.

Prices are reasonable for the quality.  $3 and change for a single bao.  $10 for three bao and a drink.

They do sell out so check their Facebook page or Twitter feed before going.Late night spot. The different variety of fries are really worth trying. Everything else on the menu is good, not great. Avg pricingHad two double char burgers with cheese and one without with raw onion (usually comes with caramelized onions), sweet potato fries and regular fries.  Both burgers were amazingly good and fresh.  The sweet potato fries are some of the best, but the regular fries were nothing to write home about.  On the fries they need to take a lesson from Smashburger--their smash fries are really, really good.  
The cooks made a mistake on one of the burgers and management more than made up for it.  Great manager!!  This is a place that I would return to over and over again.  I  suggest to the management to come up with a better substitute for the mundane french fries.  Otherwise, The Habit Burger Grill is a hit!!!!!Afternoon tea is the way to go. The pricing varies on the level chosen and caters to different levels of hunger. A friend and I stopped in after a smoothie at Whole Foods and just wanted a pick me up. We opted for the Sussex Cream Tea set. 

For $10, there is an extensive choice of teas, two large scones, some kind of cream, and jam. I am unsure of what to call the thick cream because normally tea is served with clotted cream, but I have never had it before. The consistency of ours was similar to a thicker and richer whipped cream. It was also less sweet than it's counter part. The combination of all the flavors was nice with the Tropical Green Tea. It would probably go better with a traditional black tea. Nonetheless, it was a nice experience. I might skip breakfast one day and go for the Cream Tea Service. For $8 more, it comes with finger sandwiches and pastries. By the time we finished, I felt like taking a nap, so I can only imagine how decadent  and heavy this combination would be. 

If there was one complaint it would be about how the tea leaves are floating in the pot. I drink my tea quickly and by the third cup, my tea had already become bitter. It had over steeped. It is nice that they offer refills on hot water. Having a strainer in the pot would have been better than giving the one for the cup. 

James, our server, was diligent and polite. Came by to check on us, but gave us our space as well. Looking over their happy hour menu, it would be a nice spot to stop by for a glass of wine or a pint. It goes Monday-Friday from 3:30-6:30 for anyone who is interested.Oregano's has been a favorite restaurant with our family since before we WERE a family (circa 1998). Even though we've never lived close to any of the locations, we've had so many great moments (and honestly, in 13 years, only ONE bad experience) at this local chain. We had our first date on University in Tempe and we had our wedding celebration party (after eloping to Australia) at the Scottsdale location. The front patio at the Mesa restaurant was the choice for my husband's 40th birthday party.

 Always great service! Great atmosphere (friendly, fun) and great food.
Our two boys now love to come with us to the newest location (near our home in Ahwatukee--thank heaven!) on Elliot Rd in Tempe which will surely be our new local hot spot, as it is near my husband's work as well. WE ARE SO EXCITED!

My favorite items on the menu (although I admit, I'm finally steering away from my usuals so that I can try the rest of their extensive menu):

Kick BUTT Garlic Bread (be sure to order it with cheese and a side of marinara)--YUM!
Guaca Tony (I only recently tried this and am sorry that I've been missing out all these years)

Chicken Ceasar Salad (dressing is SO good, and there's never too much of it) 

The Sproccoli Deep Dish or Stuffed Pizza - have a little salad, which comes out quick; then wait another 20 minutes or so for the Chicago-style pie--SO worth the wait! (and so filling, you'll have leftovers for lunch the next day!)I was driving along the shitty part of Las Vegas Blvd one night around 1am, headed to check out those creepy, decaying mannequins out in front of the Talk of the Town strip club with my pregnant girlfriend from Arkansas. We passed by a new storefront chock full of artsy wackiness, and despite the late hour there was a man out front fussing around with the window display. So I screeched to a halt and went in to check it out.

IT WAS AWESOME! Run by Leroy Lopez, aka "The Gay Elvis" (so called because he's very flashy in his manner of dress), this place stocks all manner of bizarre, flashy Vegas-y furnishings, home accents, art and clothing. The prices are somewhat high, but they're willing to work with you -- I got a BAD ASS Wonder Woman costume for a really good price...at 1am on a Tuesday morning, no less. 

And THAT's why I love living in Vegas!I have to laugh at the fact that someone below seemed irritated by the lack of 'healthy' choices. It's a place serving fried chicken. If you want healthy, you started off in the wrong place. Fast food is never healthy, not even when you're ordering a salad. Enough of my rant on common sense from the masses. 

This place does a very few things and they do them all well. I have been here several times. The chicken, fries, toast and cole slaw are always good. Is it going to send you screaming out to tell all your friends? Probably not. But it's good and their menu is easy to order from. It's also better chicken than you will find at probably 90% of the normal fast food drive-throughs. 

It's definitely a place I like hitting up when I can and I will continue to do so. I have yet to have anything there that was a turn off.Love this place but they are a little overpriced!!! The sauce is what makes the chicken taste even better! Raising canes is fab. 4 stars due to prices!My friend and I have been waiting for this place to open, because it looked so good. We finally went today and weren't disappointed. It is very similar to Paradise Bakery (price and food wise), but in my opinion is better. They have sandwiches, salads, soups, pastas, and paninis. Both of us got the chicken pomodori and it was SO good. Super flavorful and filling. This place gets super busy, but there is a ton of space so you won't have trouble finding a place to sit. They will bring your food to your table and also grab your plates when you are done. Great food and good service. We will most definitely be going back.I finally decided to give this place a try after a friend kept nagging me to. The food was pretty good. Im not a big fan of lobster but if you love lobster then this is the place for you. A friend that was with me said yhe ceviche was good and a must try.When I read the great reviews of my yelp buffet lunch group for this place (yes, this review is for the lunch buffet), I knew I had to come here; and I'm glad I did. The restaurant is bigger than it looks from the outside, and inside it is clean and the service is very friendly. The buffet items were all good - several types of curries, two kinds of pad thai, rice and noodle dishes - including my favorite, beanthread noodles. Chicken and tofu are the predominant proteins in the buffet, but there's also a beef curry for those who must have their bovine fix. Also, there were a number of tasty vegetarian options. The heat level of spicy dishes was low to moderate, though there is a condiment area with sauces and peppers that will allow you to crank your food's heat level up to thermonuclear, if you so desire. All this really good food for just $8.88 plus tax.  The lunch buffet here is definitely one of the best dining deals in the city.Loved it, classic Dim Sum service. Attack you with carts as soon as you sit down. There is a Chinese dessert called Rice Cake that I could only fint in Hawaii, finally found it here and it was done the right way! Service was great, food quality was amazing! The only downer was that some of the food was cold. Other than that I will be coming back here for a long while!I mean let's be honest IF you can put garlic on a pizza and no sauce and it's still damn good, you got something going for ya.

We went on our lunch break b/c I had to say hello to Mr. Kors.  We split a white pizza and split the salad and it was just right!

Service was fast and the food/drinks came right out. Bill was probably like $25 for the 2 of us.So after all the fan fare I made it out here finally.  It takes me about 20 to 30 min to get out here so we were a bit on the late side getting there.  We got there at 20 to 9 and it looked like they were almost cleaned up.  I felt so bad making a mess right before close.  But we were greated with a very nice hello and what can we get you?  No eye rolls or sighs at all!  Nice guys!  So we had 4 people and wanted to cut some in half to sample a few.

We ordered the Beef Bulgogi Dog, the Banh Mi Dog, the West Coast Dog, the Angry Bowl, the Angry Kimchi Fries and the Fried Pickles.  Put it this way we went a bit over board!  But we have heard so much we really wanted a sampling.  The Dogs hmm... I don't eat a whole lot of dogs but WOW, they popped when you bit into them and had a subtle smokey flavor then the fusion on top just kind of set it off!  The cook said they changed the way they make it recently and started to put the sauce on top.  I thought it made it look amazing but also helped hold the toppings on a bit.  The dogs were Great!

The Angry Kimchi Fries were a nice change I enjoyed them, however the BF didn't like the sweet potatoes he would have preffered regular potatoes.  I thought the sweet potatoes were a nice compliment to the spice of the kimchi on top.  The fried pickles sadly I have been ruined for life for fried pickles.  I will never again have the satisfaction of the pickles I had on a trip to the east coast. :(  The batter had good flavor but it was thick on top of the pickle which in turn took away from the flavor of the pickle.  The dipping sauce for it was great!  

The decor is nice and bright and made me smile the staff is super nice!  So the verdict is I will come back the BF says he wouldn't drive out there for it but I do the driving so I guess we'll be back!Really great hot dogs at this joint.  As the name implies, they have lots of hot dogs with a Korean influence.  The hot dogs by themselves are very flavorful and the toppings are all made in house.  So far I've had the Angry Dog and the Pork Belly Kimchi Dog.  Both are very good.  The prices are good and the staff is very friendly.  Glad I finally made it here!Delicious!!! I am not a hot dog fan, but the amazing combinations and toppings Buldogis has to offer has changed my mind. Not only that, their Kimchi Fries are a great side to share with somebody. I am never disappointed or still hungry after eating here!So i am sort of a snob when it comes to pizza. I'm guilty of judging places because I am not a fan of pizza Hut and other like places but I recently got some coupons in the mail for Papa Murphy's and decided what the heck, I will give it a shot. I called in before I left work and they were ready for pick up when I got over there. i got a specialty stuffed one for my boo and got myself a veggie thin crust and even got some free cookie dough!! The gentleman that helped me on the phone and when i went it was very helpful and make my first experience just delightful. It was a nice change just to get home and throw something in the oven and have dinner be done. The pizzas came out better than I expected and my boyfriend even said the next morning that his pizza was really good and would def order from Papa M's again. That comment coming from him says a lot, since he is a bigger pizza snob then I am!

Super convenient, super tasty, super affordable.

SCORE X3 !Finally a location in the area. Love the famous star, super star and the steakhouse six dollar burger. Also the charbroiled sante fe chicken sandwich. Drive thru is open 24hrs. Didn't eat inside just went drive thru but it looked kinda busy inside. Drive thru service was quick.Picked the Barrymore for a nice romantic dinner after reading the reviews on Yelp. Found the food to be excellent, the portions were large, and our waiter Israel was helpful and fantastic.  The only downside was the large, loud group seated right beside in a dining room that is on the small side.  Would highly recommend this restaurant!Damn great, old school service, and, for my California-starved soul--FOIE GRAS!!! (melted in my mouth...could have died happy then and there) Wonderful retro cocktail menu (yeah, I happily knocked back a few Moscow Mules), well-priced, superbly cooked steak and I'm still dreaming about that onion side w/ jalapeño peppers on top... However...it wouldn't kill them to turn on a few more lights! Dining room as dark as a cave...I could barely see my succulent viands!!! Did dig the film spools as ceiling decoration.I went here for Grand Opening for a sneak peak. They had a minimum of $2.00 for admission in which part of the proceeds are being donated to a charity. There was a long line, but it flowed pretty smooth.
  
This was my first time ever going to a maze...wasn't quite too sure of what to expect. They did a great job with the graphics and how the place was decorated overall. There were people sneaking up on us and they totally got me. One guy got me good 3 times...I think they he thought I was a good target cuz I was such a scaredy cat. =o(

Overall, it was done well and it was a great experience for my first maze.I visited this newly opened small shop called Bread and Butter in Green Valley today. Owner, Chris, was former pastry chef of Bouchon at Venetian Hotel. Everything here is pretty good especially the fresh peach jam n honey butter came with sourdough waffles. I even bought a big jar of peach jam when I left. My bf likes their veggie sandwich. It comes with artichokes, grilled asparagus, apricots, cucumbers n goat cheese. I think I will come back this place soon again.Stumbled upon this gem of a place the other day with some friends yesterday.  I didn't know such a quaint place existed in that strip mall, as I've been to places like Aurelio's and Osaka before.  Bread and Butter really offers a lot of brunch personality and boy was I lovin' it!

I decided to get their daily special, the beef brisket hash with a fried egg, instead of the strawberry salad it's accompanied with, I got the bowl of fruit and a soda.  My bill came to about $14 total.  Yes, a little steep but I thought it was a lot of food.  First the fruit came in a small white cauldron well, filled with cantaloupe, strawberries and pineapple.  So fresh and so sweet, I was lovin' it!  The hash was also served in it's own well, potatoes and chunks of beef brisket chunks and caramelized onions, topped with two fried, sunny side up eggs.  Maybe I should have asked for over medium or scrambled.  I'm not a fan of very runny eggs however the yolk did run into the hash and did combine pretty well.  The brisket was super marbleized, maybe just a little too much , however I was needing something fatty so it was fine.  

Although I didn't partake in any of the million pastries they had to offer, I KNOW when I get in that mood, I will definitely come back to try some of their baked goods.  It looked AH-MAZE-ING.  If you're on your way to Anthem, stop by this gem of a brunch place and try them out!  You will love it!This is my go to spot when my Wine rack is sparse and I need to load up on Wine.  There's a very large selection of Wine and most importantly, they have a great selection of Wine that's $5.99 or less....and the cheap Wine doesn't taste like 2 Buck Chuck either....it's great table Wine for everyday drinking.  I've bought over 300 bottles of Wine less than $5.99 at this place and have never thrown out a single bottle...that's a pretty good track record.

They also have a nice selection of Beer and Spirits....although, I have to admit, this place is not always top of mind when I'm shopping for those type of alcoholic drinks.

The staff here is very friendly and I enjoy browsing the employee selections, which are featured Wines the employees select.

I'll definitely be back.

Return Factor - 100%Total Wine & More has just won the Laz C "best liquor store" in 2013 award and have a strong hunch it will repeat in 2014!  In all seriousness, as previous Yelpers have stated that walking into this store will cause you to go into a childlike state.  It is to much to take in at once.  You boast about the selection of your grocery store, they have no chance with the huge inventory Total Wine has.  The prices here are LOW!  In some cases better than the club stores.  The carry the gift sets for the holidays too.  I like the special edition beers during the holidays that I gift.  This is the perfect store to buy most adults their gifts.  You can't go wrong with all the mini liquor bottles for stocking stuffers or a gift-card.  I'll take one if you're buying! : )Kanpai..we meet again. .

I remember when Kanpai first opened. It was introduced to me by a friend knowing the owner of it.  At the time she was the owner of Sushiya and then she opened Kanpai.  Not sure about now though.  

So being recommend by a friend and big lover of Japanese food...again I mentioned...went along...location wise its quite hidden away...and I walked in..wow..so much bigger compare to Sushiya....sat down ...immediately opened the menu ...

Tokyo roll, softshell crab roll, tempura roll, rainbow roll and dragon roll. Oh and california roll. 

All excellent.  Not one problem I had with their maki. I was guessing maybe their tempura roll might not be so good? Coz its extremely tricky to get the batter right for tempura.  And it was excellent. 

Was very disappointed when they told me they dont serve ramen or udon or even hot food...which really confused me...coz u need hot oil to fry tempura no? And..I can order teriyaki beef thats hot no? Anyway she said if I want ramen I can try sushiya...there was a long awkward pause there...

So I went for the teriyaki beef which came in stunning presentation.  Beef sitting on a candle lit...burner thing...the portion was small compare to the price. First thing got to me was...is that a real leaf??? Wont it be burnt sitting on top of the tea light. ...but my friend sitting opposite me reassured me saying "of course it won't!! They must have tried this many times don't be stupid must be some kind of fire safe leaf looking thing....blah blah" so I thought. .mm..ok..he must be right.   But guess what..the leaf did burn....and we were embarrassingly stuffing our mouth and plate with beef so they could remove the burning leaf...in fact...I put some water on it...it was not a big massive flame but yep...not the special kind of waterproof leaf atall..

Overall the food was excellent, service was good too the waitress was so apologetic but hey they just opened back then...I believe they must be doing so well now coz they got high ratings..the place was very clean...definitely somewhere good to take your friends family or business.Express is currently offering 20% off already reduced items offering a 60% sale to clear summer items for fall.rocky road, yum!! I am not vegan, not vegetarian, (considering...) this place helps put a check in the pro's of being vegan for my debate.  It would help ease the pain of not having ice cream, because it was very very good.While you can find some of my favorites added to my post for Green I just tried an affogoto and I am hooked. I LOVE straight espresso so found myself eating spoon fulls of it straight but by the time i got to the bottom of my cup all that was left was tons of syrup. Next time I'll mix it all up and make myself a vegan flurry for sure. 

My friend Mariah works in here, if you see her or any of the staff you'll be greeted with a smile and the owners the man too. 

Definitely come in here for some vegan deliciousness but be ready for the post soy gas as well. 

Suggestions include peanutbutter chocolate bars, peanut butter frosted banana muffins, tsoynamis, and as stated above AFFOGOTOS! 

Oh one more tip, if you like chai get their desert haboob ;)I haven't been to Timo in a few months, so I was excited to come back for our twin mom's night out. When we got there, they already had our table set up.  I am usually the first one, hey, I need a drink, but this time there were a few other moms already there.  We ended up having a table for 15.  Our server, Alexis was very nice and efficient.  I shared a couple of things with one of my friends.  Timo offers a great deal on Mondays, a bottle of wine and flatbread pizza for $19, an incredible deal.  I had to share the bottle, as much as I like my wine, I can't drink a whole bottle by myself.  I had a carb overload night, it was delicious.  I had not had carbs in about 4 weeks, so I could feel the bloat before finishing my last bite, but it was so worth it.  One of my friends had a delicious cocktail made with pineapple infused vodka, muddled mint and lavender.  It was very refreshing.  Last time I was there, the menu was a lot smaller, I am happy to see a great variety and food looked delicious.  I can't wait to come back.This is really more of a 3.5 star place than 4 but I'm feeling generous today. I love the drive up Central to this place as the homes remind me of where I grew up so it pushed it to the 4.

I've been to Timo twice now, once for lunch inside during the week with a girlfriend and most recently, with my fiance for dinner on the patio. I do remember thinking the place was really cute inside and I really enjoyed the patio at dinner, though it was a bit chilly the night we went and were never offered a heater. I didn't encounter flies on the patio as another yelper mentioned but I did have a tree just over head that was shedding it's needle shaped leaves that were all over our table and chairs when we arrived. The hostess never offered to sweep them off and just placed the menu's over them so we had to clear them off ourselves. Luckily none ended up in our food, at least not that I noticed or tasted :) 

We both ordered the butternut squash soup and I thought it was delicious! I even ate what my fiance couldn't because I thought it was so good. I opted for the oven-roasted chicken salad, which was good once I added another dressing option to give it more flavor and my fiance got the spicy salami pizza. His pizza was definitely spicy though because his nose was running and he was sweating but he said he enjoyed it! 

Service was pretty slow all night but that was okay since we weren't in any hurry and we had a mix of waiters throughout the evening. All in all, this place is cute and has pretty good food and I like the firepit on the patio. It would a good place to grab a few drinks and relax for an our or two even if you didn't want to eat.Great food.  Great service.  Will come again  when I'm in townThis was good Thai food, but pretty greasy compared to other Thai places I've been to. I recommend the Tom Yum Soup.Service was quick, drink was always kept filled without having to ask.  The fresh wasabi that came with the sashimi is a great plus.  The baked mussel appetizer was very good, it wasn't smothered in faux crab like a lot of other places.  Place that we will definitely be returning to and recommending to others.I went with some of my classmates. They were pretty nervous about nigerian food, but the great reviews sold them. So we headed over there on our lunch break. We were pleasantly surprised. It was pretty awesome.

The owner was so friendly and nice. She really took care of us and seemed genuine. 

I checked in and got a drink for 3 dollars. Let me tell you, this drink was amazing. It was fruity and full of alcohol, but you didnt realize how much alcohol (thats the best kind!) I loved it. I wish I could have had more, but I would have to be carried out.

The food was so good. My friends ordered dishes like the yassa chicken and jerk chicken. One friend ordered pepper soup and did not know tripe was in it. She tried to eat it, but could not get past it, so be warned! We also had the Puff Puff. Order those. They are amazing. Oh soo yummy.

I didn't rate 5 stars because of the lack of vegetarian options. She had to mix something up for me. I wish there was a vegetarian soup or entree on the menu. It would have made the experience great for me.Great food, with massive portions.  Fair prices.I came here last night with John C to grab a bite to eat after he was telling me about this place.  It's a newer restaurant, and even though I've seen it a few times, finally stopped in here tonight.

The menu is huge, with a selection for everyone.  They have quite a few vegetarian dishes, along with meat, fish and chicken.  This place gets everything locally grown, and has mostly organtic, locally grown foods.  Place is well decorated and you seat yourself when you walk in.

John did most of the ordering.  I stuck with the falafel, and I really enjoyed it.  John ordered vegan spinach dip, hummus and veggie pizza.  Everything came out fine, but the veggie pizza had way to much broccoli on it.  I'm not a fan of broccoli, so I picked off the few pieces that we split between us.

The only downside was that the service here was a bit slow.  Took us a while to place our order, but overall, I will say that its probably because their new.  I would come back, but will probably try a few of their meat dishes next time I'm here.  They serve a lot of different dishes, so I can see myself trying a few different things upon returning!Super friendly place with very attractive servers. A big dance floor, VERY tasty mojitos. My husband had the chile verde margarita and found it delicious-- not overwhelming with the spiciness, and just the right amount of sweet. We would definitely go again with a group of friends-- it seems like this place will pick up in the "after 10 PM" hours.Great gyro! We will definitely return for the flavor and friendly service!Great staff and of course the coffee is always the sameFood was pretty good. Had the carnitas tacos. I forgot to say no cilantro, so I didn't like it too much. But the parts that didn't have cilantro was really good.We went for the first time for their lunch special. I go the the stores next door often and always smell something good coming from this place. 

There were only a few people in the restaurant as it had just opened. We were seated right away and our server was very friendly and polite. 

We got the lunch special that was actually a really good deal! This place doesn't do AYCE and most of the places we go to do. The special included 3 pieces of sashimi (chef's choice) 3 piece nigiri, and a roll for around $15. The quality of the sushi was excellent. Everything tasted fresh. I can't remember the name of the roll I got, but it had a mango salsa on top. It paired really well!

I want to come back to this place for more sushi and to try the hibachi! Definitely recommend it!Great place for tempe market! the food menu just changed so trying to figure out the 100 diffrent options buuuuuuuuuuuut! love the place. parking on busy night can be pain but great staff and the TV's to watch a game are huge!Love this place! I go here after my workouts to "treat" myself. Their pizzas are all amazing, each 10"s and each low in cals (250-300ish). Also try their tofu fries! Very tasty and also super low in calories. If you're trying to watch your waist but still crave some comfort type foods (and more), this place is the place to go!

(Also gluten free, vegetarian/vegan/raw friendly - major plus!)I was there with a group. I was a little disappointed with the small selection of meats brought out and how they did not service each table equally. Then they cycled us through to desert and seemed annoyed when I was not done eating and requesting more meat. Even if it was a group thing, it is still an all you can eat meat house! Unfortunately I have eaten at other Brazilian meat restaurants in town and have had much better selections and service. I still gave 4 stars for taste.This boils down to a pretty simple review. If you're a fan of Hot n Juicy Crawfish, you'll be a fan of Boiling Crab. The premise is exactly the same--you order seafood in 1-pound increments, you choose a sauce type and spice level, it comes out in a plastic bag, and you go to town. The sauces are named differently, but just like HnJ, I go for the one that mixes everything together i.e. "The Whole Sha-Bang."

If there's one thing BC has over HnJ, it's that the space is much more, well, spacious. You could probably fit more people in BC than both Vegas HnJ locations combined. Also, it's a minor thing, but I like the napkin dispensers at BC better than HnJ--when your digits are covered in sauce, it's much easier to grab a napkin at BC.

One weird thing about BC? They charge 25c for a cup of water.First time here and it was definitely a treat. Went on a Monday night an hour before they closed and the service was wonderful. They didn't mind at all. The food was just as good as the service. I recommend you come early because if you want the king crab and the blue crab. Those sell out quick. The crawfish and snow crab were delicious. Only thing I didn't enjoy as much was the corn. It was overcooked. The flavoring was on point but it felt like I was eating baby food. I will definitely come back again to try that king crab; when my wallet recovers from the hit it took last night.I prefer the food at Hot N Juicy, but the atmosphere/interior of the Boiling Crab is tops (at least compared to the original HNJ location, I haven't been to their new location yet).

The shrimp (about $10 a pound) was large. They still had their heads on, which can make for a memorable experience. I ripped one off and all the brains and extra stuff exploded all over me. Luckily I had their plastic bib on. The king crabs were excellent (roughly $25 per pound). It's tough to ever be disappointed with king crabs as long as their not overcooked. We got the whole sha-bang with both. That's a mixture of all their seasonings -- rajun cajun, lemon pepper, and garlic pepper. I loved how they had chunks of garlic in there. It made for a great dipping sauce. We also got corn and potatoes. Dip that stuff in the sauce and cover in garlic and you'll be in heaven.

The place is huge. Plenty of tables, chairs and booths and TVs everywhere. It's a great place to watch football or just hang out with a group. They get extra points for having HD, unlike HNJ, where the reception was nothing but static.Very good food. Had the Iskender Doner which was really good but the best dish I had was accident. My wife ordered a vegetarian dish that they did not have enough of so they added some Pirasa with it. Wow. Amazing stuff.Delicious food as usual, loved the coffee shake, and the staff here actually seemed even more perky and helpful than what I have become used to at SmashBurger.  
This was the first time I tried their regular fries, and they honestly weren't as good as their featured fries, so I guess the moral of that story is, if something is featured as a specialty, you should stick with it.  ;)
Good stuff.The Tahitian Vanilla shakes are divine on all levels, the burgers are decadent and the Nom Nom's are Yum Yum! :)So I yelped the place I had a feeling that it was gonna be horrible. So I didn't really expect much, actually I was having second thoughts of even eating here. But don't let the reviews fool you, it's not that bad.

I ordered the BBQ burger with sweet potato fries and a strawberry milkshake. I wasn't going to make my order a combo but I really wanted a milkshake so they told me that I could just make my burger a combo and makes my drink a milkshake and the fries were basically free, so why not. Okay, SO I really did love the burger but the downside is that it wasn't as big as I thought it would be for what $6 bucks? And the fries weren't huge or anything it was just a little serving, keep in mind that a side of fries are 2.50. Their sweet potato fries weren't the best, they added cinnamon or something to them and it made them taste kind of weird, yeah not a fan. The best part was seriously the milkshake!! I absolutely love strawberry and when it came it was topped with marshmallows, I LOVE MARSHMALLOWS!! My boyfriend got The Inferno burger which I took a bite of and it was amazing! I liked it better than mine actually. It was a perfect spicy burger. If you like jalapeños, go for the Inferno. He got the natural cut fries which were awesome, perfect crunch!

The place isn't as bad as I thought it would be. But I'd like it better if it was a sit down restaurant, because the prices are more of a sit down restaurant. It's not a cheap place to get food, it's not fast food. But overall, the taste of the place is awesome.Super happy to have a sushi place in the neighborhood! I've been there once and 
Livingsocial has a deal right now which I couldn't resist. 

Check it out - you pay $10 for $20 worth of food: http://t.livingsocial.com/deals/235346?ref=email-jp&rpi=47072500

Needless to say, I bought it and will be back to try out some other rolls.

Atmosphere is nice and customer service was excellent. Will def be back :I love the quirky collection of unusual jewelry and garments that are offered here and service was quite warm and friendly.  I had luck finding a necklace that from a distance looked like a delicate antique brooch but up close was actually a skeleton.  For some reason that combo just struck me as funny and I enjoy wearing it.Loved this airline.. Not the biggest fan anymore. Although they are so so so friendly. Their seats are so comfortable. Our seats wouldn't stay reclined back, kept raising back up. Not a fun flight. the food, use to be tastier.. it was chicken teriyaki! How can you go wrong with that!!! i was dry and the sauce. eh. but its airline food, how good can it be? that was on our return flight from honolulu to las vegas. The wait line was ridiculous on our was from las vegas to Honolulu.. good thing we got there 2 hours prior, they had many issues with getting guests checked in. but we were eventually on our way. they did apologize and thank us for our patience. Although on the flight to honolulu no meal was served , maybe cuz it was a red eye?The service is the only thing keeping me from leaving a 5 star review as far as the food and ambiance of the restaurant were top shelf I will eat here againAwesome food as usual... Our server seemed to be a little over whelmed..Their Taro Snow Ice and Chi Pai Fan is to die for. Awesome.

Tried their famous STEAK...but nah! didn't it so much...May be it's just me!

Service: Not so good. Considering they are a small set up, they should have been a little more attentive towards tables.

Good thing is they are open pretty late and anytime i crave for good dessert, i know where to go!This is one of my favorite places to eat downtown during school. Their salads are huge and super affordable. One with chicken is only $7. They also make smoothies that are all fruit for $5. The people that work there are super friendly and are always quick to give you their recommendations. It's in a great location and is very accessible for students. Because of that and the great food and prices, I will definitely be coming back here often during the semester.Came with Angela H. for some sista time. 

We started off with a burrata caprese. I love that slightly boogery cheese and theirs is good. Plus that the tomatoes are small cherry tomatoes that have been roasted. 

For pizza, we got half the Big Apple. You can get either NY style thin round or a square which is a bit thicker like a pan pizza (not quite as thick as deepdish). We got the square and it was a crispy delicious crust. I love that the meats had a light sear but that the sausage slices got crispy good. My problem with most thicker pizzas is not enough sauce and their ratio was ideal and the marinara is solid. I'm a sucker for fresh basil and I love that they put ribbons of that on top. 

Service was constant, but unobtrusive. We were checked on, drinks filled and boxes and check didn't need to be asked for, but given when we looked done. 

I didn't know about this place and it was super delicious pizza. Definitely a contender for some of the best za in town. I didn't realize this place was affiliated with Di Fara's pizza which is pretty good stuff I've made the trek to Brooklyn for once. 

Can't wait to bring the BF here. I've been thinking about the pizza and that doesn't happen very often to me.I've here a number of times with friends originally from Brooklyn. We all greatly enjoyed the pizza. My favorite is their "special" square pizza.Dom De Marco's is easily the best pizza on the west side of Las Vegas. I have not had a bad meal from here. the salads are so fresh and tasty. The pizza is out of this world good. They have a great patio and they allow you to bring your dog. Woo Hoo- there aren't many places in town that allow people to bring their animals. This is a huge plus for me. They also have ice cold beer which is awesome on a hot Vegas day.

Also-- I had a little incident with the hostess. The manager came right out and apologized for the hostess.The family really likes this place. Service is consistent and the food delicious. My only complaint is i think there marinara is a little spicy. However i am the only one in the family feels this way.YUM! Great food at a good price. The place does really well mixing up the food choices.  I eat at the one in Desert Ridge and the Biltmore and the food is consistent and great!!I will premise this review by noting that there were only 2 other people in the place when I arrived.  And that is the only reason that I did not give it 5 stars, becasue I would like to see how everything is when they are busier.

With that said, I ordered the Ultimate Grilled Cheese and an Iced Tea.  The bartender talked me into adding ham to the sandwich, and informed me that this sandwich came with a cup of Tomato Bisque Soup.

Ordered placed and in about 7 minutes my food arrived.

The Tomato Bisque Soup was out of this world, I could have eaten just that for a meal.  But, I didn't, and I'm glad I didn't, the Ultimate Grilled Cheese with Ham was also very, very good.  I would say that I will definitely order this again, but I can't say that because the rest of the menu has me wanting to try other items.

Overall, this was a great experience . . . and . . . I will definately be returning.It was the 3rd meet up for The Breakfast Club UYE this year, and had a good turn out! The placed picked this time was Breakfast Club downtown Phoenix at CityScape, now prior to the meet up I did call the Breakfast Club to let them know that we had a party of 10 to 15 coming in the morning on Sat, and the manager said no problem, we can put some tables together but it will work, so I said great, thank you and see ya on Sat!  Sat morning came and I checked in at the hostess told her that we are here and she said oh, I didn't know anything about you guys coming, if you don't mind waiting I have a table I can sit you at when the existing party leaves, said no problem and we waited.  

We sat at a table that was sort of inside and outside, and it was a beautiful Sat morning for Phoenix, when we were waiting for the table, we passed around a menu so I already knew what I wanted. Everyone placed their orders and conversation was flowing and it was just a really good vibe.  The hostess and our server were very friendly and nice, love places that have great service, it makes you want to come back more.

Oh then the food started coming out, let me tell you, everything everyone ordered looked amazing! There were big blueberry pancakes, breakfast grilled cheese sandwich, turkey bene, huevos rancheros, breakfast burritos and more! I was pretty set on what I had ordered and when those plates starting coming out, I was drooling, it was cool seeing the menu in full color, every plate was beautifully prepared and vibrant in color.

My son ordered the breakfast burrito and a bowl of yogurt with berries, he said the yogurt was amazing, and he loved his breakfast burrito, he was stuffed and couldn't stop eating it, but he did and took half of it home and ate it for breakfast the next day. 

I ordered chocolate chip pancakes, you can take me to a grown up place but I will still get me the chocolate chip pancakes haha. Also ordered a side of the potatoes Obrien, the pancakes were perfectly sweet and tasty! The syrup was in a glass bottle, like for olive oil, I thought man that's pretty sweet idea. On the potatoes Obrien I was just expecting potatoes with peppers, but what I got was so much better, huge home-style potatoes and nice slices of fresh peppers & onions!  My breakfast was delish baby!

It was a great breakfast club uye, look forward to the next one!The good:

-The steak swarma is packed with flavor and is cut to a very generous portion. 
-The babaganoush is smokey and overflowing with rich characteristics.
-The salad is a mix of dark greens, chickpeas, tomatoes, purple cabbage, cucumbers and pickled carrot sticks.

The bad:
-The falafels and salad are heavy on the oil. The fried chickpea patties tend to absorb too much of the frying oil. The taste was magnificent though. I like that they serve it with hummus for dipping. The salad needed more acid instead of base.
-Peanuts are used in the baklava and overpowers the walnuts. Instead of pistachios, Parsley uses peanuts and that is all you can taste. Honey is not a big component of the dessert and it comes out kind of dry. It just reminds me of the peanut toffees you get at the Asian markets.

I was amazed that I ordered everything for less than $18. I ended up taking so much of it home. With a few customized request, I could see myself loving Parsley.My co-workers and I go here 1-2 times a week.  The food is good and the lunch specials are even better.  For 6.99 you can get any sandwich on the menu and a soda.  We always substitute the fries for a salad and the house Italian dressing is quite tasty.

Four stars because the service and food delivery is fairly slow and they always over toast the bread so ask for them to either lightly toast or not at all!We got a really great rate on a room at Fraser Suites on Hotels.com for our 3-night stay in Edinburgh. We chose this hotel for a variety of reasons, but most importantly, its location. Located along the famous Royal Mile, it's in the heart of Old Town--and perfectly situated for taking a walk across the bridge to New Town. 

It was a wee bit difficult to find when we arrived at 12:30am into nearby Waverly Station.  We came across a couple of chaps who were fresh out of the bar--they desperately wanted to help us find the hotel, but were unable to offer much assistance (even though we had a map, and one of the blokes has lived in Edinburgh his whole life), but it was a friendly, character-filled introduction to the city. So, we continued on until we saw the beautiful St. Giles Cathedral lit up spectacularly in front of us--the hotel was just a stone's throw away. 

We had notified the hotel of our post-midnight arrival, so there was no hassle in getting checked in at such a late hour. Upon entering our room, we were delighted by the abundance of space and amenities. Fraser Suites has done a great job of blending the historical character of Edinburgh with 21st century technology. The darkwood wardrobe closet was HUGE, the draperies majestic, and the loveseat adorable! We had a very modern kitchenette fully stocked with dishes, hot cocoa, coffee and shortbread--So, if you're planning on visiting Edinburgh for more than a few days, Fraser Suites would be a perfect place to stay if you want the ability to prepare some meals of your own. The bathroom had a rainfall shower, teek shower floor and a towel warmer (that I couldn't figure out how to use). There was broadband internet, but no wi-fi.

My complaints are few, but should be mentioned:
1. Our "executive suite" was supposed to have a separate bedroom (away from the living/work area), but instead was an open floorplan. It didn't end up being a big deal, but I would at least like to get what we paid for. 

2. Another feature listed in our room description was a "City View". Well, call me crazy, but I don't think a view of the backside of the building behind the hotel qualifies as a view of Edinburgh. Surely disappointing--we chose not to spend much time in our room, and ventured out for views of the city. 

3. Due to the open design of the shower area, and a flaw in design of the drainage system, I nearly flooded our bathroom when I took a shower! Perhaps our room just has a faulty drain due to a sagging wooden shower mat, but it was something I would've rather not been concerned with.

4. They have an airport shuttle, but it costs £20 (something we didn't find out until the morning of our departure, which caused some unnecessary stress as we rushed to an ATM), but perhaps we should've asked. Also, we had the shuttle reserved for a particular time, but it had apparently been somewhat double-booked. We waited over 30 minutes for the shuttle to arrive, leaving us to rush to the airport and nearly miss our flight to London.

Ok, so perhaps my list of complaints is a little longer than I thought. But all in all, it's a clean, comfortable hotel with beautiful interiors. I would stay here again, although next time, I will certainly look into other options in the area as well.this was a second stop on recent bike pub ride with Rage cycles. i like the new bar/restaurant layout. they have a very Dia de los muertos motif going on. it is bright and open, but intimate and not stuffy. 
there are flecked gold tables in the bar area and large wall with skull sculptures lining the shelves. the bar is replete with soft mood lighting, but there's an overall feel of swanky, 70's ish-ness to it. the white starkness is gone and this area is much more inviting and conducive to drinking!

our bartender was friendly and quick, important on a pub ride.Really enjoyed this place! Went for dinner, and everything was delicious. Sushi was fresh (I loved the Scottsdale roll), and there were a lot of seafood options. I especially enjoyed the Thai calamari, the walnut shrimp and dim sum. My companion had a ton of crab legs and oysters, both of which he said were very good. Large dessert selection, although we were so full that we didn't try anything. Service was very friendly, and I liked that they had people wandering around keeping the counters clean and checking the temperature of the food. I also thought the $20 price was very fair, considering the amount of crab legs, oysters, sushi, and shrimp that we ate. Buffets are sometimes scary to me, but this place was very clean and made me feel very comfortable. I will definitely be back!4 stars for what it is a Pan Asian Buffet - nothing more, nothing less.

Unfortunately, I have had my share of bad chinese buffets.  Even more unfortunate is that I typically overeat at them.  That is the risk of a buffet.

Here at Jasmine, the reward is worth the risk.

This place has several things going for it:

1. it is laid out nicely and has a warmer, less institutional feel to it.  I didn't feel dirty after having been there.
2.  There is a wide selection of items from many asian cuisines.  Kim Chi, sushi, dim sum, stir fry, twainese, thai, currie etc.  they are all represented.
3.  I thought the sushi was a nice mix of veggie only, fish, california rolls, even some hot rolls and tempura.  
4. Wide selection of dessert options (though I typically pass on those)
5. many nice cold dishes/ salads.
6. for quality and selection I found the price to be reasaonable.  Is it priced to compete with the $6.99 special down the street, no, but there are reasons to pay more.

I have been five times now and will make it a regular stop for my asian cuisine loving family.  

After five visits I have a new comment, curtesy of my brother's visit there with me recently.  There is no real taste challenge here.  Nothing that excites the taste buds.  everything is buffet safe.  Maybe this is a call to spice things up a bit.  Still four stars for what it is.My buddy Craig and I were in the mood for something hearty and saucy so we decided to give The Strand a try and boy were we happy we did. We had the Bucatini Polpetti and a Caesar salad. Although the portion sizes are enough to share, it didn't even cross our minds until after we had stuffed our faces. We had no problem devouring every last bite on our own. The pasta was cooked perfectly and the sauce was amazing; robust, spicy, and plentiful. The meatballs were great, too. The salad was definitely enough for two and we will split that in the future. 
The interior design and layout of the dinning area is very different, cool unlike any other place which is refreshing. The ordering process is very similar to Pei Wei but it works and was super easy. The owner was kind enough to stop by our "pod" and check in on us and was thrilled to share his design and dinning concept. He excitingly shared the story behind the commissioned panoramic photograph that takes up the majority of the north wall.  The lighting fixtures are also very cool, somewhat jellyfish like.  
We are looking forward to our next dinning adventure. The online menu has been printed, reviewed and circulated.If there's anything to be said about Jersey Mike's, it's that the food is always fresh, delicious, and just the right amount.  My go to is the #8.  Whatever you end up getting - turkey, ham, salami, (definitely try the prosciutto); the meat is light, fresh, tasty, and doesn't leave that heavy feeling in the pit of your stomach.  White/wheat bread for the base, and then get it Mike's Way! for all the fixin's and oil & vinegar.  Hits the spot everytime, and at $6-8 it ain't cheap as far as subs go, but Jersey Mike's definitely has its own niche in subs.We came to this restaurant for years as the San Lorenzo. It has had its ups and downs, the new menu is good - but most important, the service and the food are very good. Our waiter was Algis, probably the best waiter that we have ever met - anywhere, very professional, very cool! The food was good, right temperature, good taste. Dixie and I each had a chicken and pasta dish, the pasta was done right, flavorfull sauce. We had the salad, the new soups are not as good as they used to be. The bread sticks are warm and soft - but not like the breads that San Lorenzo had... they should bring back the old bread offerings.  Overall - nice! Thank You!Always friendly and quick service. Their bread is fantastic.We went twice while in Scottsdale on vacation, we loved it! We got to go on taco tuesday, got cheap margs and beer, and cheap tacos. We both tried 4 different tacos each, they were amazing. I loved that we were able to choose 1 of each, unlike many restos who only let you choose one type. The drinks were great also.

OH yeah, the Nachos!!! Those are the best we've ever tried, and a huge serving at a low cost.Referred by a friends glowing endorsement. I was impressed. Besides the unique atmosphere folks of all types fill the tables, booth and bar, moderate noise levels and a robust menu. It all makes for what appears to be a terrific gem just of old scottdales Fifth Avenue.   I sat check it out.Great happy hour food & drinks.  The bar staff was great as well. 

I typically hesitate to write a great review for most places because after I do, they become overcrowded and I can no longer enjoy them.  

But I will be back!I was so glad to find out that the food is delicious, reasonably priced, and interesting. The location is terrific for my wife and I, right across from East High (behind Milio's), so that was the only thing that could have kept this place from becoming our new favorite local cafe. Corona's Cafe in Florence will always be our #1 in the World. The breakfast sandwiches were ready quickly, tasted great- nice spice and terrific, local ingredients. Their pastries are really nice too, with a decent variety to choose from.
Check out www.facebook.com/semperpie for daily updates to the menu and space.I moved literally 2 doors away from 4&20 and my only complaint is that it closes too early (2 pm)!  I feel pretty lucky that a place with friendly staff and food that is fresh and simple yet unique!   I came here once before I moved to Madison and it was great then.  Today I had the squash, mozzarella, eggplant and arugula sandwich, a piece  berry pie and a chocolate chip cookie...yes, I am full!   My Dad, who is not a café/sandwich eater type had no idea what anything was on the menu......but he later told me that he had one of the best sandwiches of his life. Now that's a compliment!What a difference a night can make. I went on a Thursday and on a Friday both completely different experiences.  During the week it's low key, they had a live band and you have some elbow room.  I would say this is mostly 30-40 age, established professionals type of night. Such an amazing view of the water show and a very cool venue.  
Friday is everyone from under the sun!! They club has go go dancers, VIP area and there is a live dj.  Great dance music playing and will be crowded.  If you can get on the VIP list there will be no wait time in the line. I would try to either do that the night before.   Depending on what your mood is will determine which day during the week you will go.  
As all the other reviews have said, Hyde is a beautiful venue.I stopped by here this week. I'm glad I did.  I first ordered Al Pastor Torta.  Took me just a minute to woof it down.  I had to order Carne Asada Costra. Both dishes we're great, but the portions were small. Before I thought of ordering another dish, I just took my cheesecake flan to go.  I would definitely come here again, but when I'm not as hungryConfusing concept. But once we got our pomegranate ice cream I was in eternal bliss.This location is larger than their location to the north.  But the wait time can still be horrendous late mornings on the weekend. Still the food was still as good as the original location.  The red velvet pancakes still rocked and the breakfast burrito (an occasional special) was excellent.  Good stuff!The wait was plain ridiculous at the original location so we decided to go to this secondary location where I called ahead and there was no wait and close to other errands we were doing. I don't like this temporary new earlier schedule of ours. Having breakfast at breakfast time really sucks with the wait times and dampens the mood.

We had zippys chili omelette on the specials white board. It's pretty decent and a bit different. I never really thought about chili on eggs, but it makes sense. 

I did a make your own skillet - potatoes with your choice of toppings (1 meat, 2 veggies, 1 cheese) and you can add additional toppings to the base price. I did carnitas, peppers, onions, pepper jack cheese and asked for green sauce on the side. It was decent, but different from most skillets that seem cooked together, this is more thrown on top and put in the broiler to melt the cheese. 

We got our babystacks that come with our breakfast upgraded to their two new flavors on the white board. We did butterfinger which was rather nice and the butter finger pieces slightly melted were more peanutty in flavor and some parts crunchy. The creamsicle was decent, but I don't know if I'm just not a fan of orange flavored baked goods. 

Service was alright. It took a while for someone to come see us and order but once we did food came out pretty quickly . Server and host were both friendly. 

Yep. Same consistency of food as the original which is good. Sometimes it doesn't happen that way with new locations. Same food with possibly less of a wait!The staff was friendly, quickly seated. I got the baby chick skillet, it is an ideal comfort type food, it was good. I stayed full all day. If you love breakfast this is the place to go to.We went to this place for the first time last night.  It was very good.  We had the stone pot rice thingie and seafood pancake.  They have ayce BBQ you cook yourself but we didn't think we could do it justice.  The servers were kinda "hands off" but that's okay sometimes.  The place is pretty modern decor and very clean so the service issue was whatever.  It is open til 2 am which is good cause we never decide on dinner til everything is usually closed.We had a wonderful dinner at Cask 63 last night. Our waiter, Daniel, was a real pro and extremely accommodating. The Sea bass, Ahi tuna and Lamb chops were phenomenal, as was the Key lime cheesecake.This club is awesome! Hands down the best service I've ever received at a club. We had a comped bottle and table for one of my girlfriend's birthday.. We didn't have to wait in line at all and the cocktail servers were so sweet and nice! They never let your glass go empty and they were always somewhere close by. Even the porters were on their A Game constantly refilling everything!!! 

The bad thing about this place is that it's kind of small and we actually had to share our table area with another group of people we didn't know.. But their service is on point!!! Good job 1Oak~ 

Another annoying thing was that there were promoters EVERYWHERE! We we were probably asked by 20 different promoters while walking to the venue inside the Mirage and I am not over exaggerating even in the restroom some promoter chick stayed posted asking ladies if they were going to the club tonight.. Weird!!!Definitely in my top 2 of favorite dim sum list. This is located near the Carnival World Buffet inside Rio so take that into consideration when parking. We ended up parking on the opposite end. It's busy here but we only waited 10 minutes to get a table (on a  weekend). This has got to be nicest, fanciest and cleanest dim sum restaurant I've been to.

There were carts that would pass by every 5 minutes. I didn't see my favorite dim sum items though like the roast pork and deep-fried minced pork/beef dumplings. We were there for at least an hour so, I doubt we missed it.

We got har gow, siumai, chicken feet (I don't eat feet of any animal), roast duck, shrimp wontons, baked cha siu bao, steamed cha siu bao (BBQ pork buns), crispy shrimp roll, salt and pepper shrimps, egg custard, shrimp balls, calamari and sweet tofu. My favorites were: roast duck, shrimp balls and sweet tofu - they have the best version of these dishes in town. I've had sweet tofu that has a strong ginger flavor...KJ's version is just right.

Gimme sum dim sum!Came here for the weekend because everyone said that it was really good. And they have really good dim sum........

So for everyone to know, they serve Dim Sum from 10:00 AM to 3:00 PM. When you walk in its totally like an asian feel. There are many tables and the space is huge!! Great for large parties! They do have a better variety of dim sum and siomai than Orchid Gardens. But I honestly like Orchid Garden better, and the food really tasted the same. We ordered the pork and shrimp siomai, shrimp chow mein, egg flour soup, chinese broccoli, shrimp dumpling. Everything was fresh don't get me wrong and it was really good, but i just rather prefer Orchid Garden. In my opinion.

Menu was really pricey, if you were to order soup it was like $20. but i guess that's what you pay for when you're on the strip. If you're visiting and you're near the Rio then yes try out this place. But if you're a local don't waste your money and time driving here.One time I waited over 3 hours to eat at the Pizzeria Bianco downtown....well, thank god those days are over. This new location is nice because there isn't usually a wait and they have the same menu as the other location....plus it's right by my yoga studio (cuz after yoga, I need some pizza...duh!). I went with my mom and we shared their super simple salad, which was good, but plain with just a light vinaigrette, and we had a half bianco verde half rosa pizza. The pizza was soooo good. Better than I remember from the other location (the lack of the wait time may have helped too). I like that these pizzas are very different than others in Phoenix....local pistachios on a pizza? Come on! Is it the best pizza in town? No...but it's definitely worth a try!


PS this may sound really dumb, but I had some leftovers and later that night I popped them in the micro in the plastic container and the container melted to the pizza...I was pretty devastated, so don't be dumb like me....safety first, use a plate :-PThis is a good place for a quick, healthy lunch. The sandwiches and salads are tasty and the coffee and desserts are good as well. Just keep in mind, it gets pretty crowded at lunch so parking may be crowded and there's almost always a line, but they do a good job of getting to you quickly. While its not a place for a long, quiet conversation, it does its job.Great place to watch the games, food is average to better than,  and the girls are hard working, and good looking.  Don't expect anything more an you'll have a good time.Super friendly staff who make themselves available but are not annoying hoverers.  Tried a couple different items today: chicken fried steak and eggs breakfast and then the Mexican dog.I just went here on a whim and was not disappointed, they have great service, the food was good, and the prices great. I was surprised to see sushi available but it was still pretty good. If your looking for healthy stuff,they have that too.Go to Mexico, Baja Coast, even further south - and these are the types of Taquerias you will find.  Order at the counter, enjoy chips and salsa while you wait, then enjoy street tacos the likes of which you think you can only get south of the border.

(The building is yellow on the outside, still bearing its former name - so don't be confused.)

The price of a  street tacos here? $1.25.  For that price, try all of them, especially the Al Pastor.  This type of taco is unique in its preparation.  Typically pork meat, it is marinated - giving the meat an orange color - and then roasted on a spit.  Similar to the way gyro meat is carved off a spit.  The result is an incredibly flavorful meat taco.  They add cilantro and a little pico de gallo, a squirt of lime and a dash of picante sauce, and it's pure heaven.

On Tuesdays its Taco Tuesday - $.99, with coke only $1.25.

If you are not a taco fan, the menu features Tortas ($3.75-4.25), burritos enchilada style ($4.50), Beam burritos ($2.50) Carnitas burritos ($3.75), Fried fish ($12), Shrimp Cocktail ($9.95), Camarones Ahogados (shrimp $9.95), Tamales combo ($5.95), and Huevos con chorizo ($4.95).

Live music on weekends, as Taqueria has a separate bar area for dancing the night away.They just opened and this was my 2nd visit!

LOVE the donuts, fresh even at 3:00 in the afternoon. Wonderful variety of donuts including smoothies, hot coffee, and bagels!

Staff has to be the friendliest I have seen in awhile. 

Shop is not fancy but very clean. My oldest daughter even checked out the bathroom this afternoon and I have been told "very nice Mom!"

If you haven't come in to try them, you should!Chinese food is legit here. 
You know how? 
If mom says the rice is good, then that means they know what they are doing here! It's all about the rice. 

What we had on separate occasions:
-Roast Duck and Roast Pork combo plate - I really liked the roast pork because it was basically roasted pork belly, sliced thin with crispy skin. The duck was meaty and tasty, but we did get some pieces that were not meaty. I guess, they all can't be meaty. 
-Green beans and scallops with XO sauce - the flavors were good but I would need to ask for it to be spicier next time. 
-Salt and Pepper Pork - I did not enjoy this because I found that most of the pieces were mainly fat. About 50% meat and 50% fat. 
-Stone Crab porridge - this is not on the menu and you need to talk to the server about their specialties. I think they may have just made this up? It was incredible because I got to eat the yummies in the shell! 

There is also a pre-prepared food counter if you need to pick up Chinese BBQ and food, fast. 

I would definitely come back, for some more roasted pork and crab.Crowded on the Saturday we went and sometimes felt rushed. Parking is $3 for lot or meter on the street. LOTS to read and look at...very interactive.  If you're going to go, make sure the kids are older (lots of graphic stuff around) and ready for a long stay.  There's so much to read and experience, we'll probably have to make a second trip.It was super busy when we got there, but we were seated quickly and the service was pretty good. Granted, we went on a Sunday morning, so I shouldn't have been surprised at how busy it was. The food was great and the poinsettia (drink) was awesome. Overall, it was a good experience and I would definitely go back there in the future.On a weekend trip to vegas. On the way to a night club on Easter my 2006 300c srt-8 Died on me late at night. Long story short it was my alternator. After checking yelp I came to this place. They had great customer service unlike others I had called on yelp. They were the closes to where i was staying at trump international. The reviews on yelp were great so i made an appointment. The prices were lower then some and on average with others. I arrive and they advice me the part is on the way as we speak. They have fresh cookies water soda ice creme tea and coffee for free while you wait with a 47 in flat screen tv. Making waiting in the waiting room not such a bad idea. I would totally recommend them to any one in vegas or going to vegas that needs to get something repaired pretty quick.I came here to take my friend's dog to see the vet. Banfield is the company that does exams and pet care. We came in a little early to fill out all the paper work and it did not take too long before the nurse came in to do the initial check up. When she finished, the doctor came in to administer the shots. Before we knew it, the work was done and we were out the door. 

The staff were helpful and quick to assist.You can't compare Monta and Sora. They are two different beasts.

Me? I'm a Sora fan. I love getting the chasu ramen with miso broth and extra noodles. The Sapporo style ramen noodle is slightly thick, curly and complements the fatty broth well. Since the noodles are slightly curly more of the broth coats the noodle. This makes for a fun splurpfest. 

If you come on a weeknight or after 6:40pm, be prepared to wait 20 minutes.The best fried chicken in town seems to be KFC...Kathy's Fried Chicken, that is, of Kathy's Southern Cooking.  The fried chicken dinner is $11.75 and gets you three pieces of chicken, corn bread, and two sides.  Sides were decent, corn bread was good, but the chicken absolutely steals the show.

Service is casual but super friendly.  Food is made fresh to order, so be prepared for a bit of a wait; our party of eight was there for 2-3 hours.  For fried chicken!  It's so worth it though.  The breading is not too heavy, is cooked to that perfect golden brown, spiced just right, and encapsulates a perfectly cooked, juicy piece of chicken.  My friends are now no longer allowed to recommend fried chicken to me, unless they've tried Kathy's.I get a color every two weeks.  Tommy does a phenomenal job!  What a professional, courteous young man!I ate so much here I hurt myself. I also forgot what I ordered (besides a few al pastor 'cos), so I can't really go into too much detail here, but what I do know is that what I had was pretty darn delicious. My bud and I grabbed 5 tacos, 4 special 'cos with extra toppings and two drinks, with our will coming out to around $20. There are some die-hards out there who refuse to pay more than $1 for a street taco, but I'm not that guy and think that 2 hungry (tipsy) dudes who can eat themselves sick for around $10 is a darn good deal. Parking is a b*tch here, but there's this amazing attendant who will walk you through squeezing in and out of a spot. If you're looking for some delicious cheap eats downtown, make the trip here! 

Warning: you might be mesmerized by the al pastor spit. Mmmm spit...I love coming to Postinos.  The food is always good and I like the ambiance of the restaurant. We got the hummus & artichoke platter and a plate of the Bruschetta. The only thing I did not like about our visit tonight was that the hostess forgot to put us on the list and all these people who came in after us were getting seated before us. We were sitting right in front of her and she still forgot to put us on the list. when I finally asked why everyone was getting seated before us she said she thought she put us on the list. So that part was irritating and it made us almost walk out. Beside that , the food tasted delicious.Ok their food and prices are GREAT. Their fish is very fresh. I love their natto hand rolls but they really need to work on their speed.  Even for simple orders, they are quite slow and that is a big problem with this place.  If they get the slightest bit busy, you can easily wait 10 min for 1 item.  I have no problem going back here, but only during slow times or late at night when it's not busy.Eating here is great, service was okay except not enough staff for such a small place. Sushi was excellent, but only 1 carpaccio per person. And if you get a freebie you have to pay taxes on it so technically not free."This gas station is a true 5-star experience!" ...said no one ever. 

This place gets one star each for the following: 
- Convenience
- Cleanliness
- Safety
- Price

If you want to get more expensive gas, you are more than welcome to venture near the Strip and fill up with the rest of the state of California. If you want to get cheaper gas, you are also welcome to shimmy on over to the sheisty part of town. Godspeed.Really good Reuben! The best I've had in a long time. Was not expecting something that good from this little place- Ideal location (next to Bellagio, Paris, Miracle Mile Shops...),
- Very comfortable rooms (stands comparison with high-end hotels on the strip),
- Calm atmosphere (there is no onsite casino),
- Proper service,
- Good prices. My average nightly fee was $159+tax for a 4-night stay and that was during the very busy week of spring break/march madness.
I can only recommend a stay at the Elara. The place is still in a transitional phase from being the flagship Westgate timeshare property to a Hilton Grand Vacations, the current decoration doesn't mirror that of traditional Hilton properties, but it's no big deal, the Elara is a great value.

I can't put 5* however for the following reasons:
1) Check-out time is 10:00am with no extension possible ... this is Vegas, what a sadistic rule!
2) The water is strange, a bit creamy; You get like an all-in-one shower and body lotion with a 'can't-wash-it-off' feel. Now, I know that this is Vegas and I should be grateful that water is freely available, so I wouldn't complain if it was not for the fact that YOU CAN'T DRINK THE TAP WATER AND THEY DON'T PROVIDE BOTTLED WATER IN THE ROOM, whether for free or for purchase, there is no mini-bar. Being able to drink something in the room is a base need of a hotel customer. 

One more thing about water. Why would a hotel room that sleeps two and with no stove need a family-size dishwasher? Well, we used two cups to drink our coffees in the morning and placed them in the sink. When we came back to the room the dishwasher was on!! It's a shame, hotel management needs to educate cleaning personnel to water conservation! I almost gave 1* to this review because of that, but angry reviews are not helpful ones. I hope the hotel management is reading that.I enjoyed the burgers here quite a bit. I wasn't really feeling the fries. They had a funny aftertaste. Probably from the oil they cook them in. The burger was moist and flavorful and the service was really friendly and efficient. I'd come back.Employees are nice but some of them can be rude. The Semi-Annual sale was not that big here which I was disappointed about. Store is a pretty good size but I wish they had more cash registers since lines can be long here. The dressing rooms are hidden which is weird and almost makes you think like they don't have any dressing rooms.I'd been looking for a new dinner spot to fill the void left by local breeze and I've almost found it. I only say "almost" because they don't have a weekend brunch (yet?).  The pizza is delicious and the outdoor seating on Central is a nice touch.Wings were pretty yummy. I got seasoned wings and my boyfriend got ranch wings. They were both very well seasoned and not saucy which I loved. French fries were good and large big enough to share. Only downside is the seasoned wings were very greasy...but we will be back.I've been looking for an alternative to Danny's since my last visits were lack luster, my kids do a better job.  I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of service.  Actually did the hand wash unlike Danny's and overall wash was thorough. Hopefully not a fluke and will try them again!Unassuming and maybe even a little drab, Asti is actually a whole lot more than meets the eye. Take not of the little things and you'll realise the food that's coming out us the product of a kitchen that really really cares. Nice, simple, unadorned and well executed Italian food with not a pizza in sight. 

Down sides; nil atmosphere and a wine list that only offers the house wine by the glass. When will restaurants realise that drinking wine by the glass rather than the bottle still means you want a serious drop. Start to offer every wine on your list by the glass and watch your place fill up...Went there on Thursday,  August 23rd. Reservation at 7pm. Didn't get seating until 7:25ish.

We were seated upstairs. Got to the steaks but bf ordered pork belly for appetizer,  beef wellington entree, truffle mac & cheese side and a pepsi. (For sodas, they ONLY have pepsi or diet pepsi, WTH?)

I ordered foie gras for appetizer, crispy chicken breast for entree, chili lime corn for side and an infused peppermint iced tea. 4 stars because my chicken was a bit dry, well, it's breast so I guess that's why. I had a piece of the wellington and OMG it melted in my mouth! I am for sure coming back and ordering me some beef wellington all for my self! sides were alright. and for dessert, we ordered the sticky toffee pudding. that thing was excellent! (needed a little more ice cream, imo)

Slow service to begin with, had a reservation, didn't sit until about half an hour. Great table service, not as excellent, great or whatever else other reviewers say. Maybe because we're Asian/we looked like we had no monies? I observed other tables had better service than ours =/

Anyways, will we come back?! YES, I will give GR another chance! And when we do, I will maybe give it a full 5 stars (for the food/service) when I have the beef wellington all to myself!I literally am only reviewing this place because it has one of hte best desserts i've ever eaten.  The toffe sponge cake with brown butter ice cream is hands down perfect.  I like that they try to give a feel for why the construction is the way it is when you walk in.  The chandelier is an artists interpretation of how gordon ramsays hands move when cooking a dish.  and the entrance is supposed to be like a chunnel.  The star is removed because when I told the waiter I was vegetarian he looked at me with a really weird face like I was an idiot for coming to a steak house.  Hey I can't choose where my friends want to go.  plus they usually have vege sides which are amazing.  Also we ordered a couple appetizers and desert as no one was too hungry.  The dessert came first then the appetizers.  I mean really isn't that resto 101.  Serve the dishes in the proper course order?  But despite that the dessert was so good I would overlook them trying to sit an elephant at our table, as long as it wasn't eating my dessert.we are well aware that gordon ramsay steak is infamous for its beef wellington, but what it SHOULD be infamous for is the rib cap. this has to be one of the best steaks i have ever had in my cow-eating career. you can literally cut the meat with a fork it's so tender ($56). the beef wellington ($52) was good, but it was completely outshined by the rib cap! the fisherman's grill literally has the smallest pieces of each fish/crustacean and is not worth the $50 price tag! a fisherman would be insulted! the sauteed mushrooms are worth trying as they have this almost sour taste to them that is odd at first and then addicting and the assorted bread is fabulous!! as for dessert, if you come here and don't order the sticky coffee pudding, you should probably re-evaulate your life, why you were put on this earth, and most of all why you are eating at gordon ramsay steak. cocktails were excellent (ADORE the innovative glassware!!) the ambiance is beautiful and the meat cart... WOW!

super expensive but if you come here with a friend/date for the rib cap, a side dish and the sticky toffee pudding.... this is the safest bet you can make in vegas!The manager of the restaurant contacted me and was able to get us the reservation on the date we originally wanted. We very much enjoyed the food and the service. I appreciate the gesture to rectify our experience, but we shall see if the reservations process is fixed the next time we try to go here.Okay, this is the most honest review  you will read.  My husband and I walked in off the street, no reservations. We were seated immediately . Donnie was our waiter and could not be more enjoyable. He made the experience even more enjoyable. After looking at the menu we decided to go with the Hells Kitchen experience. I don't normally eat eggs but the Scotch egg was thoroughly enjoyable. I am not a beet person but the beet salad was not all that bad, then came the good parts, the scallop risotto was to die for but only got a half portion, also the beef Wellington is all the hype they put with it...I have never enjoyed a meal as much as this one. The toffee pudding was also the most enjoyable thing I have ever tasted.  I could not even finish my dessert.

....now for the reason that I did not give 5 stars....the price of the Hells Kitchen experience was $145 per person...which was okay by me...until the portions came out half...half a scallop risotto, half a beef Wellington. It costs us over $400 for 2 of us and we only got half portions of the food we so craved.  

We did walk out of there full, fat, and happy...but for $400 I would have liked to have some take home food...

The experience as a whole...I walked out of there with a grin from ear to ear, I have 2 signed pictures of Gordon Ramsay and the reminisce of the meal still lingering on my mind.  I will eat here again but this time I will get my full portion of beef Wellington. 

As for our server Donnie, he was a delight and I would request him to experience the same feeling I had the first time. 

I recommend if you have a couple dollars to splurge definately try Gordon Ramsay steak!!!Is this the best sushi I ever ate?  No.  Not even close.
But is it a fun environment, with decent rolls, and cheap?  YES!

The sushi comes in small orders starting at around $1.50 and moving up to about $4 or $5.  There's nothing special about the rolls at sushi station, but the price is a lot cheaper than grocery store sushi, and the quality is much better.  The tuna and avocado roll, the salmon and avocado roll, and spicy crunchy salmon roll were all good.  A total of 8 orders for two people came to a little more than $17.  Good deal.

Just a note for some people; Look at the menu.  Every special roll, most appetizers, and most salads have shell fish in it.  It's mostly prepped and can't be changed.  If you have a food allergy, or other dietary restriction, this may not be your sushi place.Fast & Friendly Car Wash is great.  A great wash for a great price.  The vacuums are free for unlimited use which is amazing.  I hate having to rush trying to beat the clock as you climb around your car.  Check it out!This place just opened up in town. As a lover of both KISS music and miniature golf, you better believe I didn't waste any time checking it out. 

The first thing you will notice when you walk in this place is the environment and KISS decor that is everywhere. They have a gift shop, arcade games, cafe, and tons of props and memorabilia on the walls. It is blacklit, and they really went the extra mile to make it a tribute to our favorite 70s shock rockers. KISS music is, naturally, blaring out the speakers non-stop, and it was a welcome relief to hear some great tunes you don't hear too often. 

I didn't deal with many employees during my actual visit, however the few that I did deal with were very friendly, and you can tell everyone here shares a love of KISS. It's a nice, laid-back environment. Adults will love the place because of the painstaking details this place has done to pay tribute to one of the hottest bands in the band. Kids will love it for the wild decor and crazy characters on the course. It's also great to have an attraction like this in Vegas that doesn't exclusively cater to the 21+ crowd. Kids need something to do in this town, too, and it is great that a place like this exists for that purpose! 

As for the course itself, apart from the KISS props, it is a fairly basic miniature golf course. If you're a mini golf fan, you'll have fun playing, though there aren't real "curve balls" or surprises thrown your way. But it's still a ton of fun! I only have a few minor complaints about the place:

1) There is ONLY ONE COURSE. Many of the mini golf places I have been to have two courses, which helps to mix things up and keep it fresh, which often adds to the replay/revisit value. The one course they have, however, is top-notch, it just would have been nice to have multiples. Of course, given the size of the suite that hosts the business, I don't really suppose there is any way they could have fit another one.

2) Bad location. It's clear this location was chosen due to its proximity from the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino, which is right across the street. This is not a "nice" end of town, and it is extremely difficult to get to the center that hosts the business due to packed-tight traffic lanes and one-way streets. I loathe this area with a passion, and I wish they had chosen a better location. Still, I'm glad it's here and not on the actual Las Vegas Strip, which is far more congested and painful to navigate. 

3) Too warm inside! Granted, they may have had some sort of air conditioning failure/problems going on, so I can't really elaborate on this. In this town, though, particularly in the summer time, you NEED to have air conditioning. Vegas summers are killer. UPDATE - a manager from the facility messaged me and told me they have installed an additional AC unit, so that's a plus right there. 

My complaints, though, are minimal, and should not stop you from checking the place out.KISS glow in the dark mini golf, heck yeah! The boyfriend and I took advantage of the Yelp Spring Break deal (2 for 1 admission) and enjoyed it. There's a little something for every KISS fan; arcade games, gift shop, and of course mini golf.
 
My only complaint would be that there were so many people on the course that it became crowded waiting for people to finish certain holes. My boyfriend and I got stuck behind a group of four who were just taking their dandy time. Each time we finished a hole behind them, we would take pictures to pass some time yet still be waiting for them to finish their hole ahead of us. Even the couple behind us got annoyed waiting for a bit. For approximately $11/person, it's not a bad deal, but you'll need to have patience to wait for people ahead of you!
 
Their decorations, obstacles and moving obstacles are kind of cool. There are definitely a lot of photo opportunities while you are waiting. They have a staff member on the course that watches you play and can also help you take photos. They even have a small sound stage to play music and announce welcomes for guests who are visiting (local, other states, out of the country).Get ready to rock and roll and play miniature golf with one of the world's greatest rock band "Kiss". That's the feel you'll get when you walk into Kiss Monster Mini Golf in Las Vegas Nevada. You will see so much Kiss memorabilia from the early years to present that you will think you've died and gone to Kiss heaven. I went on a slow night it was a Tuesday evening and Kissed "mini golf"  the night away. The staff there was great and very friendly. It was like having the full monster mini golf course all to myself with my girlfriend. We took funny pictures all through the black light glow in the dark "Kiss themed" course. There's also a lot  of arcade games, gift shop, snack bars, wedding chapel, and VIP room for your special partys. I even won a free round of Kiss Monster Mini Golf for next time. "I just wanna rock and roll all night and party Kiss Monster Mini Golf every day!"My boyfriend took me here the other day to pass some time before going to a show- and pass time it did. It's an indoor mini putt putt course that has black lights and amazing glowing murals on the walls. All the paintings have to do with Las Vegas and KISS.
The front of the establishment is entirely swag- gift shops, snack stand, loads of KISS memorabilia, an arcade (where you get tickets and can swap them for trinkets) and even a wedding chapel where I'm going to assume you can actually get married in. 
The price for two people was 20$, you get to pick your own colored ball, and off you go. At first it looks small. REALLY small, but it's very deceiving. It took us an hour to get through it, and we took our time since there was no one behind us, only a large party in front of us. You can score yourself, or have them do it.

The ladies room has sharpies that you can use to write on the walls!   

It was really fun, and you can bring your own drinks in if you want, and I'm assuming food as well. Kids can come in and have a great time- as long as you don't mind the uncensored KISS music.Great service each and every time!! 
     This place is great when you need to, make changes to your account, have a cashier's check issued or simply need a large or out of the ordinary withdrawal.
The service is great, which makes up for their understaffed team. Everyone and the manager have a great attitude and are very willing to help. Not the bank I frequent, but definitely helpful since its the closest to home!!I tried Chi Town Dogs for the first time today.  I placed a phone order for pick up and was told it would be 15 minutes.  I arrived 15 minutes later and found myself standing in line with people who had yet to order.  There was one girl taking orders up front and another in the back presumably on the phone or working the drive-thru.  The owner was running around frantic telling his staff to get food bagged up but to finish taking orders first.  Soon enough I was up to the counter and told my food would be ready shortly.  I was getting frustrated with them.  My food was not ready when they said it would be.  The lack of organization was exhausting.  I was ready to get my food and go.  I watched them make it, handed over my money, and went on my merry way.  My frustration was quickly replaced with pure bliss when I felt the weight of the food in my bag.  Two sandwiches and it was easily a couple of pounds.  My sandwich was incredible.  I got the beef and sausage combo dipped in "gravy" with added mozzerella.  A little bit salty but very good.  The bun was so soggy having been dipped.  It made it hard to eat.  I made such a mess.  My hands, the table, the napkins.  All were covered in food residue.  Like I always say, if it's good it's messy and if it's messy it's good.  This my friends was good.  The beef was flavorful and had just the right amount of thickness.  The sausage was so tender.  My teeth cut through the skin with no problems.  It made a more easy to eat sandwich without having to battle the toughness of sausage skin.  Remarkable.  With the quality of the food, I am willing to overlook the fact that the service and organization could use some improvement.  I was quite satisfied upon finishing.  That made the $8 price tag worth it.I have to give this place 4 stars simply because its the BEST COLD SOBA place in Las vegas.  However, how many other soba places are there in vegas? no clue, but for sure not many.

For a hot summer day or night when you're craving noodles, this place will hit the spot.  I recommend starting with the fish cakes and or pork belly as appetizers.  If you're the type to like add-ons or lots of meat in your noodles then ask them to bring out the appetizers along with your noodles.  Otherwise, prepare to spend 5 min just chowing down meatless but delicious soba.Authentic Japanese restaurant indeed. I had no clue how to eat certain dishes we ordered. Rarely would I have no clue on how to eat something too.

-Zuke Tororo (marinated tuna with mountain yam and quail egg)- yum! refreshing and beautiful! I was impressed.
-Kakuni (braised pork belly)- tasty! I love the sauce that coated the pork belly and carrots!
-Ten Zaru (cold soba with tempura on the side)- I heard it was really good on a hot day. The dipping sauce is cool and really compliments the soba noodles. They give you hot water at the end to turn the dipping sauce into broth.
-Ten Kake (hot soba with soup and tempura on the side)- the broth was a little salty but overall good. I think I would order the cold soba next time. The tempura was okay- the batter was a little tough, not the soft kind of crispy.Quick takeout pizza not many varieties but it's always consistently goodThe moist brisket is very good, and the various BBQ sauces are fantastic. You order at the cashier, so you get your food very quickly. There are many tables located throughout the restaurant -- we were able to find seats for our group of 7 very easily. Would likely go again to try out some of the sides and other meats.This is some tasty BBQ. I like the environment of the restaurant. I will continue to eat here when in the area. A good find. Try the moist brisket. 'Nuff said..We came in for Italian ice after a soccer game!! It was great and the people were nice. Limited seating together.We loved the look of this place, the great, enthusiastic service from all the staff, and enjoyed the food, with the exception of the side of sauteed spinach, which was thick and gloppy. It was more like an appetizer spinach dip with cheese and bacon, but somehow the flavor was bland.  Loved the steak salad and beef stroganoff. We'll be back!Came with a company function; I think there were about 18 of us during a Friday night Happy Hour.  Food is better-than-average bar food; I really liked the fries.  Unfortunately, for a group our size (full of heavy drinkers I might add) one cocktail server was not adequate.  Ours was friendly and kept her smile up despite the fact that we were pretty demanding, but she simply couldn't keep up with our orders.  I can't see myself coming back here on my own because the atmosphere isn't anything to write home about, but I'll definitely look forward to a return engagement for a work event because the food was quite yummy.Enjoyable dinner.  It was pretty quiet.  I do like that they have the dinning separated from the bar area. The atmosphere was very relaxing and comfortable.  It was clean and very nice, definitely not what you would expect when you drive up. 

Our waitress was very attentive. She was never far away and did keep our glasses full. 

The meal was very tasty.  We had the Tips and they were very good. I'm not a huge fan of fries, so I opted for the Lyonnaise Potatoes when were tasty but perhaps a little too mushy for my personal taste. The flavor was good.  

We may not be a frequent visitor but I'm sure we will return.Two thumbs up .. Jelli radios rocket wednesdays at Oracle mansion is a blast!! The Layout and location are perfect.. staff is awesome and the girl to guy ratio always on point  you definatly have to check it out.

jk-Best Filipino food I've had in Vegas! Good crispy Pata and palabok. Generous halo-halo portion size :-)We  came here and were so excited to see Forrest but when we drive up we. See they. Are closed august he closed for the month of August.so hopefully they will open 
After aug. Looking forward to pizza makingReading all these reviews I feel like the "banh mi" burger isnt getting as much rave as it should, I mean.... Guy from Diners Drive Ins and Dives did come here to eat that and loved it! It's possibly the best burger I've ever had. The myagi burger isnt as flavorful. The oxtail chili fries isnt as great as I expected, it was too sweet for my taste. And it's really big!!! ITheir Burgers are original and authentic...The Banh Mi Burger, Grass Fed Waygu Burger, Oxtail Chili Fries, Truffle Parmesan Fries...It's all really good. Its not your typical Burger joint...including nice table cloths, romantic lighting, and full wait staff.My experience was not positive the last visit. Ordered one of my favorite burgers and had to spit it out - yuck!  Asked for the manager, Mike, who unwilling to accept the fact that I got a product that was not good. He was arrogant, unwilling to replace the burger or do anything to make the customer "happy".  I will not return, nor will the guests that were with me.Despite it being cheaper than their local competitors, the quality for most items purchased are still par with some exceptions.

Bargains can be had just about everywhere in the store.  From the produce to grains to meat to bakery to international spices.  While seemingly fresh, the fruits and vegetables might not deliver the sweetness or taste you desire.  Do not be surprised if you take grapes or strawberries home and taste a bit on the sour side.  The barrels of grains like nuts and rice are priced by the weight.  This has become one of my favorite sections to shop around.  The idea of handpicking and controlling the amount of ingredients is quite powerful and cost efficient.  

They never mail any ads because their low prices are always constant.  I guess they just want to be known as the one stop for cheap goods.  Probably one of the best perks of shopping here is they are open 24 hours.  How convenient! The cashier lines are almost non-existent as there are ample registers and self check-out (at this location anyways).  

I come here regularly to buy cases of bottled water that cost me a whopping $1.90 something cents.  How ridiculous is that?! 

I can probably go on and on and on about how cheap it is but if you are lucky enough to live by a WinCo, don't hesitate to drop by and check it out.  Your wallet will thank you afterwards.2nd class.   I was weak to comment after the first class.  I'm not sure why there are negative reviews.  This place is clean. Very clean for what is going on.   Instructors know their stuff.  If you feel dizzy you simply stop & compose yourself.  I'm a raw rookie.   Trust me this isn't easy but I feel incredible after the class the next day....lol ....  I got a 10 day groupon and its $$$ well spent.  I will say this.... Park close to the door on your first few classes.  Its a long walk to the car afterwards when your legs wobble.A personal local favorite! A little pricy but well worth it. It's a great place to meet up with a good friend. Cool vibe. Ultra professional and friendly staff. Don't shy away from a $10 drink. They are worth every penny. Made with fresh herbs & fresh fruit/juice. The Rebel's Son (bourbon & rosemary) is delish! You gotta try the homemade ricotta and the fried pig ears (the vinaigrette they're served with is oh so yummy!)Very fresh with some originals like monkey roll. Actually has fried banana. Yum.Walking past Jean Philippe Patisserie at the Bellagio, how can one not stop and stare at the cascading chocolate?  As you see white, dark and milk liquidy goodness spill over one pool and then land in another, you can help but wish you were standing (naked) underneath that waterfall of rich chocolate...

Sliding in right before the doors closed at midnight, the BF ordered a generous scoop of Straticella ice cream.  We wandered throughout this quaint patisserie mesmerized by the magnificent cake illusions from above and far.  We watched the video of how their lovely desserts were created and how one can wish they had the skills (and tools) to make such lovely treats at home.

As the workers, in their cute little uniforms, cleaned up and closed up shop, they didn't scoot us out at all.  I appreciated that they addressed my questions about their cakes ($3000 for about 100 servings for that pink cake) without batting an eye or appearing annoyed. 

I can't say much about their other desserts or savory food offerings.  But this store is worth visiting just so you can be transported for a brief moment to that opening scene from "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" and that chocolate pool.  

I can already feel the white chocolate flowing down my face...The choclates and pastries are surprisngly really good! And I thought it wouldn't live up to the hype.

But if it seems too pricey for just pastries then just go to at least see the chocolate display.After Yellowtail, my date and I decided to head to Jean Philippe's to get a couple of pastries.  Drinks and dessert...a way to my heart.  In Bellagio, you can't miss it.  Store front has a fountain fall of chcolate in the front.  The lines are insane in the morning, so don't go then, but when we went, it was perfect.  No lines, but the selection was definitely minimal.  Definitely a great place to grab a dessert or warm drink.  Just expect to pay a little more than your Safeway types of cake.Jean Philippe Patisserie is located inside of the Bellagio Hotel. Home to the largest chocolate fountain in the world, Jean Philippe has something to satisfy every sweet tooth. The chocolate fountain is absolutely beautiful and will have you staring at it for a good few minutes. All of the pastries here are beautifully displayed and all of them look delectable. 

They create amazing cakes and chocolate sculptures here too. They look so fake, but are definitely real. If you really want to appreciate how beautiful it is, just look at it, but don't look at the price... Everything here is a little pricey, but you are in Vegas, right? Just live a little and enjoy!

I decided to go with the Rose Macaron. I think I chose the most delicious dessert possible! It was a raspberry macaron filled with rose water cream and fresh raspberries. It was beautifully topped off with a sugar coated rose petal. It was almost too beautiful to eat...I said ALMOST. The raspberries were fresh, the rose water cream was rich and silky smooth and the raspberry macaron itself had a perfect texture. I can honestly say that it was one of the best macarons that I've had! Absolutely delicious!

I would highly recommend checking this place out if you are craving something sweet. They have plenty of different pastries, gelato, chocolate, and crepes (savory & sweet).Food is 5 star. Wait is 1 star.

Food:
1. Smoked forest ham crepe. Excellent
2. Italian crepe. Good
3. Nutella crepe. Good
4. Vanilla soufflé crepe. Excelllllllent!!!
5. Ham & cheese croissant with béchamel sauce. Wow!!!
6. Vanilla Napoleon. Custard was perfect and dough was crisp. Excellent!!!

Wait:
Only for crepes. 40 minutes??? Why??? Because crepe making lady had to redo every other crepe because it was sticking to griddle. Ugh. A location this busy must have their stuff together even the manager was laid back and allowed stuff to get out of control where customers were being quoted 60 minute wait time. RIDICULOUS!!!
You felt like they were doing you a favor serving you. 

I wish I can give it 5 stars but management needs a kick in the behind to get their act together.Went on a monday.. It was dead.. No one was there.. We got the lobster and shrimp ravioli and the ny steak with blue cheese sauce.. Both were very good.. Pasta was homemade and fresh so that added a definite plus... I would recommend to go if the group on special is still available.they have a great seating Area inside and out... Its in the palazzo so you can just walk into the hotel after your meal and gambleI like the place so far, the breakfast burritos are awesome.  I had also ordered the pollo fundido but that is just okay.  The chips and salsa are fantastic and the service is always good.  I like the casual atmosphere, you can tell it was a fast food place because they have a drive thru but I think that is only for pick up now.  I would have to say it is the nicest casual Mexican place I have been too.Their lattes are awesome and the mini banana cream pie is delectable! The caramel drizzle adds just the right amount of sweetness!This is a wonderful new, little bakery. The menu and baked goods selection is still a bit limited (the only reason I didn't give them 5 stars). We had coffee, some of the Mac and Cheese with bacon (yummy but could have been served a bit warmer) and a really good mixed-berry pie al a mode  (which was really good). The setting was modern, urban and comfortable. I very nice little place.Love this cute quaint little place. I would give this place 5 star just for the croissants, however, menu could be just a bit more extensive. All and all I love coming here each and every time and never disappointed.I'm a meat eater through and through, so why would I find myself craving a vegetarian sandwich ? The "California" at Beach Hut Deli is amazing. Loaded up with Avocado and Alfalfa sprouts, full of flavor and freshness. Sandwiches are HUGE, ingredients fresh. The Marley Nachos are great and remind me of BLT flavors in a good way.
The only caveat would be that their "assembly line" could be optimized a bit better to cut down on waiting time if it's busy.Busy place, but Ragan hooked us up. Even though we got the wrong meal, they gave it to us for free and thanked us for coming. Good BBQ for the value. Could watch the game here with lots of friends at the bar.This review is solely about their 'Navajo' taco.. aka "Indian Fry Bread".  I've only had this dish (carne asada) here and probably will stick to ordering this as it is plentiful, tasty, and repeatedly enjoyable.
My sis ordered their pork 'fry bread' and I was disappointed because I asked the chef guy if it was shredded and he said yes (me thinks he don't know what he be takin' bout) ... it was cubed and not as flavorful as my carne asada.. mine was delish!
The young girl at the front was nice and their place seems really clean and since it's finally a locally owned restaurant that *doesn't* suck in S Chandler (everything around here is a chain), I am officially a FAN :)We stopped by during their anniversary celebration to peruse their selection of bikes, as I'd been in the market for a cruiser for quite a while, but had yet to find the right bike.

After looking around for a bit, we better explained to the guy helping us what I was looking for.  There were a couple bikes they had there that I liked, but I wasn't loving them and they were a bit out of my price range.  He remembered an Electra they had at their other location and quickly pulled up a photo of it.  He also offered to retrieve it from the other site and bring it here for me to check out.

We headed out to run some errands, giving them time to bring the bike over.  When we returned, the bike was there, all ready for me.  A beautiful matte-finish magenta Electra.  My self proclaimed bike genius boyfriend checked it out, and was pleased with everything.  While he fiddled around checking out bikes for himself, I quickly paid, fearing they'd change their mind and not let me leave with this gem!!

The Yelp reviews are mixed, but I had a great experience and have since recommended Bike Exchange to friends.I've been to Rehab (the restaurant!) several times since they opened and have left happy and full each time. The place is very cute and relaxed with a beach and surfing theme. Every server we've ever had was excellent and attentive.

I've tried a variety of items of the menu:

* Hawaiian Burger  - It was tasty, but the slab of Ham on the burger was a bit much for me. Personal preference thing.

* Veggie Noogie Sammy - I incorrectly thought this would be similar to Oregano's Veggie Wedgie. It is not, but that doesn't mean it isn't good. 

* Shelby's Shpinach Salad - This is my favorite with or without the grilled chicken breast on top. I love that you can get the mini size of this salad w/o chicken for only $5. It is a steal!

I've also tried the onion rings, french fries, and sweet potato tots. The tots are where it is at!

Most everything on the menu comes in two sizes - Rehab (small) and Relapse (huge). Even the small size is really big if you don't normally eat big portions. Be forewarned!I would give 4 stars for laser tag and prob 3 for golf. I didn't do the golf but walked through it. It is inside golf and all neon.  I prefer outdoor miniature golf. Now the laser tag was fun. Pretty big arena and cool music. 12 bucks for two games. Not bad.I came in after finding on Yelp to get a mani/pedi while visiting Vegas and when I pulled in the parking lot, I was like "I don't know about this place..." but I felt better once I sat down and saw they are really good with customer service and had quality nail polishes.  I came home and my pedicure was still perfect a month later...I had to force myself to go get it done after...so, I guess I won't judge the next book by it's cover.The burgers are fresh to order. I love the soda machine and the different flavors it has.I decided to give this place a try after seeing positive reviews, and I have to agree that the subs here are quite good!

What I really liked was that their subs are enormous. I am a guy who can usually eat a lot, but I couldn't finish my foot long sub, and it ended up being just as good leftover. I ordered the signature Gatti and it was delicious. I also ordered some cookies, which were good but nothing special. The prices are a little expensive, but not unreasonable. 

The employees were also very friendly, which I really liked. They were pleasant and helpful and it made me want to return!Small but still nice.  Feels like a hipster joint. But I live crepes and the crepes were actually good. Are here twice now most likely going to keep coming back.This is a convenient gas station with a small shop attached. It's not fancy, but it has the things you'd want a gas station to have. While the gas here isn't the cheapest in town, you are able to use your Smith's fuel rewards here for up to $1.00 off per gallon! A great tip if you aren't near one of Smith's stations. This location often runs specials so be sure to check out the signs or ask the clerk. Sometimes it's a free car wash with fill up, a free soda with fill up, etc. Last week I got a free cup of coffee with an 8 gallon fill up.Local vegan mexican food that's gluten free...what more could a girl ask for?! ...With only a few vegan restaurants around, going out is limited, which is okay, but sometimes its nice to go out...I'm stoked I finally got to try the food here, well worth the wait. I think Tedibertos has the ability to succeed, especially since the location is great. I also completely understand and empathize with the opening of a new restaurant...of course there are going to be some bumps in the road. Nothing is ever perfect, have some compassion and patience people.  We ordered the tacos, quesadilla and nachos, which I personally think kicked some major ass.  We really need to help this place stay open, so definitely stop by when you can! My only recommendations would be try to find more lighting during dinner and start making your own organic wine!!! Good luck to ya'll and ill be back for sure!Just saw this musical last night! I enjoyed the Beach Boys music (over 20 are sung throughout the show), as well as the dancing and sets.  The electronic backdrops re truely new-age and high tech - very cool.  The lead actor can sing very well, as can most of the cast.  The house was only half full, but by the finale, you'd have thought it was sold out! People are on their feet singing and dancing with the actors that seem to welcome and love the participation!  Overall, I had a lot of fun!Grimaldi's has one of the best perks for your birthday!

If you are on the email list, you will get an email a little before your birthday, which can be used before or after within a few days! It is essentially an $18 coupon for a large pizza! 

This essentially gets you a large one topping, or a large white with garlic, and you pay for additional toppings or anything else above and beyond!

I enjoy Grimaldi's charcoal style ovens, which add a nice flavor to the super thin crust and toppings. The pepperoni and sausage combo was a bit on the greasy end, but a little grease is a good thing!  The white pizza is amazing, with chunks of garlic hiding in there!

I'll be back at some point, but for sure next year for my birthday!Easy to find, I love the parking lot design, and gas was cheapest!Better quality than their chain competitors, although slightly more spendy. Concept of the business is unique. It was busy when we ate there, and we still received our food relatively quickly. Have I had better sandwiches elsewhere? Probably. Have I had worse? Yeah. Would I go again? Yes, if I was in the area.Just like home, minus the surly patrons...

Thank you for bringing this to Las Vegas (Henderson) and for the great, friendly staff!! The only thing that makes this place inauthentic is the friendly, helpful staff.

i understand that there will be haters, and they are welcome to go elsewhere. We will make a stop a Rita's part of every family trip to that part of town.GOOD ITALIAN ICE MEMORIES

I lived in the DMV (DC, Maryland, Virginia) for a couple of years and you could tell when winter was officially over when the local Rita's Italian Ice would post their reopening date. And every summer evening there would long lines to their serving windows. 

Back East, Rita's would shut down for the winter. In Hendertucky, they're open all year long. No excuses not to visit with our mild winters.Fresh baked cookies and Thrifty Ice creamWe went to ihop for a quick light lunch. We decided to share the chicken quesedia. We had a very sweet young  woman as our server. The restaurant was not busy when we were seated. She brought our beverages in a timely fashion. However, it took forever to get  our quesedia. the portion size was ample, more than enough to share for a light lunch for two people. and it was quite tasty. and the price was right by for lunch for two for under $10 before the tip. if we could have been served in a more prompt fashion this would have been a 5-star review.Drink and muffin were very good, airport prices.  The staff was very friendly and they serve Dr. Smoothie drinks!Best food served fast in terminal 4 concourse B near gate B9- I have had the Napa Salad for lunch and the breakfast burrito for breakfast here and both were excellent.  They also make great cappucinos.  Most of the restaurants in this terminal all had salads premade in plastic boxes that looked identical.  Press Coffee made the salad fresh and it was outstanding.  Furthermore, the staff was friendly and helpful, which was the reason I first ate there, after waiting a long time at the place next door for a cashier that did not appear happy to be at her post.One of the better places to get a steak-n-cheese... it's just pretty expensiveI've only come in here to drink before watching movie at Harkins. The drinks have always been good and the staff has always been friendly. I did have to find my waitress a couple time to get my bill so I wouldn't be late for my movie, but it's no big deal.Husband and I have been looking for a new wing place for a while since we can't stand the thought of franchised Buffalo Wild Wings and their nasty fake chicken, stumbled upon this gem close by to our place.  I'd have to say, first look is kind of an eye sore, I had faith though and quickly realized you can't judge a book by it's cover.  In the little "Internet Cafe" which seems to be a college hang out close by to CSN, the best wings in town!  So many favors to chose from, their chicken is fresh and made to order!  My favorite was the honey mustard wings... So good!  I'm a boneless fan, we forgot to order boneless so had to deal with the regular wings but I'd say it was worth it!  Awesome either way I'm sure, but it was the freshness that really won me over.  Super nice customer service, we'll be back for anytime wing cravings!Wow.  So so good.  OK It was pricey but wow.  I originally wanted Rocco's but they don't deliver.  Their loss.  So I didn't even order pizza from Those Guys Pies becuz I didn't want to be disappointed but maybe I should have.  I ordered an original cheesesteak with whiz "with (which means with onions) and mushrooms and peppers,a caprese salad and a mascarpone cheesecake.  The salad was delicious, huge pieces of mozzarella, beautiful heirloom tomatoes and fresh basil.  So fresh, so delicious.  olive oil, balsamic vinegar....so delicious.  The cheesesteak was so juicy, so tasty, delicious.  Then the cheesecake, while WAY TOO small, was delicious.  Very impressed.  Only thing is the $27 price tag but then it was a big salad and delicious.  Worth it.  And They deliver which Roccos does not which is why I chose them.We enjoy going to this park.  My kids love that it has two playgound, splash pad area and a field they can play in.  There is also a dog park that is attched to it.  The parking can sometimes be a pain but it is close to the house and we will return.Great little casual, urban hip restaurant with inspired, hand crafted food. Went there for Sunday breakfast & was very satisfied with the tasty crepes with chicken and swiss chard. Funky twist on crepes & pretty healthy. (A welcome departure from bacon & eggs.) Homemade salsa & sausages unusual. Impressive selection of coffees & cold coffee is properly brewed "Japanese style," not just poured over ice. Nice patio seating. Good vibe!The dancers were beautiful. They all looked like fitness models. They were very talented and sexy. The singers were also very talented. So, the performers were great but the show itself is lacking. The entire process is very unorganized. Some of the acts are awkward and too long. The really need to go through the show with a fine tooth comb and cut out or change the parts that don't flow well. Sometimes the girls looked like they were not well rehearsed but I don't think it was their fault I think they need to change their routine to things that work a little better so it runs more smoothly. Over all it needs to be cleaned up.  I am hoping the production staff reads these reviews. I was really endeared by the cast. Those girls stayed in character with sexy smiles the entire time even with costume and set malfunctions and awkward missteps.I'm serving notice upon you all- I call this bar from 11a-1pm every Saturday, so find somewhere else to drink.

They aren't overpriced (Stella was $4, craft brews were $5), and they are very good at understanding that you're here to drink beer, so unless your glass is empty you can enjoy conversation with your friends and not the staff.Despite working nearly opposite Pep & Fodder for the first 4 months of its existence, I had never noticed it before. Oops! And since moving jobs I've not been up Waterloo Place way for a while, or at least not in search of food. But, this Saturday, after a stroll up Calton Hill and in desire of some lunch and a cup of tea my boyfriend and I strolled past and thought "Yep, that place looks nice", and it was.

The decor's lovely, the lime green tiles particularly, and they were playing a Beatles best-of (FAB). The chap who seemed to be in charge was very friendly, to everyone and not just us, which really makes you feel appreciated as a customer (I was asked twice how my soup was).

I had a breakfast tea and their soup of the day, carrot and corriander which was served in a mug with a slice of bread. I've been trying to cut down on starchy carbs but couldn't resist the bread, mmm. My boyfriend ordered a mocha which was served in a little glass cup. Sweet.  Price wise it came to less than £7, which wasn't too bad.

I'd agree with previous reviews that comment on the selection available (or lack thereof), only one soup, and teas listed as "Breakfast" and "Herbals" (I assume if you enquire further they have several, as I spotted an Eteaket sign, but it's not obvious). Oh, and whilst the breakfast menu looks decent it was strangely lacking in eggs.

But, it's a nice cafe, and perfectly located for a quick pick-me-up after visiting Calton Hill and if I'm in the area again I'll pop by for a brew.The go-to spot when we're craving Thai food.  Good food, fair prices (discount if you pay by cash). Nice clean and quiet restaurant. We usually order Pad Thai, Pad Se Ew, Crab Fried Rice, Satay and Fried Tofu. It may not be as "fancy" as the other Thai restaurants out there, but their food is good and gets the job done.Have been coming here for past two years. Always have had great service, without being pressured into getting other things done. Most of the time my car is done in timeframe promised. Just got tires and new battery today, was pretty quick for a Saturday.Wafts of Mesquite wood as you walk in... food clearly made with love and good technique! The staff was super nice and welcoming, too.

The green-lipped Mussels were of very good quality, and I enjoyed my Falafel wrap which came with a small bonus salad. A satisfying meal, and I look forward to coming back for more!I always drove by this place so one day I decided to try them out for lunch. To my surprise they were not even registered on Yelp yet. So I did that and was the first tip, check-in, and now review. 

I ordered one of their lunch specials which was a main item and fries for 5 bucks. So I orderd a 6 inch philly cheesesteak. Wasnt too bad at all.

While I was eating I was going over their menu and it looks like they have a wide variety of different kinds of food you can order from pizza, wings, ribs, to seafood choices! Yes, I said seafood! From what I saw you can get deep fried catfish and shrimp! 

Their place is clean and service was pretty good. Not really a typical sit down restaurant but they do have a counter with chairs lined up against the walls. 

So in closing I have a lot more items to sample so this review might fluctuate depending on the next couple of visits. From what I saw it looks like its gonna be a solid 4 stars for now.weekday dinner. Sunday& MOnday half off wines!
I had short ribs over red wine risotto. Delish! Everyone liked what they got except that filet mignon was a little dry. But that mac&cheese which came with it compensated for it :) Service was great too.I was a fan of the old Bosa 1 so i had to check this new location, and needless to say, it lived up to the hype. 
I went there twice once for lunch and once late night. Both times the staff were very nice and helpful. They made suggestions and seemed genuinely happy to be there.
I had the rice plate which was pretty good, but not a world beater. The bun bo hue on the other hand is to die for. The meat is so tender and juicy I could eat it for days. 
However the only thing I wasnt very high on was the shrimp cakes. I'd heard they were good and they tasted fine but waaay too greasy.
This place definately gets two thumbs up from this  foodie :DI work in downtown Tempe, Mill Ave, location and am so happy to find this place.  Finally a reasonably priced lunch that's also healthy.  With a name like Bad Mother Cluckers, I had to stop in last week just to look around and pick up a menu.  I was met by the owner and a guy behind the counter who were both so friendly and helpful, they answered all my questions and made me a copy of the menu and happy hour specials for me to take back to work.  The place has a nice outdoor patio in the front, casual seating indoors, and a lawn area in the back for outdoor games.

Yesterday I return for lunch.  The same guy was behind the counter and he recognized me from my stop in last week.  The owner delivered our food to the table and introduced herself and chatted with us for a while.  Everyone was very friendly....I really liked that about the place, it felt very welcoming.

Being on a diet and trying to eat healthy I choose the Chicken Woody, a skewer of marinated chicken grilled over a mesquite charcoal fire, and the Veggie Woody, a skewer of grilled vegetables.  They were both delicious, the chicken having a great flavor and the veggie skewer included mushrooms, onions, zuccini, and tomatos.  I added a side of the Sante Fe Corn Salad, which consisted of sweet corn, black beans and diced tomatos in a light marinade dressing, it was good as well.  My meal hit the spot, just the right about of food for the right price.

They do have larger meals and other sides to choose from.  Also, they had a yummy looking triple chocolate cake to tempt you on the front counter, but I was good and resisted tempation.  They also have beer (some bottled and one on tap) and they have wine (small one glass bottles).  They also have some great happy hour specials.

I definitely want to go back, I want to try their other Woody's (steak and shrimp).Everyone that knows me understands that I have to look and seek out good Hawaiian or Hawaii like food, so after hearing about 808 Tapas by Dean Okada, (another Pearl City Boy) I had to check it out and what I found was awesome with traditional Hawaii dishes mixed in with a Spanish flare we experienced a great new place. We had rolls, stir fried pork belly, sashimi Lobster, etc..., but one dish that stood out was the Tensai Hamachi shooter, it was killerz I could have just ate that with some sushi rice. The service was awesome some of the best I have had in Vegas!!! Mahalos to Dean and the crew for taking care of us!!!! You gotta check this place out!!I was driving around aimlessly after every restaurant I have been wanting to go to was closed. I finally decided on Ross J's and saw this bakery close by. Cake pops are the new cupcakes and can be overrated. 

When I walked in, I was hit with a bouquet of delicious smells. The woman working gave me a run through of the items in the display cases. The theme of baked goods on a stick does not end with just cakes. They serve pies and cookies lollipop style as well. On Mondays, they play catch up due to being closed on Sunday. 

The best part of cake pops are that you get a taste without committing to the whole piece. I wish I could say that I was completely health oriented, yet I must not tell lies. 

The maple bacon is probably the best version I have had. The cake is not overtly sweet. With the pieces of bacon on top, it was everything great about breakfast.Sizzler is good. Generic salad bar but the clam chowder is amazing. I like going here. BUT don't order to go. They have no lids for salad dressing and nothing to put the soup in. And no to go cupsThis new place opened up recently with some good hype attached.  My friends and I decided to check this place out before the Prince concert at the Joint.  I'm certainly glad I did!

When you check into the hostess stand, you think this place is pretty small.  Don't be fooled by that.  It's HUGE inside.  A lot of seating inside and outside as well.  Huge bar area extending outside as well.  The outside area has a bunch of lounge tables.  Our table was half chairs and half booth.  Accommodated all people of my party.  Our server was nice, seemed a bit flustered as we did have a lot of questions and most of our drink requests were "out of stock" which didn't make too much sense.  

Their menu is not too pricey.  Things go for $15-$30 depending on what you want.  On top of that, they have an AWESOME secret menu given out on concert days.  Since the Prince concert was there, they offered it to us!  Super fast and easy, it's only $25 dollars and comes with 3 main components:  starter salad OR soft pretzel, meatloaf OR fried chicken and a bag beer.  GREAT DEAL, by the way.  I chose the salad which was light a refreshing.  Spring mix with balsamic vinaigrette.  For the main course I got the fried chicken.  You get various dark and white meat pieces.  They gave a ton of that!  It was accompanied with mashed potatoes and gravy, sauteed green beans and a biscuit.  The chicken was super juicy and crispy on the outside!  The gravy really made the mashed potatoes, which were also very creamy.  The beans were sauteed with bacon and had a nice, light salty taste.  The biscuit also was dense and flaky with creamy butter.  SOOOOO GOOD!!  The beer was a low end beer, always different.  I got the Milwaukee's best.  The thing that enhances the experience is the paper bag it comes in.  Super creative for higher end restaurant.  Shows the lighter side of "Las Vegas strip" type restaurant.  I REALLY liked that :)

Definitely will be back for another try.  I would like to try their fish and chips, Korean style ribeye cap and salmon.  So many yummy toppings!  If you're in the Hard Rock hotel, I highly recommend this place before a concert, show, or date night!I didn't know that this restaurant existed until I saw a $30 for $15 gift certificate on Local Dines (http://www.localdines.com/phoenix?ref=19485), and I'm sure glad I gave it a try.  I would have never thought that one of the better mexican spots in the valley would be this far north?  No wait and live music at 7:00 on a Friday night also made for an enjoyable night.

The restaurant itself doesn't scream mexican in anyway.  There is a stage and couches to the right of the bar.  The band that was playing on this particular night played a modern jazz style of music, giving Hacienda's more of an upscale lounge ambiance.

We were seated immediately, and chips and salsa were placed on the table in seconds.  Already a good start!  I ordered Irene's Anaheim Green Chile Chicken Enchiladas.  Very good.  The plate is covered in a mushroom sauce that a lot of people may like better than I did.  I personally would have preferred a traditional red or green enchilada sauce, but I'll give Hacienda's credit for doing something unique.  My wife had the chicken fajitas.  Who doesn't love good fajitas?  Not only was this a good meal, but it could easily feed at least two.  If you order it, you're going to need to take it home, maybe with an extra tortilla or two.

We were seated by the kitchen and watched countless fried ice creams being brought to the tables.  Wow, did they look good.  Somehow, we decided to skip out on desert, but we certainly will have to give it a try next time.This isn't a 4 star diner, its a burger stand and ice cream place.

Their Specialty Hot Dogs were quite good, and the staff was very friendly.

I didn't care for the fries, but the onion rings my lady got were good.

The ice cream was FANTASTIC!Not sure if this place is worth the 3 hour wait.  The lines will probably die down once the buffet isn't as new any more.  But once you get in, you'll be overwhelmed by the amount of food options to choose from.  It's like the Buffet @ Wynn or Wicked Spoon @ Cosmo but 2-3x larger.  There's Asian, Mexican, Meats (American?),  and Seafood sections to cater to everyone's needs.  In addition, there's freshly squeezed oj, cucumber, and tropical (mango, pineapple) juice near the seafood section which is near the front.Price was actually 59$ per person when i was there around christmas time. but i thought it was worth it, only worse part of the meal was the mexican food. I also killed the desserts!Oh yeah!  This competes with Wynn for best buffet on the strip.  Came in for lunch.  Their asian selection is surprisingly very well done!  They have cool fruit juices, different seafoods, fresh meats, tacos, a great dessert bar (they even have gummy bears in a jar that you can take away).  An overall really really well done place.  Service here is also up there.  Even the guy cutting the roast beef had this big smile on his face and is so happy to give you a slice!  Bacchanal if you're reading this, you should give him a raise (he's a black dude - yeah that's pretty vague I know)!  I would definitely come back!  Oh, and this is better than the Wicked Spoon.tl;dr hot new buffet, ask for crab legs steamed

It seems like every year, there's a bigger and better buffet in town. This is the year of Bacchanal. Luckily, we arrived early enough on Saturday to avoid any sort of line. Almost two hours later, the line appeared to be a 45 minute wait. 

Brunch automatically includes mimosa, which I thought was strange. But since I paid for it, I suppose there's nothing wrong with drinking at 11am in the morning. This is Vegas afterall right?

Other buffets I've been to repeat their food items, either for lack of creativieness or to avoid congestion. As our host lead our party to our table, I noticed that nothing ever repeated. The food options stretched beyond what I could see. I continued to eyeball where along the buffet I should start until we were abruptly welcomed by the gentleman at the carving station. How nice I thought to myself until he started with the Ni Hao. That was just weird.

The wide array of food left me satisfied beyond stomach capacity. Instead of this being brunch, I treated it like a cheaper version of dinner. Though annoying at the time, the presentation (small amounts of food on dishes larger than they needed to be) helped me to avoid eating until barfing. Bathrooms are right outside the main entrance just in case.

Tip: Ask for your crab legs steamed!If you're visiting Vegas, you have to try this place. HOLY DELICIOUSNESS. This was SEAFOOD HEAVEN for me. I'm not going to lie, I completely skipped everything and went straight for the seafood. I loaded my plate up with crab, oysters, sea bass, and shrimp for my first plate, then went back for more for my second plate. My dad must have had 3 plates of seafood. The lobster bisque and seafood paella were also amazing! Some of the seafood items I wasn't as thrilled about were the crawfish, sushi, ceviche, mussels, and clams, so my best advice would be to skip these and just grab more crab instead. 

I didn't try their prime rib because my brother said it wasn't worth it but their sausage was really juicy. I also really enjoyed their ramen. The broth was very rich and full of flavor. I barely remember anything but the seafood because I was in seafood bliss during the entire buffet. All I know is there was just SO MUCH FOOD. It was like sensory overload for me. I could barely contain my excitement. 

Luckily, I saved an itsy bitsy little pocket of room in my stomach for dessert which was perfect for ice cream, creme brulee, and red velvet whoopie pie. My only complaint about dessert is the creme brulee had a really weird texture to it. But there are so many different desserts to choose from, this didn't affect my experience at all. They have a big ice cream bar set up with a bunch of different flavors, mochi ice cream, pies and cakes for days, and a whole bunch of other stuff I can't remember because there was just too much food. 

Next time I'm back in Vegas, I will definitely stop by Bacchanal again. We were lucky enough to get in without having to wait at all. Try to go on a Sunday around 5 and you probably won't have to deal with the long lines I've heard about.SO I've been the place where everyone says to go..Bacchanal Buffet. I heard crazy stories of the wait and the food..but impressively enough, there was no wait for Saturday during lunch time. Super nice!

I was impressive by the size and decor of the place. very cute and simple lines which i loved. They had a whole bunch of neat presentations and little finger hot plate grabbers. (use them..plates are HOT). 

The american food there was a-ok in yelp terms. The fries were superrrrr salty, even for my husband, king of salt. the eggs, the benedict, and burger was all what you would expect..nothing too delicious stood out. THe carving station is always a good bet when you go to a buffet. 

the crab legs were good. they cut them in half length-wize so it was super easy to eat. We got a ton of those.

The Italian food was very generic too, the pizzas and breads were good, the pasta was ok. 

The asian food is where it it at. I loved the PHO. it was perfect. If I had known, I would of gone there first, middle, and LAST. the sushi was ok, but i never am too impressed with sushi at a buffet. The Chinese food was pretty good tho. 

Now the glory of the desserts! I think the dinner desserts are better, but the gelato was good. The chocolate was toooooo sweet and decedent for my sweet tooth. 

OVerall I think this place was good, i think people hyped it up too much so I was expecting the food to be way better than it was, but for a buffet, I have to say I would come back here.After trying out the other competitor buffet "Wicked Spoon", Bacchanal is hands down the best eye candy and yummy in your tummy buffet place to go.  It doesn't matter what time of day you go, their food is totally worth the money your paying for and the consitency is there.  I hope the next time we come back this summer, their creme brulee has improved.Went here on Sunday evening around 7:30.  It was not busy and we sat on the patio.  The guacamole with crab was great and so were the tacos.  We had the pork and the short rib tacos.  Highly recommend the short rib tacos.  Others on the list looked great as well.  The service was great.  We will return.I am way, way too excited that a Pinkberry opened up in Vegas.  Now all the desert dwellers can get that California stripmall experience.  Mani/pedis and fro-yo, ya'll!

But, DAMN THEM, they don't serve salted caramel, my favorite flavor.  Of all the places to pour salt on ice cream, Las Vegas should be number one! But, noooooo.  

However, in a pinch, the pomegranate flavor works.   Add some pineapple, mochi and granola, and you'll be in heaven.  Prices are pretty good too, considering it's right on the strip.  About $5 a pop.

P.S. - It's in front of the Mandarin Oriental, not inside.I rate a 4 because the customer service with JC needs to improve a little more.. Stopped in tonight to exchange brake pads and get a refund for my brake rotors , overall I do like shopping here for my parts thoughA definite hidden Gem!! 

The wife and I stopped in for lunch one day and I instantly knew this was going to become one of my go-to's. The product is fresh, the portions are generous, and the staff is friendly. Well done and welcome to the neighborhood!While I didn't think the light displays were spectacular, some of them were stunning, and they and the accompanying music did put my carload of 5 in a festive holiday mood.  I was ready for Hot Chocolate at the end of our journey, but not at the beginning, when they were offered for sale.  The guide map was helpful in announcing what was coming next, but a few times we had already passed a location before we spotted it.  I liked the longest tunnel of lights and the moving lit Viva Elvis figure best.  All in all, I thought the tariff of $15 per weekday carload was worth the expenditure, and look forward to repeating this in future years so long as the light displays do not remain substantially the same.

I recommend that Glittering Lights be seen at least once by those who welcome and embrace the holiday season.My reaction to Potbelly is always "so small," followed swiftly by "so good!" If you're looking for a direct Subway substitute, Potbelly will come across as pricey. If you're looking for an alternative to chi-chi $8-$10 sandwiches, Potbelly uses highly respectable ingredients and has a wheat roll that toasts up delicious.

The Wreck is a truly fine sandwich, nicely filled and tasting like cold cuts I would not be embarrassed to buy at the supermarket.

The environment is also a bit more soothing than many sub shops: it's all earth-tones and wooden chairs, so there's a sense of relaxing.

The clerks are cheerful even under the pressures of customers with truly peculiar orders.The food is spectacular! The portions are perfect and the atmosphere is terrific! We live in the neighborhood and we will definitely be regulars at Central Bistro!So I sold my washer & Dryer last week thinking I would turn around & buy another set right away, but alas I have not yet. So my husband & I had quite the stack of laundry piled up last night. I had every intention of heading out to a laundromat during the day, but found myself procrastinating because the last trip I made to a laundromat was pretty traumatic. So, I went out & socialized for a bit and around midnight I felt as though I had consumed enough tequila to brave doing laundry publically again. So I found the Laundry Lounge online that was 24Hours! The best part is that it wasn't totally across town! Not that it was super close, but Craig & Rancho is way closer to me than anything East of the strip. 
Since tequila was still my fuel, my husband was stuck driving & was a lot less enthusiastic about our "adventure", but was pleased by the safe neighborhood the mat was in. So we loaded up 3 of those huge Ikea bags full of our dirty clothes & off we went!
We walked into the CLEANEST, quietest, and nicest laundromat I have ever seen! Their washers were in the middle, both the kind you see in apartment complexes and the stainless steel commercial ones and the dryers around the outter walls. The stainless washers cost $3.50 per load & the smaller ones $2. We loaded 2 large loads & one small & dried all together. The dry cost .50 total. We were in and out in less than 90 minutes! They have reasonably priced snacks, free wifi and a great location! I don't know if I'm in any rush to drop the scratch on a W/D set anymore...lolLarge soccer park. Usually clean and has a large play area for the smaller kidsI called the office at 9:00a.m. And was offered an appointment for the same day! I was expecting to have to wait at least a few days! 
I arrived at exactly the time of my appointment. 
I was discombobulated when I walked into the office. There is no receptionist area. There is no partition between "us (patients)" & "them(medical people". There was a staff person sitting in the beautifully appointed lobby working on an iPad when I entered. She didn't smile but said, "are you here for an appointment?", which oddly enough I was! She handed me a clipboard & instructed me to complete the forms with nary a smile. While waiting I observed several staff interacting warmly with other patients instantly impressing me!! 
I waited less than 10 minutes in the comfy chair before surly nurse entered the doorway & said, "I'm ready for you now."  No smile. No emotion- think Lurch. 
I was taken to a simply decorated but clean exam room where I was asked the usual questions. 
I waited less than 5 minutes for the physician to enter the room. Dr . Grier was personable and professional. She was thorough!! My appointment lasted just shy of 2 hours ( I was her last appointment of the day). I feel comfortable with her knowledge and recommendations. I didn't feel assaulted by her physical exam (ladies you know what I mean!). 
The final portion of my visit was lab work. The phlebotomist acted as if she had been vaccinated with pickle juice. She said neither hello nor goodbye. She did not acknowledge my tears as my blood was being drawn. She was unprofessional at best and uncaring at least. * of note I know she doesn't work for MomDoc, she is employed by the lab*.  I will definitely return to this doctor despite the staff but I can assure you- Atilla will never touch me again!!Amazing Burger and the Sunday papers with the dog!! We love dog friendly places and this one is great! Good food, Lovely Cocktails and the pup gets left overs. If you have not been I can Highly reccommend it yum!Ok, I absolutely LOVE this retro arcade bar. Great selection of beers. Great food. Free arcade games. Great place to come w/friends. Friendly servers. 

Price is average, I wanna say 5,14-16oz, beers cost around $30- forgot exactly cuz when you have 5 beers in one setting, things get a little fuzzy. 

I want to specifically mention the HANGOVER FRIES. I was a little skeptical at first, because of the chorizo, but one bite and you'll wet your pants. I tried the Jalepeno sticks- uum- DE-LISH. 

A must try bar :)Tried this restaurant 3-4 times for buffet, luckily all times food was too good. Specially spicy chicken tandoori and dry black paper chicken. Just make sure you go there before 2 PM for lunch buffet else most of the item would have already finished...Really delicious!  Fresh and different.  Well priced.  Kind of an Italian Chipotle.  I'll be back!Pretty solid show in Vegas.

This is not a "live" show or taping. They bring in past season favorites for you to enjoy for about an hour and half to two hours.

I think my ticket was around $50 and the seating was good. You just have to go early to redeem your ticket to secure a better seat. 

I got to watch Tom Cotter, Anna Graceman, and the Olate Dogs, and some others' names I do not remember. Overall, the show was great. I liked Tom Cotter but some of his jokes were definitely not PG. I saw some kids with their parents so I am not sure how they would feel. 

I highly recommend the show. I wish the show could be longer!Over the last 3 years we've lived in the area, this place has changed 4 times.  First Uncle Bear's, then Tio Oso's, then Thirsty Cactus (or Thirsty Cantina, whatever, it sucked), and now it's TC's Pub & Grub.  The menu is typical bar food, including burgers, sandwiches, pizza, wings as well as some taco and quesadilla selections (which I always appreciate a good quesadilla so I will have to try it next time). 

The restaurant section (which was always dead before) has now been opened up and TVs added so the whole place is more of a bar feel (thumbs up).  The place was packed for Thursday night football (Cardinal's game!), but still got a good table close to a TV.  

Server (who admitted multiple times he was brand new) was very friendly but had to keep asking other servers for clarification on menu, etc.  Still, nice enough and very attentive.

We ordered wings ("medium" but they were spicy!) and their "ugly" crust pizza with mushrooms and olives.  The wings, very good, I would get them again.  Pizza, I wouldn't order it again if someone paid me.  The "ugly" crust basically is a thick hand tossed crust - too much crust (and half of it was burned) and very skimpy on the toppings.  It was pretty horrible honestly.  The actual toppings (although sparse) were very tasty... good cheese and fresh mushrooms and olives, so I would order pizza here again IF they have a thinner crust option.  Otherwise, if you are coming here to carb load and really need your bread fix, by all means, order the pizza.  I personally prefer a thinner NY style crust.

All in all I would come here again based on the good wings and service, and I'm looking forward to trying their other menu options. 

p.s. text TCSPUB to 411247 and they'll send you a text coupon for a 50 cent draft. Score! (I'm a sucker for a deal)  Cheers!It's always hard to find a good pizza shop in las Vegas, it's usually hit or miss. Having said that, the food was surprisingly REALLY good! We had delivery, the guy said 45 minutes and he was on time. 

Me and my girlfriend split the white pizza and an order of plain chicken fingers. The white pizza with actually very good. It had ricatta and mozzarella cheese, canola oil with no marinara sauce. I think I found my new favorite pizza. The chicken fingers were perfectly cooked and lightly battered. I eat chicken fingers all the time when I have a cheat meal and these were worth it!

Overall I will definitely be a returning customer. Maybe next time I'll go and see what the atmosphere looks like inside.I'm thrilled to have G&B within walking distance of my house.  As others have commented, the interior is gorgeous.  It reminded me of a Door County restaurant, one of those that has been there for ages. 

The menu is not extensive, but there is enough variety that everyone in your party should be able to find something they would be happy with.  In fact, I think the menu choices do a great job of covering a lot of different preferences with a minimum of options.  I have been to other restaurants with far more extensive menus and found fewer choices that were appealing to me -- I don't eat red meat or poultry but I do eat seafood and fish.  In some restaurants I may have a single option on a very large menu, yet at G&B there are several I could eat.

I have eaten there twice -- very good, not "gourmet" but a cut above the regular bar/sandwich place for sure.  I am not sure I understand the critiques of other reviewers who downgrade G&B for being the kind of restaurant it is, rather than the kind of restaurant they wish it was.  If it's a casual local gathering place, then that's what it is.  And not everyone wants a big haystack of fries automatically with their sandwich.  It's wasteful.  The cole slaw that is served with the sandwiches lacks flavor, in part because it is dished into the serving cups long before it is served so the dressing sinks to the bottom.  If you don't know this and don't stir it up before you eat it, you get plain cabbage for the first few bites.  Even so, the dressing is pretty bland.

As I'm not a sophisticated drinker the lack of a drink/beer menu doesn't  bother me, but I get how that should be remedied.  My only other issue with the place is not the fault of G&B but with the patrons.  Both times I have been there, parents have allowed small children to scream and/or run around while they sat either oblivious to the behavior or assuming other patrons would find this adorable.  There are clueless people everywhere but casual dining is rife with them.Have now had three meals here, and I have been a few other times for beers and apps.  Not quite five stars, but on its way.  First, the two burgers I have had were both fantastic.  Clearly, they are using quality beef.  The fried onions on the Mushroom/Swiss were cooked in what tasted like a wine sauce, and they made this a flavor full burger.  The G&B burger was even better, one of my new favorites in Madison.  Unique and satisfying burger.

I had the patty melt one other time, and it was disappointing.  It was greasy, and I think they used too much butter on the bread.  Also, while I like little twists on a classic, I just didn't think the sauerkraut/mustard combo was right for patty melt.  Just one guys opinion, but the opinion of a life long patty melt lover.

The cheese curds are also obviously hand made with their own batter, and I love the dill dipping sauce that comes with them. 

The selection of beers on tap is spot on.  Some unique choices, but not different just for different's sake. For example, the great Chech beer Staropramen on tap - bravo!

Finally, fun atmosphere that is bright and lively.  

One problem - parking.  Give yourself time to find a spot and be ready to walk.Nice addition to the airport.  Carnitas tacos are the way to go.  Plus a nice pull up bar while waiting on a flight.  Don't forget the black beans & rice in the to go cup:)We randomly decided to pop into Tavern Americana after a day trip to Tucson and needed a restaurant on a Saturday night that could fit a party of six.  We were able to get in no problem, since I assume people are just starting to find out about this place.  My first impression was that this restaurant needed a boost in the decor department.  I loved the garage door walls, but otherwise it was just gray and drab with nothing hanging on any of the walls really.  Besides the decor, it was loud and bustling in the restaurant, so the overall vibe was good.

After sitting down, our waitress greeted us, but it took awhile to get our drink/food order.  She seemed overwhelmed and all over the place really.  Once she did focus on us, she offered some suggestions and we all placed our orders.  I had the beet salad and added chicken.  Everyone else had different dishes, so I did get to taste some of the other items.  I LOVED my salad.  The grilled chicken was awesome and the beets were cooked perfectly.  The salad met/exceeded all my expectations and was rather large.  The Hubs had the gnocci and seemed to like it, but it was rather small.  I must mention we tried to order a couple appetizers, but they were already out for the day, which was kinda sad.  To top off the meal we had the cookie and apple fritters.  OMG that cookie is to die for, and I consider myself a cookie connoisseur, so you can take that review to the bank... you'll love it.

All and all, for a place close to home with good quality food, we will surely be back soon.  Hopefully they will add something to the walls and perfect their service.  If they do that, surly they'll have a winner!Really Good food!!!Have tried this once.  I got the meatball sub and it was just average.  I really liked a couple things so will try this again ordering a different sandwich for comparison.  What di d I like?  I used online ordering, this was great.  I walked in bypassed the 20 deep line got my sandwich and headed out.  Since I paid online I was in the shop for less then a minute. Easy and convenient!  The other thing that Iliked was how well wrapped the hot sandwich was, Paper inside foil inside paper.  It was still nicely hot by the time I got it home and ate.  Right now I like Jimmy Johns sandwich better but will try a comparable sandwich on my next trip and may up this to a 4.

Second visit, I got the Italian Grinder.  Nothing great about the sandwich, just okay.  The lines are long here at lunch time, I'm not really sure why, use the online ordering! .  I'll try this one more time for their salad, just trying to find another lunch place to get some variety.  The online ordering worked as well this time as the last.

3rd times a charm I keep going back!  I also tried a sandwich as a salad and liked that, basically a chopped salad but the extras available really kick it up.   I think I finally figured  the combo of extras that I like on the sandwich and have now had something from every category except seafood.  I'm waiting to try the Elvis sounds pretty different. I have also been getting the banana milkshake regularly.  This has moved to the top of my sandwich places.Located at the corner of Ann and Decatur, this relatively new Fantastic Sam's location may have become my new home for haircuts. One of the hardest things for me to find has been consistency and my do is really quite basic. I think I may have found it! Tabitha took care of me this time, but I've had both Crystal and Tabitha on previous visits. They are both "fantastic" and I have been pleased with the do every time. Granted they are still offering grand opening prices, but where else can you get a decent haircut and a relaxing shampoo for twelve bucks? I can't comment on their products or other services such as hair coloring or styling for long hair, but for me and my short hair, this was a four star experience.Well, I know this review is a little on the late side, but here we go. Since it opened a few months ago.. it's now my go to place. Thankfully I no longer have to drive a good distance to get my stock refilled. With it being just right down the street from the house makes it really convenient!! :) Although, it's not as big as the other places, it still has what I'm looking for, plus the staff is pretty helpful. Now, if I can only get them to carry "Spicebox" whisky! :-)Order delivery a few times a month. The pizza and wings are always hot and tasty (hunger is the best ingredient).  Delivery drivers are usually quick & friendly. They have made mistakes & forgot sauces that were paid for to accompany items I have ordered on more than one occasion. I finally decided to call and complain after the 4th (possibly 5th) time and the manager was very responsive and handled the situation to my satisfaction. We haven't had any issues since.Never go to Woodman's East hungry. First have a blackened fish taco from El Poblano, located right in their parking lot. The fish is well seasoned and moist. The toppings include fresh avocado so the taco is creamy and delicious. The restaurant is co-located with bakery Pan y Pan. Their food is fabulous and very reasonably priced. Whatever you spend you will save when shopping!

You can eat or take out. My routine includes eating in the car while I finish making my list. i always need extra napkins.Extremely tasteful Italian spot in north scottsdale that has a great wait staff and decor. There is a good sized patio if you want to sit outside.

Started off the dinner with a caprese salad and fresh ground pepper, fresh mozzarella is made daily in house. Don't forget the basil :)

Next course was the Margherita pizza. A thinner smaller pizza is a good way to describe the pie. Pizza can easily serve two, but if you're hungry you may want to order more. My only complaint was that the pizza was served cold and not straight out of the oven.  

Last course was undoubtedly the winner, hands down. Apple "pie" (which is only seasonal and was told will be off menu soon). This was absolutely heavenly, served warm with vanilla ice cream, whipped cream and caramel. The pie dough was perfect and the size will be able to serve more than one! 

I enjoyed meeting Marco, the owner from Italy with a lovely accent! He visited our table at the end of the night and was very interested to learn how our dining experience was. It was nice to see the owner helping out around the restaurant. I would definitely return.When my friend said lets grab lunch at Honey Salt, I was like where? I had never heard of this place, so I read the reviews on Yelp, and so glad that we decided to try this place. A new local restaurant that has great food and atmosphere. 

Honey Salt is tucked away in the corner of the shopping plaza on the corner of Rampart and Charleston, as the hidden gem in the corner of the plaza. With so many different reviews of the fried chicken sandwich, I definitely had to try it as well. It is described as the Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken sandwich on the menu and comes with a creamy slaww, house durkees dressing on a nicely toasted brioche roll. It comes with a lightly dressed chopped salad. Two perfectly fried pieces of chicken - what is not to like about that...besides wanting a larger portion or more of it (but that would just be gluttonous). The portion size is just right.

I'm looking forward to coming back for dinner and trying out some of the other items on the menu. Honey Salt, I will return!We walked in here without a reservation on a Saturday night and ate at the bar.  I am super late on the Honey Salt bandwagon.  So much so that I might as well be writing a review on this cool new show called "Breaking Bad".  I mean, the buttermilk fried chicken sandwich has similar qualities to meth...so I've heard anyways.  

The creamless corn soup intrigued my wife the most and she loved it.  The charred kernels and arugula oil was kind of a shock at initial taste but it grew on her quickly and she already plans to order it the next time we're there.  

I got "My Wife's Favorite Salad" consisting of duck confit, arugula, frisée, pine nuts, roasted bing cherries, and a farm fresh poached egg.  This was terrific and I only wished there was even more duck but I am sure everyone feels that way.  I thought the mix of flavors were really good.  

We split the Colorado Lamb porterhouse for the entree.  It came with bacon sofrito, pea tendrils, roasted fingerling potatoes, and balsamic reduction.  I'd never had lamb prepared this way and thought it was quite creative.  The lamb was a little more done than I wanted it to be but it was still juicy.  Like all good porterhouses, I found myself gnawing on the bone with my bare hands at the end.  

Our super friendly (and fellow Red Sox fan from Andover, MA) bartender lightly twisted our arm into getting "The Brookie" for dessert which the menu describes "chocolate chip cookie meets chocolate fudge brownie, with vanilla bean ice cream".  You should definitely try this if you like but are really tired of chocolate lava cake.  I feel so jaded typing that last sentence.  

Overall it was great.  What's not to like about this spot?Pricey but delicious. The lamb chops tasting course was impeccable.  Turkey meatballs were delicious in their marinara sauce and the Tuna tartar was flavorful. Butternut Squash was ok and my girlfriend didn't care for the pumpkin creme dessert. otherwise yummy and worth the return tripWe went there for our 4 year anniversary, as we had heard from friends this was a great restaurant.  For our first course we had the Burrata and Heirloon Tomato salad and the Elizabeth's Caesar.  The tomato salad was pretty good, the Burrata was a lot creamier than a regular buffalo mozzarella, which I am used to.  It took a minute to get used to the texture but overall, a good version of a caprese salad.  The Elizabeth's Caesar was very lightly dressed.  Much to our disappointment.  If ordered again I would ask for extra dressing on the side. 
As for entree's we recommend the Caramelized Sea Scallops.  Perfectly cooked and the cauliflower two different ways (charred and pureed with vanilla bean) was a great accompaniment.  
For dessert we ordered their signature "Brookie."  Basically a chocolate chip cookie pie with brownie filling.  Served along a salted caramel ice cream, this dessert is worth the trip to Summerlin.  Their bread and cocktail selection is also very good. 
As for service, our waiter was nice.  However not very attentive.  Never asked if we wanted a second round of drinks until we were completely dry.  We would have gotten another if he came around quicker.I went the other day for lunch and the place is pretty good (really 4.5 stars). I got the cornbread enchiladas, a unique concept in and of itself, with the red sauce. The red sauce had a very mellow heat that didn't overpower the flavor and meshed well with the slightly sweet cornbread. 

I will definitely be back to try some of the other menu items and support a local business that is churning out excellent food at reasonable prices.It has been a while, and a lot of visits later to Perfect Scoop. Something is different.

I'm not sure if it's a partnership change or what, but every month or so I'd say it's a little less quality. It must be growing pains because as far as I can tell, two new branches opened and then it all started.

Peter, the owner, has not been in this branch for a while now. When he was there, I knew what I was going to get was the best he could offer. Be it the freshly brewed jasmine milk tea, or vegan ice cream that he could talk to me about. It's just not the same. I don't even see jasmine milk tea on the menu, and when I asked about it - apparently it's powder now? I don't know.

This isn't to say it isn't still acceptable. It's fine. I haven't had any induced bowel movements yet, a la Stephanie K. Prices are still the same and the selection is relatively the same. There are a few different flavors at the branch on Jones. But at this rate it will simply blend back into mediocrity. I hope this does not happen.Fyi the spring rolls come two in an order not four they just cut it in half. Spring rolls are very good tho.Day 1 Foodie Fest 2013
There are more food vendors and vendors in general in booths but less food trucks compared to last year. There are some new ones and the favorites from last year like Tornado Potato and Fluff Ice are back! Yay!

Last nights attendance was way busier than last years.

Super busy - White Castle.  Their lines reminded me of rides at Disneyland. 
The more popular trucks like Fists of Fusion (formerly Truck Norris and Nonna's), Jogasaki Sushi Burrito, Tornado Potato, White Rabbit have lines too. Everywhere else lines were much less wait time thank goodness.
   
Dole Pineapple Whip Alert!

Yes there's a booth that sells Dole Whip!! and not just Dole Whip soft serve mind you. They also had Dole pineapple shakes and floats!  The ULTIMATE Dole Float in a pineapple is THE one to get! The pineapple is filled with pineapple chunks, pineapple juice and topped with soft serve Dole Pineapple Whip! Enough to share!  It's the real deal just like the one in Hawaii! Their stand is decorated like a little grass shack and is located near White Castle. You cant miss it!
 
Before I got sidetracked with Dole Whip here's what we had:

Buttermilk Truck -  I did really like the Red Velvet Pancake bites!! It was more like mini pancakes though. Wow very rich! Making a note to buy a can of this pancake mix.

I also had the Chicken & Cinnamon Waffles and Mr B had the Chicken Sandwich w/Chorizo Gravy! If you like white meat/chicken fingers like those Chik Fil A thingys then you'll like the chicken n waffles...me not so much since Im not a chicken fingers kinda girl..and the waffles werent nothing special, just waffles with cinnamon on it. But that's just me.   Wish I had what Mr B got. The Chorizo gravy on his chicken sandwich was really good! The gravy was savory with a hint of spice.  If you get that ask for extra gravy..that's what I would do.
 
This will be one of their last runs for their food truck!!( http://buttermilktruck.com/) So take advantage of some of their signature and popular dishes!

Tornado Potato- Mr B had the one with cheddar?? I just took a few bites. Good but I wish it was just a tad more crispy. I usually get the zucchini one..I'll save that for day 2 feasting.

Misc deets:
Dining area - they have round tables scattered throughout the place and there is a designated area also that is shaded. Like last year, they have staff busing tables.

Entry - Organizers take note. The area had alot of volunteers manning the entrance and they are AWESOME hard workers and were helpful even though some were a little lost on what to do but you need to have some type of meeting or orientation so everyone is on the same page. 

3 day wristbands cant be removed just like last year.

Happy that I won a pair of tix via Yelp! ( http://www.yelp.com/events/las-vegas-las-vegas-foodie-fest-2) so thanks Yelp Las Vegas  CM Drew and again Red Dragon LV Foodie Fest for your generosity!  So far it's been fab!We discovered Lima Limon through yelp as a newly open peruvian restaurant.   We chose the usual dishes that people would normally get at other Peruvian places in the area.   We got ceviche mixto,  lomo saltado, chicken  chufa, and sopa de pollo. The lomo  saltado taste inconsistently depend on the time & day we went. Otherwise it a solid Peruvian restaurant.I have been intrigued by this place ever since they started painting and tagging all the walls with "Rattlecans". I have read reviews from my fellow Yelpers, so I had high expectations for this spot.

My coworkers and I stopped in after work. They were almost closed, so we rushed in, grabbed a seat, and ordered as fast as we could. Our server was very friendly and answered all of our many questions very well. Great selection of beers on tap and in bottles. The whole time you're there you cant help but focus on all the amazing tags and art surrounding you. The atmosphere and ambiance is great!

For my burger selection I ordered the "All-City" burger which was great. You can't go wrong with Nueske Bacon and Bleu Cheese Crumbles on a perfectly cooked burger. The bun was fluffy, and perfect. I definitely enjoyed my burger. 

For my beer selection I asked some questions to the waitress, because I definitely needed some guidance when selecting any beer. I asked if a Ballast Amber from Cali was hoppy or malty because I was going for more of a light ale. She suggested it would be light, and not hoppy. In fact the beer was hoppy and not in the direction I intended to go. I give some lee-way because they are a brand new establishment and the burger was delicious. 

If i had one recommendation for this restaurant, i would recommend staying open a bit later. Closing at 11, not cool for a bar/burger joint!  All my coworkers absolutely enjoyed all of their meals and we will definitely be back again.. as long as we get cut early.Standard Good food (not great food, but better than many other Mexican restaurants), great happy hour (love the margs) nice patio seating.  Patio service is slower then indoor service, but the people are very nice and it gets busy here.  They have a cool tequila sampler too if you prefer tequila over wine.  I like that the water pitcher is always on the table and they serve fresh chips with 2 salsas.  We go every week!I am a dude and therefore I don't browse when I shop. My shopping style could be described as hit and run. We were on our way to the restaurant next door and we were drawn in by all the interesting stuff. I lost track of time looking at things I've never seen before. I stood there thinking, "this stuff is cool, but I have no idea what to do with it."  I did say I am a dude...  Lucky for me the people here had ideas how to showcase the goods inside my home. There is a lot to check out for such a small place. I recommend checking it out between appetizers and main course next door, you won't be disappointed. I ended up buying a cool glass vase that hasn't left my breakfast nook table since I got it. I don't know if I lose my dude status after buying a vase, but it was worth it.This was formally known as White Eagle, It has recently re-open under the name of Eddie's European Bistro. Wife and I was a fan of White Eagle, only problem was you never knew when it was going to be open? Place has been renovated, smaller dining room, but still enough room. Looks like the same people still works there, and the food seems to be the same! But looks like they now offer a wider menu. Again, we liked it before and will continue to come back!This was the only place I could grab a hot beverage during my conference last week and I braved the loooooong line. The chai latte was good! The spices were, well...spicy and my extra hot tea was always piping just the way I liked it! It was worth the wait.I love going here during the winter! The portions to me are huge and i bring a second person to share. The xo lobster with scallops of use to have was the perfect ramen to fight a cold.I came on a Wednesday night and was surprised at how busy it was, however the level of service we received was great and the food came out quickly. This place has a great chill atmosphere and I actually thought the food was pretty good! I got the fish tacos which was loaded up with tons of veggies and also the beergarden salad (which btw has a very yummy dressing). My friend got the fish and chips which was a decent portion and tasted pretty good too. 

I can't wait to come back and try the other dishes and I would also like to try the beer samplers!Good quality sushi for very reasonable price. They just started their AYCE for $25.95. We went on a Friday at 7 pm and there were very few people in the restaurant. Service was polite and attentive. The only complaint I have is that they sold out of a number of items like Spanish mackerel, red snapper, giant scallop, etc.While waiting for the Celine show we were lucky to grab a spot at the bar. Our bartender, Keith, was very friendly, telling us the pub had only been open for 3 months. I guess the uniforms were supposed to be disco 80's, but I felt sorry for the girls. Our food service was prompt. I expect pub food to be fattening and it was delicious as well. I had the sliders and my husband had a ham and cheese sandwich.  I hope Ramsey keeps his eye on this place to keep it up to par. I've read several poor reviews that I think would get his ire up! Maybe better training of the staff? Our experience was great.I'm happy to give GRPG a solid four stars. Our meals were piping hot, and the portions were quite large. Also, beer lovers will find their line up of beers to be quite good. I went for something a bit different, and got myself a pint of pear cider. It went very well with their braised pork which I think was cooked to perfection.great cocktails and bartenders, we sat at the bar and had the pork rillete!! amazing-ness!!!I love Mexican food and dishes. The GF and her daughter don't care too much for it though. The end result is I don't get to enjoy Mexican food too often but I found a perfect loophole. 

I just say "hey sweetie my car is dirty and needs a full wash inside and out" this gives me at least 20 minutes to drop off my car at the gas station for a full service car wash/detail/and fuel up. Once done I head inside and place an order for some of the best, top notch Mexican food on this side of Vegas.

Being a Gringo I normally like ground beef tacos and don't like the shredded beef ones but here the shredded beef is perfectly seasoned and grilled to ordered on an Iron Flat top. They throw the onions and peppers on the grill and that fuses all the flavors together with the meat. Simply stated its delicious.

The enchiladas and the sauce is damn good as well. Probably 2nd in Vegas. (There is a hole in the wall dive place in south Vegas that beats them in my opinion but that's about it). 

Only downside to this place is that its an express and shares space with a gas station. Seating/parking can be minimal especially on the weekends when everyone is getting a car wash/ fuel but by paying for that full service car wash your car is in their hands for at least 20 mins and that is plenty of time to get your food cooked and consumed before leaving with a near spotless vehicle.

It may seem weird to go to a gas station for a taco but trust me its worth it!It was our first time here today. I liked how you can see how they make your pizza. I was not feeling creative with my pizza today so we opted for their specialty pizzas to skip the build-you-own pizza process. We got a Bianco pizza and a smoked salmon pizza. They ran out of white pizza sauce so they had to make other people's pizzas before ours - it's a lazy Sunday so it was not a big deal. We got our fresh and hot pizza rather quickly.

The smoked salmon pizza has smoked salmon, capers, red onions, olive oil and goat cheese.  It was like lox and bagels in pizza form. It was good.  The tanginess of the goat cheese balances the saltiness of the smoked salmon.

The Bianco pizza was good too.  It has gorgonzola, pesto, white onions, mozzarella, arugula and truffle oil.  I just think it would be better if it had pine nuts to give it texture and additional flavor.

I like their crust. It was crisp and was not boring at all.  We got a free cannoli with our Yelp check-in. It was good...actually, better since it was free!So glad to have something close to our house. We have gone here a few times and has been good! We have ordered the club sandwiches and blizzards. Everything has been good!It was actually my first time to eat at a Kushi Age ( (Japanese deep-fried skewers) restaurant. I am usually not a big fan of deep fried food. However, I did enjoy my dining experience at Yu-Yu quiet a bit. It's located in China Town Plaza and right in front of 99 Ranch Market. I came here during lunch hours. This place is very clean with open kitchen. 

Yu-Yu has lots options for vegetarians. (deep fried pumpkin, broccoli, eggplant, avocado, garlic, sweet onion, lotus root...) You can choose curry powder, chilly powder or special dipping sauce to go with fried skewers. I personally slightly prefer curry powder and dipping sauce. I tried 15 different skewers and there was nothing I didn't like. I would say beef tenderloin and bacon wrapped scallop were the best in my orders. Beef tenderloin was really juice and tender inside. Breading was very nice too and not too greasy.

I also tried grated radish noodle.($7.5) It was light and perfect to go with deep fried foods. My noodle order came with 2 complimentary skewers. It's a pretty good deal for lunch meal if you just order it alone. 

I finished my meal with An-Mitsu with ice cream. I loved it! It's not too sweet. I enjoyed the sweet red beans with that very creamy ice cream a lot. 

Service here is just as wonderful as most Japanese restaurants. Our waitress was super nice. She explained everything to us with details since it was our first visit. 

On my next visit, I would probably order less deep-fried skewers and order a noodle or rice dish to go with it. Yu-Yu will probably be my lunch regular spot soon.Very friendly, pretty quick making our order, and the sandwiches were delicious to boot! Definitely recommend this location after our lunch experience today.I liked this place a lot!  Do yourself a favor, sit at the bar and order the Hell's Kitchen Burger! The bartenders have great personality and work as a team so it is like having 3 waiters vs. one!  The burger is to die for and if you have room, get the Oreo shake, that thing is so good it should be illegal in all 50 states!Food was really good. I ordered the "hells burger" and my boyfriend ordered the "farm burger"  it's loud and really busy in there. Customer service was excellent. To me the food did seem over priced. Our tab was $75 for 2 burgers, a side off fries, a salad and 2 drinks.The food was pretty good and the service was really good. It's interesting using the iPad to look at their menu haha and the sweet potato fries are really good too!Really liked the jalapeño poppers but the buffalo wings left much to be desired. The burgers were good and I'm very picky when it comes to food and I great indicator of whether I would come back or not is if after the meal I look at my boyfriend and ask him if he would come back and he said yes!Yep... 80's Crazy all the way!  

Keep the kids at home....I love the atmosphere here and the food is always tasty. I love the Country Benedict. It has cheddar jalapeno biscuits with sausage, a poached egg and house made hollandaise sauce. Breakfast is my absolute favorite food and I love that they are open til 3 on the weekends so I can do brunch later in the day. This place is always really busy on the weekends though so be prepared to wait if you have more than two people. The wait usually isn't that long though, I've never waited more than 15 minutes.This is my new spot for my fitness needs.  Tons of instructor base and On Demand Fitness Classes are available.  

Free Parking even on game day and special events.  And did i mention you get to watch the game and event for free?!  There is also a Free Shuttle Service that conveys fitness fiends from their boring cubicle to the weight room in less than 5 mins!Pool:
Nice but small pool area,  drink prices don't reflect the fact that this place is not on the strip...other than that, it is not crowded and pretty well kept up.

Rooms:
I was completely satisfied with their rooms. Comfortable bed and pillows. Nice lighting, dark woods complimented the color scheme. Wall mounted TV, small fridge and if you happen to need to call someone on the room phone while on the toilet, they have that covered too. Nice big shower too. 

Sports book:
Decent place, drinks are always cheaper at the book. Friendly bartenders.

The Farm Cafe:
Decent, not great food. It's the 24 hour cafe so they have just about anything you'd want at anytime of the dayBackyard Taco was serving at the Johnson Elementary Carnival. The food was fantastic and grilled right before us. Really enjoyed the carne asada and pollo street tacos. Everyone was raving about their food. One parent was raving about her papa loca. NICE!Is Angelo Sosa the next Wolfgang Puck? Ol' Wolfy started a Vegas revolution when he opened Spago back in '92 and other celebrity chefs followed. Sosa is one of the first TV celeb chefs to open a spot in the Vegas 'burbs and hopefully more will follow (it's great to hear Bradley Ogden has plans to open a new restaurant in Tivoli soon, also). Comparing Sosa's culinary chops to Puck's might be a stretch right now, but his food is tasty.

Here's what I've tried:

Jarred tuna ($12) - unique presentation in a square glass dish; tuna was decent quality, well seasoned with a little heat.

Watermelon and goat cheese ($8) - nice presentation, flavors worked well together, really loved the candied wasabi that added a nice crunchy texture.

Pork pot stickers ($9) - order of 5 sitting in a shallow bowl with a sweet, thick sauce

Tuna deviled eggs ($12) - eggs are cut up in pieces, next to a mound of tuna tartar. Odd combination, but it worked.

Korean BBQ short ribs ($11) - about 5 small pieces of short ribs. The typical sweetness and spicy depth of Korean ribs was replaced with a more mild profile that was dominated mainly by the charred exterior.

Pork belly ($21) - very interesting dish, large strip of pork belly with a thick tempura-like exterior topped with cabbage, pears, etc. I loved the different sweet and sour notes of the dish. Bold savory flavors. Biggest issue is that the thick crust takes away from the best part of pork belly --  taking a bite and experiencing the crispiness of the crust, the lusciousness of the fat, and the tenderness of the meat. The crust dominated the textures and while it was a delicious dish it doesn't beat eating a more simple, typical version of pork belly.

Chocolate cake ($7) - baked in a tea cup; came with miso ice cream and caramel popcorn, cake was delicate and airy.

Strawberry shortcake ($7) - miso ice cream, whipped cream. I thought it was supposed to be soaked in sake?! I didn't taste it. A decent dessert, but I prefer the chocolate cake.

They also have a kid's menu for those that want to dine early with the little ones. It's a smart move considering it's the suburbs. Another smart move is the pricing. Way cheaper than eating on the Strip. Let's hope more quality restaurants open off-Strip so my wallet won't take as much of a beating when i dine out.Poppy Den is a funky little gastropub in Tivoli Village. My friend and I had dinner here on a Thursday night. We were seated quickly in their outdoor patio area. We ordered two different signature cocktails which did not lack in the booze department. They were strong! 

We started with the watermelon salad with goat cheese. It was an interesting combination of flavors- creamy and rich, but crisp and refreshing. We also had the tabbouleh lettuce wraps- no lettuce necessary- the filling was good on its own. We also shared the duck, which was a little over seasoned, but was balanced nicely with Kix cereal. Everything was served on mismatched dishes that look like they were bought at little old ladies' garage sales. 

My favorite is always dessert. We shared the trio of sorbets: mango, pineapple ginger (my favorite), and a mystery flavor that we couldn't figure out (raspberry? strawberry? watermelon?). The mango was creamy and tasted like you we're eating frozen mango purée. The pineapple ginger was refreshing and I would buy it if I could. It was served on a crispy thin sugar cookie with fresh berries. 

Prices were fair. The check was presented in an old children's book, which was a cute detail. Ambience was the best part. The patio seemed larger than the dining room, and even though it was a little warm, the breeze made it feel like summer. 

The only negative was our server. She seemed to talk down to us and invited herself into our conversations. It was very off putting. 

I will return to try more of their interesting dishes (and have lots more sorbet!). Make sure you dress up a little- Tivoli Village is not very t-shirt, shorts, and flip flop friendly.I am all about being "Authentic" as I am born and raised in Chicago, and also the Founder of Chicagoans In the Desert, LLC.  "Authentic" is the only way we roll!  These beef's are it!  Just like back home.  Whether you get yours wet or dipped...you'll feel like your home.  And of course they carry all the other fun "Chicago" beef stand stuff like Jays chips, Green Rivers and Wunderbars.Love it!!  Such great food!  Unfortunately, they do not honor discounts from Yelp anymore for some reason, so don't go in expecting to be able to use your percentage off you earned by checking in!  Otherwise, love the food and lemonade!I really liked Karben4. It's like they did an evaluation of Simon's beer tastes and decided that it was time. A line of beers based on English malt? Don't mind if I do. We definitely left with a growler of the Undercover.

The space is pretty cool. We went on a Sunday and had brunch while watching the Packers on a couple of large televisions that still manage to fit into the space in a pretty natural way. It's definitely the kind of place that has those TVs so you can watch the Packers or Badgers play, but don't expect to see them on and running 24/7. This spot is about interacting with your fellow patrons and coming together over an excellent pint.

The brunch food was simple and good - nothing to wow you. But let's be honest, I didn't drive all the way over to Stoughton (sp?) Road for the breakfast sandwich. They have a small kitchen in a spot that is about the beer and from the two meals I saw I think they have done a nice job coming up with a menu that allows them to provide enjoyable food to go along with their enjoyable beer.

So last point - can you please transplant yourself downtown? Pretty please? I'll be back, I'd just be back more if you were within a few blocks of the Capitol!Met a friend there for a casual dinner and drinks on a weeknight a few weeks ago.  Service was great- our server was very knowledgeable about the beers and the menu and was very friendly and accommodating. The beer was really good (the SamuRyePA was the favorite, I think) and the food was also quite tasty.  My friend and I had the grilled cheese with apples and thought it was fantastic, although we both wished we'd specified that we wanted it on the pretzel roll. The menu says you have a choice of that or bread and the server didn't ask which we wanted, so we both ended up with bread by default.  Still really good, but would have been even better with the pretzel roll.   Husband had the Midwest Muffaleta and thought is was ok, but not great- although that is really just because it has tapenade and he hates olives (he got so excited by reading the part about polish sausage, ham, and white cheddar, that he didn't read the rest of the description!) . If you are a fan of olives, you will probably love this sandwich. 

Overall, we enjoyed our visit.  Good food, decent prices, and unique (in a good way) beer.  We will definitely be back!Everything at lunch was yummy. We started with the chili cheese fries and they were very good and upscale comfort food.
I had the turkey, avocado, sprout, w/muenster sammi. I wish they had listed the tomato on the menu so I could tell them to leave it off but I pulled it off and am ok with that. I switched the bread type to sourdough. Waitress was nice and attentive. Service was fast & good overall.I love Ruth's Chris.  This location is the fifth one we've visited.  So we were surprised at the bumpiness of the service when we were there on Saturday.  

Arrived with no reservations and grabbed a table in the bar area to eat.  That usually works well in the other Ruth's Chris, plus it's a good spot to people-watch.

Our waiter was friendly and settled us in with menus.  We ordered sparklling water and a glass of red wine.............and waited.

After about three apologies for the slowness in the wine arriving it came - mid-way through the salads.  Hmmm.

Dinner arrived, and as always, the steaks were a shining spot of happiness.  Perfectly cooked, sizzling plates, tender, yummy.  Blissfull.  Oh yes, the Cesar salad and potatoes were also perfect.

We never saw our waiter again.  Ever.  My wine was way long gone, something that would NEVER have happened at the other locations.  He didn't come back to check if everything was ok, if we wanted to order dessert.  Nada.  We had just been abandoned.

The GM was very kind and apologetic, but by then, we just wanted a check and to head out.  And then it took another 15 minutes to get the check.

So why the four stars?  Because Ruth's Chris is a fabulous place to eat.  The food is exceptional and worth the cost for a special occasion or if you just want a good chunk of perfect cow.  As soon as they work the bumps out from being in a new location, it will be killer.  But seriously, maybe wait a few weeks to let that all happen.the food is good, & the service is EXCELLENT! our server stephen went above and beyond his job!! HE kept us entertain while waiting for our food to arrive...(which didn't take that long) 

it's my mom's birthday.. aside from the desert we ordered, they gave us something on the house too as well!! 

the manager checked in on us if we are having  a good time. I'm telling you guys, if you want a good food, and service matters to you. check this place out! it's awesome!Happy Hour is 2:30-4:30 $4 smoothiesWe went on a hangover Sunday and when we walked in the place was packed and super loud so we decide to eat on the patio- if that option wasn't avail we would have left it was that loud. I ordered the egg sandwich with tots and a side of the Brioche French toast both were amazing. My husband ordered the pollo loco omelette and that was also very good. Our waitress was super nice and even though the place was slammed we felt well taken care of. The menu has tons of choices and the price was right.  There was a woman eating alone crying so we decided to pick up her meal and the manager came over and gave us a 20% off coupon which I thought was super nice!  We will for sure returnImpressive!  The place always makes my mouth water when I drive by as the open grill out front is always going so the food is always fresh!  What they lack in space, they make up for is taste!  The service was good and the servings were great.
I got the chicken burrito which is pretty much a meal by itself. The salsa is fresh and the price is right.  Can't believe this place didn't have a line.Good food at a great price.  Way cheaper then Roberto's and no where near as greasy.  Only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because both times I've been here, they messed up something on my order.  After telling them what was wrong it was replaced with ease,  but it's no fun watching people at your table eat while you wait for a new burrito to be made.  But like I said, good food, great prices, I'll def return.Nice station. Wish they had Window squeegee so I could've scrubbed all the bugs off! Sams does have best Prices. Was 3.54 today for 91 octane. I will definitely venture to this fuel station though from now on!Great fast food. Cheese fries and chocolate malt shakes are terrific. Parking is not plentiful, be prepared to park over in Tempe Marketplace and walk over if it's a busy night.We ordered 2 bento boxes here only to find out that the amount of food they give you is enough for 2 people to split one box!

Our meals came with two huge rolls, 4 pieces of sashimi, tempura vegetables, soup, and hot tea.  GREAT deal for $13!!This was my second time to be doused in color while wearing white. However, one in my group of four decided that it would be cute to run in official Color Run tutus to my dismay. So not only was it raining "cats and dogs" outside and 50-something degrees, my friends and I looked either ridiculous or super cute depending on the on looker with Color Run socks and tutus. I didn't care though. We were out there to have fun, and that's all that mattered. Despite the freakishly crazy weather, very similar to the rain I experienced while running in Portland, Oregon, we all thoroughly enjoyed ourselves.

I felt like there was much more color involved than in the Color Me Rad run. I honestly thought the event would be canceled due to the extra heavy rain, but kudos to The Color Run peeps for hanging in there, and enthusiastically throwing dyed cornstarch in our faces as we ran 3 miles.

I'd like to use the word "run" lightly, because the run, despite the different run start times, still ended up being a "cluster_ _ _ _" for lack of better words. I agree that this is a "fun" run so what are us "serious runners" doing weaving through groups of walkers? It was really cold! We just wanted to run and get it over with! The trail was so cramped up by the end that we were forced to run on the hilly wet grass to get around people. It was pretty slippery between running on the wet grass, the sidewalk, the mud, and through sidewalk puddles. There was an element of "slight danger" involved as another reviewer said. 

Will I do this again? Heck yeah! I have allergies too, so the rain kind of helped keep the color cloud at bay and instead of inhaling everything, the color stayed glued to my skin instead. We certainly felt and looked ridiculous at the end but inspite of the weather and mess, it was fun! I definitely recommend this run to people, the original Color Run!While back in Tempe for work a couple weeks ago, one of my employees and I were looking for a place to eat dinner before I had to catch a flight to Milwaukee.  I told her that we had to walk over to where Chronic Taco used to be for a moment of silence (check out my review on Chronic Taco.)  There appeared to be a business there, but we weren't sure it was open until a young man outside told us that since we were standing there, we HAD to come in.

Wow, am I ever glad that we followed his advice!

The place looks completely different from Chronic Taco (same owners, though, I'm told) and is a totally different vibe.  Since it was a Monday night during the sweltering heat that is Arizona in July, the place wasn't busy.  The very friendly (and hot) bartender told us we could sit wherever and brought us menus.  That's when I saw it....

MAC AND CHEESE BURRITO!  AHHHHHHHHHH!

Being from Wisconsin, seeing that made me very happy.  The fact that they had a vegan version made my employee happy, since she is vegan.  We both ordered ours with carne asada (mine real, hers fake) and it was by far the most delicious thing I've had in a long time.  The salsa in a bottle was heaven- great flavor, without too much cilantro, which is good, because I'm one of those rare people that cannot stand the taste of cilantro.

The only reason that I'm going with 4 stars here, instead of 5 is that had that guy not been outside to tell me that C.A.S.A. was there and open, we probably would have gone someplace else (and missed out on the heavenly mac and cheese burrito.)  There is nothing outside to lure you in.... but don't worry, I will be telling everyone how much I love it and can't wait to go back to Arizona.... which will NEVER be in July again.Great coffee (they roast their own beans), great service, very knowledgeable barista. If you like rustic and great art you'll love this little spot. I am a Fan!I tired their milk tea for the first time yesterday, OMG it was so good.  I told them that it my first time there, and they let me taste their most popular flavors and man were they good.  I think I found a new favorite placeFour things that I really like about this place: it's extremely close to my residence, it's open 24/7, it has 2 squat racks and it's not too busy in the morning. I paid for a year membership up front because I don't like any business accessing my bank account. I don't really know if the staff is nice because I'm usually gone before they arrive. 

I'd give it 5 stars but it's not too clean. The bathroom is slightly unkept and it smells. Dust and dirt throughout the gym. I wash my hands when I leave so it really doesn't affect my routine. 

Overall I recommend this gym.While pricey, this is an institution and consistent across the country.  At the Vegas location, the waiter will ask you about what you like and then arrange the menu for you.  The sushi was delicious, and the sides were great as well such as the sashimi salad and soft shell crab.

I personally am not a fan of the black cod, but many people like it (oh ma gawd ya hafta get da black cawd) can be heard uttered by many a patron.  I prefer to stick to the sushi.

Oh and the drinks are delicious.  When you go to the bathroom, make sure that you remember where your table is.  I got lost as did many I saw coming back from a pee break.Nice atmosphere. Friendly, knowledgeable staff. Appetizers consist of, in most cases, five Little bites of whatever you order. Entrees are also small. Of course we tried the black cod miso. It was tasty, but nothing spectacular.  Our favorite item was the yellowtail jalapeno sashimi. Dining there was a very good experience, it was a "tasting event."  We were very satisfied, left happy. Our bill for two, not including the tip was about $234 including two cocktails.I pass Firehouse Subs several times a week and finally decided to stop in to try... Well it was well worth it.  The 'Steamer' sub I ordered was AWESOME!  

I compare to a Quiznos in style but much better quality in my opinion.  The bread is fantastic.  And it is always great to see a big Saturday crowd looking to be in full enjoyment.

The place is clean, comfortable, smells incredible, and the people I interacted with were very friendly and happy to have my business.  I will definitely be back and highly recommend to anyone looking for a great sandwich.  

I am withholding one star only because I have yet to try more of their sandwiches.I stumbled upon Weeziana while reading Desert Companion while getting coffee. I told my wife that there is a place that has excellently reviewed gumbo. Cajun based food is rare here in Vegas so we had to try. My wife and I along with our daughter went today and we are not disappointed. The gumbo was spicy and filled with lots of wonderful cajun style meats. I love spicy food so this was right up my alley. My wife had the Shrimp Po' Boy which was delicious as well. We talked with the owner and she was very nice lady. We told her we would write a review and invite friends so that is what  we are doing. Go check out this excellent food for a super affordable price! Next time I am getting a Po' Boy for myself along with some Slap Yo Mama Bread Pudding. I'll be back!A wide vairety of movies with lots of showtimes, nice plus!! This theater is fairly new so the sound is crisp and the screens are beautiful, all surrounded in a contemporary design. Theater was clean and tidy, the seats were comfy and roomy, and the temperature was just right.

Note: you get what you pay for, $10.75 a ticket mid-week night just FYI.Wow. 

I will tell you why I would have given this five stars.
This place just doesn't stop partying, there is a very young crowd as well, I could tell I was not the only one here to celebrate spring break/ my 21st birthday. The staff here are always smiling, and always pleasant. They will do just about anything to make your stay more pleasurable. When we first arrived to the hotel, a very drunken lady came up to my boyfriend (ladies do not leave your man alone here) and began to kiss his cheeks and hold him with a ninja grip, though I quickly intervened, the staff quickly called security and took care of the situation, they apologized a lot for that, so I wont take away that 5th star for that because that drunk lady (at 7 at night mind you) was not their fault.

The odds at the tables are great, and this was of course my first time gambling, every one of the people helped us out and taught us how to play, taught us the rule book, and helped us make our betting decisions. I walked away with a couple hundred bucks, and I am not complaining. And all of the bartenders are very nice and recommend their fav drinks if you ask them. When I went to the luxor, they were a little bitchy about suggesting anything. And the drink the luxor guy suggested was GROSS. 

The only down side:

-18 dollars for one cape cod cocktail!!!
-music playing non stop, I think they stop playing it only between the hours of 4am and 10am. Not enough for me thank you. And it seems to be the same playlist?
-Non stop smoke....but thats Vegas for you. My lungs hurt!If you stay here I would suggest the main tower.  They actually have doors that open up to a balcony.As long as you have a car, it's a good place to stay since it's off the strip.  There are plenty of taxis waiting if you want to go that route too.  The room was updated, modern, had nice comfy beds.  The only complaint we had was that the safe malfunctioned.  My husband wasn't able to get it open.  Three different employees had to come open it.  It took them about 45 minutes.  They waived the ridiculous $20 resort fee after my husband complained.  The best thing is that you hear good music throughout the hotel and casino, not the regular stuff you hear in the other hotels.  If you like to workout, take advantage of the gym.  It is very well equipped and it's part of the resort fee anyway.I used the Priceline "N.Y.O.P." option to book a relatively cheap 3-night Summer Family Getaway to Vegas and must admit that I was initially disappointed with the result. Online reviews aren't favorable and everyone complains about the High Daily Resort fee. (All of the decent Vegas Casinos are heading towards a $25/night charge now. Call the hotel before checking-in so your not surprised at the Front Desk)        

Sidenotes before I go into a Pro/Con List: Yes, the pool music is loud but it only adds to the atmosphere. Yes, there is a Cigarette/Mary Jane aroma. You're in Vegas, get your ass out of the room. After 72 hours, I caved and decided I'm a Fan...

PRO's
- $20 Room Upgrade Trick was Successful (Paradise Tower Rooms are significantly better than Casino Tower. Especially when comparing the bathroom size)
- Beds: Comfortable and Clean  
- Pool Area: Sunday Rehab Pool party is still lively after all these years
- Mr. Lucky's 777 Special (Salad, Mashed Potatoes, Steak & Shrimp for $7.77)  
- Casino Layout: Especially if you like Music Memorabilia  
- Lots of places Convenient & Liquor Stores nearby

CON's
- Off the Strip. (Run App showed 0.89 miles from Front Desk to Strip not 0.4 miles that I read online)
- Coupons given at Check-in are a joke
- Casino empty at times. Where is everyone?Came here for Mother's Day breakfast! It was awesome! Dezarae was great with suggestions and helped us make our decisions.

I got to try the chicken fried steak, gooey mess scramble, banana pecan French toast, and oatmeal for myself. It's no wonder this place has such great reviews! It all was delicious... Oh and don't let me forget about the fresh squeezed orange juice!

Great place for breakfast! Definitely will be back.6/22/13

4 stars for my first visit to Giant Rustic Pizza!  Prior to my call for takeout, I called to ask a few questions regarding allergy issues I have with corn- does GRP use corn meal in the production of the crusts?  How about in the oven?  (Some restaurants don't use corn meal to help add crunch to their crusts, but a LOT of places use it to keep the bottoms of the pizzas from sticking to the oven floor, and this sadly keeps me from enjoying past favorites and from trying new places that are on everyone's list of bookmarks.  I'm happy to report that GRP does not use corn meal at all.  The person on the phone was very helpful in answering my questions, and for those that he couldn't answer himself, he offered to ask those in the kitchen who could.  After we hung up, I continued to look over GRP's webpage and decided I'd order the 14" Big Sky (cheese with five toppings) for $15 plus tax.  I normally forgo red-sauced pizzas, but something told me to try one of each, so I went for two orders of Big Sky- a white pizza with ricotta, spinach, artichokes, seasoned feta, and garlic, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/giant-rustic-pizza-scottsdale?select=VP28FVb81R7KblTMVv_nDw#VP28FVb81R7KblTMVv_nDw and a red pizza with Italian sausage, pepperoni, ricotta, spinach, and artichokes. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/giant-rustic-pizza-scottsdale?select=9QDrj92eJNOydcrH78tYCQ#9QDrj92eJNOydcrH78tYCQ  I vaguely remember saying something like "Oh, but these photos online of the crusts don't look like thin-crusts to me," to which the GRP rep said, "but we can do thin-crusts, if you'd like."  Oh, yes I do!
The phone rep was calm and did not seem to be in any rush and answered all of my questions.  This surprised me, since I thought the more people they could rush orders through on the phone, the more pizzas they could be baking and selling.  I suppose I'm just like many people who are used to rude service on the phone.  Thank you, GRP for being different!  :)

When I walked in to retrieve my pizzas, the two people at the cash registers were very welcoming and had big smiles for me.  Greeting customers with smiles sounds so simple, and yet this single act alone can make the receiver of the smile feel like a $100!  The staff at GRP also make it a point to open the pizza boxes to show you what your pizzas look like, and to see if they meet your approval.  These looked and smelled AMAZING, and when I got home, I found that they also tasted divine!  A little too heavy on the ricotta, but I will never complain about too much ricotta, since I can always take some off, but too little is something to whine about...  Each pizza had their merits, and I wholeheartedly recommend ordering pizzas with red sauce from here.  I am a die-hard white pizza fan, so when I tell you the red sauce is good here, you better believe it!  During my first ten years of life in Manila, I ate SO many sweet Filipino-style spaghetti, and while they were delicious enough for me, I do not favor sweet pasta sauce anymore.  GRP's is very tasty, tangy, and zesty.  I also enjoyed the white pizza-- I recommend adding the feta for a little kick, since the ricotta can be a little sweet.I'm an east coast native.  I like my pizza with zesty sauce, plenty of cheese, and a thin, crisp crust.  Giant Rustic Pizza delivered on my first two requirements more than any other place I've tried in the Valley.
I will say I didn't love their crust--too thick, not quite crispy enough.  Still the flavors were better than any other pizza I've had here (enough so that they outweigh the less than stellar crust), so I think I've found my new pizzeria!
I will note that the large pizza was pretty small.  If we were hungrier, my husband and I could easily have polished off a whole pie at dinner.My favorite club in Vegas right now!  The have pulled all the best djs in the world.  I love and hate how big this club is.  You can definitely get lost with all the different levels.  However, I love that the dance floor is big (way bigger than Marquee).  No outdoor area, so it can get a little claustrophobic.  Several bars on each floor.

I saw Tiesto in my recent trip, and it probably was the best time I have had dancing to Tiesto!  He had great lighting and performers.

Make friends with a promoter or show up early with pre-sale tickets if you want to bypass the lines.  Get a table above the dance floor for the best view.I am torn between this place but the review is for bottle service only. Came a few weeks back and saw Danny Avila and a group of us got a bottle. First off Danny tore that set up. Second besides Light which is my favorite club in Vegas the table service was premier here. I had table service at all the major clubs now in Vegas which promote EDM and this club is it. Both XS and surrender are cool but they rush you and kick you out. IMO Hakkasan not only have great hosts but the layout for table only is top notch. I will definitely come back for table ONLY as all the other reviews have mentioned the place gets packed and I wouldn't want to be out in the crowd without a table.Wow, I didn't know this place existed until today but my officemate and I had a hankering for pizza so we did a search for places that deliver and found AJ's. It wasn't the fastest I've ever had (we called when they opened, at 11 AM) so it could be that they have high volume at the start of their day because it took about 45 minutes to deliver at Epic, but it was delicious and totally worth the wait. 

We got a deep dish special with one side the Deluxe and the other half the Spicy Chicken, both excellent. I liked that their Italian sausage is good quality with a lot of flavor and they don't scrimp on the toppings. Also, the crust was chewy on the inside and crisp on the outside - just right.

Definitely would recommend to anyone in the Verona area wanting some real pizza for delivery (not Dominos or Papa Johns).Good sushi, decent prices and happy hour, good service!  I tried this place out just one so far and it was good!!  Godzilla was good.  Loved the baked scallop roll.Quick in and out. Soda's any size 79¢ always. gas is reasonably priced at this location. kids working the counter are always very polite and eager to help.When you regularly see smiling Indian faces as regulars the food has to be up to Mums standard !
 Also they support Marie Curie cancer care a worthy cause on presentation of a voucher
I magine when its busy you have to  wait longer to be served 

However be patient its good food and good value !

Try and taste the differenceOne of my new favorites! The food is great; we've been there twice and service was awesome both times. Prices are also very reasonable, especially given the quality of the food.

I had the miso ramen, my husband loved his oxtail curry. We also had a mango tuna roll (?) which was delish - the fish was really fresh. A bit too much garlic on the chili garlic edamame, but that was good as well.

The restaurant is a lot larger than it looks from the outside and is really nice inside. It looks like they have a private room. 

Would definitely recommend!Happy Hour at Bink's Midtown = YUMMY!

This past Friday I was fortunate to try out Bink's Midtown for the first time.  We were seated on the back patio and on such a beautiful night this was a real treat.  Our waitress was super friendly and honest, which is a must in my opinion.  She directed us to some great choices and we embarked on a very delightful and filling meal.

Thanks to some great happy hour pricing we tried a variety of appetizers.  We had the green garlic fritters, fried ribs, mussels, and the meatball of the day (Hawaiian).  Everything was super delicious, but I was particularly fond of the fritters and ribs... although be warned the ribs are super messy.  There was so much enticing things on the menu it was very hard to decide what to try.  We also partook in the pumpkin donuts for dessert, which I felt could have been a touch sweeter, but really with a fried cakey item, what more could I really ask for.

Bink's Midtown was super charming inside and outside. I'm looking forward to coming back soon and trying more off of their unique menu!Went here for Happy Hour. Decent wines for reduced prices. The lobster Risotto was pretty good. The lobster was a little chewy and it was not broken into small pieces. Overall a good dish and nice place. I would try a diff dish if I was ever back at EvoStopped here on a Sunday for lunch.  Shared the buffalo wings (very meaty), fried pickles, and a caesar salad. Fried pickles were awesome! They came with a chipotle ranch which went along great. 

If we'd known that they had a brunch menu, we wouldn't have eaten breakfast.   Not a huge menu, but plenty of variety. 

We ate out on the back patio which had a great vibe. Music playing and plenty of shade from the sun if wanted.I've had the opportunity to try this Firehouse Subs location twice and was definitely impressed the first time, and just slightly less impressed during my second visit.  I have fallen in love with their Firehouse Hero, but I make a few little changes.  Both times I have ordered this sandwich online and it was PERFECT.  Tonight I ordered a sandwich in person and the girl taking my order LITERALLY had to ask me to repeat EVERYTHING for my order....and it came out wrong.  It wasn't drastically wrong, so I didn't call to complain after I got home, but I will stick to placing orders online from now on.  Less trouble and they seem to pay more attention.  

The inside of the store is clean and they have an awesome Coke fountain machine that lets you customize just about anything you want to drink - a HUGE plus, but I still go to Sonic (across the street!) for my drinks.  The other reason for the missing star?  The artwork depicting a LVFD fireman turning the hose full blast on a coyote chasing a rabbit.  Not sure that they want to be condoning cruelty to animals, especially by a firefighter!Meant to stop in for happy hour apps and cocktail, but instead tried their Restaurant Week $30 three-course menu (app, entree, and dessert) and a glass of house wine (cabernet or pinot grigio), or draft.  I decided to try the Goat cheese-stuffed Peppadews, the Malbec burger (comes with Salut fries), and Chocolate cake, with a glass of cabernet to compliment the burger.

I've had peppadews stuffed with goat cheese before (at Fez), so I knew these would be tasty.  The peppers were raw (as opposed to the roasted peppadews at Fez, or that's how I recall them to be, anyway), so they added crunch to the experience, and were stuffed with a sweetened goat cheese filling, then sprinkled with herbs and drizzled with a very mild-tasting vegetable oil.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/salut-kitchen-bar-tempe?select=H7ExguXj2xipVp4CTDxM4Q#H7ExguXj2xipVp4CTDxM4Q  I ate two of the four peppadews (to pace myself for the coming burger and dessert...).

I ordered the Malbec burger without mushrooms and tomatoes (allergies), and while Maham forgot to ask how I liked the temperature, she said she asked for medium ("red in the center"), but the burger arrived without any hints of pinkness at all.  However, it was still juicy and tender.  The bun was good- looked and tasted like it may be supplied from a local bakery.  Without the mushrooms and tomatoes to temper the sweetness from the caramelized onions, this burger tasted almost too sweet.  No matter- I just took a few Salut fries, shoestring fries topped with feta and parmesan, which leant the saltiness to counter the sweet onions.  Loved the citrus vinaigrette drizzle on the fries- YUM!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/salut-kitchen-bar-tempe?select=AiLPBPynnsej5zssNM6x1g#AiLPBPynnsej5zssNM6x1g

For dessert, I had my choice of S'mores, cheesecake, or chocolate cake, and I almost can never say no to chocolate cake, especially when the description mentions a drizzle of both chocolate and white chocolate sauces, but as you can see, my dessert only came with a dark chocolate drizzle.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/salut-kitchen-bar-tempe?select=58Yym4133_Nrx9H61x2M4A#58Yym4133_Nrx9H61x2M4A  My sadness was only fleeting, as I tasted my first bite... oh, this cake tasted definitely of homemade dark chocolate batter, sauce, and ganache filling and frosting!  (No use of powdered sugar, cornstarch, or corn syrup- I asked!)  One of the best-tasting chocolate layered cakes I've tasted in a long time, complete with semi-sweet mini-chocolate chips on the outside edge...  Not very sweet, so I ate about half of it- oops!  :)

I hadn't planned on participating in Restaurant Week this season, but I'm glad to be able to recommend Salut's participation.  Thank you, Salut and Maham, for making RW fun again!Pickles, Pickles Pickles ! It was only after my 3rd visit that I got  pickle chips on a sandwich and I have to say they were the best Pickle I have yet to try in al my nearly 5 decades here on earth! 

The Sandwich I had yesterday was weird though tasty, I kinda thought they made a mistake and gave me tuna. It was THE TURKEY,The Turkey meat was in shreds and very wet, that with the pickles, peppers, mustard, mayo and vegies It was a conundrum.

I wanted the same sandwich I had a few days prior but I didn't recognize it on the menu, I now know it was THE ITALIAN. This sandwich is so fresh with great meats and fresh toppings it was a winner and I was both Happy and Sad I had to share it with a hungry coworker.

My first impression last week on my first visit, I had the CAPISTRAMI, It was highly recommended by the cashier and although I have never wanted ordered a Ruben, I must say the sandwich was a solid 9 out of 10.

I love the location of this new Capriotties, It's a very welcome addition of fast casual restaurants that scatter the area I work in. Americas Taco Shop, Qudoba, Paradise Bakery are weak options and I almost would rather go hungry. That problem is solved with Capriotties now in the hood.

What needs work are the side options, as of now only chips, I hope they work on that! 

What doesn't need work is the sandwiches and Ultra helpful, professional, and extra friendly staff.

Welcome to Old Town CAPRIOTTIES!!!!! Keep up The Great work!!!!!While the service was very good and friendly, the price quote for glasses was simply outrageous.  The exam price itself was a little higher than others, but not terribly so, and the service was excellent.  However the glasses were about 40% more than my previous optometrist who also provided great service.  I decided not to buy from them, but would consider using them for the exams in the future.

If the glasses prices were reasonable, it would be a five-star place.Al pastor and carne asada are awesome.This place is located near the cross streets of st.rose and eastern right next to subways.

Price: $7.99 for buffet! A STEAL FOR SURE.

Service: Meh, it could definitely be alot better. They're pretty slow, whenever a customer finishes eating they don't usually clean up the table until a couple minutes earlier or until you point it out. Everything is pretty much do it yourself, don't expect anyone to come by and refill your glass, there's a pitcher in the back and you refill it there.

Food: There is no end to the variety of food they have!!!! I've been to this place twice and they always have different things which is a plus in book. Pancit, sigsig, kaldereta, soup, turon, fried rice, and lechon are just a few of the selection they carry.

Ambiance: The place is somewhat crowded, if you come when all the tables are full you'll just have to wait until a group leaves. The first time I went the a/c and debit/credit machine weren't up, but they both seem to be working now. 

I'll definitely be back here, it's a pretty good place if you're hanging out with a friend and want to go to a cheap place to eat and talk.Perfect place to go to get away from the normal breakfast places that litter las vegas. Slightly on the pricey side though. I got the stuffed French toast my first visit. Filled beautifully and tasted amazing. Second time I got the captain America, which was basically a typical breakfast sandwich, but for some reason tasted way better than I expected. Overall great atmosphere, good food, slightly pricey.My father-in-law was visiting from CT. and both him and my husband love seafood so found Little Cleo's on yelp and decided to try it out. Parking is insane, so we went with the complimentary valet. I really liked the open atmosphere of the place and service was fast and friendly. I was not impressed with the menu.They have what's called a small plate and large plate option and it seemed the only way to get crab legs was on the large plate option and was basically $40 a plate. Didn't really say anything was with it or the size of the portion. The small plate had crab in a jar which didn't sound too appetizing. They only had one steak on the menu so I went with it, the new york strip and potatoe rosti. My meat wasn't cooked right and sat on what I can only describe as overcooked hashbrowns that were to crunchy to eat. I asked for a long island and they said they don't normally make them but they could make one for me.? Ended up ordering the sour cherry paloma off thier spirits list which was amazing! Im giving 4 stars because the seafood lovers I were with, both ordered the bouillabaisse and said it was amazing. Also Im not going to base my review off a steak. Its obvious Im too redneck for a place like this anyways. lol..  The service was good and we all had a great time overall. :)I've been stalking Taco Guild for months now. Every time I'd go to Starbucks next door, I'd creep on Taco Guild, snapping pics of the structure and the dope typography on the wall. Being sure, of course, to upload it on Instagram and hash-tag it with things like #omgtacos #imadesigner #typographynerd #wheredemtacos. So as you can imagine, when they finally opened, I was quite excited and had high hopes for the restaurant.

First of all, there was a lot of meticulous thought put into this entire concept. Being a designer/art director, I know what it takes to maintain a level of consistency throughout a restaurant. This place was just excellent in terms of execution and aesthetic. The actual building itself was gorgeous, and I'm a huge sucker for stained glass windows. Everything from the logo, to the murals, to the design of the menu - color me impressed. Which is the color of chartreuse, I heard. Anyway, we all know why I really went - to stuff my chipmunk cheeks with savory tacos. You can have awesome design, but the food is key (duh). I started off with the chips and salsa - pretty standard, good salsa. Whatevs. I was particularly hungry, so I ordered 3 tacos and 2 sides. I had the peking duck, molida lamb, and guild chicken with a side of red beans and grilled corn. The tacos were very delicious, I loved the unique toppings and flavors to all 3. My favorite however was definitely the lamb. The sides didn't disappoint either, both were packed with flavor and by the time I had consumed everything, I was quite plump and happy. There was no way I could eat any more food and...oh what's that? You have a prickly pear sorbet? Sure I'll take that as well. This turned out to be an excellent idea, as it was the perfect amount of sweetness to satisfy my sweet tooth. 

So why the 4 stars instead of 5, Lindi K.? Cause I felt like it yo! Just kidding. It's because I felt the food was a wee bit overpriced (but not surprised by this) and because the tacos weren't as good as Taqueria Los Yaquis, which is literally $1 for a taco. Although, Taco Guild does have a bar...bonus. No matter though, the entire concept was impressive and I had a lovely time there. I think this place will do very well.Beautiful design,  and I would check this place out for that reason alone. The menu was fun, & just the right amount of options.  We only did happy hour, but everything we tried was delicious.  Definitely want to go back again.  Plus, the valet service they offered there was top notch!One of the very few restaurants in Phoenix that has pleased me. The margaritas are tasty and strong, the tacos are quite delish, and our server Laura was a sweetie pie and attentive. My only complaint: We all thought is was pretty disgusting that there are no doors covering doorways to the bathrooms. Yes, you don't walk directly into the bathroom, but when you are sitting anywhere near the open doorways, which lead to a tiled "bathroom looking" area, it can be enough to turn your stomach. Why not cease the opportunity to place another beautiful and creative piece of woodwork? Come on, Mr. Fox.I love the hanging by the pool at night with the firepits and the absolutely enormous hot tub that is open until 2 am.  H2o bar located conveniently by the hot tub to relax with cocktail in hand.Great place to get fast healthy food, but I do hate how all the bowls are the same price. We ordered the Toyko Bay and the Gulf of Mexico. The Tokyo Bay was worth the $10 because it was delicious, fulfilling, and had salmon. The Gulf of Mexico was just an overpriced Spinach salad and it was bland. My advice is to read the ingredients carefully and make sure you're getting your money's worth!I've driven past this place many times...finally went and was impressed.  It was clean, the people were friendly, and they had a good salsa bar. 

Highlights were the habanero salsa, the green salsa, al pastor tacos, and the street corn (elote).  The corn was very flavorful and huge...and they actually brought two ears of corn for one of my friends because they said that they didn't have enough large ears. I will be back for more elote and that salsa.  
Stay away from the fish tacos...not very good (but at least it wasn't fried!).Had a very good experience today at the Café for lunch.  Their black bean soup is great and, moving here from Miami, that says something!  Ordered the Burger, it was great and had wonderful spices and sauce.  The staff was as friendly and helpful as could be.  Very pleasant environment.  Will definitely return.I'm thinking some of the bad reviews may be from evening visits? We typically come in for lunch and the service is always very friendly and attentive.  However, went in for dinner one night and there is a huge difference - evening crew needs some definite customer service training and the food was poor quality as well.

But, the good stuff we love:

Chicken tacos - delicious!  Traditional street taco style, plenty of meat, great sauces (green sauce needs a bit more flavor)
Chicken enchilada - my FAVE!  The red sauce is fabulous!
The salsa (pico de gallo style) is always fresh and chips have always been fresh and crispy
Maui Bowl - very good teriyaki, not oversauced


The not-so-good:

I ordered chicken tortilla soup hoping for a Mexican-style tortilla soup but instead got a bowl of what could have been Progresso chicken noodle with some tortilla strips on top.  No taste, definitely not what I had in mind for "tortilla soup" - very disappointing.

The choices of rice and beans is a little weird - plain white or brown rice and either black beans or Cajun beans.  My husband enjoys these options and the portions are generous and always cooked well, but I always opt for ala carte because none of those really appeal to me.

Some of the items are a little pricey - for instance, the Wahoo's Salad is a very bare bones, basic salad for almost $8.  But my ala carte enchilada with chips and salsa for under $5...I could eat that every day.This is Michael Mina at his casual best!  An American pub;  Skeptical poker buds and I walk in ready to be insulted but were pleasantly surprised.  Straight to it, the food.

Remember, Mina is a master of seafood; namely lobster so...

There back!  Lobster corn dogs.  Incredibly sweet chunks of perfectly cooked lobster in a crispy, fluffy, semi sweet corn dog coating with a tangy whole grain mustard and crème fraiche.  Simply put, good eats.

Other starters such as the duck spring rolls with ginger chili dipping sauce, mint and cilantro (excellent with the earthy flavor of moist duck accented by a decent "Asian" dipping sauce that brings forth the flavor of the oily duck meat and a great, light, crisp tempura or maitake mushrooms in a soy, scallion dipping sauce are excellent.  As with all Mina's restaurants, try what sounds different.  While not authentic Asian, still very good flavors.

For larger plates, the Lobster roll with jalapeno creamed corn is excellent.  It's not Northeast authentic but who cares.  Rich, perfectly cooked lobster in a crisp, buttery roll surrounded by a very spicy creamed corn.  The flavor of the jalapeno brings a rich chili taste that contrast well with the sweet, cold water lobster.  The Korean BBQ salmon burger is also good eats.  Soy marinated, cooked medium, and accompanied by cucumber kimchi and ginger aioli is incredibly well balanced.  Complex texture.  Simply delicious.

Great pub style service.  Friendly and correct.

Nice selection of craft cocktails and infusions.  Solid but not too creative beer list.  OK wine list.  Vegas resort pricing.

A worthy replacement for Seablue.This is my 3rd time here in 2 weeks time. The food is so yummy! Best fried shrooms I have ever had anywhere. 
The food is 5 star. I give 4 stars because nothing on the cocktail list catches my fancy and I am not a beer drinker. If I was a beer drinker then I probably would give them 5 stars.
I've had the Greek salad- Very flavorful with awesome lamb meat balls
Fried mushrooms with scallion sauce- So addictive it was embarrassing how fast I ate them.
1842 Hamburger- I am officially voting this as the best burger on the strip.
Duck Spring rolls- Wrap them in the lettuce for extra flavor. They are so good!
Kale Caesar- Surprisingly good
I will be a regular.I was heading over to south LV and saw Amanta Real Thai which use to be a Chinese restaurant months ago. Parking was plentiful at lunch and the interior is decorated modern.

The waiter took my drink order -Thai ice tea which was huge. For lunch I went with the boat noodles which were delish. I measure how decent a Thai joint is by the boat noodles and Amanta hit a home run. The beef was lean and the broth was similar to my favorite Thai restaurants in Hollywood Cali. The portion wasn't huge so I had room for a scoop of coconut ice cream which had chocolate drizzled, then topped with peanuts. 

Overall a solid lunch and I'm looking forward to returning for dinner on my next visit to Las Vegas.Ok, do not get the "fire chicken" unless you like plain grilled (bland) chicken.  Do get the pork or the grilled sirloin if you want an amazing flavor experience.  I tried half sirloin and half pork over noodles and it was amazing.  I really am starting to love this place!Big MJ and Jackson fan here, and the show did not disappoint. Few things to mention:

Pro:

The music selection was diverse enough to transition well

The theater was intimate and acoustics good. 

One featured dancer is quite flexible with a pole! 

Con: 

It was way too damn cold!!! To the point of knocking off a star, as I was often too uncomfortable. Pulled me out of the performance. 

Featured dancer used too much, took away from some of his neat tricks to see them again.

The guitar player was also used too much and was annoying. 

Ushers did not hold people from coming nonstop through the aisles during the songs. They need to make them wait for breaks in the show.Finally made my way over to SkinnyFats last weekend and I can't wait to make it back. Love the concept and the food was delicious. Service was just fine and the place is packed... considering its location in a business park, I was impressed they were slammed for lunch on a Saturday.
 Chix on Broadway - delicious. Too much lemon aioli for me but that's just a preference and I know for next time to ask for it on the side. 
Phatty Philly - good size and taste but not really a philly. A philly has shaved or thinly sliced meat... not chunks of meat. Not that I'm complaining about taste because the meat was good.. but when you see Philly its what you expect and what we ordered it for. 
Fries - we had garlic fries and sweet potato and both were a win.
Can't wait to go back! So much to try.
Eat HAPPY!!If you're looking for a casual place to hang out with a relaxing patio, this spot is it. Great prices and the fish tacos are yummy. So is the fish n chips and the ice cream sandwich for dessert. My daughter gives this place two thumbs up and she is not easy to please!So happy this place opened if only for the Grand Buffet at lunch. I don't know about the weekend buffets, but my Dad and I are very happy about the Grand Buffet. For a price you would pay at some fast food places, you get to pick and choose at a well-stocked salad bar, the hot bar, and fresh fruit. The hot bar has a server that dishes up what you want, usually meatloaf with sides, chicken, fried fish or baked fish, or something similar. Also, included in the price of the Grand is the Chinese and Italian food bars. Even more inexpensive is the Chinese buffet bar by itself. It must be popular, as I see many people getting just that. The dining room is very clean.

The only thing is if you go in late to lunch, you may find the server that takes your drink order disappear. I would not suggest getting coffee if you want a refill.

The rest of the store is fantastic to walk around in on a cold winters day. The Hy-vee brands of products are moderately priced and they are always having sales.I have lived in Chicago and have rarely found compatible gyros here in Arizona. This place delivers. Great taste and very juicy not dry. Will defenatly go back.Only complaint I have with this location is that the drive thru time takes quite a while, other then that clean restaurant, friendly staff, and.... Good food I guess. 4 stars!Yummy food, we shared nachos and a burger. The service was good, friendly staff. Although they advertise the best margaritas in Vegas, they were out of the stuff to make them.We went there for a couple's date and sat at a lovely table on the patio. It faced Gilbert Road, adjacent to Postinos and it was very loud. However, the music slightly drowned out the street sounds. The service overall was ok. Our waitress came around to check on us periodically but I understood as it was a busy Friday evening.  We were first served chips and salsa.  You could tell the chips were made fresh and the salsa was good not great. I ordered the cucumber mint tequila drink. So refreshing, but paying $8 for this it was a little weak. My friend got the almond horchata with frangelico. It was good  not too sweet, but I felt it didn't have enough horchata flavour. For an appetizer, we ordered the queso dip. I'd give it a 3.5 out of 5. Now on to the tacos...we were all very confused by what they meant by "family style". All it means is they come on taco trays not in any sort of order. You get one taco $3 to 4. The best at our table was the shrimp, braised beef, chicken tinga and Baja. We also had two sides...black beans (So very good, probably cooked with ham as they were very rich) and rice (didn't finish it as it was dry and slightly bland). Our table agreed we would come back perhaps during their happy hour,  which is from open to 5 everyday, as the bill racked up quickly from everything being al la carte. At the end of the dinner, we had a chance to meet the manager and he was delighted to know we found it because of yelp. So next time I have my eyes set on one of their tamales. Yum! We will see how that goes...This is a cute little Italian joint. My friend and I went at 645 and it was busy but we barely had to wait 10 minutes and they suggested that we stop in at the turf for a drunk first(the bar next door). It was nice in there but a lot of green lighting, which doesn't really make anyone look good. We got our table and sat outside. The service was quick but not very careful. At first when our pizza came out, there were no plates, napkins or the toppings they are supposed to bring  with it. We asked for those things and the napkins didn't show up until we were almost finished.

The pizza was delicious, we got the one that starts with an a, I don't recall the exact name. I would defiantly eat here again. 

One other thing was we both ordered a glass of the White House wine and it tasted like what I imagine pee tastes like. It was pretty gross, I'd suggest you splurge a little and go for a more expensive wine, you will probably have better luck.Fox Cigar in NE Mesa is pretty nice. Very nicely decorated, and the humidor is fantastic. I am not a huge cigar guy, but every now and then like to throw down a nice puff. I liked the selections, and will most likely return again. The guys behind the counter were very friendly and I felt good going inside here. Perhaps my cigar collection will soon match my wine selection.We worked up a hunger at the gym and up the street, there just happened to be a Grand Opening for Café Zupas so we figured, why not?

There was a line out the door for one reason-50% off your bill....WHAT!?!?!? Luckily the line moved swiftly and I was already in attack mode! Their system is quick, easy, and painless:

1) Order your salads and sandwiches
2) Order your soups(toppings are additional charge)
3)Order desserts and drinks....pay for your order

After you pay for your order, a worker is waiting at the end of the line offering to take your tray to your table for you!?!? Oh, and each order comes with a chocolate covered strawberry, so if you choose not to get a dessert, you still end your meal with something sweet....:)

Here's what we got:
Nuts About Berries Salad
Berry Mango Salad
BBQ Pulled Pork Sandwich
Crab and Avocado Panini
Cauliflower Soup
Lobster Bisque
Rocky Road Brownie
Salted Caramel Crème Brulee

Everything was tasty, and the price for all this???? Just over $13 dollars!
Great for the kids too, and Zupas won't break the bank either. Another unheard of thing is that they DO NOT accept tips AND they will clean up after you too! Hey, they may be on to something positive???? Welcome to the 702 Café Zupas! Now if only the folks at Chik-Fil-A follow your lead(CZ is out of Utah) that could be another win-win situation!   ALOHA!!!Places was pretty cool. Seems like a moma and poppa place. The girls were friendly and my daughter loved the selection. The only thing missing was bacon but I didn't ask. Delicious ice cream!!!During my recent visit I had the 608 burger.  I ordered it medium rare and with a side of grilled seasonal vegetables. The burger was perfectly cooked, but the sunny side up egg that sat on top was not cooked enough for my liking. I absolutely love a runny yolk, but I do no like gooey translucent egg whites still on my egg. I went along by scraping off the gooey egg whites off  and proceeded with the burger. I didn't want to bother with ordering another egg because the bartender was busy putting Christmas decorations. The highlight of the dish were the grilled vegetables. There were green beans, zucchini, mushrooms, and carrots. They were delicious! Veggies had great seasoning and seemed to have some sort of sauce, but that may have been the natural juices of the vegetables. I do plan on stopping by again for the grilled veggies. If I do get an egg, I will make sure to specify over medium!Very good and healthy!  Coffee was so so.  Juices very good. Prices about a dollar too much.  Friendly service.I recently heard of this empanada restaurant and I just had to make sure I would go and try it out.  I lived in South America for 2 years and empanadas was a food that I ate just about every day down there.  At the Republica Empanada, I ordered the ham and cheese, buffalo chicken, and the beef (El Capitan).  The ham and cheese and the El Capitan were very good and they tasted pretty much like the ones I ate in Paraguay.  I was not impressed with the buffalo chicken empanada.  I love buffalo wings, but this empanada did not have the "buffalo" flavor that I was expecting.  They used gorgonzola in the buffalo chicken empanada, so that may be the reason I could not taste and "buffalo" flavor.  We also ordered yuca frita (fried yuca) with was good.  In Paraguay, you pretty much have mandioca (yuca, cassava) with every meal you eat.  It was nice to eat yuca frita again.  If you like empanadas, give this place a try, it is good.Stopped in for burgers before ball game. Food has good flavor meat was thick and juicy. Prices are on the higher end but would go there again when back in town.Located inside the Mandalay Bay across from the Minus 5 bar, Rx Boiler Room is a great place to have dinner or grab a quick drink.  I came here for restaurant week a few months ago with my boyfriend and a couple friends.  I dig it.  I can't quite remember what I had, but I think it was a chicken dish.  Obviously nothing to rave home about because I can barely remember what it was.  My friends got the skirt steak meal, which looked pretty good.  Loved their unique cocktails and desserts.  I got the milk and cookies which are served up fresh and hot on a slate with a little carafe of milk.  Adorable.  

The ambiance is dark and kinda folk-artsy.  It's cute.  Think Burning Man but all foodied up lol... The service was great.  They gave pretty good suggestions with what to do for restaurant week.  I'd love to come by here again to check out the rest of the items on their menu.  Definitely one of Mandalay Bay's finer restaurant options.I ate here with 3 friends around 5pm on a Saturday. One of my friends had a sore throat and was looking for a specific whiskey to help her throat. The restaurant did not carry the whiskey so our waitress went to ask her manager if my friend would be able to go get her drink from the casino and bring it in. Next thing we knew the waitress came back with the whiskey. She went outside the restaurant and tracked it down and only charged her $10 for it. Fabulous service for such a casual place. The pizza was delicious as well. Very rich and filling so I would definitely recommend sharing or just ordering a slice. I had the farmstead pizza and it was amazing. All very delicious and fresh ingredients. I will definitely be coming back for more.Pizza Rock is one of the newest additions to Downtown 3rd, located right across the street from the brand spanking new Downtown Grand.

Not quite sure where the best place to park is for free parking. I ended up going to the Binion's garage (free 3 hour parking with validation). It's just a short walk away (1 block).

A Sunday brunch stroll in was welcoming. Not too busy, friendly staff. We decided to start off with the Salumi & Formaggio Board and a Margherita pizza, which apparently is a signature pizza they're proud of. Ended the meal with a tiramisu dessert.

Salumi & Formaggio Board: Assorted meats and cheeses, candied walnuts, focaccia toast and fig jam. I enjoyed this. One of the lighter options to start off your meal.

Margherita pizza: The pizza was quite tasty. You can tell they used some great ingredients in this. Split between 2 people, this pizza satisfied us, but it's not a heavy pizza. The ravenous might want to go for one of the heftier pizza options.

Tiramisu: Really tasty and creamy, served in a glass. Not a huge dessert, but makes for a good closing. 

All in all, a great experience here. One thing I noticed on the way out is that they have weekly specials that use ingredients purchased at the Downtown 3rd Farmers Market. I'm going to have to give those a try on my next go around. There are also huge TVs located at every corner which made it great for us to watch the football game during our meal.This place has a great craft beer selection and awesome scratch made food made with fresh ingredients! Super friendly staff too...A great escape from big casinos. More IPA's on tap would be the one area that could use improvement but that's just me...Solid burgers and fries! Love that they give you the options to mix and match the type of protein with the different topping options. 

The only downside is the price. They are pretty expensive for a burger, but definitely worth a try!For my 400th review: sushi - that seems like a lot since I've only been Yelping for a little bit over a year. One of my favorite things is sushi and here's a new place to try.

I went here with a group of Yelpers (thanks Tony!). Signage still says Kabuki and even the tea cups still say Kabuki as well. It's easy to miss if you didn't know this place exists. It's in the Target complex on Maryland and Flamingo.

We tried a bunch of nigiri, rolls, desserts, etc. My favorites out of everything we tried were pink scallops, sashimi salad, salmon belly nigiri, wasabi tobiko nigiri, unagi nigiri, soft-shell crab, black sesame manger, plum ice cream and green tea Panna cotta.

The pink scallops were fresh and topped with roe. Sashimi salad has shrimp tempura, tuna and salmon. Salmon belly nigiri was nice and fatty. Wasabi tobiko was pretty and yummy. Unagi was nice and smokey. Uni is served differently here. The rice isn't wrapped in nori with the uni on top. I've been a recently-converted soft-shell crab fan - I've had one too many bad soft-shell crabs back in the day that didn't deserve my precious allergic reaction time. Theirs is lightly breaded, crispy and yummy.

They have a good selection of desserts which are all great. For AYCE, it's only less than $25/person for dinner. That's really cheap for quality sushi.Came in for an early dinner since they offer dinner at 300 pm. Thanks to fellow yelper Barbie S for turning me on to Sakana.

For less then $24.00 a person I enjoyed the AYCE made to order sushi. In addition they had 2 for 1 Sapporo beers. The sushi was fresh and the rice amount was not overwhelming to the ration of sashimi. The menu included sweet shrimp and uni but there's a limit of one order per person on these items. My faves were the cooked pork belly, soft shell crab roll, shrimp tempura, Sashimi roll & Chirasi salad. Lastly the green tea pannacotta and strawberry & mango mochi were a yummy way to complete the meal.

BTW. The sign on the business outside states Kabuki - but no worries your'e in the right place.Once upon a time, I tried the Short Leash Dogs food truck at a the first play date at the Children's Museum. I've longed to get back to them again since that time.  I finally did and I absolutely loved it! I love the naan for a bun and the kettle chips were amazing! I had an extremely difficult time trying to choose which thing to try, everything looked yummy!  I can't wait to try more of the menu, next time!I had a HORRIBLE day and nothing was going right.  I was supposed to meet up with friends here, but my car battery died along with another whole string of events that I will spare you...the dear waiter had heard of all the atrocities that had happened to me and offered to pick me up on his break and guaranteed I would have a better day.  I toted my butt in a cab over and everyone was way ahead but having a blast.  Matt our waiter was fantastic, but unfortunately as I arrived it was time for him to clock out.  He was very charming and funny though; you are lucky if you have him as a server.  

Matt was replaced by Macy who was also a doll and kept the draft beer flowing.  She hooked me up with two flavors of wings on my small order and gave me a huge bowl of celery to lap up the yummy sauces.  

Unfortunately my 49ers lost, and they had huge big screens to remind me of that!  Haha!  All and all this is a good sports bar, lots of TVs, big bar, great specials, and outstanding service.  My wings were just okay and seemed a bit pricey to me, but the beer was cheap to make up for it.  I will definitely be back for beer and sports because the service was impeccable and it is close to home!I came here to get some Pho Ga.  I have only had Pho a handful of times before this visit, and I wanted to get another taste before a trip to Vietnam.  One thing I really like about this restaurant is that the attention to customers seems to be important here.  Many Asian places don't seem to place a lot of interest on customer service, but I felt that we were well taken care of here.  I am seeing some of the reviews of bad customer service, but I had good one.  The taste was pretty good as I felt nice and warm afterwards.Hey guys, 
    If you're in the area and in the mood for some good boba with great service, then give OMG a shot.  From the first time I've been here to the last time, great service is what I got.  On top of that, they have some of the tastiest and warmest boba around.  I'm happy that OMG opened up in my gf's hood because it eliminates those days of having to drive to Chinatown to get my boba fix.  OMG hasn't been around long and they will soon have snow slush.  In the meantime, you can smoothies and slush with a plethora of flavors. My drink of choice...just an iced coffee or a hot coffee with boba.  This has also been the only thing that I ever get here.  If it ain't broke, why fix it? Right?  Obviously, I'm a fan of boba and a fan of OMG.  See you here. 

PS:  The owners are great.  Next time you're here, say hello to Kevin.  He's the little secret behind OMG's success.



YELP PERSONAL CHALLENGE - (044/366)I would give this place 4.5 stars if I could.  Being from the OC, I have access to some of the best boba on the west coast.  OMG Boba Tea definitely contends.  

First of all it looks like a typical, simple boba place.  The first thing I noticed was a table in the front covered in fresh fruit.  I ordered a large mango slush with boba and my brother ordered a large mocha slush.  

The mango slush is so thick and refreshing, you can taste the fresh mangos.  Most boba places use powder and artificial sweetener.  I can definitely appreciate that the drink never separated.  The boba isn't the best, but the mango slush made up for that.  My brother's mocha slush was alright.  I want to try their popping boba next time.

The prices are great as well.  A large is $4.80, something you hardly see in SoCal.  I can't even finish it!  The location is great as my family lives in Summerlin and we don't have to drive out to Chinatown.

I am a huge fan and will be returning shortly in the hot summer!I was surprised at how small this place is and even more surprised at how comfortable the chairs were. This would be a great place to go for a casual date, I think. They have a fairly small menu with few vegetable options so I opted for the the tofu and basil dish and Max had the beef curry. He thought the curry was okay but I LOVED what I ordered! This tofu dish was presented almost like a work of art. (see picture below!)We visited Ohjah on our Groupon mission and were pleasantly surprised with overall value and quality of the meal. 

We decided not to go with the hibachi grill as all members of the party has to opt for the grill.   However I am a sucker for the hibachi grill fried rice. I dont know it is - probably the child hood visits to Benihana and the buttery goodness seeping from the rice.  But Ohjah provides a more affordable experience of what you can get from Benihana.

The fried rice was perfect with huge chunks of chicken, not over cooked.  We ordered the sashimi combo which came with 20 pieces.  This was such a bargain.  5 pieces of tuna, salmon, yellow tail, garlic tuna, and super white tuna.  The pieces were gigantic, fresh and for $23 was worth it.

We'll be back for their hibachi.  There s no real big specialty items that i saw but overall everything was cooked to perfection and we were provided with great service - will be back to one of their many locations in vegas.My boyfriend and I have been here a few times now, and we always leave quite satisfied. The fish quality is great, and they have great dinner specials. I mean, 3 specialty rolls for $25.00 is a phenomenal deal! The service is always pleasant, and the restaurant ambiance is relaxing. If you are looking for good sushi at great prices, I recommend Ohjah.Nice to have Brat und Brau back in Madison!  Carla, our waitperson, was very friendly and attentive.  Brats and fries were as expected; pork cutlet very tender and tasty.  Coleslaw could use some improvement.  We will certainly come back again!I pass by here all the time, because I frequent the ice rink across the street. Had to check it out Friday night when I was done skating, and I was glad I did. They had just opened that weekend (Aug 16-17) so like any other new place they have some kinks to work out but I think they have the potential to be something great. The décor was a slightly upscale western style, and felt comfortable to me. It looks like they get a DJ and dancing going on weekend nights, which I wasn't able to stick around long enough to see, but it sounds like a fun idea.

I got the meatloaf sandwich which came with bacon and gravy and was served open-faced. on Texas toast. Very filling and delicious! My friend kept it simple and got the grilled cheese which came with cheddar, mozzarella, and bacon.

They have a breakfast menu with a good variety of skillets and burritos you can get, but they only serve breakfast on Saturday and Sunday mornings. I will be back to try that out!It seems that Chi-town has come to me even though I just moved away from there! There's a few Rosatis in Chi-town that I've had pizza in. Now, it's no Pizzano's in downtown but it will suffice for being 1,500 miles away from good pizza. :DFirst visit and a great visit! Came here for lunch during work and glad that I did. Small selection for a vegetarian but loved the burger I had. Ordered the sweet potato fries to go with my burger and they were delish! 

Atmosphere was cozy and great to match the food. I will be making this a lunch spot for days to come. Excellent! Will have to come during off hours because I noticed they sell Red Fox beer, which is one of my favs!as expected the shaved snow texture was amazing. the sesame seed flavor has a roasted light nutty flavor and the green tea tastes delectably of matcha.  additional sweetened condensed milk is readily available and the workers are cheerful and friendly. it's good but not as good as class 302 where the condensed milk is already mixed into the flavored blocks so that it strikes an amazing balance between flavor and sweetness.Heard about this place from my boyfriend and all his (foodie) roommates as they live really close to this new place. Funny thing is they, initially, came here for Rice Trax - the local Hawaiian spot that was previously there.
They raved about the chicken karaage and his instagram video of his DIY tonkatsu sauce intrigued me. 

Luckily, my brother and his family took me here for a belated birthday lunch. 
Decorated with those "good luck" bamboo plants/trees, various Asian prints and curtains. What a difference interior design makes in a place...It's hard to believe that Rice Trax was here.
 
Of course, the 1st thing I did when I sat was make my very own tonkatsu sauce. Kinda fun as I've never used a mortar before. My nephew (who doesn't like sauces of any sort) even had me make some for him.

We ordered the katsu curry, chicken karaage, beef tatake, edamame, and salmon katsu. 
- Beef tataki was the winner for me. Seared beef and ponzu sauce are always a win.
- Chicken karaage had a nice breading on it, which also made for crispy "fried chicken." But, the chicken wasn't burnt. Thin pieces of chicken which made for fairly juicy chicken.
- Katsu curry was nice. Wish the curry was a little more spicy but nothing a few chili peppers (on the side) can't solve.
- Salmon curry was breaded as nicely as the chicken karaage and katsu. Salmon was pretty thick and didn't fall apart when bitten. The best part of that salmon katsu was the salad that came with it. Standard Asian cabbage/slaw but, the yuzo/ponzu dressing was amazing! The owners came by to give us more dressing =)
- Pickled onions, cucumbers on the side were delish. You can tell the freshness and that it was homemade. The owners were telling us that they get many requests for kim chee so, that may be a possibility.

Overall great experience an the food was very good. Nice to have a tonkatsu spot in the area as tonkatsu this good is few and far between.
Service was great. You can tell it's a family run business and the owners take pride in the food they serve!Went here while on  vacay as an alternative to the overpriced salons on the strip. We were greeted by an awesome space and glasses of champagne from the owner. Dallas did an awesome blowout---thank you ladies of blowout doll house! Wish there was one in Phoenix.wait was longer than I would prefer, but then again it was a Saturday night. like everyone else said... portobello mushrooms were yum x10! tri tip was delicious. very friendly staff although the bus boy did spill sauce on my purse while clearing the table. a little annoyed but.... accidents happen?Really like this place. Everyone is super friendly and I haven't had a bad dish yet. Their clam chowder is really excellent. Have had a variety of soups and sandwiches and have never had a bad thing to eat. They are also quick so if you're in a rush on lunch this is a good spot.$1 for a bun. No tax. Normal variety of Hong Kong style buns. Taste is pretty decent and they have Hong Kong style breakfasts and lunch too! Closed on Sundays. Good for a cheap breakfast/lunch or to grab a bun to go. Nice and clean. Definitely recommended!After reading reviews I wanted to try this place. When you walk in, the first thing you see is a register/counter with a bar behind it. Weird, but ok. I noticed that the restaurant is cut in half- singles to the left, parties to the right. Kidding aside- I really did notice that I was sat on the left side, where all the other "one tops" were sat, while it seemed like parties of 2 or more were led to the right. Very odd,but may  have been uintentional.
Waitress was very nice. I ordered a BLT with onion rings. OMG- this sandwich had more than enough bacon and lettuce it fell out of the bread! Hot bacon! Yay! Crispy like I asked for! Yay! Delicous! I also upgraded to onion rings as a previous reviewer advised- great call!! For $1.25 more I got a hefty order of hot onion rings, and a side of ranch (at no extra cost!)!
The only strange thing for me was that even though my bread was toasted, it was soft. How does that happen? Not sure, but it was good.
I was interested in a few other items on the menu, and will definately be back.
$7.72 for a great sandwich and onion rings! Score!I didn't have very high hopes at first because when I first walked in I noticed the emphasis on the bar, which immediately made me think "Ah, well they don't have to necessarily have good food if patrons are boozed up."  Oh how I was wrong!

When you get your sandwich, probably the first two things you'll notice is:

1. What the shit, this thing huge!
2. Instead of a roll, the sandwiches are loaded into a hollowed-out half-bread-bowl.*

*Side Note: Now I definitely get where people are coming from when they hate on the half-bread-bowl idea, as if that's the equivalent of shitting all over tradition, but I happen to like it because:

1. Unique/different isn't always a bad thing.
2. It keeps everything locked in like a semi-burrito
3. It still tastes delicious so STFU and STFD!

****************************************************

Anyhoo, stuff your face with a cheesesteak (don't forget the whiz!) and if you're craving a little culinary juxtaposition - I highly recommend the cold Italian hoagie here, it's unreal.  Except...it is real (who the hell came up with that expression?  Probably the same wishy washy asshole who started saying "Yeah no").

Grade:
Let's dance, let's shout
Steak your hoagie down to your mouth
Let's dance, let's shout
Steak it over!We made a special trip from the Northwest into town to dine at WILD. Parking was easy, but it was a weekday at 1:30. The decor is quite charming and seating limited if you desire an intimate table for 2 or 4. It was difficult to choose from so many gluten-free options! But we went with a basic pizza and a grilled chicken sand which. For starters we shared a square bowl of their tomato soup. Warning- the soup has a bite to it, so if you're a weenie like myself, be prepared. The pizza was good, nothing remarkable and the chicken sand which was terrific. Although it too had a bite to it , pleasantly surprising for my husband. We were seated next to the pastry display and after gazing at them for 45 minutes were forced to order. Oh my. Oh my, oh my, oh my! The Tres Leche cupcake was divine, probably the best gluten-free dessert I can remember having and I will be back for more. Why did I only give 4 stars? The water  in the bottle we were given was from "filtered tap water". Yuck! It had the weirdest aftertaste and I truly don't understand why it would ever be served.I was in AZ on vacation and had planned to eat at several nice restaurants, but as we drove by smash burger we had to give it a try. We liked it so much we ate it twice in one week. It was hot fresh and delish. It's a fast food place but the staff is very friendly.A great cafe that offers a sleek setting for some fresh eats, but it is the pastries that justify a trip across town.  Owner/Baker Eugenia Theodosopoulos and her French training is much appreciated and we relish being able to get a world class macaroon without having to put up with French snobbery.So nice to finally have an Essence nearby!  Love their French toast with the banana caramel sauce!My friend sent me an email about this place and I realized that the Chandler location was really close by, so I stopped in yesterday after work to check it out.  The store is very cute and the cupcakes looked delicious.  In addition to cupcakes, they have mini cheesecake, stuffed cookies and other sweet treats.  The flavors rotate daily so there is always a variety to choose from.  After much contemplation, I decided to try a cookie dough cupcake and a caramel macchiato cupcake.  I ate the cookie dough cupcake last night and it was AWESOME!!!!  The frosting was the right balance of flavor and sweetness without being too sweet and the cake was perfect.  I will definitely be back to try more flavors!I had a  short layover at PDX on my way home from Mexico. Four Peaks was right across from my gate and since I was in desperate need of an IPA after drinking crappy Mexican beers for the past two weeks, decided to give it a try.

The place was packed and the staff was really busy but I was able to score a seat at the bar and the cute bartender quickly brought me a tasty Raj IPA.I also had the Bavarian pretzels which were just OK - a little too gooey with a lot of butter melted on them. Based on the beer, I'd definitely go back the next time I'm at PDXA welcome addition to the area. Overall, this store seemed small but has the essentials. I expected more produce and freshly made food like Fresh and Easy. This store is way better though than visiting the big Walmart near Gilbert Rd.This orangetheory just opened up about two weeks ago in Scottsdale! They were offering a free introductory class and were very accomodating to get me in and have me try it out. The employees were super sweet and welcoming. The facility was clean and had nice restrooms.

The class itself was great. It is a sixty minute class that focuses on HIIT cardio for 30 minutes and weight training the other 30. While although the workouts are something I can do at my own gym, I felt like the class setting gave me a boost of energy and motivation. What really sets them apart from other training facilities is that they provide a heart monitor that tracks your heart rate and calculates the calories burned. This is extremely beneficial and also plays a roll in making sure you get the most out of those sixty minutes. 

After the first class I was unsure about joining, but due to a TINY/MINOR hicup in the registration process for my free class- they kind enough to give me a FREE six month membership. The employees and owners are so sweet and you can tell they care about their clients and the results they get.

I will be renewing my membership even after the free six months. Thanks!Wow ia that drive thru packed after 5 p.m.!  It was way faster for me to just get off of my car and order inside. I got my order extremely fast. I even got out sooner than some of the cars that were at the the drive thru. 

 It was my husnand and my first time trying out this restaurant. We wanted to try it after my brother raved of it being the best. I got the 6 piece chicken fingers, it comes with: fries, Cole slaw, a piece of toast,  and cane sauce.  I thought it was a little in the pricey side. I didn't really enjoy the chicken with their sauce. I ate mine with the Louisiana hot sauce they have at the restaurant. If my husband or I are ever in the mood for "chicken fingers" we'll just stick to KFC not worth the drive from Buckeye.We have used LMP a few times and have always received reasonable bids and good quality work.  I've had them remove a Mesquite tree, remove shrubs and trim other shrubs, and trim all the front yard shrubs at my new home.  They are not punctual and have come later than the scheduled time on each of three visits, but for their reasonable price and good quality work, I can deal with the wait.We've been here twice and I hope it stays open! It was a nice change of pace in the area and lots of beers on tap. I prefer it to Native New Yorker which was in this spot previously. 

I was craving BBQ chicken pizza. I don't know if we ordered incorrectly or not but we got buffalo chicken pizza, Oh well we ate it anyway. It was tasty, the chunks of bleu cheese really made it!

The second time we actually ordered and got the BBQ chicken pizza. It was very good too, but I would suggest a thicker BBQ sauce and I would probably sub red onion for green.New place opened up in the Chinatown area of vegas. This is a thai asian fusion style place. The world noodle is good. Had that twice in 3 days. The thai dumplings were ok. Not all that freat but the pad see ew was also very good. New plave for me to go to when I am n vegas again and craving noodles

Also staff there were very friendly and service was good.Just popped in for a drink & got a wee table upstairs on the mezzanine level. Service was prompt. Nice vibe but does get very noisy when full due to the low ceiling. 
Great selection of cocktails. I had the "pick a pear" one & it was lovely. 
Looking forward to working my way through the rest of the menu :-)My bf and I came here on a Saturday night date and we were entertained the whole time! We sat at the kitchen bar so we could see all the action in the kitchen. Chefs and wait staff were tentative to our requests. Also the owners were present and cheerful. Bf ordered the Mexican patsy and I ordered the peppered steak patsy. Bf and I determined the peppered steak was the winner. We also started with appetizers. Bean dip served as a cold dish and the Scottish Egg which was surprisingly delicious! I'd recommend this place for amusement and a great meal. Enjoy!Called in a takeout order tonight & the process of ordering and going in to pick up was quick and painless. I could see parking being an issue for some, but that's just how it is downtown. Due to the small size of this place, I would probably only call in orders, but it's a really cute place. 

The food was good and something I would try again. The Sweet Home Alabama was spicier than I expected, which was nice, but not as cheesy as I'd hoped. My husband got the Great Balls of Fire and he thought that it was good and the meatballs had a nice kick to them.  

All in all, a good experience. As someone who lives and works downtown, it's nice to have a new place that isn't pizza and is quick and easy to get takeout from.Their custard is the real star but the chili cheese fries and burgers are good for fast food (especially out here). Pricier than your average fast food joint but worth it.The chicken was very delicious, covered in a bright and savory seasoning. The chicha morada was ok, not as flavorful as some other varieties as I've had. Papa huancaina was a bit disappointing because it came out cold but still was not bad. The meal was also very affordable, a great place for lunch or dinner to go.Food is very good - a bit higher for Vietnamese but worth it for the venue and the food - love the décor - service a bit slow but they just opened so we will try again - we love this type of fresh Asian food - thanks - we made it to the movie on time for hubby's birthday last Monday.The pup and I walked here yesterday so that he could socialize a bit with other dogs. Unfortunately, there was only one other dog here when we came. The facility was nice, but it was a little dirty with poop all over the ground... come on people, clean up after your pets. It was a little funny, my dog was scared of the doggie drinking fountain, but hopefully he'll get used to it. We will certainly be back!Went back for a second time to get the Irish coffee on a cold late afternoon.  The place was empty and there for the service was great.   The bartender was engaging and extremely knowledgeable about whiskey and even gave us some pointers about how to have a better experience and enjoy the whiskey properly.   The place itself is small  but let's not forget that it is inside a sea container but the patio during the afternoon is delightful and make a great perch to watch the playground.   The Boozery is the ONLY BAR IN LAS VEGAS that serves products from our very own Las Vegas Distillery!!!      So go enjoy this unique bar in the very unique setting of container park....I guess I have to admit it.  I am a fan of Sam Fox.  He seems to have the golden touch with restaurant concepts.  I mean, really, who puts two of their restaurants right next to each other?  With another one right around the corner no less!

Blanco Tacos and Tequila uses a modern check-in system for getting a table.  Nowaitapp.com registers your phone number, and sends you a text to let you know you are in line, with a link to a webpage that tells you approximately how many people are ahead of you.  Finally, they text you when your table is waiting.  How cool is that?  Toss that stupid flashing beeper thing!  Now you can shop around instead of tapping your feet nervously while glaring hungrily at the diners that just won't leave  (p.s. I'm one of them :-)

So, we did a little Biltmore shopping while we waited to be called.  The wait was a bit over 30 minutes at 7:30pm on a balmy Friday evening.  Not bad.  We were quickly escorted to our patio table, where warm chips and tasty salsa arrived shortly thereafter.  Blanco has a fairly extensive menu of appetizers, salads, burritos, enchilada's, street tacos and chef's specials.  We started with appetizers of Esquites Street Corn and Queso Dip for the chips, with a fairly decent selection of beers both on tap and in bottles, I went with a draft Pacifico.  The wife chose a tasty Sangria.  One of my very favorite dishes is the Elote Corn appetizer served at Elote Café in Sedona.  The Street Corn at Blanco is similar, roasted corn tossed with green onions, lime and Cotija cheese, garnished with Cilantro.  The queso dip is a warm, gooey mixture of Oaxaca, Asadero and Jack Cheese.  The Street corn was good as was the queso dip, and putting them together on a chip was a match made in heaven.

For dinner the daughter went with chicken street tacos.  Three savory shredded chicken with cabbage soft tacos, garnished with Cotija cheese and served with a side of beans.  The wife had the same, but opted for fish and mushroom tacos.  They both raved about their dishes, and had to have the remains packed up for later noshing.  I had the Pork Green Chile enchiladas.  I'm kind of a green chile snob and I have to say that while this dish didn't have the hotness that I expect, it was savory and tasty.  Shredded pork and Ancho chile sauce is layered New Mexican style between two corn tortillas and garnished with lots of gooey cheese, sour cream and pico de gallo. This dish also came with a side of beans - either black or pinto, and we had both varieties.  the beans were tasty and accompanied the dishes nicely.  Instead of the ubiquitous red rice, the rice was white and contained bits of corn and green onion.  Cooked nicely and tasted great.

Service at Blanco was top-notch.  Our server was knowledgeable about the menu items and made good recommendations.  She made sure our drinks were full and stopped by several times to check up on us, just making sure we were okay, without being intrusive.  Overall, I'd say this is totally gringo-ized and more geared to those that don't want hot and spicy, but do want a decent meal.  Our dishes were flavorful without overpowering any sensitivities and we all agreed that it would be return-worthy.This place is POSH- very cool and trendy at the time. Gotta love it. 

Food was great, kind of expensive, but definitely tasty and well worth it.visited 1/9/13

had Mango flavored shaved ice.
can't say much about shaved ice, although the flavoring really tasted good.
i saw that they had Halo-Halo, so I have to come back to this place & visit to do a better review. Also there was a cute looking guy with the most beautiful eyes lolWhen we entered the Container Park, I first saw the Pork and Beans sign and figured I would have to wait for dinner . . . then, I saw the "Vegan Cafe" sign and all was right with the world.  I ordered the Chili Cheese Fries and they were excellent.  My wife ordered the nachos and they too were excellent, though it is not as difficult to make excellent nachos as it is to make fries using jicama.  The service was quick and friendly and the food was great.  My only negative comment about the food offered is that much of it was an attempt at replicating non vegan food.  I don't miss meat or dairy and I prefer a vegan restaurant that challenges me to try new and wild creations, not replicating food that wasn't that good when I ate meat and dairy.  If you are in the Container Park area, this cafe is a great place for a snack, lunch, or even a dinner.  On a warm night, you can sit outside and watch the kids go crazy while you enjoy a vegan meal.Coffee shop out of no where!

Had a delightful cup of Nutella Cappacino! No need to add sugar, the nutella gave it enough sweetness.

Really enjoyed the toasted ham and cheese croissant breakfast sandwich. The croissant was warm and flaky and crispy. Yummy.

A wonderful substitute morning coffee place when I can't get a cup of Philz nearby.I think this is a great show for the money. It was only $27. The singing and dancing were great and I laughed a lot. My main complaint was the seating. It was hard to see at times since everyone was on the same level.I'll have to check out the regular menu and see what kind of portions you get to confirm, but for now this place gets a 4 star rating from me.

It's a very cozy but well-designed bar atop Gelato Spot.  Its really neat the way they have a viewing glass sky light type thing that looks into the Gelato Spot from the restaurant as well.  They also have a patio that we were able to enjoy because it's still not too hot.  Not the loveliest view, but definitely interesting being able to look down at the comings and goings of Scottsdale Rd.  

The staff was VERY attentive.  Can they be a little less attentive?  Maybe just a smidge..  but it was mostly a nice attentive.  On the other hand dinner took about 2 hours.  It was the 3 course for restaurant week, but there were long gaps in between courses.  Not overly annoying tonight, but we were glad we didn't have any other plans.

For 1st course we had the beet mix and the quail.  Both were very delicious and presented beautifully.  The next course was scallops and chicken for us.  The scallops were done perfectly and seasoned pretty well.  I wish more potatoes came on the platter, less carrots but other than that no complaints.  Maybe some arugula or some green would have been pretty.  It was still one of the best scallop dish I've ever had.  The chicken worked less well, we thought the blue cheese though spotty was a bit strong.  It also needed a little more salty meat - sausage or more prosciutto maybe?  The last but not least course was foie gras and veal chop.  It was actually our first time tasting foie gras - though I don't think we'll ever miss it, it wasn't bad and I believe it to be a solid representation of the delicacy.  The veal was tasty, presented nicely in slices over some grainy base.  This dish was also very good but could have used a little sweetness (cranberries?).

All in all, this was a very enjoyable dinner with dishes that were well thought out.  Everyone we talked to were helpful and not pretentious at all which was refreshing.  We're glad we tried it out.  Happy hour didn't seem to include any food items which was disappointing as we're not big drinkers, but I think I would like to return to try some more offerings even at regular pricing.So I heard that 'The End' moved to a new location, and luckily they kept most of the decor that became part of their bar renovation on the Bar Rescue show. The End also used to be called 'The Underworld', although it seems like they still operate under that name every now and then as a secondary thing. 

There's not really a lot of 'punk', 'goth' or 'psychobilly' places here in Las Vegas that can be local hotspots for those who are into the alternative lifestyle--really, the only one we have here is perhaps the Double Down Saloon located near UNLV (super hardcore punk-azz place BTW; reminded me of CGBG a lot), or the Las Vegas Country Saloon where they showcase punk rock, metal, rockabilly, etc. bands. To have more places where all the 'punx" and 'spooky Betties' can hang out is always a nice touch.

The bartenders have been polite to me and my group the both times I went there. I finally got around to trying their infamous drink-in-a-huge-plastic-­syringe called the 'Zombie Antidote'. The mix had vodka in it, so it was going to be bitter but had enough of other sweet things to it that made drinking from a syringe enjoyable. I wish I was able to keep the syringe, though (seems like they don't let you keep them).

I also tried their Double Tap, and I think a drink called 'Lost Vegas'. The former is a another sweet mix, and it even has pop rocks in the drink. The latter is sweet as well and tasted like an alcoholic version of soda or so.

Their pizzas are pretty good, and I liked how they had a zombie theme to it as well. I forgot what pizza I ordered, but the flavors really popped with the garlic and herbs or so.

As for the music? Dunno if much has changed but the last time I was there, they had dubstep music playing and other stuff I can't even comprehend. It didn't really fit with the horror theme to be quite honest. Ugh, where the hell is the White Zombie? The Cramps? The Meteors? Misfits?? Heck, even the dubstep version of Rob Zombie's "Dragula" would do.

As I mentioned earlier, I went here twice: the first time was on a Saturday night, the week before Halloween and the second time was on a typical Monday night. Now I don't know if it was just for some sort of Halloween special or not, but one of their bartenders was dressed up as a psychobilly chick and I thought that was pretty cool.

There seems to be more people on the weekends than on weekdays, but that's to be expected. Monday night was really quiet, even when 10PM hit. The End hosts 'scary karaoke' nights on weekends, however. Sounds fun--I can finally get my horror-punk, doo-wop 'Saturday Night' song on by the Misfits on these nights (P.S. If you like the Misfits, request to sing their songs! One of the bartender dudes I spoke to is a fan of them and I asked if they had any punk rock songs on their playlist).

There used to be a Goth/Industrial scene going on here, on Fridays, called 'Carpe Noctem'. I heard that it got shut down due to the event holder's health, and also something about how The End is growing and they need a different game plan from now on. :( Such a shame, since this is one of Vegas's few yet real Industrial scenes. But hey, if The End is growing in business, at least that's a good thing. Although now it seems that the bar owners are doing their own kind of goth night thing on these nights.

I don't know if they have local bands play at their venue, but if they do then that's pretty cool. I do know that they host all these other music-related, one-time special events--usually some sort of concert after-party or so.

Oh, and speaking of events--The End is the real deal for those who are fans of 'The Walking Dead'. They host a lot of Walking Dead watch parties. So if you wanna get into the mood for some zombie fun, go here!Close to the strip in between harrahs and ballys area in the Linq. Cool new concept, supposely all their slushies have top shelf liquor but I felt it wasn't strong enough, I believe I've gotten more drunk at fat Tuesdays slushies. They have more flavors though and we chose the patron grand mariner because it was sour.The staff is very friendly and cutely dressed, just needs more signs on the cups of drinks. The saxophone cup is seriously amazing! I think its the sexiest and bangest cup there is. ;) Ha haSometimes as a local, you have to go a little "tourist" to remind yourself of the fun this city can be.

A friend and I stopped in here after work during our visit to the Linq shopping area.  The place is set up like a giant candy store.  Actually, parts of it ARE an actual candy store.  There are plenty of little candies and such that go along with the rows of goofy, oversidzed glasses.  The back wall, however, is the main draw.

An entire wall devoted to drinks.  But here's the catch.  One half is alcoholic.  The other alf is not.  So it's basically an all ages Icee/Slurpee stand.  And once you buy your selected cup (they do give discounts and punch cards to locals), you are allowed to step inside the gated area.

Now here's the kicker: They hand you a small collection of tiny cups to sample the various flavors, which I appreciated.  Nothing like spending a small fortune on one of those ridiculous drinks only to find that it tastes like Windex.  These tend to be more flavorful, despite the quantities of booze involved.  And you can even mix and match, so you can create your own Frankendrink.

So I friend and I walked out, giant zebra hooves in hand, and proceeded to have the rest of the night's adventure.  The staff was friendly, and the process was unobtrusive and easy, so it just made our stopover fun.  I've kept my hoof for the next time I decide to make my rounds over to the Purple Zebra.  I can see taking my vacationing friends to the place.Went to Chayo last night at the recommendation of a friend and I must say I was very happy with my overall experience.  The food was great and the service was very good.  

The decor of the restaurant is very impressive and you can tell they spent a lot of time and money to every detail.  The restaurant has a great feel and is a fun place to dine.

When we arrived it was very busy but was seated immediately very close to the mechanical bull.  Although the bull was not running (i assume it starts later) you can tell it must be a center point of the restaurant/bar later on in the evening.

Everyone in my party loved the food and the presentation.  At my table people ordered the lobster tacos (recommendation of the server) and everyone loved them.  I ordered the ribeye steak that was cooked perfect and another person ordered the fajitas.  The size of the fajitas was large and he said it was full of flavor and very filling.

Overall, I would recommend this restaurant to anyone that is around the strip that wants to try a unique experience for a mexican restaurant.  With a great location we went and walked through the linq project before heading home.This review may be a lil overdue, because my boyfriend and I have visited Chayo quite a few times now.  Each time we have had a great experience.  We enjoy the location, atmosphere, and of course the food each time we visit!

We LOVE the carnitas tacos! You have to try these.... they are great! There is just something about the mix of flavors and textures that makes these tacos a must have!  We order them every time we visit!

I would also highly recommend trying the sweet corn enchiladas!

Try to sit in the bar area that is open to the outside- great people watching!I came with the fiance, April D. and her hubby Doug. 

We walk into a room of doors and shown the door to the showroom. I really think the presentation of the different rooms is fun and impactful. 

We grabbed some drinks and while they are $14-16 a cocktail, they are quite delicious.  We got the whiskey smash which was refeshing and the monte carlo that brought out the best in the whiskey. 

We sat down and thankfull were seated on the bench instead of the foldup. The Fiance and I were a bit hungry so we ordered the caviar and egg flatbread. There isn't a full service here for food but we were able to go pick up our food at the bar when ready and bring to our table. It was good combination of flavors and nice crisp and light texture, but a bit skimpy on toppings. 

The show was inappropriate and fun as expected. I think the people in it are awesome as they have the best emotes and really sell their character. 

After the show they usher you through the bar where a live band plays. The awesome thing is the people in the show perform little solo acts here. We saw three before they stopped and did curtain call for the next show. 

This place is fun and doesnt take itself so seriously.  It's a great dinner and show place that actually doesnt suck and is tired. 

I like this show because family tradition #3 is near and dear to my heart. I will be back probably to see a midnight show and more of those drinks. It would be a great spot to bring visiting damoly to show them a better side of "on the strip" options.Went to Joyride for the first time on Sunday, around brunch time.  Sat at the bar, ordered a cold Negro Modelo - they only offer it on draft.  Staff was very friendly and engaging. The place is super cute, love the outside patio, good blend of background music.  For the food, I started with guacamole, chips and salsa - all were tasty.  The salsa had a nice kick.  Tried the shrimp, fish and ahi tacos.  The shrimp was flavorful, fish appeared slightly under cooked - so that lost points.  The ahi was by far the winner - amazing actually.  Will definitely go back, thrilled to see more restaurants in Central Phx.Happy hour is the place to be. Seven days a week, from 5pm-7pm, five small plates, five cocktails, five wines by the glass, and two entrees all for $6 a piece. The best part is that it is honored at the bar and out in the patio. The spacious amount of seating makes it way easier to dine at this location compared to the original. 

Between the three of us we ordered everything except for the salt and pepper shrimp. At that point, what is another six dollars? The highlights were definitely the mushroom raviolis, baked brie, and burger. The beef carpaccio was not the best. The meat was rather dark and tough compared to the tender bright red I'm used to.The pork belly was very tender and artery clogging. The polenta and compote was my favorite aspect of the dish. 

As for drinks, I will stick with the Ward 8. Oh yes, browns can be oh so refreshing, 

If you can, sit with Stephanie. She is fun, engaging, and sweet.Dropped in on Sunday for a cartilage piercing for my daughter.  Terry was very friendly, professional and worked us in without a long wait.  The piercing area was clean and organized.  We were given aftercare instruction and we were on our way. The cost was great.  This would have been 5 stars but the area around the shop was a little run down and I was approached by a homeless woman walking to my car.  If I was on my own, it wouldn't have been a big deal but my younger daughter was with me.  I am just glad it was during the day and not at night.  It wouldn't stop me from going back to this shop because it was was a great experience.This is supposedly the biggest Yard House in the country, and it's pretty big. We were having my boyfriends birthday dinner here so we were a group of about 12. They don't take reservations but we were able to get seated right away upstairs. It was Monday, so maybe that's why. 

They gave us two servers, who were both really nice.  The food at Yard House is always great, so no complaints there. They even let us bring our own cake and they brought it out for us. The only issue I had was that we bought a bunch of candles to put on the cake, and they brought it out with 3 candles. 

They were also kind enough to split all our checks, but somehow there was a mistake at the end and they gave someone the wrong bill, but she paid it. We never figured out if the other girl paid her own bill as well, or paid hers. Either way, it wasn't a big deal especially since we had a large group. 

We had a great view of the observation wheel from upstairs as well.Great place for sandwiches and salads. It's a little expensive for sandwiches so that's why I only gave it 4 stars. But this place is definitely worth the splurge now and again!Food here is great. They have a truly unique twist on how to make crawfish. I find this uniqueness refreshing especially with all the different crawfish joints in town it really helps them stand out. Prices here are also very comparable to competitors around town. 

My only criticism to this place is this the service is a little lack luster. They are friendly and helpful when asked. But they are not very tentative, even though the last couple times ive been there we were the only table present. If they were a little more proactive as opposed to reactive it would make this place excellent.Since I was craving a hot dog place I decided to yell a nearby locations and this popped up. I'm fan of komex so a korean hot dog fusion seemed interesting. The staff was nice and informative when I asked for suggestions. I ordered the bulgogi hot dog and the soul to Seoul order of chicken wings. the flavors of the bulgogi dog meshed well together and was a great combination. the bun was soft and chewy and the toppings were well spread out and distributed along the hot dog. one suggestion though was although the hot dog  was tasty it was a bit over cooked because the skin was rubbery. despite that though the hot dog was still juicy on the inside. the chicken wings were massive in size and came freshly cooked. I asked for the SS korean sauce on the side and it complemented the well seasoned crispy chicken wings well. the kimchi was okay and  the other side which was not listed on the menu but was sweet with vinegar complemented the wings well. I would have given 5 starts but for $11 I was disappointed that it was only 3 wings with pretty basic sides. for that price range I would have expected a little bit more for my money. overall I'd come back for the bulgogi dog.Om nom nom. After finishing exams a trip to Burger was just what the doctor ordered (well probably not actually) but it was the perfect end to my day!

I ordered the chicken katsu burger with scrummy wasabi mayo and  fries. The boy went for a coconutty/blackbean/mango chicken burger from the specials board. We also had some chilli cheesy fries and plain fries and both were crispy and delicious. Their milkshake was super tasty (and so thick you had to suck your cheeks in to get it up the straw). We had the chocolate one with peanut butter and it was lovely and ice-creamy! 

The staff were friendly and it was nice and chilled out with a mixture of couples, work friends, families etc. Would definitely go back.Great location on the Linq, small but packs a punch with live music. Just a great place to sit with a nice drink on the outdoor patio and people watch. Drinks are pricey but the live music adds to the value. Give this place a try!Pretty good!  I would eat here again. I ordered the Greek Salad and Santa Fe. Had a little of both and very good.This review is just for the aquatic center. Med sized city pool with a large splash pad, water slide, whirlpool and lazy river. Also a couple diving boards. It's brand new so the facility is very nice.

Today is the grand opening and it's not even that crowded so that's nice. It'll probably be a mad house during the summer as it's not very big.

It's free with a rec center pass which is likely a vastly better deal than a day pass. Day passes are overpriced compared to other city pools, at $4 adults, $2 kids. That's double the price you'll pay at any other city pools.

You can rent swim vests for your little ones.

Fyi...there's practically NO shade. Not that many seats either. There's a small area in the middle with shade and seating, then you have to take refuge on the perimeter of the building. Bring your own umbrella and seat.If you haven't been to this place you should definitely check it out!  They have the BEST shaved ice and its perfect for this hot weather!  

Who would have thought about adding whipped cream to shaved ice.....brilliant! 

Drive thru is sometimes a little slow... still it's worth the wait.  :)I loved the vegan red velvet cupcakes!! That's the only flavor I tried. I thought it was moist and they used coconut frosting instead on cream cheese...gotta love it.These are definitely more of a cake like donut than the light and fluffy ones. I've read in a previous review that they use hydrogenated oils which is concerning. 

But, the glazes are super tasty! I had a maple bacon and a chocolate covered cherry. They were awesome. The donuts are a bit heavy-it's not like BoSa where you can down 3 of them and be content. I had two and was super full.

The staff is really friendly and kind. I'll be back, but I really really hope they change their oil. It has a funny after taste.We've heard about this legendary taco place on East Tropicana and was excited to see that one was being opened here in this location. Having been in the building when Republic was, we knew what to expect in terms of floor plan. When we walked in, everyone (I mean everyone) was uber friendly and much brighter than before. 

At first, it was confusing, they have stations, then one of the beautiful girls came over and gave us a tour and told us how it all worked. The cooks were offering samples so that definitely helped us decide what to have. We finally decided on the chorizo, carne, al pastor taco, and street style corn on the cob. I must say, if that is what they eat in Mexico, I'm moving to Mexico!! The chorizo was so damn delicious, I had to get up and get a second round. The salsa bar was an awesome touch along with the bar, they've got a decent selection of draft and bottled beer. 

Taco y Taco, although sit down style, is a an upgrade from their first location but certainly a wonderful addition to the Silverado Ranch area. The building is perfect, the food is pretty epic for the value, and is a definite hot spot for a late night 'I need a quick buzz kill'. 

Go check it out!! We'll be back!!After watching tons of episodes of cake boss, you can bet that I really wanted to try these seemingly mouth watering desserts. I was absolutely thrilled that I could finally taste it, and not just imagine how it would taste!

The appearance of the store imitates the Hoboken store from the show, and there's also a window where you can watch people decorating things, which is kind of cool. When I went, it was only the second day it was open, so it was pretty crowded. You take a number, and when it gets called you get to order your desserts. Then you have to get that same number called again so you can get it all packaged and pretty and pay for your stuff. There's not a lot of sitting room, so plan to take your desserts home. If you're really impatient, you could always sit on a bench by the "canals" in the Venetian and eat them while watching the gondolas.

EVERYTHING LOOKS DELICIOUS! I settled on the "lobstertail", which is a pastry stuffed with I think it's french cream, since it seemed to be something sort of unique to Carlo's Bakery. It was so good! The outside was flaky and crispy, and the inside was rich without being too sweet. It was so perfect!

I'm definitely looking forward to trying more desserts! The big problem will just be what to get next!Came here after seeing some promos for it just opening. Pretty cool vibe to it, with a mix of music from the outside carnival court and music inside. A little loud for my liking but I get it. Really friendly staff all around. I had the mac and cheese burger and it was really good. Huge portions of everything!! Wife had the the asian wraps and the pepperoni sticks. The asian wraps came out cold. I will try it again down the road. Overall a decent place for some good food.I commend this place for their attempts at making this place a more viable for vegans/vegetarians.
They changed to way they make their pinto beans so it doesn't contain bacon anymore.
They've also offered a new type of Sofritas, basically flavored tofu, that you can substitute for your dead animal corpse. 

However, I always like to brag that it's cheaper for me to get a no-meat burrito with guacamole and not have to pay extra, but with the Sofritas it comes out to extra. Why am I paying the price of meat for tofu that is waaaayyyy cheaper for damn sure? Sorry Sofritas, you're not that damn good.

The service here is always great, the workers are very nice and work really quick. This place is new and I hope the positive atmosphere stays with this particular location.We decided to visit this new restaurant near our home.  It was tastefully decorated, but the real highlight was the food.  We tried three meals, all extraordinarily tasty with the perfect blend of flavor and seasoning.  Service was a little slow, but hopefully this will improve with time.  We'll definitely add Silk to our regular rotation!Pretty awesome spot for crawfish, shrimp and sausage.  As other reviewers have suggested, you are going to get dirty, as will your sleeves if you're wearing a long sleeve shirt.  The crawfish at this place are huge.  I got a couple pounds of crawfish with half pound of sausage added in- that was just the right amount of food. I ordered it medium hot with the hot n juicy sauce (would like to try the Louisiana seasoning another time).  It wasn't overpoweringly hot and the corn/sausage helped cool it off.  I would put it between 2-3, closer to 2.  I also ate a few of my buddy's shrimp cooked in the same sauce.  Honestly they were kind of bland after peeling them, so I just ended up dipping them in the crawfish sauce which helped a lot with flavor. We sat at the bar and got great service from Jasmine.  Highly recommended if you love crawfish and don't mind getting dirty!Wide variety, very reasonably priced.  We didn't realize it until we were leaving but you can also order entrees from the menu as well.  That is helpful for the crowd, including my wife, that don't like sushi.  A novel way (the revolving conveyor belt) to offer up the different varieties of sushi.Stopped in for happy hour the other day to try the latest edition to the street taco crazy taking over Phoenix.

The place is small but well decorated and cozy and I loved the lighting at the bar. 

We split the street tacos which were only $1.50 during happy hour! What really set them a part were all the sala choices. I picked 6, my favorites were the roasted corn, chipotle and avacado crema. I can't wait to go back and try the rest of them on the menu. The coronas were still around 5 bucks on happy hour which was pretty high, but they did have house margaritas and wines for $5.

I will be backMore love for Monsoon Siam! The food was delicious, and the waitstaff was kind and attentive, without being overly so. You could tell this was the kind of place that the owner and employees were proud of. And with good reason! 

Most of the food we had was great, but the real stand outs were definitely the papaya salad (as others have said!) and the khao soi, which might be my favorite one-dish meal ever (the only other place in town I've been able to get it is Sa-Bai Thong, and there you have to know to request it, as it's not on the regular menu). Our table also ordered the spicy eggplant (good, but not amazing), the pad ginger (lots of good ginger flavor!), and the lemongrass chili tofu (beautiful presentation, but the tofu texture was lacking--really the only reason for 4 stars instead of 5). 

Oh, and we also had a baby with us, who was treated kindly, even amid some fussing. 

We will be back!This restaurant is going to be our favorite for a Downtown variety, we decided to do lunch and was able to get in without a wait.  Very unique food with a twist, the black rice looks strange, but the taste is very good.  The meatballs are very tasty and so was the short rib sliders.  I sure wasn't expecting that sweet taste which comes from the rootbeer sauce.  The only thing that bothers me is the parking as with any Downtown place you want to visit.  A definite must try!!!!
