They charge more than the services they provide are worth.  Since they currently have a monopoly on cable tv in the madison area there is nothing anyone can do about it.Do NOT. I repeat - do not do business with this company. 

We purchased a furnace with an extended warranty. The warranty was for 650.00 and we were told it would cover any defects, issues etc. Within 2 years the blower motor went out on a Friday. They advised us it would be 198.00 per hour since it was overtime. This was at 3pm on a Friday. They told me to read the fine print..... you know the drill. Finally after much run around I was told we would have a man out for no charge Monday morning at 8am. Of course no one showed up. after 3 more calls and missed times finally we had a tech arrive at 12noon. They do NOT do what they say, they are rude, and not the least bit proactive. Beware of any promises the sales persons make and any comittments the company makes.Was here for a gala at the adjoining conference center.  Service was terrible. The waitress kept slamming food and drinks on the  table. She only brought dinner for half the table and the rest had to wait for 15 minutes. One of the guests had to wait about 20 minutes for the meal. Horrible!
I've been to many Marriotts before and hold a frequent visitor card, but this one has been the worst experience so far.

I know this isn't a review that completely reflects the hotel or any restaurants inside it, but the fact that this service was under the Marriott name prompted this review and ratingDoes anyone in Madison consider this a great Mexican food location? Both of my experiences at Pedro's have left me disheartened. They go a little something like this:

1. Thursday night. Friends invite me for inexpensive margaritas. Am   approached by a girl who wants me to go out with her father standing 10 feet away, who ironically is the least creepy of the crowd looking to enjoy cheap tequila. Implementing Gym Rules, i.e. baseball cap and hoodie upon my next visit post 9pm.

2. Wednesday evening. Dinner with a friend. Server who may or may not go on living if she stops texting, poor quality food and terrible lighting, which is imperative unless practicing G.R. (see above.)

Being a girl from the southwest, I have had a great fajita or two in my day. If you are feeling rebellious and decide to go despite the many poor reviews, know this: Mexican food is great, and this is nowhere near that.The only reason I put one star is because I had to. One of the poorest managed and run motels that I have ever seen. The rooms were very sub-par with mold on the bathroom ceiling. There were crumbs in the bed and they weren't very clean.

The rooms' walls were very thin and you could hear everything that went on from people stomping around upstairs to listening to doors banging constantly. There was a ton  of noise from these places as well as the highway running parallel to the hotel as well as adjoining rooms.

Management was the worst of all. Horrible at enforcing the rules so other guests can be very discourteous as well as riff raff running around outside peeking into locked vehicles almost as if they were trying to find a way to break in. Head manager is very hard to understand as he doesn't speak English clearly with no common sense on how to run a business.

Overall, one of the poorest run hotels I have seen in a long time and for the money, many other choices in the area which provide way better service and accommodations. So overall, easy to make a better choice anywhere else. Beware.This place is awful.  

Drinks are way overpriced and weaker than a popcorn fart.

The place is filthy inside and smells like a old, sweaty jock strap.

Staff is slower than molasses and you'd see the Minnesota Vikings in the Super Bowl before you get served.

Always a testicle festival.  No hot single chicks here.  

Rather buy a 12 pack of Ultra and spend my Friday night under a bridge.

Go Packers!!!!!!Two words: Overpriced and understaffed.

I'm not sure if Palazzo is always open "sometimes" or just recently reopened, but they've brought back the goth night one Friday a month. Just to clarify-not reviewing that particular dance night, just the establishment itself. 

Every time I have been, the bar has been understaffed. Two for an entire nightclub that is packed? How does that work? It takes forever to get a drink and then it's just generally expensive no matter what you get. There's also a back bar that seems to never be in use. With the amount of people that hang out back there for the majority of the night, you'd think they'd hire a few extra people. 

Also? Maybe invest in some misters for your back bar-it gets ridiculously hot back there when it's packed full of people. It's almost as if this is a bare bones establishment. It's sad because this event is attempting to revive the goth scene yet the venue that it's at (which used to be Tranzylvania back in the day) just plain sucks.This place makes me nervous just thinking about going there.
I have officially decided I am never going back here again. I will drive 15-20 miles to my nearest Sprouts or the Fancy Fry's in Scottsdale before I ever drive 1 mile to get to Safeway.
It's that bad.
Not only is the parking lot notoriously sketchy with inconsiderate drivers abounding, but there are numerous problems inside the store, as well:
1) You walk in to a rather dimly-lighted store, usually with a sour-faced security guard blocking your access to the carts.
2) What carts you ask? That's a good question. Several times I have had to grab a handbasket because there were no carts in stock, even though I had a long grocery list to fulfill. I actually saw the cartboys leaning against the cartrails, laughing and having a heck of a time. Look, I get it, it's hot outside and you don't want to get get the carts, but C'MON!
3) The first thing you see upon walking in may or may not be a ghetto display of moldy-looking fruit, or on  the 4th of July, a teenage employee roasting hot dogs on a bunsen burner with open containers of ketchup and mustard on a rickety table.
4) Venture into the produce section, and you will meander through very difficult twists and turns that your cart may not even fit through. Please, managers, make sure that the spaces between fruit stands are at least cart-width!!!
5) The line for the pharmacy extends into the produce area. Enough said.
6) Expect for the aisles to have large space-blocking cardboard displays and/or fallen down merchandise and/or an employee restocking items right in the middle of the day. I would say half of the aisles are blocked at any given time.
7) Once you have completed your hazardous journey of finding everything on your list, you must enter one of the two checkout lines, which are so long that they become another force blocking the aisleways. Two checkout lines, you say? Yes, only two, despite there being 5 or 6 total checkout lanes. If you are a young lady with any shred of fashion or hygiene, expect to be "checked out" by creepy older men whilst standing innocently in line.
8) Your cashier will either be a surly teenage boy or a pregnant teenage girl who does a poor job managing the line and barely gives you the time of day and/or forgets to give you the receipt when you are done. But you are so eager to get out of there, you simply don't care to go back and ask for it.

Oh, and there may or may not be trash on the floor.
If Safeway as a nationwide brand prides themselves on safety or service, they need to get their corporate people in here to take a look at this store, and either condemn it or fire everyone who works here.
It's even more pitiful because they are the closest store to everyone who lives downtown, so they could easily be the most popular.
Please, downtown, replace this disgraceful store with a Whole Foods or a Sprouts or a place with a shred of human decency.Terrible service.Pretty bad. They have recently changed the name. Seems like a good place to go downtown, but both times I have been were terrible experiences. 
Incredibly poor service by the bar staff and servers. I thought the first time might be a fluke but the second time proved worse. Food was nothing more than mediocre both times. If you HAVE to go, DO NOT order the artichoke dip. Absolutely terrible.Another review of AT&T wireless....not the store.  This may be a record; they lasted less than 2 hrs for me!  After 12 years w/Verizon I decided to leave so I could get an iPhone.  GIANT mistake.  I called to activate my phone, and was told the activation dept. is CLOSED.  I called customer service, and got it connected.  But then I called Mom and she asked why I was calling from her cell phone number?  They got the numbers attached to the WRONG PHONES.  So I called customer service back, and THEY WERE CLOSED.  It was 7pm here.  I dont care what time it was on the east coast...if their customer service dept (and tech support) cant be open when i need them, then i dont need them.  I'm going back to Verizon and im never leaving again!This place is an embarrassment to mexican restaurants. The food here is terrible! Here's what we ordered:
Combo taco/enchilada / oily taco, diarrhea enchilada 
Green chilie burrito / the tortilla was plastic and the filling was gross.
Taco salad / bunch of stuff with zero taste. Should have grazed in the planter.
The beans and rice? Really? They couldn't even get that right. Under cooked bland rice and under cooked beans.
This place sux!
Beer is good.Possibly the worse service ever. I love their wings but for this simple experience, I will never go to Hooters again. Went there for the zombie walk and ordered wings and food. 
My party and I finished eating our food and the wings had not even come out. I had to ask for them twice and the last time I asked for them to go. I didn't even get to eat them at the restaurant. Worst of all no one apologized for the delay or for anything. Possibly the worse service ever. I will never ever go to a Hooters again. I can find better wings and service else where. So if you want to eat good wings and bad service then go for it. Should of been a zero star rating.Seriously my frappe was chocolate water disgusting!
How hard is it to make a blended drink?
Sorry but frappes are like my crack so don't mess that up.Went here yesterday.  Ordered the pulled pork sandwich, side of beans and drink for me to eat there. Beans had chunks of what tasted like dehydrated dried onion in them and they were not hydrated. Sandwich bun was totally soggy and pork was dry. Ordered the 1/4 chicken meal with dark meat (does not like breast meat)  and drink for my husband to take with him because he wasn't hungry.  We sat down with my meal and ate, he had not gotten his meal yet.  About 20-25 min later, went to counter to get his meal and they didn't even have it ready!  Then they said, oh, is the white meat ok?  We don't have any of the dark meat ready right now?  After 25 minutes and they didn't have any ready? Husband reluctantly said ok.  Got home and later ate it and it was all dried out and appeared old.  We will not be going back, the customer service is terrible and so is their food these days. Spent $20.00 on a small amount and food and this is what we got. Try https://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Barbecue-Company-Grill-Cafe/100123416554
The Barbecue Company instead.  Their food and customer service are both great. Honey Bear's you lost a customer. BBQ Company is only open Mon-Fri until 3:00pm but worth the visit.  Once a month they have a buffet!This is legit, I ordered combo #2 at 2:45 pm 3-1-14 and at 3:40 pm I had to walk to the counter and ask how much longer my food was going to be, the reply was 5 minutes there is one order ahead of you.
NO "i am sorry for the wait, let me see whats taking so long." Nothing.
I replied with you have three minutes or I want a refund. Well 5 goes by, Ok I want a refund. It took about another 5 minutes for him to get permission from his "manager" whom may or may not have even graduated high school. At this point I have been robbed 1 hour of my life, with no apologizes, with no interaction with management, or any  sense of customer service.  
There would be a zero star here if i had the option. Absolutely yummy food, when properly serviced. 
I mean their was not one single resemblance of an adult in this establishment. Its like they all got high in the back and had no sense of time, or surroundings. I understand if you have a few new people that you are training. But WTF....
Oh and on the way out some one told me calm down...Me calm down you robbed my of an hour of my life, made me hungrier than what i was, and told me to calm down. That is not how you deescalate a situation. 
Never again Honey bears will I treat you to my hard earned money. And frankly the gentleman before me should have been more furious than me, he called in his order and sandwich with whatever side, you handed him a bag with a side of sauce, no apologizes for him or any of your other LOYAL customers. Dam I am MAD.
                                    Thanks for nothing, 
                                                       Augustina AKA ROBBEDSo after reading all these reviews I thought to take a chance so I went to explore.  I arrived for lunch at 11am and was seated immediately.  The atmosphere was ok, and the bar looked a bit disorganized.  I ordered the the sesame chicken and egg drop soup.  I asked if I could pay extra for shrimp fried rice but was told no.  I chose the fried rice vs white or brown.  Soup came out first which I found to be very bland and very few pieces of egg in it.  On my 4th spoonful my meal arrived and I was not impressed by the way it looked.  The sesame chicken was only bits of fried chicken in batter covered with very little brown very thick and gooey sweet sauce.  Some of the chicken pieces didn't even have sauce on it and grossed me out because it was hard and bland.  The fried rice looked like it was done in a hurry with many white spots in it and with little taste.  The egg role wasn't bad although they did not serve with hot mustard sauce.  I will not be returning to this place.What is the hubub over China Chili?!?! Don't understand the high rating this restaurant is getting?!?

I had not been back to this area for 5+ years and wanted to stay near downtown Phoenix where my friend lives. I looked up high-rated Chinese restaurants in downtown Phoenix and China Chili, of course, came out on top. Well folks, you yelpers here are totally fooled!

First of all when you sit down, the menu gives the impression that this restaurant is a Szechaun or Hunan restaurant. It's NOT! The chefs at this restaurant are Cantonese serving Szechaun and Hunan dishes.

For starters, my friend and I ordered Sizzling Rice Soup. As entrees, we ordered Szechaun Shrimp and Braised Tofu with Beef. I had a hint of what was to come by listening to the waitresses... Surprise! They all were speaking in Cantonese!

The Sizzling Rice Soup was very good. 

The Szechaun Shrimp turned out to be a Sweet and Sour dish...  Shocking! There are almost NO dishes in Szechaun cooking that are Sweet and Sour! It looked nice though, the shrimp was ringed around the plate by thin slices of cucumber. The Braised Tofu with Beef was almost as bad, chemically tenderized beef that probably is used from another dish and dropped in the Braised Tofu. Both dishes were supposed to be HOT... NOT!

The only redeeming thing we got out of this adventure was that our wallets were not affected that much by the experience!

Demographics of Customers @ 6pm - less than 5% Oriental, 40% of capacity.

If you want an authentic Szechaun restaurant, travel down to Tempe to Wong's Place on Baseline Road off of I-60. I will be going there tomorrow night and writing a review which will be more positive than this one!Don't go to this store if you are looking for 45s. They give you a book to look through and ask you to tell them what you want and tell you the prices will be $4 upwards. They then price them up using various price guides. If you have found something that is priced highly they hide it then put it on Ebay rather than sell it to you. You do all the work (the books have a total of more than 300 pages) and they reap the benefits. If I hadn't had picked out a certain $300 record that record could have lain there forever. I wasn't even offered it at any price and I would have given them a good price.Updating my review after a horrible experience trying to utilize their private room, Rendevous, for a birthday dinner.  Their event coordinator dropped the ball with several huge miscommunications during the 4 weeks we were in touch, and then went MIA for a week and a half before the event.  In the 11th hour, three days before the event and ON my actual birthday, I had to pull the event when there was no way to find a mutually-agreed upon solution that would preserve the original intent of the evening.  I had to inform my 27 guests of the last-minute location change via e-mail after sending formal invitations weeks in advance. 

The entire experience was a nightmare and having the owner yelling at me on my birthday was not the highlight of my week.  The most unprofessional and offensive experience I have ever had within the service industry.Terrible service from the manager Dave at this marshalls location. I tried to return something and he literally yelled at me and belittled me in front of a line full of customers for not having everything I needed to return the items. Get the hell over yourself! It blows my mind that the customer service at these establishments are so terrible considering how much competition there is in this day and age!

Not only was he rude to me but also to the woman that was trying to help me do my return. Will never shop at this location or let anyone I care about give there money to this shitty store.I worked near there a couple years ago and would blindly walk in there on my lunch breaks over and over, ignorantly forgetting how mediocre the food was.  But I recently saw a Stixx has opening near there, so I don't even know if they are still in business...The store manager is lazy, rude and unhelpful. Same with the assistant manager Charlie. I feel really bad for the reps who have to work under such poor management.  I got no help from anyone when it was clearly a problem caused by someone at that store.  The manager refused to take me off speakerphone even when it was obvious that the echo in his tiny, depressing office was making it impossible to communicate. GO TO THE ARCADIA STORE AT THOMAS AND 44TH. MUCH BETTER!! BOYCOTT THE CAMELBACK STORE!It's gross.  Don't waste your money please!  Hope this helps you!I was driving by looking for a place for lunch and I stopped in, hoping for some deli food. 

I was quite surprised to see that it's actually an old-school cafeteria. I didn't know that these places existed anymore and I was ready to be charmed.  Alas, that was not to be.

Although I came inside in the mood for pastrami, watching the staff throw together - and I mean that quite literally, I've never seen anybody, anywhere make a sandwich as quickly or carelessly - I lost my nerve and ordered the meat loaf special, thinking that was probably a better way to go in a place like this.

Unfortunately the meat loaf was dreadful as were the mashed potatoes.  Absolutely devoid of any flavor and covered in a gloppy gravy.  Seriously awful.

I see that one reviewer described it as hospital food.  That's being charitable because some hospitals actually have edible food.  It's more like what I imagine prison food to be like. 

It's also not particularly cheap.  My prison plate was $9.73 with the tax.  Not recommended.worst brunch I ever had!

I was hoping for a nice Sunday brunch but was very disappointed. The waitress told us that it is a fourty minutes wait for any order. She suggested pastry even though the cafe was less than one third full (12 people including us).  So we selected two crossants, a quiche and two cups of coffee. Pastries arrived quickly but no coffee.  Crossants were cold and soft, not as good as crossan from Paradise cafe but twice the price. 

Halfway done my croissant I realized I had no napkin. Asked her about coffee she said that it is brewing and need to wait four more minutes.  My husband noticed that the lady behind me complained coffee was too cold and it was then microwaved. He was puzzled as the waitress told us they serve freshly brewed coffee.

 I finished my croossant and had some quiches. finally our coffee came. They were luke warm too, not as hot as from McDonalds. At this point, twenty minutes later after we sat down,  the waitress  told us if we order now she will be able to serve quickly. We were not happy.  We asked her if there was anything we could have done differently to have a proper meal and she said no. 

The worse thing is it destroyed our whole day being treated this way. 

Will not go there ever again!Bought an apple pie and it went moldy in two days. Brie was expensive and the worst tasting I've ever had.Ok.... This was an awful experience!!! A friend and I decided to check thus spot out because we pass it frequently, it was late, we were hungry and it was open. It's was fairly slow with 7 tables or so occupied, however, there was only one waitress. We noticed the food coming out pretty fast which was cool, however, the waitress was AWFUL.... so rude and unprofessional. We ordered a milk shake because they are suppose to be known for great milkshakes but was we was served was a watery mess. We explained we didn't want it and she told us we still would pay for them. After contesting, she grabbed the milkshakes, said something in spanish and walked off. Seconds later, she slams the cups in the sink and began yelling. Luckily, we already had our food!!! From that moment on she had the worst attitude and tossed the bill in the table and walked away!!!! The food was good but the service is the WORST!!!! Yikes!!!!!I've never experienced this before, but I'm just going to let you be the judge:

I am starting to watch/count my calorie load, especially when I am eating out.

American Chinese is famous for huge calorie loads in the sauces and fried treatments, so I thought I would split the middle and order a brown steamed rice with broccoli and beef.

Well, I asked the young lady behind the counter for the calorie count chart and she quickly said she would have to ask someone. No problem and expected...but what happened next was not:

She walked to the back of the galley-style kitchen past the viewing, walkin freezer to find her manager. Outside of the freezer is the prep area with a large gray garbage can. She stood there, asking her question, HOLDING THE GARBAGE CAN. Then she and the manager walked back to me.  The manager came with the paper and placed it on the prep line. And she grabbed a bowl to serve me. WAAAAAAIT! "Uh, excise me. Is that a garbage can?" I asked. She looked back and asked where. "There...in front of the freezer...the big gray thing with the black garbage bag stretched around the rim." "Yes". I asked her if she realized that she stood there and grabbed the rim and talked to her manager. "No," she replied. "My dear, I watched you and you not only grabbed the garbage can you just came and grabbed my bowl to serve me." She put the bowl down and walked away, washed her hands and apologized.

Needless to say, I won't be coming back.Against my better judgment, I went to Pat Murphy's again. I mean, it's right around the corner from my house and they have Smithwicks on tap. Plus, my friends were going for karaoke and I hadn't seen them in awhile.

Still a dump. Still lame. Still hate it.I would absolutely love to tell you that I discovered a gem on Thomas Road. I would love to be able to write how magnificent this place was but alas, I can't. I never got to taste anything. I never got to order anything. I walked into this dirt hole, holding my breath and tongue, and willing to order something in the hope that I could find some good Mexican food (good Mexican food is actually an oxymoron), anyway, I stood where it said "order here." I stood, and stood, I looked around, it appeared there was still business being conducted. A couple were eating in a booth. Hmmm....I stood. Waiting. No one came out from the back to acknowledge me, or take my order.

Now this isn't Pizzeria Bianco where if you ignore me I will wait. If you spit on me I will wipe it off and take the abuse to be able to experience the pizza. No, this is a dirty, disgusting Mexican dump situated a few feet across from an hourly motel and down the street from a strip club. This place should be lucky anyone has walked in and kiss my feet. Well, I gave up, I started to walk out and just as I was heading to the door, some "person" walked out from the back. I left.

If the service is that bad, I can't believe the food is going to sway me otherwise. In fact, I feel like I was saved from a case of botulism or diphtheria.I will never go to this place ever again! The day after my nails were done they looked like I'd had them on for over a week and my cuticles looked horrible! At every other nail place trimming up the cuticles are a part of the service. NOT AT THIS PLACE! It costs an additional $5! Not only did they refuse to fix them but they refused to give me my money back and were extremely rude!! The guy that works in there had the nerve to yell at me! I will never go back to this place again! I am going to stick to 7 day nail and spa in Tempe Marketplace!This place sucks!! I am from Chicago just recently sentenced to the valley, but I will tell you what, the food at this place is as authentic as a three dollar bill!! I mean they were rude, unfriendly, and their food reflected there attitude..it sucked! Owners let me tell you something just because you order a sign that say's "Chicago style" and hang it outside doesn't mean that it is and you may be able to trick your Phoenix natives but true chicago folk should know the difference. The reality is that if you were on Clark st. Competing for business you'd last about 10 minutes before you went dark. Your food is bland and nasty. Your employees seem like extras from the movie "coma" and look like they could use an FMLA day, and your place is unkempt and dirty. I pray that a white castle opens nearby and steals your handful of customers, it would not be hard. Next time I will take video of the place and the food as well as the staff and their attitude and post it on you tube for those who have any doubt. Finally, try using real Vienna giardinara peppers not your own creation because your way off. By the way, I will post a link to view your county health inspection for all to see!! Have a 
windy city day buckaroo.I had experienced first hand why it's not a good idea to slide down a banister drunk, and cracked the crystal on my favorite watch. After finally getting around to getting it fixed, I contacted The Watch Repair Company:

12/12/09: I call the shop asking about a price quote and ETA on when it would be fixed. I'm told it would be $20, and it would be finished Wednesday (12/16/09).

12/23/09: Almost a week after I was told the watch would be fixed I call the shop. I am told that the watch is not finished but it would be the next day (12/24/09, a.k.a. Christmas Eve). Surprised that he would work on Christmas Eve, I am told the watch would be ready between 1-2pm. 

12/24/09 3:01 PM: I call the shop, and am told that he just needs to get the watch put back together but it would be ready by 4:30. Frustrated I let him know I would be there at that time.

After The Watch Repair Company had fallen through twice, I was starting to get pretty frustrated with their complete lack of contact or clarity on when my watch would be fixed. The only guy that runs this place is almost completely impossible to understand, mumbling  in sort of a primitive way. No matter, I was especially excited to have my watch back.

12/24/09 4:30 PM: I walk into the shop and let him know I am there to pick up my watch. He pulls it out of a sleeve mumbling "I got it cleared on out, I can give you a call when the crystal comes in," and hands me the same exact thing I had given him two weeks ago. The crystal was still cracked. After all that, nothing had been done. I am completely speechless, grab the watch, and head for the door. He mumbles "There's no charge on that."

I still have no Idea what to say. What a complete waste of time. I have absolutely no idea how this place is still in business.Pretentious and overrated.

This is the kind of restaurant for people who a) miss New York, or b) don't know what they're talking about.  This is the kind of restaurant where you'll pay $200 for $100 worth of food.  It's not that it's bad, it's that it's pretentious.  To pay this kind of money is a strip shopping center is...overrated.

Yes, the owner-hostess it's just not worth it.  Very snooty to other patrons she deemed unworthy, save the money, go elsewhere.My wife and I stopped in for dinner and margaritas. We were seated right away and served chips and salsa  from there we sat and waited and waited for our waitress to show up.  We ordered food and drinks together because we weren't sure how long it would take her to return. Good thing because she didn't come back until food was ready. 
I ordered the pollo fundido. The chicken had NO flavor and the cream cheese on the top was so thick you couldn't taste anything but cream cheese.  We will NEVER return!!!I have been going to this place for over 35 years.  I am originally from Joliet, Il where is was called Aurelio's (owned by a different relative).  I was ecstatic to find this place 16 years ago when I moved to AZ.  I frequently visit the restuarant as well as order out.  The pizza is very good.  Just yesterday I ordered my pizza like I always do (my favorite super six) (even though it only has five toppings) and asked to hold the peppers.  To my surprise when I picked it up they charged me extra for HOLDING the green peppers.  They will not hold an ingredient on a special pizza.  What they do is charge you for the basic pizza with adding for each ingredient.  I was appalled to think that I would pay more for less ingredients.  I quickly refused the pizza and walked out.  The manager quickly followed me out to the car who proceeded to argue with me that they had a change in policy and that is how they do it.  He was clueless and felt that it was fair to charge more for less ingredients.  I quickly advised that they have just lost a long time customer and that I will not be returning.  Believe me I will not be returning.  Where is the family business I used to know......Ugh, so slow, and not friendly, they could care less if they have your business, and the food shows it.Went to Wendy's on 7th St. and Greenway for breakfast with my wife. They opened at 7. We were there when the doors were open. Two gentleman were ahead of us. The restaurant had approx 8 employees.we stood for five minutes, the employees totally ignored us, one of the men left. The other asked if someone could help him, a employee looked at him, didn't say a thing, turned her back and walked away! The shift Manager looked at as and said," we'll be with you in a minute" Five more minutes went by and all the employees, and the shift manager still ignored us! We left! I eat at Wendy's all over the valley and generally the service is fast. Not at this location. The owners just went through a complete rebuild of the location and it looks great, but the service before the rebuild was horrible and that didn't seem to change, in fact it was the worse service I've ever had anywhere. If you are the owners of this location please do something about your poor attitudes of your employees and your management staff. Attitude is everything and it starts at the top.Would give this joke of a salon 0 stars if at all possible.  Stylist quoted me a price that magically doubled when finally arriving at the Salon.  The stylist was 30 min late to the appointment we made over the phone.  Called and spoke to the manager who showed no interest or concern in my disappointment.  She spoke in a condescending rude tone.  Avoid this place like the plague.Horrible service!!! Don't ask for them to quote you a price before your grooming service. They will quote you low and then give you the "but once you get here the groomer will let you know what it will be for sure".... Once I arrived they originally quoted me $47 and the groomer said NO its going to be $83.... ? Never will I take my pets here again!!!!!!New owners New Menu Blah blah 

I used a restaurant.com coupon and wish I hadn't. 

Dumpy, bad service, worst food. 

3 kids and myself for dinner during the week, 

I had the steak, a nice rib eye ...BARF 
IT WAS ABOUT 1/4 INCH THICK, GREY IN COLOR, NO SEASONING, AND 2 GRILL MARKS (SERIOUSLY 2) IT TASTED LIKE IT WAS BOILED. 

I SENT IT BACK (VERY UNUSUAL OF ME) 

I went with the ribs, which were Gray and boiled tasting too but the sauce was good and I was done! 

She sucked at refilling water, it spilled everywhere when she did and she never mentioned any kind of discount or anything. 

2 kids want wings, which were on special for $0.35 each IF you buy drinks @ 1.75 each. (waitress proceeds to tell me this is CHEAPER then buying the wing plate. 

1.75x 2 = 3.50 
12 @ 0.35 = 4.20 
total 7.70 for 12 wings and 2 kids hopped up on Dr Pepper. 

I ordered the 5.50 for 12 wings. and 2 waters. 

PS Wings were good. 

Kid #2 got fish... it was greasy and chewy, she didn't even eat all. 

The salads we OK the dressings were OK. 

Don't bother unless it is the bar your are after, at least the bar girl was cute.POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE:
Called to get a price for one print job, and the guy who answered the phone interrupted me three times to quote prices before hearing the details of the print job. Needless to say, his first two quotes were less than half what the correct price for the job. They would not have honored the first two quotes. The guy was rude even when I thanked him for his help.THANK YOU! 
Finally WONDERFUL Italian food ... Yumm & double yumm!!!

That was last year.  And it was true. Wonderful warm welcoming feeling, wonderful food, wonderful service. And very understanding and cooperative toward my wife, who is blind. Even to the point of standing on a chair to direct and adjust the available light to best serve my wife. 
All in all quite impressive and worth the 5 * I gave it. 

But that was last year.  I don't know what happened, maybe they were sold, but this year was entirely different. No warm vibe, no welcoming feeling, totally empty, music and tv blaring, some staff person sitting at the bar texting, waiter says: this is the best lit table (it was pretty dark), I request the table were the guy adjusted the lights, he say I can't do that and it never happened, no one would do such a thing. And the woman at the bar chirps in that I don't know what I'm talking about.
Nasty nasty nasty - especially to a blind person. 
I wouldn't put anything in my mouth made in that hostile place. Stay away!Ran through their drive through last Thursday. The employee working the window seemed to speak english perfectly but kept asking me to repeat the order. (it happens so whatever, thought nothing of it despite the fact I only ordered one item).

After the 3rd time, he said "pull up". I pulled up to the window and had my card ready but was surprised to see said employee chatting away on his cell phone. He didn't say anything to me, not even my total and because I was dumb enough to have my cc ready in my hand out the window, he yoinked it and promptly charged it and continued chatting away on his cell phone IN FRONT OF ME.

I'm a cell phone whore just as much as the next person but I have the decency to know when and where this is appropriate. THIS WAS NOT THE TIME/PLACE, DUHHH much???

I stared down said employee thinking "surely, he MUST be getting off the phone to actually, ya know, provide SERVICE?" He eventually walked into the back out of sight, still never having said ANYTHING, not even "you want salsa?".

At least when I go across the street to Filiberto's, they have the decency to 1) give me a bloody freaking total and 2) ask me if I want some fu***** hot sauce. 

I'm not expecting a 5 star level of service (I'm realistic, not stupid) but stuff like this makes me want to shove cell phones up the employee's  noses. 

I won't be back.I advise not avoiding Phoenix pediatrics. The waiting room smells like cigarettes and walls & floor are very dirty. They are consistently running at least 45 minutes behind and when you finally see a doctor, he/she spends less than one minute with you.They need to fire that bitch Ashleigh. ...I did not tip you today because of the stuck up bitch attitude you had with me & with the mother and her sons before me.The surliness and thievery committed by the Phoenix based TSA employees really ruin PHX Sky Harbor from being a traveler Friendly Airport. This is also the same airport that kills drunk housewives! I use this airport weekly and have had numerous gear stolen by TSA employees at checkpoint C... Stolen items include portable hard drives, laptop batteries, USB drives and an LCD Projector.I hate this airport, friendliest my ASS! From security to gate agents to bus drivers to parking cashiers, this is one of the LEAST friendly airports I have ever subjected myself to. I've lived in many cities and currently have to endure the complete crap this airport is in every imaginable way. I'm so frustrated with it I will consider driving to LAX just to avoid using this shit hole. Yup, sitting here now after getting effed by United on a code share with Lufthansa. Umm, Lufthansa... why do you code share with this abomination of an airline? Maybe driving to Tucson is an option because I am not coming back to this place. PHX? BOO!Terrible airline operations, incompetent TSA.  You're better off flying in to ABQ and driving.I like to stay at Hilton Hotels, because I have an expectation for accommodations that are a little more upscale.  Well, skip this one.  In all the hotels I've stayed in this was the WORST mattress.  Didn't sleep at all.  I would have been better off going out to my car for sleep.  The room was what you'd expect in a less expensive place....old thin linens, furniture that needed to be replaced badly.  Then there was the restaurant.  I'd traveled all day and decided to go pick up a sandwich at the restaurant.  I figured they could do the least amount of damage to a club sandwich.  I got to my room....couldn't even eat it.  The white bread (not toasted, but totally dried out was also MOLDY.  There was no mayo on it, not that I would have eaten it if there was.  Yuk.  I fly out of Sky Harbor often, but will NOT try this hotel again!!Tried to call in order. Girl who answered the phone seemed lost and requested we be place on hold. (Hold as in place on counter and left to hear their personal conversations for over 5mins) Another women picked up seemed even more confused than the first on what we trying to do (how hard is we'd like to place a to go order). Finally gave up hung up on them and called our normal place just down the street from them. So much for trying something new.I have a similar story about Advanced Auto Service.

Went in for a routine oil change and came back with a repair order of over $3000 based on the steering. New rack and pinion, shocks, the works.

I politely declined and went to get a second estimate elsewhere. I didn't show this second autoshop the quote Advanced Auto gave me. He asked whether I was there because I've been quoted repairs, and showed him the quote. He laughed at it. My car needed none of the repairs I'd been quoted on.

He even guessed which auto shop had quoted me before I showed him it was from Advanced Auto Service on Warner street. So my advice is be careful.Service is fine. quality of food has fallen significantlyHigh prices, poor selection, and awful customer service. These are the reasons I chose not to register at Babies R Us in the first place. When l received BRU products at my shower and had no use for them I tried returning to the store. I did not have a gift receipt nor a gift registry so I was told they couldn't do anything for me. I was stuck with products I didn't need. Really? Is this how you treat your customers? The cashier admitted that each item was currently on the shelves but she had no way of "matching them up" against a receipt or registry. She even suggested that I try returning them to Walmart because their return policy is very lax. I was disgusted and offended. I was doing the right thing by taking the products back to the store from which they came. Even Target allows you to return things without a receipt. I'll never buy anything at BRU.Delirious from hunger and unable to think straight I let my daughter talk me into the worst decision I've made in quite sometime. 

We ordered a Tempura & California Roll Lunch Combo plus a tootsy maki and a tuna avocado roll rolled in toasted sesame seeds. 

The tempura arrived, everything was barely crisp, a tad greasy but otherwise somewhat edible. 

When we got our sushi rolls it was apparent with one look that they were total crap, however, starving as we were we decided to carry on and eat. 

Tootsy Maki= DooDoo Kaki! 

Don't be fooled by the long wait, they are not making these fresh to order. 
This was definitely a roll that was prepped and pre-rolled last night! 
The seaweed was chewy and slimy, the dried up rice almost broke my tooth and the crab mixture was like eating mayo that sat out over night. 

My Tuna and Avocado roll which I asked specifically to be rolled in TOASTED SESAME SEEDS, was no better with it's also chewy seaweed and RAW Sesame Seeds, I didn't order a 
damn big mac. WTF! 

The California roll that arrived lastly with the salad was the same kind of pre-rolled crap. We ended up leaving it. 

Unfortunately I had to pay for this shit, but made sure to thank the sushi guys for the worst sushi I've ever eaten and let them know that I knew they  had served us pre-rolled crap, and of course they had nothing to say but "have a nice day"! 

*vomits*My son made reservations for Mother' s day for our family and specifically requested handicapped accessible  seating.  Upon arrival we found we were seated  upstairs,  not on the main level by the handicapped entrance.  When I asked the location of the elevator I was told they don't have one..."it called legs".  (not a good response for an Iraq veteran in a wheelchair).  After being told to go back outside and up the main entrance to the upper level we found the seating involved steps.  When I pointed this out to the waitress, she suggested we just turn the wheelchair  backwards and take my son down the stairs.  When advised this was not acceptable. we were moved to an downstairs location.  This involved my son going back  down the upper ramp, outside and back in the handicapped entrance...then to the other end of the building.  This situation stressed my son so much he was unable to eat with us.  The staff at Rustlers  Roost is in dire need of sensitivity training.I came here after a car accident - I had smashed my head into the door panel and was having issues with memory and major migraines. Dr. Hetrick saw me once, then kept referring me to his PA - although she was nice, it really caught me off guard when she refused to prescribe certain medication because she hadn't had experience with it... So she would only prescribe meds she was used to, then told me to go see another doctor for everything else. After being overly drugged with nortriptolyne and topamax and having an adverse reaction to both, Dr.Hetrick's staff got overly pushy with Botox (for me it felt like they wanted me to get it so they could get a big payday rather than because it would actually help me). After I refused the botox Dr.Hetrick basically told me that he couldn't help me and that I need to go see someone else (like their acupuncture guy down the hall). I ended up switching Neurologists altogether and finally found one who was able to help - I ended up getting nerve blocks for several months which made my migraines go away completely. 

This story gets better - back in April I got a call from the billing office (Rose) who told me I owed some astronomical amount of money, so I referred her to my lawyer (who's handling my car accident claim). I thought everything was taken care of until I got a very unpleasant call from Rose just a few minutes ago telling me that she was sending me to collections. I asked her if she had spoken to my lawyer and she said that she lost her number... Super unprofessional. 

Either way - if you already suffer from headaches - you may want to avoid this additional one and find a neurologist who cares about your health and has a competent billing office.Although I usually love Target, this location is always lacking. The staff is rude and the baby section is tiny! They never seem to have anything in stock and when you ask them they grumble and tell you "everything's on the floor" always.
Everything is always on the floor? HmmmThis UPS location prominently advertises its printing services. Upon printing a shipping label, I was inexplicably charged $2.50 because the file was on a thumb drive, requiring the employee to spend an extra 20 seconds to retrieve it. No mention was made of this absurd charge prior to printing. I'll give it a solitary star, because it is conveniently located.死八婆  made me wait 30 minutes for some pan fried noodles and fried rice.So I've been to this restaurant 3 times just to make sure it wasn't me that was being rude or a jerk. 

So to start off the food is just ok, nothing too spectacular but not bad, but the pricing is high for the things here, I can get it at any other Korean restaurant for way less.

So here's is why I gave the place a one star.... The service it's not nonexistent it's pure rude like I borrowed money from them and didn't pay them back!! So every time I ask them about any dish on the menu they look at me like I was crazy, like I was from another planet or something for not knowing what I was asking about was. One time I was there for lunch at 2:30 or so with a buddy of mine and I asked them if I could order the happy hour dishes that starts at 3 and naturally they said no which was understandable so we order and started to eat til 2:57 when I asked again to get something from the happy hour menu the waitress looked at me with a look the a mom would give to her child when he did something bad and replied it's not 3 at that point I wanted to het up and leave  but my buddy said wait and at least finish lunch, ok I finished stood up and asked our waitress for a togo box from behinds the counter she the replied "for what?"....I was so done with this place told me buddy to pay and stormed out 

So for all you awesome people that read the my whole rant thank you and those who didn't.....well I STRONGLY would not recommend this place to eat maybe to get pissed off at but other then that yeah that's my two cent.What a crap experience !  Get someone who listens and speaks clearly to work the drive through!  Hope that idiot working there tonight enjoys that job because Jack in the box is about as good as he will get!I thought I did enough research before I had Lodi install my garage doors.  The sales part of it was pretty good. I guess i assumed too much ,  in thinking that my sales rep would at least try and match the door to the color of my entire house.... Installation was ok too....  although the auto door opener was mounted on the wall...and wired to the motor in a very "elementary " fashion to say the least....just sort of wrapped the wire around piping and draped across the ceiling.   No biggie. But I had problems with the keypad mounted outside...will not take the programming.  I had the repair rep out....  could not make it work ....he said it was a discontinued model, ( or something like that?)  He would look into it?  After hearing nothing I called back again...they want $85.00 for a service call?????  I explained the situation to the guy that answered....he said" $85.00 and we will come look at it.   No wonder they gave me a "good price" on the door opener that i bought?????  So NO outside keypad i guess.    I will NOT have them back !!!if you want garage door service dont call these guys.  purchased two garage door openers, went out of my way to make sure they had all the information about my doors, delt with a guy named jay, called him couple times giving him information including the fact they were 8' doors, service guy shows up says i can't do your doors no one told me they were 8' doors, i say ok when can you do them can you go get the hardware, he says no i'm too busy i have no idea when i can come back you'll have to call scheduling. give me a break, thanks but no thanks i'll take my business elsewhere suggest you do the same..................Customer service is nonexistent here.  Employees are not friendly at all.  Bagels were good, but not worth the lack I found personality from the employees.  Second visit w/ my family of 4.  Not a difficult order and not a busy time.  Next time we'll drive further to go to Bagel Nosh, Brueggers, or another Einstein on Val Vista where hopefully the employees will be less robotic.Maaan I'm not puttin No stars up, Ya'll close at 10 but giving me food at 9 looking like 10. Service Bad at this one, damn how many times do I gotta ask for breadsticks & water refill. Food looks like sum1 made it outta a box, shoot I could've made this, don't say I shouldve that's not the point, I come for 1 thing, it don't matter what time of day or Nyt food should look & taste the same....Olive Garden is good but Boo this one!!!  Skip my server also Craig, took his sweet ass time...smh....I guess I gotta put 1 dumbass star....the review was blank for a reason!Nothings changed here. Walked up to order breakfast, and the "manager" and crew members just ignored me. Guess why? They were discussing how to increase sales! Priceless.Installed a hot water system for me and botched the job. Terrible time getting them to repair their shoddy workmanship. The workers don't speak English. Use extreme caution when using this company. They hide  their poor reputation at Home Depot and screw up their good name to boot. I would not recommend delta mechanical.I just recieved HORRIBLE customer service at this store.  I went to purchase a Netbook for school.  My husband gave me his card and took mine because his account had the money in it.  I was able to swipe the card and push credit before I was ever asked for ID, then was told if I had the pin number to that card I would be able to use it but since I did not I couldn't.  To me that is suggesting credit card fraud without implicating themselves.  I left.  I went home and placed the order online, put it in my name, and set it for in store pick up.  Because the store was closing in 10 minutes I hauled butt out of the house and left my ID but had the printed reciept, with my homework on the back (I recycle).  I also had the card used for purchase, a debit card with my name, my android phone with the bestbuy emails confirming my order, my checking account reciept, and many other ways to prove I am who I am.  (Not to mention the sales associates who had helped me minutes before).  I seriously doubt, at 9 pm, someone is going to know I placed that order, come to my house and steel the reciept, and go to best buy all in a timespan of 10 minutes, but whatever.  I also told them they could look up my best buy reward zone account and I would verrify every product purchased and what store they were purchased at.  This was not happening.  I got a little irate...I had been at this for hours, been to different locations, and now was being told that after I spent hundreds of dollars with them I could not have my item. Before I ever got rude, just a little loud, I was told that my behavior would not be tollerated.  I said this is why I hate best buy no customer service.  He told me he could easily cancel my order and I could spend my money somewhere else.  REALLY??? REALLY??? They then called mall security and the cops. That is when I started cussing.  So this is how they treat the people who keep their business alive. Circut City didn't do too well...any business can fail.  Best Buy has never honored our warenties, have never been nice after we spent money with them until we were ready to spend more,  geek squad messed up my desk top so bad that even the CIS and Electronics professors at my college could not fix it (after geeksquad tried to charge me to fix their mistake)...this was the LAST straw.  I am completely done.This place has the best wings! My fav is the honey hot. I've been going here for years. A year and a half ago, I moved to California and whenever I come back to Arizona I have to stop by for my wings. Today, I go thru the drive thru and order 2 orders of the honey hot, headed back to the freeway because we're heading home and realize that we only got one order. We had to turn around, go back to complain and the girl that took our order tells us that she only charged us for one, then if the fact that they charge a "convince" fee for using a card isn't bad enough, they want to charge us it again when they inconvenienced me. I mean, come on... Take an accurate order. Do your job! Plus she went and got the owner and he was a jerk. Talking over us and arguing with us. They have lost my business. Making a mistake on an order is forgivable but having poor customer service is unacceptable.Where to start with this RAG, "The Arizona Repulsive" ??

They are the worst example of an alleged newspaper.  The Accounting practices are the worst, including FRAUD by the accounting department.  Yes, FRAUD.  When confronted with that, they never denied it.

If you don't get a paper today, you will NOT get it today... tomorrow "IF" you are lucky.

ALL employees in the "Customer NO Service" department are outright liars.  Every stinking one of them.  In one phone call, if you speak to  several people, you will get a different answer from each and everyone of them.  Call back, same subject, same runaround, different lies.  Guaranteed !

Another thing, their alleged "New" website is a 100% rip-off of the USA Today !!  How easy that was, "New and Improved", sure.

After you cancel, if you are lucky enough for someone to get that, they will sell your name and phone number to telemarketers.  Now, you are faced with getting rid of them.

Don't waste your time and precious money on this bird cage liner.

Actually their score should be minus 10 or worse..Middle of the road service & taste.  Weird, cold atmosphere in lounge.  Pricey for quality.  I saw Schwan's trucks in the back & checked menu... It's what they serve!Amidst a sea of chain restaurants along a seemingly endless row of strip malls, I expected this little Mom & Pop to at least try to compete. We should have stopped at the complimentary chips and salsa because everything we actually paid for was bland... even the service!the folks at my work would order this food quite often.  This doesn't say much  considering my coworkers love for strange underwhelming establishments.  You could fry a roach, call it Orange Chicken, and my coworkers will back weekly!(see Ben V.'s review)  I ordered delivery one time and was grossed out enough that I ended up throwing everything away after the first bite.  I eventually implemented a rule that we would no longer provide business to this restaurant after a terrible call we received from them.  Our company would order delivery almost weekly and would always throw quite a bit of money at this business.. Furthermore the tip would always be VERY generous.  Until one day we left a tip of... (please play dramatic countdown piano riff in your head here) 10 DOLLARS!  AHHHHHH!!! With the next order that was placed, the business contacted us to complain of the size of our tip, stating they weren't sure if they could deliver our current order if we are only going to tip blah blah blah.  Thats right, they complained about only getting a 10 dollar tip for the delivery. (the bill was only about 40-50 dollars) .  You are far better off sticking to local joints that are not only delicious but are grateful for your business. (TOTT's, dragon express, etc....)I was in today and was cut by the callous removal tool on my ankle during a pedicure. It bled and stung and was not pretty. I was compensated by a 10% discount.(?) This is not how I would do business if I wanted to retain a brand new customer whom I just cut a chunk of skin off their ankle. Ouch! good thing i didnt have an event tonight and had to wear heels. Horrible service!i have been here twice once for breakfast and once for dinner. the breakfast was  average. For dinner i had enchiladas and taco it was the worst mexican food i have ever had. the sauce tasted like the dollar store sauce and the enchilada had green olives on it, you dont put green olives on that kind of food.  the silverware was dirty and there were flys buzzing  all around.  the waitress was ok , but i won't be going back.AWFUL CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!  Seem to employ under-experienced groomers, has poor, very poor customer service.... they couldn't even call me when my pet was done because they never asked me for my information let alone any record of my dog's last vaccinations! I would NOT TRUST AARDBARK GROOMERS!!!!!Not overally impressed with the quality of the lunch here. Food was average at best. They actually brought the wrong burger to my wife and instead of fixing it like a great establishment would, they simply brought her the extra toppings. Lame.Everyone should eat here if they want to get really bad Food Poisoning and almost die!!!!Wow, I have never received worse customer service than here.  Set up a tee time for a saturday morning round of gold with some buddies from college.  It had rained all week and was raining the morning of our reservation and was about 40 degrees at 6 am.  I wore a collared shirt and blue jeans due to the cold.  Mind you, I understand the need for a dress code at nice golf courses to keep the riff raff out.  My jeans were presentable, my shirt was a nice polo, and NOWHERE on the website does it state no denim, only the need for a collared shirt. When I arrived, I met Mike, who is the cashier at the clubhouse.  From the second I walked in the door, Mike started harrasing me about my jeans, telling me I could not play yet would still have to pay because of the 24 hour cancellation policy.  Mike was extremely rude and unwilling to have a rational discussion about the "unposted"dress policy. 10 fays later, they charged my credit card I had used to reserve the time for $240 which I disputed.  I, for one, will never golf here again although I have played at Johnson Ranch several times while in school.  The course is average.  First nine holes can be found anywhere for less money, back nine is nice although all the building of houses has diminished its appeal. If you value any type of customer service for your hard earned money, look elsewhere.  Superstition Springs is much nicer for the price in my opinion.Worst nail experience I've ever had!  He cut them shorter then they should have been cut and  I asked for "squareish" cut on my nails, so they'd be rounded on edges, but there was no rounding.  After I had paid, before he put polish on them, I said they still needed to be rounded and he said it was too late....and he meant it!  My pedicure left me with skin hanging off two toes - not trimmed well.  Very little interaction with me during the hour I was there and the tools didn't look clean.  I will never return...and would advise you go elsewhere if you want quality work!Worst gel manicure I have ever had.  She destroyed my nails when taking the polish off.  She clipped my skin and then smiled at me.  And the next day the polish was literally peeling off.  Bad service + bad results = bad review.  I was hoping to like it since it is in the neighborhood.I would NOT recommend this Pets Mart to take your dog for a grooming. I have a West Highland White Terrier and took him in for a traditional Westie cut. He came back with a "cocker" cut, not a Westie cut and looked ridiculous. I took him a few days later to another groomer and they asked me "Who did this?" I told him Pets Mart, North Scottsdale and they said that he was not groomed to the breed standard and that his "genital" area and arm pits were not done to regulation and it was not sanitary!! Will not be going back there. I think their employees need better training. They don't seem professional to me at all.1stars...is all they get. I used this dry cleaner about 4yrs ago...my pants weren't cleaned well and they flat pressed them. Last Friday I decided to try them again (times are tough & they're cheap). I asked the guy to plz make sure they creased my slacks...not flat press. Well today I picked my order up and sure enough all 3 pair were flat pressed!!! It ticked me off bcz of course I asked for creased...but besides I wanted to put another pair in for cleaning.  The guys said they were sorry-the kid I put my order in with was suppose to tag my slacks "crease". 

Well I did put in another pair of slacks today; the new guys said they would tag them crease.

I'll see how the slacks come out tomorrow.  

After tomorrow I will exclusively use Z cleaners. Z cleaners is very pricey...but they always do a phenomenal job...and you dont have to request your slacks to be creased.

Also there is a (I believe) a $0.50 charge for debit/credit...not a big deal...just thought you should knowAVOID, AVOID, AVOID!!!!!  I went to this dentist because his office is located very close to where I live.  Keep in mind, I'm in my 30's.  Never had a cavity in my life.  NOBODY in my family has cavities.  Up until my visit to this guy, my teeth were perfect.  

He uses this sonar wand thing that detects 'microcavities' that have yet to show up on an xray and tells me that my teeth are perfect EXCEPT for these 'microcavities'.  He scares the daylights out of me by telling me that unless I get 10 'microfillings' in my 'microcavities' they will be full blown cavities within 6 months.  Alarmed by this prediction, I set up an appointment to get 4 of these 'microfillings' put into 3 of my teeth immediately with the intention of getting the rest of my mouth done later.  I go in to get my teeth drilled on the next day and the anaesthesia he used was so strong, I felt like I was going to have a heart attack (I have had anaethesia before and it was never like this).  He proceeds to drill on my teeth and that was the beginning of my dental  problems.  For about a month and a half I suffered discomfort chewing and temperature sensitivity.  I finally call the office and complained and they tell me to come in for an 'adjustment'.  He does some more drilling and it seems a bit better, but still my teeth still don't feel the same.  A few weeks later, I notice a black dot on one of the teeth he has massacred.  I brush it and it appears to go away, however, I notice a very small cavity on that tooth that is going through the filling.  WTF?!?  I immediately make an appointment to see my old dentist (who's office is far from where I live, but has been my dentist for the last 11 years).

I tell my dentist what this guy told me and did to me and I come to find out the 'microfillings' were COMPLETELY UNECESSARY!!!  My dentist just shook his head and said 'that's too bad'.  Everyone has small fissures in their teeth.  They are a cause for concern if you are a teenager, but for mature adults who maintain good dental hygiene, they are basically dormant and as long as you continue with good brushing habits, they will remain dormant.  

My old dentist proceeds to tell me that the dot I am seeing on my tooth is the result of an air bubble in the filling material that popped and exposed my drilled-on tooth to decay.  Now, after this M-F'er jacked my teeth up, I have a real cavity that is showing up on xrays.  My dentist told me I could go back to Douglas and have him fix the filling for free, I said ABSOLUTELY NO WAY IN HELL AM I LETTING THIS A-HOLE within a mile of my teeth.  I would rather pay my old dentist to fix this botch job.  Keep in mind that the reason I had this work done was because of the scare tactics he used.  Well it's been over 8 months and the 6 'microcavities' that I did not end up filling (because of my nightmare experience with the first 4) are NOT full blown cavities like I was scared into believing would happen.  In fact, the teeth on the side of my mouth that this guy did not touch are perfect.  So, now I have a real cavity in the tooth he jacked up and I have to suffer the rest of my life by being on the never ending hamster wheel of maintaining these unecessary fillings every 5 years.

So, the moral of the story is: Don't get seduced by all his high tech equipment.  Those kind of offices are all about the flash and sizzle and somebody has to pay for all that overhead and expensive equipment.  Guess what?  That somebody is YOU!  He will come up with any excuse to work on your teeth to generate revenue even if the work is COMPLETELY UNECESSARY like mine was.  If he mentions the word 'micro-filling' or 'micro-cavity' get out of your chair and RUN out of his office unless you want your mouth utterly destroyed.The guy who helped me was really rude and barely said a word to us. Didn't even give us the different price options and it ended up costing a lot more than we expected. Unfriendly and made us, the customers, feel like a nuisance.My recommendation, do not go!  Tonight's dinner could possibly be the worst experience at any restaurant ever.  Our server was short with us and seemed to have no time and it wasn't even busy.   The food was pure grease with cheeses and sauce. La Torretta was over priced and the atmosphere was plain and seemed quite dated.  

I don't know who might have posted the other positive reviews but I can only guess it's family.I had a lower blepharoplasty (eye lift) by Dr. Nachbar in September 2003. This procedure left me needing reconstructive surgery costing additional thousands of dollars. My eyes will always have Dr. Nachbar's mark on them. Some of the damage is not fixable.

The results of my surgery left both eyes with incisions that were placed  low and not in a natural laugh line. To make things worse, the left eye incision curved down from the corner of the eye, extended out to about 3/4 of an inch and ended with a divit. This divit was created when the stitches were painfully pulled out. The incision scarring healed horribly and widened out leaving me with an indentation and redness to this day. The left eye was also left with a pucker from improper draping of the skin. A  piece of fat was left behind under the right eye which gave me the appearance of a big bump under that eye. Both eyes were hollowed out and rounded out leaving me with a completely different eye shape. My eyes had continual pressure, pain, irritation, and itching for 3 years after the procedure.

I communicated my concerns to a Sharon Brown on staff by e-mail and phone. She was completely unhelpful. I requested my money back and never received it.

I am not a person who easily dispenses bad reviews. If I could give zero stars I would. I truly regret every day that I chose Dr. Nachbar as my surgeon. I hope this review helps you in your choice.Continue to be horrible. Now I ordered carpet, they input the wrong one, when I communicate this they tell me the carpet I ordered 12/24 is no longer carried! This store is a train wreck.One word.  Yuck!By far the WORST wash I have ever received anywhere, and this was a $70.00 service.  I still have stains on my passenger side carpet (which was the reason for getting the shampooing in the first place).  I don't think that they even washed it as they were supposed to.  I had to tell them for 20 minutes major areas that they had missed.   I need to clean all of  the windows myself since they are dirty still and have water spots and fingerprints on them.  The guy I arranged everything with was nice and assured me everything would be perfect.  I told him if I was going to pay so much I was going to be very picky.  He understood and guaranteed it would be perfect.  However, he was not the one doing the work.   I would be upset if I had only paid $12.00, because there are plenty of places that do a much more thorough cleaning for that.  But having paid far more, I feel the need to alert my fellow yelpers to this scam of a car wash.  My car reeks of mildew and the wet seat with whatever they used to clean stained my shorts a yellowy brown color.  Thank God I didn't have somewhere to be after the car wash.  This place is a nightmare!Never been here. Just tried to get a menu to place an order for an office.  I was told there is no menu on the web.  And that they can't fax me one.  So.... they don't want take out business??  He said I should come in. Then what - call back to the office for the orders of everyone.Needed a simple screw tightened on an implant. Standard screwdriver does it. They quoted me a dentist and 2 specialists and $750.  I have done it myself before but thought I would have a dentist take a look at it.

Update went to a different dentist and he tightened it for $59.If I could give no stars I would. I went in with my friend looking for a dress for her wedding. We tried to find someone to help us and when we finally did all she did was point and say " the dressing rooms are over there" that was all the help we were offered the whole time we were there. And in the dressing room there was no one to help us and an entire rack fell over and almost hit us. We will never return, I highly do NOT recommend this store.The Coffee - standard starbucks.

The People that work here?  Zombies

I've been coming here for 6 months and order the exact same 'ordinary' thing, and NOT ONCE have that remembered what I order.  It's a friggin coffee - plain - same size every friggin time.

One visiting this location should not expect any "hospitality", "emotion", "intelligence", "warmth" or any normal service that one would get at a more personal cafe.

Get your coffee and leave - and remember, the coffee isn't THAT good anyway.

This place sucks.Multiple issues from time of check in until check out. 
I called to make the reservation, I was considering a different hotel but chose the Fiesta specifically because I was told breakfast was included with the room rate. Upon check in, I was told breakfast was not included. The front desk receptionist was rude and off-putting. I asked to speak to the manager. She went behind a partition and came back out and told me that the manager said breakfast wasn't included. The manager wouldn't even come out to talk to me. I got my key and went to my room. I headed out about 5 minutes later and had the shuttle driver drop me at my destination. When my husband and I were ready to go back to the hotel, we called for the van. I got into the van, but he wanted to stay a little bit longer at the bar. So I asked the shuttle driver to drop me at the hotel, then go back to the same corner to pick up my husband. He said he would. I texted this information to my husband assuming he would be back at the hotel within about an hour. I was sitting in the lobby texting him and a large woman that I assume worked for the hotel came up to me aggressively and asked "are we expecting any problems tonight??!" I was taken aback by her aggressive tone and stance. I just said "uh... no..." and this scared me enough to head to my room and wait for my husband to get there. 
I fell asleep within about 5 minutes and woke in the morning to find that he was still not in the room. I checked my phone and had missed calls and voicemails from him, but my phone was on vibrate so I didn't hear it ring and it didn't wake me up. 
Apparently the driver never went back to get him. So, my husband ended up taking a cab to the hotel. When he got to the hotel, he asked for the room number and was told that it wouldn't be given to him. The room was in my name and I was the one who  checked in and had the room key. My husband explained the situation and was still told that he could not have the room number. I do understand the security reasons behind this and I respect that protocol. HOWEVER, why wouldn't the hotel staff simply call my room to verify that my husband was allow to have access??? Or have the security person come to my room and knock on the door to ask me? I do not understand why they wouldn't do this. Especially given that the drive KNEW I was waiting for my husband and I gave NO INDICATION to the security guard that there was a safety or security issue. 
End result is that they literally KICKED HIM out of the hotel. They would not give him my room number nor would they try to accommodate him, other than calling him a cab. The cab ride home cost us over $100. Simply infuriating. I plan to post this review on many review sites and I will make sure word of mouth gets out as well about the unprofessional and aggressive attitude of the staff. I'm outraged. We were treated like second class citizens. Something needs to change or I expect your "resort" will likely be closing soon.Terrible experience at this office. I've gone back twice for the same problem and am still having issues. Ironically enough, before the filling my tooth felt fine and ever since the procedure i've had nothing but problems with the tooth. I will not be returning to this office ever again. Maybe It was a fluke... but I doubt it and i'm not going to stick around to find out.We were going to eat at Beavers Choice but they were closed today. We decided to try Ted's Hot Dogs since so many people everywhere including the workplace rave about this place. Our order was taken and we got to the part were they top your order I noticed they put BBQ sauce on my no sauce chicken sandwich. I didn't want to hold up the long line to ask for a replacement.

THE MAIN REASON FOR THE ONE STAR RATING 

I tasted my iced tea and I am not certain what they filled my cup with? I didn't see bubbles for soda but it didn't taste like iced tea but the color was sort of dark. I asked my husband to taste it and he couldn't tell me what it was either. I think it might have been a mix of iced tea and diet soda syrup. I did NOT drink it and took a few sips of my husbands soda. If I can't trust them to give me iced tea that is a problem. 

The hot dog is extra fatty and greasy, the BBq chicken sandwich is overpowered with sauce and grizzle.
Also

The onion rings were a bag of greasy unseasoned crumbs with only a few pieces of onion. 


I know most people Love Ted's and they are most likely OK most of the time so give them a try!Had a bad experience with promised sale prices on a used car. Drove 30 miles went into dealer to buy the car and found they had jacked it up 1000.00 from what we discussed after they got me in the door. Dealt with Dave, Charles and Steve. Steer clear they will waste your time.I'm new to AZ, but I've always been very pleased with Big O in California.  So today, when I got a flat I decided to head to the closest Big 5 and have my two rear tires replaced.  I phoned ahead and was told that they would have my tires in around 2:30pm and would give me a call.  I got the call around 4pm and headed right over.  The wait was longer than I am accustomed to, and after a while I was called into the garage area.  I notice that the hood of my car is open.  "That's odd," I think since they are only supposed to be swapping the rear tires.  The mechanic explains to me that they can't get the hood to latch and wants to know if there is anything wrong with it.  "No, it's never given me any trouble at all in six years, and why the hell are you poking arounud under my hood when all I want done is the two rear tires replaced?"  He explains that they are doing a "courtesy check" of all my fluids and such.  Great, now please close my hood.  Over the next 20 minutes a procession of mechanics spray WD40 into the latch and slam the hood with increasing violence.  Eventually, someone gets it closed.  The manager comes over for me to pay the bill (which I do).  I tell him that I'm pretty upset that my hood was fine, didn't need to be messed with and now has to be violently slammed to close.  He gives me a line that "we open and close hoods all the time, and we couldn't possibly have screwed it up."  Ok, fine, whatever, I've already spent too much time here and need to be on my way.  I leave, angry, but done, or so I think.  About a mile from the shop, as I approach a stoplight my rear hatchback pops open.  Apparently they couldn't manage to close that properly either.  There are some good Big O's out there, this isn't one of them.  Avoid this location like the plague.Wasn't that good,, tasted a lot like Pizza Hut,, really wasn't worth the price.... You can tell they use frozen dough.... The sauce tasted like it came straight from the can.. Just wanted to try it once,, but I assure you I will never go back....  I can make a better pizza at home....Scheduled me and my two kids.  Appt at 9 am.  Didn't see the first of us until 10am.  Didn't let me escort my daughter (teen) but did let me escort my son (at about 10:30am).  They were disorganized and behind schedule.  My daughter said the doctor/dentist wasn't personable-- didn't explain things to her.  She said the hygienist was nice though.  Same dentist seemed like he wanted to get my son in for more xrays, son might be missing an adult tooth underneath baby molar.   But then the assistant took us back after he left and did full pano xray.  He was not missing that tooth.  Weird that the dentist wasn't willing to do it right then-- wanted us to make another appt.  They did fluoride treatment on my daughter without asking me, which was $17.  Which I paid, but they should have asked first, I would have said yes-- principle though.  I never got seen, they ran out of time for me, because we had to leave by noon.  Took 2.5 hours to see 2 out of 3 of us.  Weren't very friendly.  And to boot, I found out they use Dr Jeffrey Kootman for their surgeon on Thursdays-- he did extracted my wisdom teeth years ago and I would NEVER let him touch my kids or myself EVER again.  Very disappointed.  Don't get Total Dental insurance-- hard to find a good dentist and this is an example of what you get!Can I give no stars please?!?! Went in there and had My boyfriend ask for a water- bartender refused to serve us because we had been drinking already. Aren't they obligated to do that? What a joke. F the Yelp reviews. Service is what's worth talking about, and Tonys Definitely does not deliver.
BoooOooOoOoo!The food may be good, but the staff and service stink.  I have come here a couple of times since they are open 24 hours.  I went to the drive thru and sat there for 10 minutes with no acknowledgment, so I decided to go in.  I had to wait another 5 minutes to order.  The cashier then overcharged me for my food. When I complained the cashier made it be known how inconvenient it was.  As i sat to wait for my order, the staff began speaking in Spanish about my order.  (I know Spanish) While I didn't catch everything that was said,  it was enough for me to throw away my food as I walked out the door from an uneasy "they probably spit in the food" feeling.Worst place to go if you really want to eat and enjoy......bad food complimented with worst service possible in this world. Ambiance is ok ok kinds......only good thing is it is not one of those restaurants which looks like rat holes. Staff is not at all courteous.......and it looks like they don't know how to smile to your customers....looks like they are only paid to serve...not to treat their customers well.      
We orders some dishes and 4 gobi paranthas.....they came back after 10 mins informing us that they are out of flour and so can serve only 3....we said okay.......but were shocked to hear such an excuse!! Anyhow...that was not the end....when they actually brought food, they told us that they don't even have a single so they chose for us to bring plain naan (not even asking us or apologizing)!!  Wait....that was not the end too!! When they brought the check...it was having an extra beer which we never ordered...and when I pointed this out to the owner...he behaved as if I had done a crime pointing this out....he said how can you blame us like this....we put only those things that we ordered...and refused pointblank to accept the mistake.
Overall...a strict no no for this place.....Roaches on the bar? Kitchen closed at 10;15 PM? What happened to this place? YUCK!!!! Caught a roach on the bar and put it in a glass upside down. No apology, the barkeep just put it on the other side of the bar near other employees standing around talking!! The counter was dirty and there was trash on the floor and under all the counters!! Where is the health commission? I used to love this place but I can't drink and not eat. dui alley is right there and it's only 10:15!! Still very hungry sounds like bad management. Thank god off site betting keeps them alive but damn this place is filthy. They should be embarrassed but I will take my business back Mellow Mushroom where the kitchen is always open and the bar is cleanBoth my wife and I got sick the next day after eating at Carrabba's.  The wait staff is friendly and attentive but the food was not prepared fresh or kept at safe temperatures. We will not be eating here again.So apparently everything has changed at our favorite neighborhood Mexican place.  The last 2 times we were the food was terrible!  3 Margarita's officially broke my heart and I am unwilling to get hurt again!If I could give it zero stars I would. Service was slow and horrible. I tried the meat sampler which looked like they cut open someone's stomach who had recently eaten BBQ, boiled it up, drowned it in BBQ sauce and then served me that mess. Greasy, disgusting...I almost crapped myself on the way home. Seriously, I almost didn't make it. All I can say is that Guy Fieri is a total f$%^ing whore for recommending this dump.

If you really want to go there, make sure you wear diapers before eating.I went in to pick up a few things and headed to check out.  5 people in front of me and within 1 minute , 3 behind me; one cashier.  She waits on 2 people with multi items and as I am walking out of the store, she finally calls for back up.  This is the second time this has happened in the last 30 days in exactly the same way and with the same outcome for me.  I went back the second time because they have always been courteous and I thought it was a one time thing.  They obviously have some kind of staffing issue that isn't working very well and I won't be going back any time soon.  My money spends everywhere.I try not to have any regrets in life, but i regret not going to my normal place.
My friend and I needed pedicures and quality girl time together.  This place was between her and my house and I found a coupon, so we went.
There's nothing special about this place.  The same prices and services as every other nail salon in the grocery store plazas.
My toes look really nice, except for the chunks of skin missing around my nails.  I don't really have much cuticle down there, so that may have been the problem.  Maybe she has a routine.  
It hurts to walk.  4 of my toes have scabs surrounding my nails.  Last I checked, the cuticle only grows on the bottom.  
I guess that's what I get for trying to save $2.This place is not woman of color friendly, If you are African American you will BR ignored for fair skin ladies that the sales staff thinks will purchase more. I went in on a Thursday evening lookin to purchase a few items after the sales girls helped two people that walked in after me, when one finally acknowledged me she said she had to take a phone call and left and neve came back! No one else recieved that treatment but me, terrible service I took my money elsewhere.Gluten free people need Tamari, I understand you have soy sauce but that doesn't help me, come on Sakana, we come here so often, it's 3 dollars.Stopped for lunch.  Service and food are not  good.  I had the ham and cheese melt.  Bread wasn't toasted and soggy, fries were burnt.  Husband had the crispy chicken sandwich- not worth $10.  Bread was hard and not fresh, fries were burnt also.  We split a slice banana cream pie.  It was okay but nothing about it taste homemade.  As we left I heard they were under new management and I'm wondering if this is why it's going downhill?  Kinda sad as we like to support the locals.I can tell you this I will not be a regular here. Sorry Big Apple but me no likee. You get good size portions but quality and taste is a big part of it too. chicken strips overcooked with a hard crust. .Whatever the heck the corn mush was tasted bad.  They are testing out a dark loaf of bread was supposed to be served with meal we got that toward the end. No bueno no flavor to it. I ordered a steak it was nasty dry and small. I was like this aint no rib eye. There was no steak sauce. Oh and the smoked chicken was so overcooked it was very dry I think it was old ugh. Well at least we had a nice time with the family. Thats all that matters.The least satisfying place in Goodyear. Not only did we experience slow service(2hr wait) but the owner (and manager) clearly expressed  no concern that four people in our party specifically ordered gluten free pasta and meals received regular pasta and breaded meats. When we pointed out the time delay and food allergies they replied " so what is the problem?"

A lack of concern for their service is obvious.Rude employees.  Don't expect much help. Slowest check-outs EVER.I have decided that I hate this place. It was almost a hard decision because their baja sauce is awesome, but there are so many things to hate that I have to be the "Paul Revere of Yelp" and warn all of you good people.

They are sneaky little weasels and want to take your money. I ordered a baja burro and the server asked "with guacamole and sour cream"? While she was nodding her head. So I said yes. The bill came and I was being charged an extra $4.00 for sour cream and guacamole that I didn't even use. I know what you are thinking, "that's your fault, she probably asked if you wanted to add it," but that is not the case. Same thing happened at dessert, we ordered the deep fried ice cream and we were asked if we wanted chocolate or regular, so we picked chocolate (the menu doesn't say anything about chocolate costing more money), but sure enough... A teaspoon of Hersheys is another $2.50. Fast forward a week later, the same thing happens to my coworker at the downtown location, they pay an additional $4.00 for sour cream and guac that they didn't even use. I am under the impression that the servers are actually trained to ask you in a way that implies that it is included to jack up your bill.

Look, their food is okay, but the prices are absurd. You can find much better Mexican food at half the price all throughout the Valley. Hell, you can go to Outback and have a steak, salad, bread, blah blah blah for less money. 

The decor is old and tacky, the last server we had hit on my wife while I was in the restroom... Seriously, he said "He left you? if I was your man I would never do that to you, I would treat you like a queen." Yeah, okay Macayos guy with your extra $4.00 that you stole, go on with your bad self.The facility is big enough but that is kind of the only positive thing I can say.  The ice is bad, the price outrageous. My main problem however is how bad it is for families.  I've been to other facilities where we could bring an umbrella stroller (for a 1-year-old) but here-no dice.  Which is made more unfortunate because it's not posted anywhere.  We had to show up to find out.  They also don't have any walkers for inexperienced skaters-so two of my kids who were looking forward to it couldn't do much.  At least my 7 year old had fun.   I really did try to be nice to the employees when I suggested they put more on their website but they were apathetic teenagers who were less than helpfulWorst Dennys ive ever been to. Waited 30 minutes for a half plate of food. Waitress was unattentive. Meanwhile our buddies in the table next to us ate, payed the bill, and were completely done before WE EVEN GOT OUR FOOD. The manager offered no discount or comp or anything for our troubles. Thats pretty bad service. Id give it half a star if i could..Not impressed and won't be back.  Service was great. We came with our restaurants.com coupon and they did not charge us the 18% tip the rule said was required which was nice but we still tipped them well. 

Place is clean and roomy. Has a TV but was hard to hear over the noise and it wasn't very crowded.

We ordered the 20" pizza and mild wings.  Was happy about the large sizes. We had pepperonie and garlic topping with their regular thin crust.  Wing had good flavor and was not overly drenched in sauce. They were meaty and plump.
Pizza was very sad. Crust was flavorless cardboard looked and tasted like a premade frozen type.  Sauce tasted ordinary and blah out of a can.  Not enough toppings and the garlic I think was from a jar not fresh.

Won't be back.How can someone call this a pizza?  Saw the deals and reviews of how wonderful this place was so I had to try it.  When I got my pizza I was not sure of what I was looking at.  The crust was soggy, cheese not fully melted, and sauce was memorable in a bad way.  I guess I got what I paid for.It saddens me terribly right now to give such a low rating to this hotel, when the hotel was actually awesome. The rating is so low due to the customer service my friends and I received from the pit boss during Sunday morning (6/2/13) blackjack session. My softball team and I all stayed at Sunset Station for a softball tourney that we had about 10 miles away. The price was right and we had a teammate who was a high roller at this casino. The food and service the restaurant was great, and the customer service in the gift shop was excellent as well. The problem arrived when 3 friends and I sat down early Sunday morning, money and drink in our hands to play $5 blackjack. The dealers Nana and Leissle were happy to have a change of pace and to play with 4 girls excited and eager not only to tip but to celebrate our winnings together. The cocktail waitresses also enjoyed our company. We sat at this table
For at least 3 hours while the pit boss Ralph continued to tell us we were too loud?!?!!?! As the 4th hour approached us, my friend and I hit a 3rd blackjack in a row betting a $25 hand and we all screamed in excitement. The PitBoss Ralph- then decided to kick myself and my friend out for being too loud! When I asked for a manager, they brought over a large security guard named Mark to escort us out. As we tried to reason with them, I kindly and cooperatively asked to speak with a manager. They denied me the rights to speak with a manager then Mark put his hands on me and told me he would call the cops. I then asked to speak to his manager. After two more security guards came over and our friends were in tears and we had all been denied the right to speak to a manager they denied us yet again and asked us  to fill out a comment card! Even one of the cocktail waitresses walked over to explain to the security guard that we were doing nothing wrong. The security guards then warned us they had called the police and they were on their way. We exited the casino immediately after that. I will never stay here again, nor will my team or anyone I know. I will be calling to speak with a manager and because I left my name and number I am expecting ad waiting for someone to call me!!! Worst customer service and Las Vegas and overall casino experience I have ever had. Be aware and do not stay there. The rooms are cheap, but at what cost!!! You have no rights, and no respect!!!!!Had an appointment today for my son, I have been a patient for years. Our original appointment was for 2:30 we were called earlier in the day and asked if we could come earlier ,I changed the appointment to 1:00. After waiting till 2:15 and still not being seen I told the girl at the front desk that we would be leaving. She didnt seem to care at all. I have always found the doc and PA here to be great however their staff has always sucked. Based on this I will Not be returning. I will find a new doctor for me and my son. Doctors should never forget that the patients time is important also.i would never have gone here since i hate italian chain places but we were given a gift certificate. So here is the breakdown
Calamari- I could have fit the whole order in my hand. I was overdone and the worst i ever had.
-Eggplant Parm- Me wife had this and took three bites. She said it was under cooked and very bland. I tried a forkfull of the pasta that came with it. No taste at all
-Lasagna Bolognese. So - so. It was not that bad for a chain place but i would not go back for it
-Tapas meatballs. They were drowned in sauce and carmalized onion..apparently for a reason. to cover up their horrid taste.
 
The only chain place i would order pastas are Cheesecake Factory, they are all good there!!This place was horrible!  The pizza was so bad I had to spit it out... I also ordered the chopped salad, not only was the salad chopped to nothing, the balsamic dressing was not good.As a Las Vegas resident I have visited numerous Chipotles across town. This one is by far the worst. They give you as little as possible. The workers are stingy with the food like it is coming out of their paycheck. If you ask for extra anything they will ignore you. If I am paying $10 for a bowl I expect a decent size serving. The line is always out the door because they are very slow and out of product all the time. Drive the extra mileage to go to a better Chipotle across town because you will get better service and food.So let me just say I never ever write reviews but I'm so upset at the customer service I received at this location it's ridiculous! Went
To service desk to Register for my baby (first child) and woman asks me what I'm wanting to register for, I told her everything and proceeded to tell me that they didn't really have a big selection and maybe I would be better off going across the street to babies r us...Wow ok so if her goal was to send me away and deter me she did a great job and then she mentioned that she didn't have any free bie packages for new mothers to give me, omg! I wasn't looking for anything free all I wanted was to be registered at Toys r us for my friends and family to help celebrate our joy of our first child. I will not be Registering there at all! Ever!So I ordered a large 16 inch Pizza Napolitana for delivery with 3 items, and asked for mushrooms, tomatoes and anchovies(only on half the pizza) the guy charged me $5 for delivery because I lived like 5 miles away instead of the 3 miles radius that they charge 2$ for which I didnt mind paying although it didnt seem fair and when I got my pizza i wish I had returned it. My total was $24 something and for a 16inch 3 topping pizza it was a total rip off. 
The anchovies I asked for only on half the pizza ended up being 3 tiny pieces on 4 big slices of pizza, thats not even one anchovie for a slice!!! 
Also, mushrooms and tomatoes are not the most expensive veggies in the world and it looked as if they sliced just one mushroom and one tomatoe for a large pizza that clearly looked that these guys were trying to make money and not a quality pizza. It might be a different story if you are in the restaurant for a sit down where they cant do it to your face but for delivery they totally try to get away with being as cheap as possible and $24 dollars for a pizza shouldnt be a cheap pizza with barely anything on it, bottom line, i paid $24 dollars for a cheese pizza.Was there 3 months ago and had horrible service. It took forever to get our food then when it finally came it was not only wrong but cold. The manager apologized and comped most of the meal. We went back tonight and had another bad experience. We got our drinks and appetizer without a problem but then sat for over 30 mins waiting for our food. The waitress came over and said they had been having kitchen trouble all day but it would be out in 2 mins. 3 mins later she sits down at another customers table chatting with them. Another lady came over and apologized and said our food should be coming. I told her it had been over 30 mins and the waitress told us 2 mins 3mins ago. She assured me it was coming and another few mins went by before our food came. Everything was cold. The fries seemed like they had been sitting under a heat lamp for a long time and the cheeseburgers were stone cold. I had my 2 and 4 year old children with me who were out of patience and hungry. I told the waitress after waiting that long and then getting cold food we were leaving and not paying. She rolled her eyes at me. The waitress was Francis. I am disappointed and we will not be returning.I liked this place and gave it good review last year.  Their  featured Thanksgiving menu looked interesting but it was terrible.  The food was cold and had to be sent back twice for reheating.  The desert was yucky and ugly.  The waiter didn't seem surprised that the dishes were barely touched.  What makes it all the more galling is that the meal was $35 per person and we left hungry.  Horrible.  We expressed our dissatisfaction to the manager and he said nothing.  Happy Thanksgiving---Not.I'd give a 0 if I could. The staff is very friendly, but the food is HORRIBLE! My husband and I got food poisoning from some lengua tacos and Carne asada fries. I guess I should've seen it coming when the cashier/cook said he was having trouble finding the lengua. (cow tongue. Hey, don't knock it till you try it... Somewhere else, of course.)This is by far the worst Roberto's in the area.

Its the nearest one to where I currently live so we would go out of convenience. Being that it's a Roberto's the food is basically the same as anywhere else but for some reason getting what you actually ordered is a challenge. 

They charge a $1.10 to add guacamole to an item and on 3 separate occasions I got home and they had neglected to add it even though I had paid for it. I initially shrugged it off and didn't want to get all bent about the situation but it definitely got on my nerves.

The next time I went in I made sure to tell them about the guac situation and this time they included it but still charged me despite their 3 past screw ups. I thought, alright fine it's just a dollar.

A few days later we returned for breakfast burritos. Took the order home and they had put the wrong meat inside of one of them. I don't know how Carne Asada gets confused with Shredded Beef - and in a breakfast burrito nonetheless. Gross combination. 

At that point it was clear that they are simply too incompetent to get a to-go order done correctly. A mistake or two is understandable but this is just ridiculous. It happened time after time, consecutively. I shouldn't have to babysit them while they make the damn food to make sure they are doing their jobs correctly. 

I have never had this issue at the other location I used to frequent and though it is a longer drive I will be going back to the old location. 

Don't waste your time and money on this Roberto's. They are sloppy and careless. They don't pay attention to what they are doing, especially at 1am when the place is dead and they aren't even busy (which is usually when we would go). No thanks.LOVE YOUR PET? THEN GO ELSE WHERE!
If your going here for their low rates then I suggest only getting vaccines (dirt cheap) on weekends, how ever if in any case you need someone to care for your animal, then you got the wrong place. my poor dog was sick with diarrhea, I took him in for his shots and explained that he was sick, they said that ad long as he is eating and drinking he'll be fine, well guess what he wasn't. I had to bring him in again for blood work I was never explained what was wrong with him instead they said Dr. Stefano says "bring him back in for more blood work" (I guess one test isn't enough or they needed to charge me again,  AWESOME). I declined, and sought a second opinion I went to Pebble and Maryland animal hospital, and when I requested the records to be faxed over they gave me attitude (how audacious), they faxed over only shot records and when I called them again they said  "we will no longer fax anything" and hung up on me! WOW,  how Unprofessional this is how they treat patrons, just imagine your animal in their care? You're better off leaving them with dr. Kavorkhian at least he would sympathize.  Take my word, experience and frustration and heed my warning.Me and the wife decided to give this place a try. We came in on a Thursday and the World Cup was going on,it was a bit loud but to be expected. I ordered the dozen oysters, seafood bowl, and chicken fajitas. We washed that down with hands down one of the best red beers I have ever had. 
Now onto the food. The waitress brought us out two waters which we didn't ask for and charged 1.50 a piece for them. The oysters were hands-down the worst oysters that I have ever tried in my entire life. They were not spoiled however they taste like River water smells and they were not cold even though they were served on a bed of ice. The seafood bowl was equally tasting like River water with a bit of saltiness however the broth was completely tasteless besides the hot sauce and salt and I put into it. The chicken fajitas were cooked well there was plenty of chicken fajita and also came with a side of rice and beans however the tortilla wraps or disgusting and fell apart in your mouth while you're eating. 
The prices are absolutely ridiculous the chicken fajitas were $16 my seafood bowl was 17 ,two beers were seven dollars apiece you could just go and get the same quality food for probably a third or a half of the cost.
The only redeeming factor of this place is the furniture inside does have a Mexican island feel and the Mariachi band was pretty cool but the food is utter trash and the level of attention that the workers placed on the customers was also poor.
I understand the World Cup was going on however these employees are being paid to serve customers but without the customers they would be out on the ass.Slooooowest Trop Smoothie everr!!!
I frequent this location since I work in the shopping center n it's always a drag even when they r slow :/I don't get this place. Servers and management don't speak English so if they make a mistake or screw up your food they still let you pay for it. Very average sushi with lots of creams to cover the flavor.Get out of the business Lowes!  Home Depot knows what they are doing so get out of their way.
Sound harsh?  read on then judge for your'e self.
I manage 3 4 plex apartments here in las vegas, and needed 2 sets of counter tops for 2 units that I was quoted 1/2 of what Home Depot wanted.  Time was critical these units are being rented by two families that live in their cars currently because they are down on their luck.  (my employer is very generous and rehabs units for low income housing giving people a second chance)
I went to Lowes on w. charleston and the price was more than 2x what i was quoted on the phone.  I was in a hurry so I ordered them and was assured they would be there on 6-13.  I called 6-13 told they were not in and called 6-14, & 6-15 again told they were not in.  Turns out they were in the whole time but the employees were too lazy too look on the back of the counters to see who they belonged to.
When Lowes finally found the counters they had made a mistake and ordered the wrong size they were both too short.
6-26 Lowes has the counters in and they are too short a second time.  Store manager  Ben is supremely disinterested and I am pushed off to the counter top guy again.  I explain I need the counter top 8' not 7' he seems to understand this time.  
6-27 Lowes calls to take measurements themselves because they still haven't ordered the right size yet!  I met counter top guy on site show him I need 8', he leaves assures me he will order as soon as he gets back to store.
6-28 4:30 pm (today) I get call from Lowes they screwed up the credit card charge and haven't ordered the tops yet!
Meanwhile I have 2 families living in their cars waiting on counter tops so the county will let them move in and Lowes can't seem to get it together!
As if this wasn't enough, I was assured that the area manager Lary Ednes from Lowes would call to help me out with this problem.  Well Larry, its been 3 days and counting; each day I'm assured by your office i will receive a call that day and nothing.
Helloooo?  Lowes,? is anybody home?

Lowes your slogan is "Lowes never stop improving".  Well when are you going to start?Horrible...My friend and I decided to get a pedi after work today... That was a huge mistake..They cut a chunk out of my foot and didn't even apologize.. They talked to each  other in their language and didn't even say hi to me.. the worst part is that we were in our uniforms so they know we were locals... I will NEVER return and neither will my friend.. Oh and I posted a pic on here of my foot too... I forgot to mention that another tech did surgery on her foot with a needle and put the needle in a sanitary bucket right in front of us.. thank goodness I have been vaccinated for hepatitis.. :(  .. and I'd love to give this palce a negative 5 stars.. And I forgot to mention that the nail tech next to us pulled out a needle and did surgery on her foot right in front of us and put the needle in the "clean" box.. WTF...This place is a HUGE ripoff. I have a 2009 Camry that needed an oil change; tell me why they're trying to charge me $300 for all kinds of other services such as brake check, tire check, filter check (mind you other places do that as part of the service already!). It doesn't end there. So apparently, $30 to change/add oil, that's it, other fluids won't be topped off, that's extra! That's like the barber shop wanting extra to clean off the hair they cut off from your neck! I'm surprised they didn't try to charge me to talk to their front desk. Needless to say, I took my car back and refuse to give them even one penny. This place is so unethical, but I guess it's my fault for not wanting to take my car to the place I normally take it to who charges $70 and get everything these thieves were trying to get away with.ok, so what they forget to tell you when you book a room at this property is you don't actually get what you pay for.  Ok so the room is a bit less than other places, but when you get here they hit your credit card for something they call a "daily resort amenity fee" which is equal to or even more than the room actually costs you in the first place !!  If I would have been aware of this I NEVER would have stayed here !!  I would have stayed at one of the more appropriate hotels.  The staff seems as if they are completely understaffed and overworked and they have been rude as hell the entire time we have been here.  We spent 1 hour just checking in to this place as the line was out the door and they only had 2 people working.  It was completely annoying.  NONE of the rooms have coffee makers as the hotel has determined that they are a "fire hazard" ?!  Really?? The halls outside the rooms are filthy with trash and things that people have put outside their rooms and that have not been picked up by the staff.  The Buffet that I can remember being great in the past was completely sub-par and most items had absolutely no flavor what so ever.  I can say over all I am a bit disgusted with The Palace Station and will not stay here again !Very unprofessional. They have unclear and unprofressional business policies. Did not accept company check from another tow yard, was not told this untill we made the 5 hour drive to pick up a vehicle. Office personell are very unhelpful. When our business owner called to talk to a supervisor they said it is business policy that no one can speak to a supervisor. Horrible business.Hi.  I grew up in Las Vegas and have eaten breakfast at the Omelet House many times.  My experiences have always been decent which is why I am completely disheartened by my family's last experience with the Omelet House.  Yesterday, my husband and our two children, ages 8 and 4, were running errands and decided to have breakfast there.  My husband had been fasting for blood work.  The facility was across the street and as anyone who has ever had to maneuver around Charleston and Rancho knows, it is quite difficult to get around due the no u-turn lanes and multiple lanes of traffic.  My family parked at the Omelet House and walked across the street at 9:50am.  He signed in at the blood place at 9:57am.  He returned at almost 10:25am ready to eat food and noticed that his car was missing.  The Omelet House had him towed.  Now I understand the need for ample customer parking on busy days, like weekend brunch, but it was Monday and there were many open parking spaces.  The gentleman and I use that term loosely, claimed that he waited 30 minutes to call the tow truck, but tow records show that they called at 9:52.  As my now stranded husband was trying to figure out what to do, The Omelet House staff read to him from a piece of paper something that ended in him needed to leave the premises with threat of arrest.  Did I mention he had two small children with him?  When did we stop treating people like people?  How would parking in the lot been any benefit to my family unless they were planning to eat at the Omelet House?  Well, if the purpose of the parking policy is to keep people from parking there, it worked.  I know of at least 4 people that will never park in the parking lot again.  Good job Omelet House!I paid for an estimate ($99) from this company and was told that it would be $774 for the repairs to my LG front load washer. Plus they wanted me to pay them in cash after taking a check for the estimate. I chose not to work with them on this repair because I felt that they may not be around to warranty their repairs. I then had someone from LG come out and the same repairs were $324 instead of $774. Buyer beware...This is located attaching to PT's Pub. As many have voiced it is better drunk. Most of the time the beans are way too runny the meat is flavorless and its just bad mexican food. Ive had it at fairs and at several locations it is just bad jujuThis place should definitely stay hidden! Spend the money elsewhere for a GOOD haircut! The hairstyles are as outdated, & old school as the ladies that work there. The receptionist reffered my sister & I to a lady that was supposed to be good with cuts "Madge", but this Jamaican lady that cut my hair was horrible! She obviously never had that many white clients because she was  rude, & very rough w/my sister & I & didn't know what she was doing. She would grab a bunch of hair, pull it, & start chopping! I was supposed to have a layered look. But I would have gotten better results if I gave a blind person shears & a bowl. When she was finished she had me look in the mirror & I noticed one side of my hair was way shorter than the other, after she had been chopping for a good 20 min! She told me my hair must've already been that way.... Never again!DON'T EVER GO TO CAFE VERDI!!!! (3111 S. Valley View, LV). I ordered a Chicken Parmesan breast and side Caesar salad. It took an hour to deliver and I got chicken fingers and fries. When I called to let them know my order was wrong, I was on hold for over 10 minutes waiting for the manager. When he got on the phone and I told him what happened, he says "I can bring your order in an hour and a half. We are really busy cause it's lunchtime." I said, "You do this for a living. Don't you plan for that? I waited an hour for my food, and it's wrong, and you want me to wait another hour and a 1/2 so you can get it right?" I told him I would post a poor notice on Yelp! He laughed and said (and I quote), "WE'VE BEEN HERE 25 YEARS, WE'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE!". THEN he hung up on me. Really? Not if I can help it. Do me a favor, don't give them your business, and make sure no one else does either. They don't appreciate it and they don't deserve it.  (And I only gave them a 1 star because 0 was not an option)Honestly first time I came here it was good second time the air was off in the room when I got there n Vegas is 100degrees they wouldn't give me the banner advertised rate as promised before n the air turned out broken the toliet didn't wrk
And I had to switch rooms then the second room air took forever to feel a tiny bit decent n still pouring sweat n found a huge dead cockaroach in my room like Wtf never again I'll pay extra 20$nxt time n stay somewhere else thnx ps no wifi in the rooms it all sux n I'm not usually that picky bout hotels just need a cool air condition place to
Sleep thnx!This place sucks! I give it 0 stars. It's cheap, but you pay for what it's worth. I went with my family & the food was cold & nasty . In top of that "supposedly" it's unlimited champaign but after the 5th cup they cut us off! What the fuck! We weren't even drunk or anything . The waitress was rude &I would not even come check on us . I will never go here again. I rather go to the Mandalay bay buffet. It's a little more pricer but it's worth it! Never again.I agree with the other 1 star reviews. This place is a scam. 

Went there last night after a nice run at the craps table. I got duped into going into the VIP. Only after paying the $500 fee was I told that there was a drink minimum of $200 on top. Of course this was after the dance started and now I can't get my money back. Then the stripper told me that I needed to add a tip for the server and her. Now the $500 dance was going to be more like $800. I got up and demanded my Id and credit card back. They refused to give it back unless I signed off on the $200 hidden drink fee for drinks that never even arrived. I ended up leaving my I'd and credit card. 

Low and behold today I have a $400 charge on my card. I have already filed a dispute with my credit card company and plan on doing whatever I can to make sure other people are not scammed. 

This place engages in unfair and deceptive trade practices and should be shut down. 

Bottom line don't go there. If you do go, do not go in the VIP room and DO NOT pay with a credit card.  Stay away from this scam of a place. Go to spearmint rhino or sapphire if you are looking for some adult entertainment.Bedbugs. Seriously. Bedbugs. Would have rather had a DUI (which I avoided by staying here instead of driving a few shitty miles to my apartment). Now instead i'm covered in bites and praying I didn't bring any of those f*ckers home with me. 

The kicker? We chose that dump because we didn't want to pay $200 a night like the places around Punk Rock Bowling that weren't sold out. Joke was on us, we paid $170. $170 a night for bedbugs. 

I don't know if anyone reading this had experienced the joy of multiple bites all over your body from little flea like bastards so I recommend googling it. And imagine them feasting on your body while you slept. Reading other reviews they also have cockroaches. $170 FOR COCKROACHES AND BEDBUGS. 

I'm just sleeping in my car next time.I Love classic coke, but was sadly disappointed when I had a coke from the McDonald's at 1343 Silverado Ranch blvd in Las Vegas. This is the third time I've tasted poorly mixed Co2 and syrup at this location. Are they trying to cut cost by dispensing more Co2 then syrup? I would have returned to the store to complain, but I had driven off by the time I took my first taste. Someone or the Coca Cola Rep please change the bag in the box or balance the mix so I can taste a true coke, I would hate to cross over to another brand over this continued issue at this McDonald location. I expect my coca cola experience to be excellent with each drink I consume.so so so so many issues from bad customer service, super expensive, and then surprise charges on your bill

FILE A COMPLAINT AT THE BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU !!!Irma, the surgery scheduler failed to call us to inform us my husband's procedure had been cancelled. We took time off work and he started eye drops seven days prior as prescribed. Irma was rude to us from the start. This was a frustrating experience. We are going with another eye group.I love Italian food. Never visited an Olive garden before. My wife had a $25 dollar gift card, so I took my wife here to use the gift card and try out the olive garden. 
  My first impression upon walking in was not good due to the bad smell. Smelled like stale Parmesan cheese mixed with the body odor of several people that havent taken a bath in a month.  I sat down and was given menus. The menus had dried food smeared all over them from previous customers. 
  The waiter had cookie crumbs on his shirt, and what appeared to be salad dressing stains on front of shirt. 
  I was tempted to walk out, but decided what the hell, lets use this gift card up. 
 Ordered the special   unlimited bread sticks, soup, or salad, and pasta with sauce for me and wife. (9.99 each)
 Waiter brought a basket with a whopping 3 bread sticks. I got the salad, wife got soup. The salad tasted pretty good, but mostly had just 3 green salad leafs. The rest was mostly salad stems, onions, croutons and other junk. They give you a big bowl of salad and it is mostly stems. I could have asked for more salad, but I might have to argue about not finishing what was brought to me. 
   The pasta seemed to have been sitting around for a while before I arrived. It was dehydrated and not fresh. had to use knife and fork to cut it up. The marinara sauce had an off smell and taste to it. I could only manage to force myself to take a few bites. What crap!!!! The back ground smell, and the pasta smell and taste almost had my stomach churning. 
    the fun part was when the waiter brought the check. The total was 28.39, I gave him the 25 dollar gift certificate, and 3.40 in cash. had to wait for 15 minutes for my change., and waiter tried offering us dessert, which was included. I declined desert, as the deserts were probably crap too. I took my penny of change and departed with out leaving a tip. Needless to say I wont be coming back there. The prices are a bit high, and the quality of the food is terrible. The staff seems friendly and attentive, but jeezz the smell in there just makes you look at at the dirtiness around you more, and makes you wonder how clean is the kitchen.Hunnie Bunnie's pre-school is in the same lot as this spot. I decided to pick up some grub to take back to the Ranch and then catch up on The Walking Dead. 
I've never been in here before or seen a menu so I ordered a few items. The lady took my order and then I sat down with a to-go menu to wait. As soon as I opened it I saw the FAMILY DINNER menu - for $24.99 you can order two entrees on the list and it comes with two fried shrimp, two fried spring rolls, soup and either white rice or bbq pork fried rice. I called back to the kitchen and asked the lady if I could change my order to the family dinner menu?? She said it was coo. So I ordered the BBQ Pork Fried Rice, Orange Chicken, Chicken Chow Mein and Egg Drop Soup. 
The food came out quickly and I was on my way. I picked up Hunnie Bunnie and she got in the car and asked: What smells so good in here girl?! 
We were so damn hungry we ate the Spring Rolls and Fried Shrimp in the car! There was a lot of black pepper in the Spring Rolls and HB said they were salty. 
The Fried Shrimp were like a shrimp roll, and lots of breading - pretty bland tasting. There was that reddish sweet dipping sauce served with these, but eating in the car I didnt have time for that nonsense! 
Anyway, got to the Ranch and opened up the rest of the food. 
Everything was pretty BLAND. Really not much flavor AT ALL. I KNOW it's Chinese fast food but COME ON! Panda Express tastes WAY better!! I most definitely wouldn't EVER waste my money on this bland ass Chinese food again!Stale chips, food under seasoned and their bathrooms smell horrible no thanks Super Mex.................................The worst place ever!!! I will never go there again and I will tell everyone I know how bad this place is.  They charged our credit card twice when we ordered shirts.  When we found out later that day we called and they said "no problem we will take care of it when you pick up the shirts." We go today and the owner says "my paper work doesn't show we got paid!" Even when we showed him a copy of our bank statement.  He was rude and had no customer serves.  We ended up paying twice for the shirts (because we needed them) and "THE OWNER" will now have to deal with our bank's fraud division!!!!  Everyone makes mistakes and that is ok but when you are rude and disrespectful to your customers, you might want to remember you are NOT the only company in town!!!!! and in these hard times you would think you would want to keep every customer you can get.Downgrading from three stars to one, due to a disastrous experience on Easter. We called a WEEK in advance to ask about vegetarian options, and were told that they could accommodate with no problem, even though it was a set menu. Turns out the "accommadation" was nothing but an appetizer from the non vegetarian version of the menu with the meat taken out. Still charged the same price though!

When we emailed to complain, they sent us back a truly patronizing email.  "We had several vegetarians that dined with us on Easter and were very pleased with the options." So you know, clearly its MY fault that I didn't enjoy whatever half assed entree they chose to throw down in front of me.  If it was my kitchen, I would have been ashamed to send that dish out to a paying customer.

Every restaurant has an off day... to me its how they deal with it that decides if they are a place worth returning to. For example, we visited Nittaya's Secret Kitchen last night and had some.. problems with the service. There was a mixup in the kitchen that resulted in our entrees being served roughly ten minutes apart. Not a great impression. What was great was that they apologized, took full responsibility, and asked what they could do to make it better. They did not say to us "Well the other customers got their entrees ten minutes apart and they were fine with it." We have every intention of going back to Nittaya's. Marche Bacchus? Well lets just say I wish this had happened last year so I could have had my rehearsal dinner elsewhere.This restaurant has gone from a 4 star to a one star in a year.  Our waitress deserves the star but the food was horrible.  Lobster salad should be taken off the menu.  It had no flavor at all.  So disappointing! Will not go back again.  What a shame...beautiful location!  Understanding it's under a new management.  Get a new chef.  Change your menu also.If you specifically request guacamole and they charge you the extra "fee" for it, then they should put it on your damn burrito...  They even forgot the mild salsa.    First and last time eating at Baja Fresh.  Should have made the drive to Chipotle.I will never take my kitties back here, EVER! This is pretty lengthy but if you read it, you will understand why:
On Monday 4/21/14 I came in for a simple ultrasound on one of my cat's abdomens- she had been vomiting for going on 5 weeks now- I had already gotten blood work and x-rays done with a previous vet which showed nothing- next step was ultrasound and then, possibly, surgery. Most vets don't have their own ultrasound equipment and time was of the essence at this point and since Craig Rd does, I simply just wanted the ultrasound so we had some kind of jumping off point of, if they had to do surgery, which organ(s) are affected
 I  brought my cat in at 640pm (after work and getting copies of her records), we waited for a room for approx 30 mins, no problem. When we got into a room, I was told it'd be another 45 mins before I could see someone. I was fine with this as I just needed some kind of answer for her. After 30 mins, a tech came in, asked me a bunch of questions and left. 20 mins later Dr. Calloway came in and asked me the same questions and stated in the least compassionate way that "we will just have to open her up and do exploratory surgery". Now, I was not opposed to doing the exploratory surgery but I wanted the ultrasound in addition to this to see upfront which area they need to explore. I was trying not to put my cat through any more than she needed. Dr. Calloway went on that they needed to do x-rays and blood work again- what for? I just had these tests done not even a month ago when she first started getting sick. She said exploratory surgery is the only way to be sure since I have done everything else. If this is the case, why did she feel it necessary to rerun tests we already did if they just wanted to slice and dice her? Now it was nearly 8pm and she informs me that the vet who can do ultrasound is going home when I was told by the front desk staff that any vet could do this. So, I asked what the cost for this procedure would be (just curious) and she said "I'll be right back". Another 20 minutes went by and another tech came in with a printout of everything they wanted to do to her- x-rays, blood work, ultrasound (even though she said it wasn't needed) and on and on to the tune of $2700 and change. Really? And he says "Ok- so you're gonna leave her here with us tonight to do this surgery tomorrow." Umm, no! I already told the vet this- didn't she hear anything I said?
In the entire 2+ hours that we were there, not once did anyone even look at my cat! They don't even know what she looks like! All they did was talk to ME and not check on the patient. I would've got the same result had I shown up there myself without her. Why did I have to stress her out and have her in a kennel for over 2 hours, not even including the car ride there and back if they weren't even going to look at her, much less do the procedure I was specifically there for?? So, I left in disgust. 
I wound up taking my baby, Panda, to Advanced Animal Care in Boca Park for the ultrasound that Thursday (1st available appt) and they found a blockage in her small intestine. Surgery was necessary so we scheduled that for Friday morning and they removed part of her intestine which was necrotic (dead), the blockage had blocked the blood supply and killed off that part of her. My point is, the ultrasound showed where they needed to "explore", and that is what I needed to know. Panda is home now and doing great! I would like to add that Advanced Animal Care, Dr. Pederson, saw nothing wrong with her blood work and x-rays and did not find it necessary to redo these same tests. She also understood the urgency of our situation. AND, since Panda had to stay overnight 3 nights, she actually stayed with her! Who does this? Vets don't typically stay with their patients. And the cost? $920- including pathology of the dead tissue, just to be sure. That is a far cry from $2700! 
So, all I can say is, I will never go back to Craig Rd and Dr. Pederson at Advanced Animal Care will be my vet from this point forward because of the superior care she gave my baby. Please do your research and ask questions! Your pet is depending on you for it's life! 
It is my belief that Dr. Calloway at Craig Rd. was trying to play on my emotions and get more money. My gut feeling about her is that she really didn't care about Panda at all and was all about the money. It's $185 for ultrasound with them- I paid $400 with Advanced Animal Care and you know why? It was worth the price to get it done right and in the long run, it cost me less and Panda got superior care. 
I'm sorry this is so long but I wanted to be very clear about why I  will never step foot in there again. I just felt like they turned their back on me and her when we needed them and felt I was being taken advantage of with the situation.So I've lived in Vegas for over a year now and I've passed by this place more than a few times and wondered how good the food/service was.  Tonight we found out...not worth your time! 

After being seated we had a very prompt waitress TO START.  She took our drink, appetizer and dinner order, then handed us off to another waitress because her shift was ending.  No problem at first, but then we didn't see our new waitress for about 15 minutes.  She finally came by to check on us, and asked if we were ready to order...already done that, and then she went and checked on our appetizer.  25 minutes later, it finally came out...2 crab cakes shouldn't take that long, but ok.  On top of all that, her attentiveness lacked when it came to drink refills, to the point that my fiance' had to get up and ask for more water...

Finally, about an hour after we were seated, our salads, which were limp and tasteless bagged salads.  Then dinner, we both ordered the fillet with grilled shrimp...what came out was NOT a fillet, looked more like thick NY strips, and 3 small shrimp...$34/plate.  Per the menu:    

"Your Steak is cut from the finest beef available in the United States."   
Please tell us how you would like it prepared.

The food was prepared ok, but by this point we were not pleased with the the quality or the service.  It was about this point that I believe the waitress caught on, because she checked on us 3-4 times in a 10 minute period.  I went to speak to the manager, who was seated at the bar, a few drinks in.

I introduced myself, then began to talk to him about what was going on...explaining about the waitress hand-off, the lack of attention and then the over-attention, and then the food.  His response to me was, "Well let me get you a gift certificate to make this better the next time you come in."  I told him straight up that I'd never come back here, and that for what they served us, $34/plate was a bit extreme.  His response: "Well, you're not going to get the kind of quality for that price anywhere else in Vegas, believe me.  That's really all I can do for you."  Ok...I guess my last year in Vegas was all a dream, because there are plenty of places that are of much better quality for the same price.  I felt very dismissed, told him thanks for his time, and then went back to my table to get my check.

The waitress asked if we wanted everything wrapped up...about half of each of our meals left, and we said "NO, just the check please."  She figured it out at this point, and we told her we had spoken with the manager about everything.  She got us the check, which was now 1/2 off, magically, and a $50 gift certificate to come back.  I paid my bill, and we beat feet out of there.  

Decor aside, or lack thereof, this place is AWFUL!  If you're in Vegas full time, spend a few extra dollars and get a steak worth your money somewhere else.  Don't waste your time going here!I've stayed here a few times just because it's literally 5 minutes down the street from family.  It's always been a problem, with people partying in the next room and some rooms stink. But my recent stay (of one night) will hopefully be my last. 
My mom drove me here around 6p.m. on a Wednesday night, so it wasn't busy at all. So I don't know why the reception clerk put me in a room on the third floor directly across from the parking garage level that takes people from their cars to the casino. I mean RIGHT ACROSS from the parking garage, like someone could be sitting in their car and I could look them in the eye from my window. Throughout the night I listened to car stereos, people laughing and yelling and a few car alarms.

After a couple of hours in the casino, I went to my room. I was tired from flying in that morning and spending the day with family, so I didn't go back down to get another room once I saw my situation. I could hear people talking in the room next to the t.v. but didn't hear anything from the room next to my bed, so I stuck my earplugs in and fell asleep thinking that room was empty. Wrong. And this is how I learned just how unbelievably thin the walls are here: at midnight I was jolted awake by a thumping sound that didn't stop. I took my earplugs out and realized it was the metal headboard in the next room being slammed against the wall (great furniture) in the room that was NOT empty. The walls were so thin that EVERYTHING was audible. I got up,moved my luggage from the other bed and right when I laid down, a car alarm went off. At 4 a.m., the guy in that room began throwing up in the bathroom, which was next to the bed I was in now. He was busy with that for half an hour, then walked into the wall, then got himself tangled in the wire hangers of the coat rack, also next to my bed. I've stayed in hotels all over the world, some not so great, but this is the only time I've been able to tell everything that was going on in another room like I was watching it. I gave up and called my mom to come get me, as I was more exhausted than when I arrive.

And here's where the Santa Fe "resort" gives you the final middle finger- when we went to the desk to check out and tell them how I had been kept awake from their thin walls and parking garage noise, they demanded an additional $15 bucks for an "amenities fee" for the 10 hours I spent in their craphole. We were told "sorry, everybody charges a resort fee" by a woman who clearly just wanted us to shut up and go away. And yea, the sheets are like laying on canvas sails.Mary Ann has moved on to the Luxe Salon near Simmons and Ann Road thank god.

Mary Ann was the only reason to be going to Spirals Salon. Mary Ann is worth the drive and again you get a professional haricut, styling, coloring, etc. at a very reasonable cost.

Call Mary Ann directly today at 650-269-1291!AVOID THIS ER - The wait is ridiculous.  I took my mother here and we waited 6 hours and she never saw a doctor.  We ended up just leaving - but they never took her insurance information (dummies), and sent her a ridiculous bill for hundreds of dollars just for the privledge of sitting around and being denied medical care.  The nursing staff who worked there were completely unsympathetic and inhospitable.  These nurses were cruel gatekeepers to the actual doctors.  Everyone who worked there seemed to hate their job and were unwilling to do anything other than the bare minimum.  

The ER was packed with people and some girl was puking in those pink plastic basins while waiting.   A janitor came by and cleaned ONE CHAIR and ignored an entire row of empty seats.  Sounds sanitary, huh?  I wonder how many already sick people get sicker because the germs they are exposed to while waiting to get medical attention.

A few months later, I had a medical emergency and I went to Southern Hills hospital instead.  I was immediately checked in, was seen by a doctor and put on an IV in the first 20 minutes, and I was checked into the hospital in less than two hours.  The ER room there was empty because it is a much less residential part of town.   I also hear that San Martin Hospital on Warm Springs near Durango has a good ER.

They built so many houses in Summerlin and then didn't think that they should have a big enough hospital to accommodate all the people.  It's ridiculous and I will always make the extra drive to another hospital.I don't get how this place is ranked so high on Yelp! We chose KJ Kitchen based on Yelp ratings- GET IT TOGETHER LAS VEGAS! THIS PLACE IS AWFUL! We will not be returning to KJ Kitchen.

Usually I can overlook bad service for great food, but the meat was rubbery, slimy and flavorless on all dishes we ordered. The dishes were very unflavorful in general. 

The service was worse than the food, I had to like turn around and wave to summon our waiter whenever we needed something (and we are not at all needy) I only summoned 3 times, once to get him to come take our order after sitting there for 15 minutes, another to ask for utensils and rice after our dishes were dropped off and he took off running, and then again 15 mins after we were done and dishes cleared to ask for a check. It was awful!Apparently, the Hooters Hotel has 24-hour $3 blackjack tables. I mean, there are banners posted against the building outside, there are signs above the slot machines...The Hooters Hotel is supposed to have 24-hour $3 blackjack tables.

My friend and I walked into the Hooters Hotel.
We looked for these $3 blackjack tables.
We circled the casino three times.

THERE WERE NO $3 BLACKJACK TABLES.

One star for false promotions. 
(I was looking forward to cheap gambling too!)I have eaten here three times. Everyone always told me how amazing this place was so after trying it the first time (maybe about a year ago), and having a plain, tasteless meal, I figured maybe just a fluke or hopefully they have changed since then. I ate there about 2 months ago and again it was just blah. The third time did it for me when the food was not only gross and tasteless (AGAIN) but two people that work there that I dealt with were extremely rude! Never going back.Stopped by to pick up a new pair of walnut Blundstone boots. Was informed that they only come in black and stout(almost black). Proceeded to order said walnut boots off the Internet instead, since they do make them and saved $50. This is why local businesses are going broke, agree with the other reviewer that this shop was boring.I have never flown US Airways since they became US Airways.  I did however, fly America West and was happy with them nearly every time I flew with them.

I HAVE to write this review, as I had an awful experience with them yesterday.  I was scheduled at 7:23am out of Phoenix and arriving back here in SF at 9:30 am in enough time for work at 11am.  I arrive, and proceed to the E check-in.   The computer starts having "issues" and so I try to get the attendants attention and I failed.  Knowing I didn't have a lot of time before we depart, I decided to to to the counter check-in.   I waited 5 minutes before getting to the counter only to be told that I was no longer on this flight b/c it was less than 30 minutes before departure!  WHAT???  I have a carry on ANNNNND that computer right there (pointing at it) has something wrong with it and that is why I came through your line.  It was 25 minutes to departure and she refused to check me in!!  Again, I ONLY had a carry on.  It didn't matter to her that I had to be at work at 11am.  Arriving in SF later than 9:30 am was NOT AN OPTION for me.  She hastily said, "you can try and get through security and see if maybe they'll let you on the flight.  That is all I will do for you!"

I finally get through security and get to the gate at EXACTLY 7:22am, one minute to spare, begging the customer services reps to let me on the flight or I was going to lose my job.  

They of course told me NO.  The flight was delayed 2 hours and I was late anyway!!!  Ahhhhh...

Thankfully, the flight attendant had a lot of personality and was very accommodating to me, even if I was 1.5 hours late for work.  

I wish I had the name of that lady in the Phoenix airport downstairs at the check in desk.  I mean, when I pointed to the computer that was giving me problems, there was a tech guy working on it and she saw him.  Even seeing him, she still wouldn't accommodate me in any way and was rude about it.  Poor customer service!  I WON'T be flying this airline again, I can tell you that. 

I was not only blown away by their complete lack of care for me and the "issues" I was having with their E-check-in computer, but also the lack of  "social" skills one needs when working in customer service.  Eye contact!!Thank God this place went out of business! I went in there one day and chatted up the owner a bit before ordering. It was about 3 in the afternoon and no other customers were around. I asked if I could get a half sandwich and the owner rudely asked what I expected him to do with the other half! Is he THAT stupid or just a smartass!Worst food I've ever been served. Anyone writing a good review most be a relative.
Brisket, salmon, and chick fry steak all VERY poor quality. Total waste of money. Was there 3/14/12.Austin needs to find work elsewhere. Very very rude. Mr Pettiette should be made aware how disrespectful his son is.The people are nice, but the service is just down right AWFUL.  I could go on and on but let's just put it this way, DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Do yourself a favor and go elsewhere!  3 hours for a "partial highlight" I went running out of the salon with wet hair! Worst experience in a salon ever...Went there last night since I have MLK day off.  I asked about the beer specials that they normally have on Sunday nights.  Bartender said there were not any that night.  Wow, what a slap in the face.  They took advantage of the long weekend and decided they would make more money if they did not have their usual specials.  This is bad KARMA!  I hope there are other guys out there that support Charlies all year long that are upset by this.  I would suggest not going or at least don't tip or have one less drink then you normally would.  Best bet, tell them how unfair this is either in person or via social media.Apparently I'm too nice. I wrote in my last review after they drove spikes into my nice silk strapless dress that I was sure they would've taken care of it, had I gotten off my lazy ass, because they really are wonderful folks. 

Wrong. WRONG!!!

I am too nice. Period. I brought in a pair of pants that I had altered recently... taken in at the waist and replaced back buttons for a mere $23 Oh, I should mention the back buttons were missing due to Regal cleaners services. Did I ever complain then? Nope. Should I have? Yup.

Upon getting these pants back, they were missing a button and had weird white stuff on them. I figured they would take care of it. I took the pants in, explained that I had just had them altered (great work at The Fit Alterations, BTW) and now they were damaged. The manager was out and I waited on the call back. 

I miss the call and stopped by that night only to be told that the white stuff was the fabric wearing out and that was from normal wear and tear. Um, ok. They weren't like that at all when I brought them in and now they are almost unwearable (especially because of the button flap sticking out on the ass of the pants because you took it off... yet AGAIN).

No offer was made to put the button back on... no offer of returning my money for the last cleaning of said pants. Nothing. If they'd sewn the button back on, at least I could've worn them one last time. Yes, I am that cheap, I would've worn them even with the white junk all over. Now, they are trash. Expensive trash. It's just weird that they went from fine to completely unwearable in one single visit to the cleaners. 

And that was the day that Regal lost my family's business.I was here today and found a hair in my sandwich. I was willing to overlook this, but then my sister found a hair baked into her cookie. That is more than I'm willing to overlook. maybe they should employ hair nets. They need to do something to regulate before I ever go back. I saw a dude sneeze into his hand too. Sandwiches are good, but I just don't trust the quality at this point. Sacks is goin in the litter boxComing from LA to visit Phoenix, I wanted to try the local Pho.  I have eaten at numerous Pho places in Los Angeles area and was dying to hear what all the rave was about.  I picked "DA VANG" because of the great reviews.  All i have to say was that this placed literally sucked.  The service was horrible. The waiters took our order then took almost 20 mins to get our food. I don't know if they cared that their customers came to eat and were hungry.  Second, the food that arrived was overcooked. The meat was hard, the beef tendons were obviously old and the soup was too sweet.  Overall, if you want pho, try some other place. If you're in Los angeles, I can recommend tons of great places that are fraction of the price with great service.  

Overall, Da Vang was a horrible experience, overpriced, bad food, bad experience. I will never go back to this place.This place sucks. It reflects the ghetto area surrounding it. The cashiers are loud and annoying and don't have a trace of customer service etiquette  And I'm pretty sure some of them actually bring their kids to work with them...expecting customers to babysit them. 

There is almost always some weird, drunken derelict sitting near the restrooms. And the teenagers that hang around are always talking trash about other people they know.Do not move here. I wish I would of listened to the bad reviews I saw before moving here. I would never recommend this place to anyone. It is in a bad part of Phoenix and cars were getting broken into right and left when we first moved here. There are gates but at night they are never closed or secured. You are lucky if both or even one of the pools are clean and up and running. The appliances are a joke and from the early 1900's. The management are so rude and not helpful. Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere.You have gotta be kidding me reviewers!  This place was neither tasty or satisfying, It wasn't cost effective, it wasn't great service. It wasn't even good food.

Let's start with the salsa. There is nothing chunky or spicy or fresh about it, It is sweet tomato sauce with a bit of onion in it. If this is salsa Ragu missed the boat by -this- much. It is most certainly not prepared there and is the absolutely worst salsa I have ever been served. I took one dip and I asked the waitress if they had any other types of salsa available. She said no. My partner said "it sort of grows on you," so I dipped a few more times and all that grew on me were questions as to how a Mexican restaurant was calling this salsa. I was considering an exit strategy, but we decided to let the food determine our visit.

Looking around the place, it was near empty, except for a large family table, a senior age couple and another couple our age who were also visiting for the first time. I know because they were asking all the questions I had about the menu. Interesting layout allows you to watch the cooks plate up the food. This can either be a great experience or a fearful one. Good lord how many onions are being put on the sizzling plate? What is being poured out of a deep frying basket over them? I don't think this bodes well.

I ordered the half pound Beef Fajita. My sizzling experience was that of two cups of undercooked white onion, one ring of green pepper and a tiny ring of red pepper. Sliced Fajita meat that was charred and chewy perhaps dropped in the fryer? Tortillas which were completely uneven in thickness and sizes (I guess that means they are homemade, right?) They were almost too cold to fold and were damp from being steamed warm I think. EW. Still I was hungry and going to make this work. My condiment plates shredded cheese was fused together as if someone had scooped it partially melted with an ice cream scoop. The sour cream was plentiful but warm. I desperately wanted to add the chopped tomatoes to the salsa bowl, it seems they belonged there, but there were only enough of them for one Fajita so I didn't. The only way I was going to get these fajitas to be remotely tasty was request some lime. Fortunately I was able to secure some juicy wedges which helped. My partner said they liked the beef jerky meat, but it's not what I had in mind. At all. That's ok, the border dinner was sure to please them, right?

NO. It should have been left at the border and denied entry into the states. The congealed enchiladas held the fork in an upright position and refused to be edible. The charro beans were only edible if you pierced the plastic shell of dried beans on top and dug out some bite from the middle. My partner who loves rice didn't even scoop a bite of the spanish rice a roni provided. The dinner salad was a wilted ranch dressing mess and was useful only to put on one of my fajitas. I thought it would add some crunch. It didn't. We stared at the fried tortilla cup that held the queso. Under the skin the cheese heart was beating. Seriously, it wanted to live! It would shudder periodically as if something was swimming beneath the surface. Heat, I imagine, is all that made it percolate, but we had reached a stage in this dinner where we knew it was a bust and everything became fodder for jokes.  I am never going back and I thought others should know that Outback and Lone Star are in the same vicinity. Make a better choice.

$33 dollars. 

Wasn't it 33 pieces of silver that betrayed Jesus? These positive reviews were a Judas kiss, folks.We have NEVER had a togo order that has been correct from here. EVER

I am talking about 9-10 years worth...Ulgh. We knew better. But we had a gift card. How can you resist $25 off your meal, right?

It was a Saturday night, peak dinner time. The place was packed. Well, it must not have been *too* full, as we were immediately seated. But it certainly felt jammed. That was probably due to the fact that they crammed about 500 tables in the space the size of a Starbucks. To boot, those table were stocked with crying babies. Lots of crying babies.

I felt kind of bad for our server, who was a big girl. She could barely get through the back to back chairs in order to reach our table. However, during the course of dinner, my sympathy waned, as I realized she sucked as a server. I can't stand having to look at empty dirty plates, and we had to do that a lot. I was also thirsty a lot. 

Now the food... wow, the food. OK, it started well enough, kind of. First, we got a really yummy loaf of rosemary-laced bread, served with EVOO and cracked pepper. That's it. No balsamic or herbs or salt. That would've been fine, if they olive oil was fantastic. But it wasn't.

The blah oil set the tone for the rest of the meal. Blah, blah, blah. The only flavor in any dish, was a hint of butter. Everything was dreadfully underseasoned. My lobster ravioli primarily tasted of the spinach pasta that surrounded it. It could've really used some garlic, salt, and some herbs. 

The whole meal was completely underwhelming, and I was resentful for having spent *any* money on it. Damn you, gift card.We don't have Cracker Barrell in CA so we always stop in for some country cookin' while visiting AZ.  Today we learned they changed the menu and removed some of our favorite items.  They added a few menu items that do not compliment their "country comfort food" theme.  I guess their executives don't know who their customers are or why people choose their restaurants.The is a great junk yard, to get cheap USED parts for your Japanese imported vehicle. However, I DO NOT recommend their mechanics who service your vehicle. I used to be a very regular customer there, although not any more. I always felt like I was getting shafted in the end, and how ironic that I would have to go back to this mechanic every 2 or 3 months because something would "mysteriously" break down, like clock work. Then I got really suspicious when I agreed to have my oil and oil filter changed at this location. Not only did they replace my motor oil with the blackest (meaning worst) oil available, but they put almost a quart TOO MUCH, in the engine! I've had my brake pump, oil pump, brakes, and starter replaced there over a period of about 2 years. Along with a whole list of other repairs, too long to mention. They accept Visa or Mastercard, but only if it is associated with a DEBIT account. Good luck charging your parts or repairs on a credit card. Their card machine will mysteriously not work for CREDIT, but will work for DEBIT? Gimme a break. You're better off finding another mechanic, who will fix your vehicle. But it is a great place to find cheap used parts, because that's what it is: a junk yard. The owners are Turkish, and are very shady, they tend to speak Turkish to each other, when they are trying to scam you. Pay attention to what they speak, and what you don't understand.

Pros: They will attempt to fix your vehicle

Cons: They will over charge you, and something else will "mysteriously" break in less than 2 months!First off I thought I had already review Lai Lai but I guess not. 
Had I reviewed it I would have given it a solid 3.

Now I want to give it a zero. 

I don't know what happened but the Mongolian BBQ no longer exists. The hubs and I went in there this past Friday and it was all ripped out. 

They tried to get us to stay to order off the menu, which was just Chinese food...I reallllly wanted Mongolian BBQ. 

So sad. They are right down the street from us. No more Lai Lai for me.They gave me a quote of over five hundred dollars that included new rotors and brake pads for the back brakes. I took It to a mechanic I trust and was told the back brakes still had 75% life and rotors were fine. I ended up paying $189 for job. I would not recommend this business as I feel they are very dishonest.BEWARE: These guys will mess up your bank account, and will provide a horrible customer service to go with it. They will only sign you up for insurance without your prior approval.This place is A dive. Really surprised this place is still here. red neck heaven. Don't recommend this to anyone. Restrooms are filthy. They don't serve food. Just beer. Liquor.Terrible.  Sticky interior.  Incorrect order.  Orange chicken that tasted like they used a ketchup glaze.  Kung pao chicken was all the right ingredients just no flavor or spice.  I didn't finish my egg roll.  Crab puffs were the best part of the meal.  Will not go back.Had a flat took it in to get fixed and they called and said both front tires couldn't be repaired needed to be replaced. I told them not to do anything ill pick it up because I knew that couldn't be right. The next morning I took the car to discount tire and they fixed both front tires for free!!! and no they didn't need to be replaced.Boyfriend & I were in Scottsdale for golf vacation so breakfast was a must. We went to US Egg, the Good Egg and Butterfield's Pancake House on Shea Rd. All three were better than BC. Sat down to nearly empty restaurant late on a Tuesday morning  when waitress finally came over , BF ordered diet coke and was told that they have Coke only. I ordered iced tea no lemon and got lemon and after I added a Splenda & tasted it it was fruit flavored which I don't like. When asked the server said it was black tea then admitted it was mango tea. So I said I'd just have water and after some eye rolling I finally got it. My tomato soup was ok but the grilled cheese had some burnt charcoal bits from the flattop. Boyfriend asked for cheddar in omelette and got  pepper jack(yuck) also asked for fruit but got barely warm potatoes O'BRIEN. More eye rolling when he asked for the fruit. This place seems to want to be a healthy hip place but with the bad service I got I wouldn't ever recommend or give them another dime.  Go somewhere eleHorrible service!!!
I was visiting from LA and we hav tons of hookah places. Since the moment we sat down they gave us a huge attitude. After seating us it took them over 10minutes to even akcnowledge us. They had only 4 other tables so not busy at all and the waiter visited them several times before he even responded to me flaging him down. I asked him for any hoolah he would like to bring us. 10min later the hookah arrived but we had to wait another 5 mins to get charcol. They put this tiny charcols which went out in a few minutes. I actuallt had to get up and go to ask for more. Then i asked the waiter is he can give me a menu to order some food and something to drink. He said ohh the kitchen is closed. I said well can I atleast get a drink? He said sure and got me a beer.  The interesting part was that they continued serving the other tablea with food atleast 30minutes after i asked him. 
Service is the key in these kind of business. I guess that is acceptable in Arizona but this place would not survive one day in LA. 
Poor management...The drinks were too weak, what is advertised as hot is not. We had the Shrimp Diablo which was bland (as were the home made tortilla). We were one drink and out..It's too bad you can rate a store ZERO stars. Dillards is by far the worst store on the mall - especially the shoe department. Every time in the last 2 years I have walked through, not one person has even looked at me. I tried to get a pair of sale shoes the other day, but they didn't have my size, and the girl told me there was "no way" she could look to see if another store had them. We send people to the moon and you can't even LOOK for a pair of shoes.This is a bitter review.  The place doesn't really deserve 1 star, but I was asked to leave by a bouncer, and when I opened my mouth to protest, he grabbed me and escorted me to the door.  There is NO reason for a bouncer to get physically aggressive with a non-aggressive patron.  This guy was a meathead, and even seemed to have some roid rage if I'm not mistaken.  When are bars going to learn that by employing these types you lose business?  I would never go back there, and that means anytime I'm with my friends we will avoid the place.  DIPLOMACY is the name of the game in bouncing.  If you must kick someone out, do it in a discreet, non-confrontational way (unless the person was being violent to begin with, in which case feel free to put him in a half-nelson and toss him out the door)Dear Ra:

Get over yourself. 

Just sayin'.
- AliciaWe went there with the expectation of seeing girls swinging from the rafters. No girls swinging from rafters, and after looking up, I didn't really  see any rafters, maybe the lighting. What I did see was a lot of men, biker types, not my scene. It was a Friday and pretty busy, but just too loud to even have a conversation. Finally we saw two girls that were waitresses, dressed normal, but still no chicks swinging from rafters. So after about a half hour of this, we left.The products are "low class," and so is the "supposed' Manager ( female in cahouts with the male  owner)..As soon as a customer leaves the store, the OWNER males SEXIST COMMENTS about the customer. they have a good laugh at your expense!..how pathetic!!!!!

Paradise Valley?...some hopes...how about "The Twilight Zone?"Different name same garbage...this place stinks and should be banished from serving food.  You will know that it has totally given up once they change the name for  third time to one of those (ril)(fil) Abetos places...stay away for your own goodTerrible service. Very rude food server. Embarrassed to have brought my family there. Will never go back.Although the dental practice looks professional and clean, the staff was not genuous in their concerns of my comfort. Yes, they said what you wanted to hear but you can tell when someone is not sincere. As soon as I said I wasn't sure about coming back or my discomfort when I had my teeth cleaning, they called me everyday. Not to check up to see how I was doing with the tooth I originally came in for care, but to see how quickly they can give up my appointment to fit in someone else...Everyday at least twice a day they called and not one of those calls or messages were to ask about my pain on the tooth. That's when you know the dentist and staff isn't about your comfort and health of your teeth. Yes, we are all in business to make money but money comes  with success of making your patients happy not treating them like another dollar sign. And to be charge more than $1200 for a teeth cleaning is ridiculous.The only thing to say about Flickas is," Why in the heck can't you pass a health inspection...EVER". You can't even get hand washing rightUnprofessional, rude, and didn't repair my equipment in the time he said. 
I dropped off my broken subwoofer and he said it would be 3-4 weeks before it would be looked at. When I dropped it off he said it should be less than $175 to repair and that he would call if it was way more than that. This is not how you do business. You don't make repairs before first authorizing the amount. 5 weeks later I called and he said he hadn't gotten to it. He said that he had told me 2-3 MONTHS (he didn't). I picked it up to take it to another place that could get it fixed in a timely manor. He was rude to me when I picked it up and told me to get lost. I would not recommend that ANYONE take any sort of equipment here.Ok after reading all the reviews and seeing that it was split between 1 star and 5 stars I decided to give this place a shot with the help of a groupon.  I figured the 1 stars were just people being cheap well I was wrong.

Positives:  The service was good, enjoyed our waiter.  I had a blast with my wife dispite what follows.

Negatives:  The Food and the Price.  The food ranged from ok to terrible regardless of if it was free our the high prices that I paid.  

Oyster half shell:  Small with no real flavor= no Brine taste
Escargot:  No flavor
Shrimp Toast:  Lots of flavor and that flavor was salt.
Wife had Stuffed lobster and said it was ok if over cooked, so 3 star on lobster.
I had the Trout, I love Trout.  This was the worst trout I have ever had.  

The crowd here was mixed, but I got the feeling that the younger crowd was here off the groupon and the normal crowd is older and enjoys the taste of the food.  I could see someone with a different sense of taste loving this place.  

Now the Price is crazy I really should of just left after I ordered a beer and it came in a coffee cup looking glass and the Wife ordered a shot glass size Gin and Tonic for $10.   

I guess it one of those places you have to try once and we did, I just wish I didn't have to pay the $150 tab for fish I going to give to my Great Dane.

I do want to once again point out that the service was good.Played there a couple of days ago. Not impressed to say the least. Facility is in fantastic shape for oversseding this time of year. (mid october) We showed up at 6 am for our 640 tee time. (that's plenty to get warmed up, get a cup of coffee, and use the bathroom before teeing off.) Clubhouse was empty. Ya know that xmas story when they say... "Nothing was stirring, not even a mouse?" Yea, that's what it felt like. Finally, after siiting around for 30 mins, the pro shop opens. We pay for our rounds, and get 10 mins to hit some balls. 

*10 mins later*

We get to the tee box, no starter. Even the groundskeepers were running behind. Not a big deal, the guys were cool. With my limited spanish I was talking to one gentleman, and he was talking about how one course is down, and its a lot of work for them at the moment. I get it. They're busy, it's my day off, no big deal. The pace of play was slow, because each tee box we got to were being groomed, the tee boxes were on the side of the tee box, so we had to slow down a bit. Whos fault was that? Ours, of course. Golf course was in great shape, the views are amazing (I like Sun Ridge Canyon more, personally.)

*4 hours later*

Get done with the round, go inside for some food. Order drinks... 1 coke, an arnold palmer, a lemonade and a water. Server got 2 of 4 wrong. awesome! We order food, and the server says "Would you like to take care of that with a credit card or membership?" Well, in the REAL world, we wait till after our food arrives to usually pay... if you want a good tip anyways. Maybe I am in a different country it's otherwise... I answer I'll take care of it with cash. Here's his god to honest answer.

"We do not accept cash."

What?

Last time I checked, this is America, and it's safe to accept legal tender issued by the Federal Reserve, buddy.

Get the food, fries were the best part. 


Get the check and the 20% is automatically added. Wow. We had a party of 3... not 8 or 10, 3.... Three. no wonder there was bad service.

TL-DR?

The service all around needs to be stepped up if. It's too far to be treated that way. But then again, if memberships is all they want, maybe they've found their niche. Old people all around, a nd a lot of people who don't care. Nice business plan, guys!

I'll pass next time.From a scale from 1 to 10  I  give this place 1...We literally stood in the entrance for 15min and the hostess never showed up as people kept piling in. And the security staff standing there gave no explanation as to why NO ONE was present to seat people. Just stood there. So we left. I can see why it has such low ratings...I hate to say it, but seriously? You're going to have kids learn how to make sushi and send that to customers? It was horrible. Uneven pieces and falling apart--I paid for that. I can't believe I paid for that. 

The miso was nasty as well. Too many onions and the seaweed used in the soup was nasty. I'm always up for miso soup, but I will never eat anything like what they put in front of me ever again.

Plus, the service sucked. I'm sorry that I came in a weird hour (right about 2:30 pm), but why take a table if you are not going to stay for them? I have to say though, that I am kind of grateful that we ended up with a different server. The second one was actually nice--but couldn't even pronounce the words correctly. 

To top it off, they wear shirts that say "Miso Hungry," but one guy was walking around without the "ry" attached so it stated, "Miso Hung." 

Yeah. I'm never going here ever again.Got food poisoning here today. I have been here before and have been satisfied. Today though I got the biscuits and gravy with eggs. Since then I have been vomiting all day. Very upset this is keeping me in the house on a SaturdayI have only had take-out while at work from here. I would never go there to eat. What is the deal with the giant bread? I can never order anything hot because it won't be when I get it. I kow a lot of people like it and maybe it is what they order and what I order, but I just have NEVER liked anything I have gotten from this place!We went here for dinner the other night and ended up wishing we hadn't.

The staff is very friendly and that's probably what keeps this place open. The food is bland at best and way overpriced for a little hole in the wall. I ordered a strawberry margarita and found that a strawberry had never been near it. Clearly a flavored mix.
We each had a shrimp taco and a fish taco. The shrimp had been so overcooked that it was like chewing on little lumps of plastic. The fish had no flavor at all as it hadn't been seasoned.
We left with a feeling of "Lesson learned."Bait and switch so much for free diagnostic.Agreed with the rest of the reviews which I should have read first. Steamed won tons dry, tough, and bland; chow mien noodles overcooked, bland, dry; shrimp tasted old and fishy and like the mud vein wasn't cleaned out; portion sizes on the small size for the typical Chinese restaurant although they were enough. I usually like to have some left for lunch the next day. Mongolian beef was also bland and barely spicy for a spicy dish.

On the positive side, we received 2 egg-rolls that we didn't order.

The price was probably average but very high for the quality of food received. 

We were quoted 30-45 minutes but it took about an hour to be delivered.

Overall disappointed and will definitely be trying somebody else next time.Three words:  food borne illness.  Frankly, their food isn't tasty enough to warrant the risk.We had a layover on our family trip to Cancun today. We went out for Mexican food and found Macayos Cantina. I have grown up eating Mexican food and let me tell you this place sucks! The food tasts canned or processed,  its dirty and the staff looks dirty and unprofessional. They had no knowledge of how to make a Michelada or a Mexican Preparada,  weird for a "CANTINA".... the waiter just said "we dont serve that here bro". The chips and salsa as well as the rice and beans were old and dried out. Avoid this place unless you are looking to get waisted with a bunch of college kids.Tried to go in for lunch, a few days ago, and were told there would be a 15min wait for a table..at like 3 in the afternoon with no one else in the place..poor, poor form. Took it down the street and spent money, elsewhere. These are the businesses that are crying about the economy hurting them, when in reality it is their own service and dedication to patrons that falters.They have turned into social snobs.  My kids have been asked  (told) I do not want them to give this place any more money.  Unbelievable!!A friend and I went here a couple weeks ago on a random Wednesday night to get a quick bite to eat.  Having not had Chinese food in a while (in a state that lacks any real great Chinese food), we decided to give Wong's Place a shot.  We ordered the twice-cooked pork and the beef chow fun in black bean sauce.  Neither of the dishes were really that great.  The twice-cooked pork was far too sweet and overloaded with vegetables as filler and the beef chow fun was greasier than I'd prefer.

And to seal the deal, a classmate of mine whom I saw working there, later informed me to avoid eating here because they allegedly "recycle" the rice there.  You got it, the last table's leftover white rice is now being added into your pot and served to you.

If you're looking for legit Chinese food, you're better off going somewhere else.

Edit: Based on recent reviews, perhaps the 1-2 star reviews aren't getting their point across.  Here's a list of places you're better off going to:

1. Asian Hong Kong/Hong Kong Asian Diner (the name escapes me, but it's on the NW corner of Rural and Ray)
2. Panda Express
3. Subway
4. Filibertos

As you can see, while there are more legitimate (and delcious) Chinese restaurants to eat at, it seems that just about ANYWHERE is a better choice than Wong's.  Please, just let them go the way of Chrysler and eat somewhere else.Gross.

I love Mexican and New Mexican cuisine, but this is just the most bland, arterie-clogging mess.  I've been here three times, and each time has been as bad as the last.  Sadly, they're very close to Solo Cafe, so I've made the poor choice to eat there after a day of studying on occasion.  I always regret it.

No flavor, lots of styrofoam packaging and plastic utensils, microwaved cheese, and no spice to it.  Save your money.Ugh... watch out with that new Salmon Salad.. mine came with about 1/2 cup of oil.. ate the salmon, which was fine, and then saw the oil... took the greens home, hoping I could soak out the oil but it was impossible.. must be over 800 calories with all that oil.  $9 for a salad, pretty expensive, and this time, mostly wasted.. threw out the soggy greens when I got home.My boyfriend and I went in the store this evening and received bad service. You'd think they'd want to help push through a $5000-$6000 purchase, even if it is 30 minutes before closing...but I guess not.

We'll probably buy from Best Buy..they always go above and beyond.This place was a super big let down. Frozen fish squares? Cold unsalted fries? Flat pop? Frozen burger patties? And a burrito that looked like someone just popped open a banquet meal and pulled one out. The banquet would probably be better. Should have known the universe was trying to tell me to leave when they only take cash. It's the 21st century. Get with it. If you are looking for a better fish sandwich you'll have better luck at mcdonalds.This place deserves nothing. I got house chicken and chicken fried rice. When I got home to mix the two I bit into it and found a thick sharp plastic!!!!! I didn't really care because I didn't swallow it no harm whatever. Called them to let them know. Or see if they can fix the problem for me because we are starving and find this crap in our food. Thinking they give us a new meal and a refund on the inconvenience and  apologize for the object they yelled at me! They yelled at me. Are you kidding me? told me if I wanted new food they wanted the old food in full. they asked me how much of it I ate. Making it seem like there doing me a favor. Wth no. I found a price of plastic that could've had me choke! I had to stop my meal to argue with these guys on the food for 20 minutes. To find out there's no way out of this. I hung up because I didn't care enough to argue in circles. But hey if you want A HUGE SHARP object in your food that the restaurant will blame you for then hey this is the place to go!!!Not so good. Got very sick after eating the mahi mahi and macaroni salad.FYI Went there last night-1/22/2010---it was closed---I assume Alberto's is no longer.To call this fish and chips is SOOO wrong.  Its nothing like fish and chips should be.  Go to George and Dragon in Phoenix if you want real fish and chips.  Greasy squares of fish is disgusting.I love all you can eat buffet and the stake house the cafe restraunt I eat slots of food and I am still skinny I love that ever play machines there and sports ticketsI wish I could give no stars. I have literally had to call so many times to complain that I've stopped because it's clear no one there give a fuck about their customers. McDonalds corp just had the owner if this location call me and all she did was question me about all the issues as if I was the one who seemed sketchy. I even told them I don't want free food just get my order right.the first time I went here It was 115 degrees outside so I just thought it was the heat that amplified my disappointment in this place...   while 35 for this course was not a bad price at all, i wont be returning after this round... the weather was great, I was primed and ready for a great round....  that being said, I put my 3 iron perfect right down the middle of the first fairway on the desert course...    and then, i hit off of the fairway..... It felt like I was hitting off of the cart path.... or concrete... it was terrible...  this course is really not well kept at all, the starter backed up one of the courses for tee off close to a half hour... it was a terrible mess....  

after an errant tee shot on one of the holes i went over to the other fairway to get my ball only to see someone pick up my ball and pocket it... terrible golf etiquette... another gentlemen advised me that they were members and wouldnt do that...   just an overall bad experience.... avoid this one yelpers.... its not a good place....Called 1 week before the flowers were to be delivered.  The flowers never arrived and the staff had no idea what happened.  They blamed it on the guard at the gate and lied about trying to deliver the flowers and never attempted to deliver them.  Four days later the only thing that they told me was they would refund my money and hung up on me.  Paula, Pat and the deliver person Bobby were unable to help in any way.  I was unable to talk to the owner but judging from the staff this florists has some real problems.This is an unethical, unprofessional dental office.  They scheduled my son's follow up orthodontic appointment and when we arrived said we didn't have an appointment although I had the appointment reminder card.  Also scheduled an appointment to have his mouth-guard made for sports again when we show up, no appointment although we had the appointment reminder card.  My son's orthodontic treatment ended early but they refused to remove the braces unless I gave them $1000 (the remaining balance) which I signed a contract to have debited from my account monthly.  Stay away from Aliante Dental.I was referred by a friend to Sunrise Vet Clinic. The clinic is in a bad neighborhood and the building is run down. I have been multiple times and never saw Dr. Henderson. I have always been pleased by the service of the other Vets in the office. 
    After dealing with Dr. Henderson we will never go back again. He never listened to what I told him about my dogs. I told the Dr. Henderson multiple times one of my dogs was abused and may bite if you do not let him sniff you first, and to not come up from behind him.  Due to his horrible bedside manner and lack of listening skills my dog snapped at Dr. Henderson when he came up from behind my dog and grabbed him by the mouth.  Dr. Henderson called him a bad dog and walked out of the room. Not only did I warn Dr. Henderson, but this is notated all over my dog's chart that he may bite if nervous. My dog has never done this with any other vet in the office because they take the time the time to let him warm up to them.By far the most greasiest pizza I've had in Vegas. Total disappointment.Bedbugs... need I say more?  I woke up covered in welts... so did my buddies.  I guess we got what we paid for.  I'll never stay here again.  I would write a longer review, but the bedbugs just make it all moot.I'm only giving This review a one star because It wouldn't let me give anything less

So where do I begin?

I went Memorial Day weekend for a music festival and my anniversary this year. Already booked this room way in advanced for a way cheaper price and I shown up to pay triple the price. 
Because there was a music festival that caters to punk rock or alternative crowd, we and anybody that was hotel guests were marginalized to where wrist bands FOR THIS WEEKEND ONLY. Not that bad you say? Well this ensures that you can't bring ANYBODY to the room with you and if you do want to, then you have to pay $25 a wrist band just to visit. YOU CANT EVEN VISIT OTHER HOTEL GUESTS IN ANY OTHER ROOM!  that's right. My friend in the floor above me can't visit me. 

They also had this card system to operate the elevators. In which you are subjective to the floor that your staying on. 

For the room itself; it wasn't bad until I tried to flip some switches. Some of the electrical didn't work. Not that big of a deal. Looked in the bathroom to find a wet towel on the tub floor. And on the sink counter, I find CRUSTY, DIRTY PANTIES! No joke! 

I raised hell and all they gave us was $15 food credit in which it didn't work. 

I keep getting harassed about the wrist bands which fall off in the shower and tried to get me to pay an additional $25 to buy a new one when they had my name was filed as a guest. I've payed $400 to be marginalized, with horrible service and didn't even care when I talked to the hotel management with no sort of compensation. 

This is the worst establishment that I have ever stayed at with no regard for customer service. I've felt like I was forced to wear flair and we know what party made people wear flair. 

I'm never staying here again and I urge anybody that is planning to stay here, gamble, eat here ect.  To find somewhere else. I know about 2 dozen people that could vouch this review and had similar experiences.WAY overpriced!!!

Nothing was special about this place. And thats really sad because we spend like 350 for a couples massage for only 60 min... :(

the shower/ steam/ jacuzzi area was awful! i mean my gym has better amenties then that!!

Oh and the massage therapists didn't actually give you the whole time in my opinion...I think they included dressing time and stuff...lame..but not nearly as lame as the medicore massage that we recieved...ATTENTION: it's called pressure, and when I'm getting a massage I would like to feel some pressure...otherwise I could rub my own body thank you!! 


next time i'm in town i'm trying ceasers!REASONS WHY I DO NOT DRINK TEQUILA: 

i am banned here for life. 
yup. for life. 
uh huh... not just for Light... but from Bellagio. 

the VIP people don't know what they're doing. mainly because they combined our party with a bunch of crazy red necks without consulting us. we ended up getting into a fight with the red neck party and the security guards stomped on our heads while some of us were sprawled out on the floor. they completely did the WRONG thing and participated in knocking us all down, destroying my brand new LV purse (because it was covered in people's blood) and not STOPPING the fight. 

now, i'm no fighter. i CAN fight and have had training, but i'm more of a "let's work it out" kind of chick. not when drinking tequila. it is the devil. i... turn into the devil. 

we ended up being handcuffed and taken away by the Bellagio security. apparently... Light's cameras weren't working that night, so they had NO live or recorded feed of what happened or the fact that their bouncers were involved in the fight; not stopping it. WOW. 

view photo. that crystal bowl..? yeah, i smashed it on someone's head.Our non-smoking room smelled like stale cigarettes, the decor went out of style when Clinton entered the White House, and the location was inconvenient.First of all, I booked 2 rooms with a view 2 months ahead. I ended up with two pet stayed rooms with no view. Room was still dirty from the last visitor. Do not recommend staying at rio because of bad customer service. Will not stay here again.This place could be good. I wouldn't know though because we tried to go there last night and it was closed for a private party and today I tried to call to order lunch for pick up and they don't answer their phone. That's stupid!! The restaurants in the Rio are a horrible excuse for food, from what I've tried, and I was hoping this one at least would be good as we have to stay at the Rio for trade shows. Maybe some time I'll be able to try it. PICK UP YOUR PHONE!!!If I could... I would seriously give this place 0 stars! THIS IS A MEDICAL CENTER! You are supposed to be acting like doctors, nurses, etc... but I feel like I came to jail or something around that atmosphere. I have something to say about the front desk ladies.. on their faces they have a look of "I don't give a damn". Also, the nurse that called us in with short red spikey hair she had the same look on her face too and was super rude. Very rude service being that they are working at a medical place. I'm surprised I am even writing a review about a medical place.. shouldn't I be reviewing like a restaurant or something?! pathetic... If I was going to UCLA hospital, USC hospital, John Hopkins Hospital or another hospital in the world, they would not give me this kind of bad treatment. I don't know where these assistants/doctors graduated from but they sure don't know what they are doing or how to treat patients in the right manner. 

My grandpa went to go get a checkup here and the doctor said he was all fine and he did not have to worry about anything anymore. As soon as my grandpa got home, he finds that the doctor made a mistake and we waste gas by driving all the way down there again and that is when all the rude service began to be thrown at us. 

I suggest or recommend to go to a different medical center / hospital please! I am doing everyone a favor out there. If you are sick or in urgent need.. rude people are the last thing you need to deal with!ordered the double cheese steak.  there may have been 3oz of charred grizzle in the sandwich which was greasy.  the chicken pizza with white sauce and tomatoes was a chopped breaded chicken patty.  The pizza was in editable.  called for delivery .25 miles away...took 1.5 hours.  when I called 45 minutes in, the lady said it was on the truck and hung up on me.  Avoid this train wreck.Stay away from this shuttle "service". Although the trip from the airport is fine and pleasant, we bought a round trip ticket at the airport thinking it was going to save time & money. Nope. I called in advance to reserve our pickup from the Luxor for our 6:05pm Sunday 11/13 departure and they told me that they didn't have any shuttles going to the Luxor for the entire day, except at 9:30 AM? WHAT?????????????????????????
THIS IS LAS VEGAS!!!!!! These people take your money even though they know they don't run all day. If this information was made available, I would have saved my money and just planned on taking a cab back to the airport. Which was the exact same price as the shuttle in the first place. Basically, save your money and if you are staying at a hotel at the beginning of the strip, just take a cab, it will cost you the same thing or nearly the same. I will never use this shuttle again.You really get to experience the flavor of North Las Vegas at this course....

Be warned that if you are in need of rental clubs, I guess you need to let them know way in advance. When we showed up on a friday afternoon, they asked if we had our own clubs. We were just in town for the weekend and did not bring any. The attendant just said "we're completely out of clubs" and offered no other resolution. I think they maybe had 2 sets of full clubs for the 18 hole golf course. Kind of ridiculous. Wasted cab rides to and from the course.

On the plus side there was a charming grocery store across the street from the course named Marketon (formerly King Ranch Market). They have great deals on chicken and make a mean soccer-themed cake.I was with my children at Meadows mall, and decided I wanted to have my favorite chocolate candy which is sold singularly and costs $1.50 and is usually set on the counter and isn't seasonal it's always there.  I asked the employee "SHIRLEY G." if they had any and she said yes and began to open the glass case I said no they are usually individually wrapped and on top of the counter and she said we have NEVER had those.  I said yes you do the only reason I know this is because it's my favorite. She said no no ! I said it's no problem are they discontinued. And she said "MA'AM I just told you we have never had those!" and yelled at me. I leaned forward a little and saw them in a plastic case being dusted or refilled on a back counter. I said those are the candies I'm talking about right there and pointed at them. And she said you didn't say that kind I said yes I did but that's ok I don't want it anymore nevermind and turned to walk away and she said "WELL YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE STUPID ABOUT IT" I just kept walking. I couldn't believe that she number one yelled at me and number two called me stupid infront of my children. I found the corporate office address and will be writing a long letter to them about how disgusted with how I was treated.so eight years ago when I got married this was a good place, with a nice show in the front, and some statues and things at the entrance, it had a really nice medieval feel to it you know?

today it is just gross, they replaced the Merlin with Dick?  That is ridiculous.  anyway the casino is so smoky you can feel the lung cancer growing, even the smokers in my party complained (and they smoke 2 packs a day)

the beds were uncomfortable, even the cloths that I packed and didn't wear came out smelling like smoke at the house.  none of the other casino's seemed to have this problem.  I won't be staying at the Excalibur on my third trip to Vegas, if there is one.  

I will likely stay at either the New York New York, or Treasure Island, with the remodeling the Treasure Island seemed pretty cool, though the new show was not child oriented (though I wouldn't call it child inappropriate, it was borderline.)Horrible
That is how I describe this place. Check-in SUCKS . 30 Guest standing in Line but 3 employees working. Employees no smile on there face as if are forced to work. I only stay at this place just because my 2 small kids.
Nothing good about this place. No microwave and refrigerator. Wifi free but very SLOW.WOW..........all I can say is that the reviews for this restaurant under its original name Inka Chicken were so bad they change the name & took down the worst of the reviews. Bad, Bad, Bad, stay away unless you know the new owner personally, only then you might get good service & not get ignored. Don't be fooled Che Inka is the same place.Without a doubt the worst customer service experience I've ever encountered.

My wife and I booked a room at this motel through Travelocity for our upcoming trip to Vegas. Their posting said 'pet friendly', so we booked the room and went about our lives. Finally the start of our vacation arrived and en route to Vegas (we drove) we decided to call Best Western Mardi Gras to inquire about check-in. My wife casually mentioned something about our pet and, whoa- turns out the whole property isn't pet friendly, only a select number of rooms are. You guessed it- our room was not one of the pet-friendly rooms and all of those were completely booked. So we were told that our room was now void since we had a pet. It's still unknown if the fault here lies with this motel or Travelocity but, let me repeat: their listing said 'pet friendly', not 'pet friendly with restrictions' or any indication that any other steps were required to identify we wanted one of these pet-friendly rooms. Ok, mistakes happen. This is not my complaint.

So here we are, en route to Vegas in the middle of nowhere and just found out we have no place to stay. Needless to say, our Best Western Mardi Gras operator was less than compassionate about our situation. When we asked if there were any options for us she just said no and hung up. I could blame the poor customer service on one individual but, after calling back and speaking with a manager, I received essentially the same. We were literally stuck in the desert, on our way to Las Vegas with no idea where we would stay that night. If we had Internet access (like the folks at the Best Western surely had) it wouldn't have been that difficult to find some alternative but, as we mentioned numerous times to our Best Western operators, we were en route and in the middle of nowhere.

Anyone with an even moderate degree of empathy or customer service could have:
A) contacted another Best Western property to see if they had availability
B) taken 5 seconds to find a local number for a kennel so we could inquire about boarding our dog and keep our room
C) advise us of any other local pet-friendly properties
D) contact Travelocity to sort the issue out (instead, we did)
E) none of the above but at least express an apology for the complication
...and instead, they did none of these.Food is ok and boring. It is a part of the Darden chain of restaurants so if you are familiar with Red Lobster, think of a Caribbean inspired version and you have Bahama Breeze. The drinks are delicious and really bad for you, and the food always tastes exactly the same; consistency is good. I have actually eaten here a couple times, but my last experience will have me never come back.

If you are looking for mediocre food in the array of mediocre food options near corporate Hughes center you could wind up here. Maybe you have coupons and you purposefully drove here? Understood.

My final visit to Bahama Breeze began with 2 coworkers and I walking in and standing in front of a host podium without being acknowledged. Three professional ladies, standing in an empty entrance waiting to be seated, until a couple minutes later a host (who never lifted her head from staring at the floor, I must have missed the carpet design) finally sat us. We were helped by a strangely hostile server who at one point through the meal had his manager come up to us and apologize for the wait for our food. This came as a surprise to us because he never mentioned anything about late food, and we hadn't asked about it. 

When our lunches arrived my baja fish tacos with a side salad had turned into baja fish tacos with a side soup. I enjoyed the soup and made no complaints, it was a tasty chowder with fried shrimp. Overall the food was unmemorable but not inedible. The service was terrible. I can't believe that every person I interacted with: host, server, and manager were not polite to outright rude. We were *told*(not offered) to get free dessert (or else our server said he would eat it? wtf?) but never received any apologies. Not for the late food, not for our shitty greet at the front door, not for our strangely hostile server, not for our late and incorrect food. Instead we got begged to take a free dessert. Sad. WTF guys, get your shit together.Living proof that casinos own public officials - a 3 day banquet for 3,000 guests from all over the world, and the food is an 'open trough.' It was disgusting, to say the least. Shame on the executives at the Wynn for not providing a healthy atmosphere to dine. At the buffets, there are sneeze guards, enforced by the health department. But not required at banquets, so not provided. The executives at the Wynn have the experience to know better. 

Seeing people laugh, cough, sneeze, and simply talk over open containers of food was primitive. Shame on the Wynn. Only classy on the surface.Two years ago I introduced my sister to S-a-F. We played $1 or $2 blackjack for hours, because that's how long it took the 80 year old dealer to get through one deck, lol. The pit boss came over and she had to be 90. We had a good laugh there. There's no ambience but if you like to play for cheap, it was one of the only choices remaining on the Strip.

I went back last year and, sadly, all the tables had been replaced by machines. It was early in the day, before the food vendors opened, and there was literally not a soul in the place besides me. No drink service, no cashier, no management. If you have a problem as I did, or need change or anything, you have to go out to Circus Circus, and their managers don't know anything about Slots a Fun's machines. It was a sad state of affairs and unless they turn things around, it looks like Slots a Fun's days are numbered.Wow, what a rip off. I recently went here during my visit to Vegas. If you want to pay an outrageous price for a "Fatburger" then this is the place for you. I walked out of there with a bill of $50 for 3 cheeseburgers and a greasy hot dog. The lady at the register had an attitude and i think that those prices should provide better customer service. Will never go there again. It truly is nothing special and definitely NOT worth the price!I'm not sure how good their burgers or pulled pork sandwiches are, but what I ordered was not good at all. I got the chicken ceasar salad wrap, which isn't difficult to make whatsoever..but they made it so wrong and distasteful I have to give this place a bad review. They put in carrots and zucchini and some odd sauce which definitely wasn't ceasar dressing in the wrap. It wasn't even busy when we came here and we barely got any service...the only thing I liked about this place was the french fries, which you really can't screw up so that's nothing to brag about.  I do not recommend this place to anyone unless you are a burger or other greasy sandwich lover.This place is horrible. Its one of those places that you think could be fun because of the movie. The idea is good, but the only people dancing on the bars our the audience. You can't just have your patrons dance. Something professional would be nice.Went to this restaurant a few years back and loved it! After going to STK and a few other places over the past years instead while in town, we thought we would give Gallagher's another try. What a disappointment. Tough steak....crap...Sam, the waiter was awesome, though and that was the best part of the visit. Shrimps were very good, but the star of the meal, our steaks...very sad, indeed. Won't return. Now, STK, that blew our heads off...should have went there again.We decided to stay in this place because its the cheapest we can get from expedia with only having a week before departure to book in the middle of the summer. The second floor hallway stinks. I wanted to get into our room to get away from the smell only to find out that our room stinks as well... a non-smoking room that smells like someone just had smoke? what the heck. I've been to other cheap motels but this is by far the worst.This was not our first time but it will be our last.  Drinks were fine, we were not offered bread. Two meals turned out ok but the 3rd was steak and it was ordered medium well. It was a charred, hard knot. We sent it back after the other two were finished with their dinner the third received the remade steak and it was RARE. Mind you it took 35 minutes to make a rare steak. When we received the bill, it had the steak on and off not once but twice, both with notations that the customer didn't like it. Hmmm, nothing about not making it right but blame the customer? Me thinks NOT.  We waited and waited and it was a week night, business dinner. We will not  be going back.Bad food and pushy waiter.  We hardly finished what we were served. My fish was heavily battered and the french fries seemed to be out of a bag- really fast-food under a plastic tree.It was very disappointing, I was told how great the pizza was and I was severely let down. I actually got up and left after I had my first bite. If you are a Vegas local and want a good pizza I would highly suggest you forgo this place and instead try Pizza My Dear or Grimaldi'sDo not shop Stein Mart, did you know that sexual orientation is NOT protected in there employee handbook. Do not support a store that doesn't support equal rights!I am not very good at wrapping gifts without them looking rather messy.  So, for a recent special occasion, I took the gift (a book) in to Alligator Soup to have it professionally wrapped.  
The store is crazy-packed with all kinds of generic gifts, greeting cards and such.  It was hard to even tell where the register was because the counter was so cluttered.  I was told it would be $7.50 for the wrapping and was shown some gift wrap to choose from.  I was very surprised at the limited choices of solid color paper, but selected one.  I was not asked about the occasion or the accompanying ribbon.  I was very surprised at the finished result - you could see the title of the book right through the paper.  I mentioned this to the lady helping me, but she just offered to move the bow.  No thanks!  I have had gifts wrapped at Papyrus before and the results were beautiful.  For $7.50, I would expect them to have a better quality paper or to at least double wrap it.  It felt like a rip-off and I don't feel as though the clerk really cared.  I wouldn't go back for anything.I had a very interesting experience at this location!  The girl behind the counter had a sense of humor, but it was a touch on the... ghetto side.  When I got done ordering my food she looks at me and simply says "No, you can't have that".  Ok, funny, ha ha.  Give me my f#$%ing sandwich.  

I ordered the Buffalo Wrap.  Now, I admit, I am not formally trained in sandwich manufacturing, but this item did not sound like rocket science.  Apparently I was wrong.  17 minutes later, and a really entertaining bickering session back and forth by the staff, my masterpiece arrives.  The wrap had a decent flavor - a bit heavy on the Buffalo sauce, but whatever.  They are getting 2 stars only because the wrap was good.  Not for service, not for humor.  

Best part is there was an older gentleman that ordered behind me that did not appreciate the "you can't have a sandwich" comedy skit and got into a bit of an arguement with the employee... to which she actually tried to defend herself.

Sorry, you get one shot - I won't be back.Poor customer service, and arrogant management. The cash registers also do not face to customer, so you cannot see the prices as they ring up the items, unless you go through the self check out lanes.While a few have had a good experience and most poor, I had to speak up about the living 'conditions' of these dogs that were witnessed upon entering the store. The cages are small and for the larger breeds who are past the 8 week old, cute, puppy stage-they seem to barely have enough room to stretch out and lay on their side. Part of the high prices and their success with selling the dogs at such a markup is because when you see them, you can't help but want to snatch them all up and get them out of those conditions and into a warm and loving home.  All the dogs had water, but I saw no food, and in fairness, I didn't notice too many dirty cages.
They did seem to be well staffed and no one in the store was rude to me. It's fair to say they were a bit aloof but it's clear for most of the staff this is just a job; maybe they just get indifferent after being there awhile...
Honestly, you have to think of this place the same way you would think of a shelter.  Your saving a life and giving each of these sweet little souls a chance at a good life outside those conditions, the only difference is you get to have them as puppies and pay a much higher price. 
All this said, Petland is a business and owners make decisions about how their business is run, so in a sense-it is what it is, and it is their right to operate in a way they see fit.  As a consumer, I won't be back because I prefer not to support a business whose practices I don't agree with. That said, for those that buy, bless you. You really are giving each animal at Petland at better life by bringing them into your loving forever home.It's been over a month, and I'm still waiting on the resolution of the double charging for our pizza we ordered. Not worth it if they make a mistake, because there is clearly no urgency to correct it. I'm not talking $30 bucks here. We were charged $124 TWICE.

Don't order from here. I wish we would have ordered somewhere else, eaten less delicious pizza for less money, and only been charged once. 

What happened to what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas? This mess sure didn't.I would like to start by saying that I grew up in a mediterranean country and know this cuisine well. Paymon's is one of the worst attempts at mediterranean cuisine. The food tastes bad and their prices are crazy high, considering. Their dishes are usually soaking in oil and take forever to digest as a result. My suggestion, try Khoury's or Alibaba.Horrible service. Horrible food. Don't waste your time or money!So my friends and I went to Lupo for my friend Rich's bday. It was a first time for all of us. 
Now straight to the point I had a dry ass Penne Pasta (don't get it) but my friends offered me a sample of their food.  I tried the Sea Bass which was amazing, my other friend had the Braciola Di Maiale Alla Griglia, another had a pretty good steak but I don't remember the exact name.  We ordered sides to each meal which was delayed by far, they had already completed their meals by the time the sides arrived.  
We asked to speak to management he apologized for the delay in the side orders and comped my meal and took half off the bill.  
He also sent out 5 different types of desserts for us to try, yummy.
Overall the food was good but I would never go back there again.  Not my cup of tea.DAILY HOURS are subject to change.... Seriously?? If you're not busy you just close when you want? Ha! The posted hours that day stated they were open till 9pm, I arrived at 8:15 to hit 1 bucket of balls. To my surprise that wasn't happening, and the punk younger employee made it very clear "if we aren't busy, we shut down. Do you just expect us to wait around for customers?" - MY BAD BROIt's not really meant to be a negative review.  BUT--I happened to wander by today on my way to the grocery store, and they are no longer in business.There is not much to a smog check, so I have to rate this location purely on customer service. As you can see from the stars,... it was not that great. The guy running the place has a severe case of "small man" syndrome. In other words, he hates everyone because god gave him a tiny body, so he is forced to compensate for this by acting like he rules the world. I don't mean to dis the guy but he was a complete jerk. He was annoyed with every customer that pulled up (including me). The whole experience was just very uncomfortable from start to finish.  I will probably avoid this location this time next year when I'm looking for a smog check.Had a 1:30 Appointment today (5/21/14) with Dr. Baldauf.  Received a call around 10 that the doctor was in surgery and we could either see his Physicians Assistant or reschedule.  We opted to see the PA.  Got to the office in plenty of time, and was shown into an exm room at 1:40.  The nurse or whoever the female was that showed us to the room, asked the usual questions and her last question was, "And you are okay to see the PA?"  We said yes and as she left she said she will be right in.  At 3:20, Dr. Baldauf came into the room. My mother, who is the patient let him have it for her waiting so long.  He was apologetic in his arrogant way stating well I am in scrubs!  He wasn't interested in listening to what I had to say.  So it was decided that my mother would get an injection, which is what we had the appointment for in the first place.  He said his PA would be in to do the injection.  10 minutes later she arrives and apologies again for the delays.  When I told her we had agreed to see the PA instead of the doctor, she said she was with the doctor in surgery.  Well maybe this story works for spouses or whoever you are lying too but soneone really did lie here.  I would not take another family member to this group of doctors if they were the only ones left in town! Medicare will also here about the kind of service this office offers.  My mother is 91 and it was very uncomfortable for her to sit on that table for that long.  Think it might border on ELDER ABUSE!Carlos is the worst server there.  



I was sat got my drink and then waited 10 mins for the Guac that I wanted.  Mean while a table gets sat next to us and the place wasn't busy like it has been last time I went there.   The other table gets drink and their order taken before he even thinks about taking ours then walks away.  No water in our glasses I am out of my beverage from the bar I have to wave him down and get him to come over to me I ask for the bill because I am tired of dealing with idiots and then all of a sudden he wants to be the best waiter in the restaurant.   I told him not to bother his manager because I didn't want to waste his time.  There is nothing that the manager could have done even if he spoke with me to please me after this visit here.   Yet to remind you that I live 24 miles away from the restaurant in North North Las Vegas.  Needless to say I will no longer go back to visit this restaurant.



This is the first time that I got so mad that I left a restaurant.  I am a chef and I know that sometimes people are busy but when half the restaurant is full that is not busy.  It just means that you knew someone to get the job and trust me the only break this guy got was when they hired him.I signed up for the mailbox service in person, and when I did the female employee clearly stated "There is no other fee when you request your mail to be forwarded other than the postage you pay to have it sent to you." So I signed on for their 12-month service.  Gave them my credit card number to keep "On File". Imagine my surprise when I first requested mail forwarding and my card was charged an extra $5? When I called, the male employee on the phone said, "No, the woman misspoke. There is a $5 fee on top of your postage each time you ask for mail forwarding. I am the general manager," and proceeded to be annoyed at my puzzlement. Then he claimed he didn't have my credit card on file. When I insisted I had given it (how else did the first forwarded batch get to me??) he claimed that UPS must have shipped my last batch for free, since he couldn't find my credit card info -- all the while getting more annoyed at me!

When I insisted they had my card info and I didn't want to give it a second time, and I also wanted assurances that they didn't lose my info somewhere (!), he went and FOUND my original info. He had it the whole time.

So just watch out when you sign up for a service with this UPS Store, and check your bank statement/credit card for anything that looks unusual. They clearly don't train their employees well, if someone "misspoke" about a charge and got you to sign on. They are really nice in person but seem to be very disorganized, and I am wishing I didn't sign on for a year and entrust them with my mail :(LVAC is fun to work out at! Because finding your weights is like a scavenger hunt. They are (almost) never racked.

I'm not the kind that likes to stink up my car with post-work out sweat. I even put up with tne piss-scented showers and having to pay $0.50 to use the lockers (2 quarters).

What I do love is that if is fully a 24-hour gym including the snack bar that has a large variety of protein drinks.

It almost makes up for having he rudest and most unprofessional employees of any business of any kind I have made ever been to; no exagerations and all kidding aside.This place used to be decent but has recently had a complete turnover in staff and they all are pretty much useless. This heater in the pool hasn't worked in 2 years and I was told by the "corporate" office that they have mechanical issues. For 2 years? Really? We haven't had landscaping done in almost a year so now I've listened to loud leaf blowers and other machinery for 2 full days now which has repeatedly woken my newborn. When I called the office to ask about the noise I was told "well we have to do landscaping!" Shocking since its been nearly a year since anyone has done it. Our towel rack fell off the wall only to reveal it was being held up by caulk! Some of the maintenance people are great but others are completely useless. Security is hit or miss. The security gate is useless being that people sit and wait until a tenant opens it then follows them in. Or they wait until someone is leaving and darts in the exit gate. The garbage trucks show up at 6am and wake the entire complex. The noise level is steadily getting louder and louder. I will not be renewing my lease.AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!

This has to be the worst hotel I've ever encountered. Between losing my reservation, having only 1 elevator that works (it comes every 30 minutes and most of the time is full), and a very RUDE security guard who wouldn't let me charge my cell phone at a wall outlet in the lobby and who physically accosted me, I will NEVER stay here again, nor would I recommend this place to anyone. The one plus is free wifi in the lobby that let me write this review.The rating is for delivery service, not the product. Haven't received yet so can't rate. Be warned Rc Willey delivers on their schedule. Not the customers. They give you 10 hour window for the day you choose so you better have whole day with nothing to do so Rc Willey can graciously deliver the item you paid for thousands of dollars + delivery fee. The day before the delivery, u need to make sure you go online (yes online) No one is goimg to bother to call you with 3 hour window time frame. Apparenty it must be up to delivery guys where they feel like goimg that day first. So you better don't make any plans on delivery day. Extremely unwilling to make it convenient for customer to have the item deliver.This time our experience got more  terrible then the last experience and each  time we  say we will give this place another try and its the same.......  We love the fried Pickles, but the real crapy service is now not wroth the 25 minute wait for drinks, take our order and the 30 minute wait for our check every time!

The owner must have his head 10feet deep in the sand, because while we were there this past time three tables walked out without paying and one with out even ordering after sitting there for 30 minutes........  Wake up and start giving us some service or the you going to lose customers forever!

You can only get better!I have never had my hair cut at Cha Cha, and I am grateful for that.  I was with my mother a few years ago when she had her hair cut here, and it was the most uncomfortable salon experience i've ever had.  i actually feel a little bad because she only chose the place at my insistence, as I had wanted to try it myself.  

Anyway, I don't know how you could make a simple bob look so bad, but I honestly think going to Cost Cutters would have done a better job.  The guy didn't listen to what she was saying, or else he was inexperienced and didn't know what he was doing, but either way, it was a terrible hair cut.  He also talked her into some "streaks" which were this hideous raspberry color, and looked like some 13 year old got into a bottle of miss clairol.  The whole time we kept giving each other worried/uncomfortable looks, as Mr Cool Tattoo (the stylist) kept cutting hair obliviously.  

Like a typical Midwesterner, my mom didn't say anything, but resolved to tell all her friends.No parking!!!!  

Unfriendly staff except bartender.  He was trying but quite marginal.

OMG!!!!!  1 HOUR AND 35 MINUTES OF WAITING AND $120 BAR TAB? REALLY???  Not our first time, gave this place chances after chances before writing it off.  The hostess kept telling us 20 minutes, after 20 minutes went by, another 15-20 minutes, etc.  We saw people that just walked in get seated before us!  

Wasn't greeted when we entered, not even a "Hi, can I help you?"

Wait area outside or in the bar area.  My car is bigger than the bar /waiting area!  I don't have a big car!

The bartender was the only person in the place that we considered the most friendly.

Well, the mango margarita at $12 was okay! Our meal tab was also over $120  for one salad, one appetizer, 1 sandwich, 1 mixed seafood dinner and the slow cooked pork dinner;  2 beers;  AND was almost charged for 2 extra beers we had ordered but never got!!!  So check your checks!!!!!

No one smiles in the place which is filled with beautiful artwork that's for sale!  The music is blaring so everyone has to shout to talk to each other.  Good thing my husband and our male friend have loud voices.

The female waitress, again, seemed like she was having a bad day....or life? Had no interest in our opinions about the food, plates were plopped down on the tables, she came to check on us twice, 2nd time, the guys asked for 2 more beers which never came. 

The whole experience started at 6:30pm and ended at 10!! 

Service and the meals didn't match the prices!!!!! Ouch!!  A hole in a wall place that leaves a hole in your pocket!!This place reminds me of Fat Tuesdays.  It's a place where tourists and college students go to get nasty drunk but don't expect good food.  

The food is incredibly spicy but lacks quality and actual flavor.  It's as if they spiced up the food so they can sell you more margaritas.  If you wanna go just to get messed up on margaritas, which you kinda end up doing while you're waiting to either be seated or served your food, then the place is perfect for you.  

Unless you're a tourist - don't expect any decent customer service.  The place is an old mortuary redone into a restaurant.  It needs some SERIOUS updating, hell, just get a hose and wash the inside clean!!  It's sticky and nasty!I say I will never return after waiting 1.5 hours to eat mediocre food, but I do it anyway, Maybe it is me hoping that It will be better the next time I go. It was as disappointing as the last 8 times have been there!

Had friends in town visiting and they wanted to meet and eat there. We got there with a large group, and was told if we call an hour ahead of time, we would be OK. Wrong! It was a Saturday night and of course it was busy. So I understand that. The wait is not bad because of the bar outside, but $3 for chips and salsa? $21 for a pitcher of Ice and Sangria (more ice)? luckily there are comfy seats to consume the overpriced drinks with a bunch of grouchy hungry people! 

Finally a gentleman from our group went in and said we would squeeze into a corner booth if they let us. That is what we did. I did not mind the squeezing, actually it was kinda fun. But after we ordered the drinks and then waiting for a waiter who was a smart ass - It was getting old. 

The interior is cool, the booths are an old carved wood and with all the crap on the walls, you know there is some history. The patio is comfy in the springtime, but feels like the owners took their old patio furniture to work. There is plenty of places to sit, but it is someway awkward. Careful, You might turn an ankle on the patio with all the chairs.

Ordered the Blue Corn Chicken Enchiladas with Red Chile. I know this place is not a New Mexican style place. My family roots are in New Mexico and I know what is Hot and good New Mexico cooking. So I do not know why I expected that from my order. The food came and is was not a heaping large portion of rice and beans and entree like you normally get. I thought that was chincy. 

I dug into the meal and found the tortilla to look like it was a dyed blue, not a real blue corn tortilla! My wife's order came with rice and she barely got a spoonful portion. WTH? Where was the meat? The rice use to be hot too, but someone must have raised hell that it made all the food so spicy that there was no flavor. Now it is a normal mexican food place boring rice. Although spicy, everyone was on the clean plate club, not because it was not good, but because we were starving! 

One person in the group ordered the Tamale, and it looked REALLY GOOD! She said it was good. 

Dinner at 6:30 - it was not going to happen. We finally left at 9:45!
Everyone left kinda disappointed. I left muttering the same words... never again!Worst customer service I have ever experienced - unfortunate because the food was really good. After the waiter took our order, we never saw him again. Never came over to ask if we needed refills (which is necessary since the food is spicy) and didn't get everything we ordered. Pointed it out to the waiter, but still never got our guacamole and they still tried to charge me for it. Also, my wife had to carry her plate to the cashier just to get her leftovers boxed since the waiter just dropped the check off as he ran by.  If the service was even decent, I would be a frequent customer, but because the service was so bad, I won't go back again.Definitely not a fan. The food was so so. Not worth the price IMO. The service was also extremely lackluster. For a Sunday night with only 2 tables it sure did take an awfully long time for our food to come out. Our appetizers also came out after our entrees. My glass was empty about half the time. Even with a groupon I feel like we wasted money by eating here. I would go to PF Changs instead.Bed bugs!!!!!!! Bed bugs. My husband and I had to stay at the Stratosphere until our apt was ready to move in. I was in one room and everything in the bathroom stopped working we were switched to another room. I woke up two days later with what I thought was a rash at the time. I went to quick care and was told that the appeared to be Bed Bug bites. I went back to the room and low and behold there were several Bed Bugs I found. I immediately told the hotel manager and was moved to another room. I made a report with the security. I had bites all over my body that turned into these big dark spots that looked like little rashes. No one never inspected the room while I was there this was done days later. Security took pictures of my body in the new room. I had to buy all these different itch  creams, take all my cloths, bags, luggages, shoes ect to the cleaners to get steamed cleaned and washed because the only way to kill these Bed Bugs are by high heat. Finally risk managment got intouch woth me and said theu had some one come to check it out and it was negative sign of bed begs. I have pictures showing these things. The hotel didnt compensate me for all the money I had to spend to get rid of these bugs they offered me a complimentary dinner at the nasty a** disgusting resturant cafe these people are a fuc****  joke and im still suffing from the incident. This hotel is the fuc**** worst. Please please spend a little extra money and find a better hotel to stay at. The worst hotel in my life.Ive eaten at MANY Thai restaurants, and to me this was a total disappointment. I read the other reviews on here and was eager to try this place out. The portions that they served us were small compared to other restaurants that I've been to. We had the pad Thai and one of they're curries. I thought well their portions might be small but lets give them the benefit of the doubt, all i have to say about the taste is there a dozen more restaurants that i rather eat at. I DO NOT recommend this place at all. Its extremely Americanized, if you've never eaten Thai before you'll love it. But if you have something to compare it to you'll be disappointed!!!!Of all the places in Madison to go out, to eat at, to do anything at, why would you go here? (Especially when there is a line. Seriously.)There is an employee named Marcus who works here. He looks like a younger version of Charles Manson and is very rude. One day, he kicked me out of the store just because I walked in with a backpack and threatened me not to come back. I did contact the manager about him, but he never replied back, As far as I know they both still work there and I am boycotting this location until they are fired.One of the filthiest dirtiest casinos I have ever been inside. This hotel is so off my list I can not explain it ! The casino floor was so filthy dirty, empty drink glasses all over the place, full ashtrays everywhere, disgusting machines so dirty that you do not want to touch the buttons. When I asked the floor "key" person, he simply shrugged and said, "you can go anywhere you want, why do you come here if you do not like it?" Seriously- the bathrooms are so dated, you actually have to flush your own toilet, imagine that ! The bathrooms were also very filthy dirty, no one had been around them for a while, most were dilapidated of toilet paper or seat covers. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME at this hotel !The front desk just called and said we were using too many towels! They said we can have three sets, yet the reservation was made for my wife and three little kids in a large room. We had asked for enough towels for each one of us--five sets. 

I've never encountered this kind of pettiness in a hotel. Never! And I've stayed in many, many on business. 

With all the choices in Vegas hotels, why would I ever come back here? I recommend the Venetian or Paris, where I've had great experiences.ugggggggggggggggggghhhhh... I will never visit this place again!!!!

1- You are on the complete opposite side of the strip
2- they are still charging a crazy amount per night
3- The rooms are old, and make me want to sleep in my car.

The hotel is very old. I did not have the best experience there. I had to call room servicer to have them change my sheets. They were not clean. I dont recomend this place at all.

But on a bright side i will give the buffett a 5 stars. I keep telling myself tht if i go back to Vegas i will visti their buffett. You pay I believe $15 or $16 per person all you can eat. But they have a pasta buffett where they will cook you chicken, shrimp, with any kind of pasta i personally loved it this must of been the best thing about the entire trip. The buffett highly recomended. To stay, defenitley find else where.Stayed here when I was 18 & it was great! The location on the strip is still good but 10 years later the hotel still looks the same :/ It's outdated & hello no working WiFi is totally unexceptable!!! The whole weekend we were frustrated trying to get some kind of Internet service! It was just horrible! 
Also our reservation was wrong & they gave us two handicap rooms with one bed instead of regular two queens in them. They did bring a cot to each room but that was not what was reserved! They offered us the choice to swap into the correct rooms in the morning but when we called @ 11 am they said rooms wouldn't be available until maybe as late as 4pm. We gave up since we weren't going to just wait around to move. We wanted to go have fun...which we did! 
Had a blast as always in Sin City but definitely would not stay @ Monte Carlo again!Saw Zumanity last week. Was underwhelmed as my expectation bar of a Cirque de Solei-branded show was set pretty high. As one of the other commenter's said, this was more of a cheesey burlesque revue than an dazzling acrobatic performance. 

When we bought our tickets (from Ticketmaster), I was only given seats on the side of the stage that were "best available" and cost the same as the seats n the front. 

TIP: DONT BUY SEATS ON THE SIDE - THE SET IS STAGED FOR FRONT VIEWING ONLY.The Mirage.  Where should I start?   When my wife and I checked in on Thursday night we were told that they upgraded us to a room with a great view.  Yeah an amazing view of the roof.  After calling the front desk they moved us to a different room,  this room does have a better view.  After getting into the room I have realized that the A/C, will not cool the room below 72°.  Then yesterday I went to get in the shower and the handle came off the wall in my hand.  Are you kidding me!  With the prices you pay in Vegas I at least expect a A/C that will freeze me out and the ability to take a shower with out having to schedule for maintain to do repairs.

I would strongly rethink I ng staying here if you have thought about it.This place is horribly overrated.  Service was terrible.  They act like they don't want you there.  It took 45 minutes between the first course and the main entree for the food to come out and not once did any waiter come by to check on the table.  Do not go.  Plenty of other great steakhouses in Vegas.The rooms are ok.  Seems higher up you get a better room.  Be warned...the staff will tell you one thing and you may get something entirely different.  We were told a strip view but ended up with a east view looking down Tropicana.  The room was clean and we had plenty of towels and such.

In a large hotel like this, you're definitely treated like a number and that's the way they make you feel.  Typical for the huge hotels in Vegas.  So sad actually because their prices are extremely high for what you get and the service you get.  Which is poor.

The room and floor attendants were excellent.

The pool is very very nice.  Go strip down to your swimsuits and enjoy the hot sun by the water.  Cocktail!  : - )

I don't recommend you do Valet parking if you don't have to.  The wait to get your vehicle on check out time is absolutely incredible.  I'm glad we didn't do valet as they suggested.  The walk from the parking structure is a long ways to the elevators to the rooms.  Security is constantly patrolling all the floors on the parking structure.  They get around pretty quickly on the bicycles.

I've seen the KA show now 5 times.  This last time...on July 17th...I was totally let down.  What a poor cast and poor performance.  I've never seen such a pathetic group of performers in the previous 4 shows.  What happened to this show and the previous cast!  DO NOT GO SEE KA!  For the money, we, the customer expect performance.  Something that makes you go.....aaawwww!  Wow!  I was actually furious at what I was watching.  What a let down to the key performers that were still there like the Mexican guys on the wheel.  They're consistently good.  More on this part of the review later.  I want my money back!  Jerks! to you Cirque du Soliel for a poor job!  You guys should know better and now it appears you're taking advantage of the general public by placing less experienced performers on the stage.  I'll address that with Cirque separately.  Not letting this go for the money I spent.

Although, the rooms were clean and safe...I just can't get past giving this hotel more than one star.  There's a few little things they can do to make this experience so much more for their guests.  Too bad more of the customers don't demand more for their money.

Too bad for MGM.For some reason they did not have my reservation that I paid for through Amex. They blamed Amex, Amex blamed them. At the end of the day, I paid and got a room but they took no responsiblity or even tried to make it better. No customer service, the people were mostly rude. The only nice person there was at the buffet. An ok buffet if you like buffets... but over all, this place is out dated. If Joel Robuchon was not there, I would not bother going there at all.  So many other great hotels to try at around the same place. My sister stayed across the street at the Tropicana and that place was way more updated than MGM and at a better price.Door was nearly impossible to open, key card never worked on the first try, light was broken in the room.We did NOT stay at this hotel.  We came in strictly to do two attractions, the CSI Experience and the CBS Television City Research Center.  Upon walking in we were overpowered with the stench of bad cologne vs massengil douche in the air.  Initially I thought this was a hotel perfume counter gone bad inside one of the shops, but I never walked out of the cloud.  It followed me all the way through the hotel, into the attraction, and in fact, was still on my clothes hours later.  

If you have any kind of sensitivity to scents, you will want to avoid this place for lodging, dining or attractions.  Rather than gambling here, you would be better off just giving your money to the oodles of homeless outside the place in the walkwaI've not been back to Las Vegas since 2002 in February, it wasn't due to a lack of interest just that it isn't a place I would take the kids, so we decided to not travel back so often... more then 8 years later the experience was less then grand and that was largely due to Treasure Island, which is not a treasure at all. The Manager at the front desk who listened to my complaints was kind enough to look around as I explained what I was displeased with; even looked at his cell phone a couple of times. The front desk manager was a younger guy, round in face and body with dark hair; he was the perfect example of someone who should be washing dishes or taking out the garbage because very simply he should NOT interact with other people. My complaints were about how we were greeted, to our room and continued on to the general attitude of all the staff. In every store we went employees were constantly checking their cell phones, not really listening to you or treating you with an "oh great an interruption to our conversation just walked in." I was surprised that the Manager had the same attitude, when I informed him that I would not ever return to his hotel, he simply stated he would give us a comp to The Coffee Shop or Buffet to our choice but didn't have much else to say. I was encouraged to go speak to managers of the different areas of the hotel I had issue with, but that was it. Please see my reviews of the other locations within the hotel. 

The hotel Lobby - No sign or indication where to check in, but the "Check Out" counter was HUGE and the first thing you see when you enter... I guess that is because people are more encouraged to leave this establishment then enter. Stale smoke was in the air, every staff member sighed, looked at their phones and tried to get you to leave quickly... for us it meant we had to return because we received the wrong package, and when we informed them we were told we couldn't be helped and we had to go to the Mystere counter and they would have not just our appropriate 2 free buffet tickets but our Mystere tickets, of course they took back the initial package they gave us with the 2 for 1 buffet and Cocktails. Our room was clean, the staff who cleaned was nice, anyone of them should have been promoted to manager, we were in room 6073. 

While at the Blackjack table, they increased the dollar amount while I was at it, later I found out when a table is empty they lower the minimum then increase it as soon as 1-3 people sit down, and at one point I needed to hit a cash machine and informed if I left I would lose my lower Minimum. I was lucky to see the cocktail waitress once an hour, and she would either get orders or drop off drinks, not both at the same time. So if she was dropping drinks off at the table and someone tried to order she said "No, I will be back" and she'd come back maybe 20min later. One of the dealers who was at the table though nice had a bit of a superior attitude and kept informing two British men who were playing that she deserved a tip, and would take a portion of their winnings and declare "That's yours this is mine" and pop it in her tip box, although they didn't protest to it never in a million years would I have put up with that. She didn't try it on anyone else, but it certainly wasn't appropriate. The amenities at the TI (Treasure Island) are nil, there are 4 places to eat that I saw, a costume jewelry store, Mystere (which has to be the worst Cirque Du Solei show I have ever seen (and I've seen 3 others which I loved). If I go back to Vegas I would NEVER return to this hotel, and I would also mention that most of the hotels now are owned by the same companies, which means there is no competition; if you stay at one and have a bad experience they just expect you'll stay at another they own. The TI is horribly located, has no real redeeming features and the staff from the front door, servers, bar tenders, restaurants all the way to the manager would rather ignore you then show you that they're pleased you chose to have a vacation in their establishment.If you like poor customer service with cheesy gimmicks (buffet coupons that don't work the nights you are staying, resort fees, and customer service that is too overworked to care, then this is the hotel for you!  From check-in through check-out, you will find long lines for registration a pool that is crowded and closes way too early, 7pm when it is 90 degrees outside! 

The only saving grace of this hotel is the poker room and the location, but far better hotels can be found for similar prices.This is by far my worse hotel stay-horrible customer service, old and disgusting rooms and elevators that don't work. In fact we got stuck in one! The restaurants are slow and their system always seems to be broken so they could not give us our bill! But by far the worse is the location of the shuttle pick-up. Impossible to find because its in the back in a creepy alley where it feels like you will get shot or robbed. No one knows anything or can answer questions. Basically ruined my vegas experience.For someone that says they are food allergy friendly they seem to be doing a terrible job. I have a really severe egg allergy and a gluten intolerance. After waiting 30+ minutes for our food it arrived, with bread, and mayonnaise. Seriously?? 2 out of the 3 dishes were just totally wrong. 

Our server apologized and told us in all of the time he had been there he had never had that problem. I accepted and prepared to wait again. 

When they brought out our food finally, it was wrong again. My chicken with apples and brie? No brie. Also a giant silver server of mayonnaise, again. 

At this point I was about to have a full on panic attack. I got about two bites in and realized that my food was cold. Since it was wrong initially I assume it sat in the window while everyones elses was remade. There was no way I was going to be able to comfortably eat this, since they clearly did not take food allergies seriously. 

They did apologize profusely and took a big chunk of the bill off, but it was the worst restaurant we went to for the 5 days we were in Vegas, we will never be back. 

I wouldn't leave such a harsh review if they hadn't told us from my initial phone call before our trip, and when we sat down at the table, that they took food allergies seriously and were more than capable of handling it. 

They need to go back over the system they have in place because it is not working.This is by far the worse hotel ever. We arrived and our room was dirty. The Flamingo isn't the nicest hotel but I expect a clean room. I told the front desk woman (Fran) and she didn't seem to care. The manager Frank gave us a free upgrade. The room he gave looked exactly the same as the dirty room. I called to tell him because I thought it was an error but he said the room has the same decor and its a few inches bigger. What happened to a good old fashion upgrade to a nicer room? They even offered additional days for more than the original reservation. Nice! By the way we used to go there every year for a basketball tournament. I will never ever stay here again. You get what you pay for at the Flamingo on the Strip.This hotel is in dire need of a refurb.  I was pleased to walk up and only wait in line 3 minutes to check in at 11:30 a.m.  Well, I now know why.  First, they charge an early check in fee.  I was in the hotel industry for 10 years and this was my first experience with such a thing.  To avoid this $28 early check in fee, I was given the option of paying $30 to upgrade to their hip "GO" rooms over their substandard rooms.  I say substandard, cause the last time I stayed in one, I wouldn't walk on the carpet barefoot.  Needless to say, the upgrade wasn't worth $30.  Holes in the lamp shades, burnt out bulbs through out the room, an ironing board the was bent and contorted to the point of uselessness, closet doors with broken latches so they wouldn't stay closed, a rattling air conditioner that never cooled the room colder than 74 degrees no matter the temp it was set on and the topper, a testing of their Emergency Life System over the loud speakers at 7:04 a.m.  

By the way, did I mention I was staying there for free besides the $30 I paid for the "GO" room?  I won't be staying there again for $30 or for free.  Oh yea, I just found that they charged my credit card $103 for something.  That should be fun phone call.

This place is a dump...At Vegas for the first time and although I foresee and thoroughly expect rudeness,degenerates and blatant alcoholics to come my way; I have never experienced such rudeness as I have literally JUST experienced from a customer service attendant( to whom I asked a simple question; " where can I find the restroom". ) to which she responded, " I'm pointing at it, can't you read, it says "" restroom""", to which I responded " oh I'm sorry, I've never been here, so you could've just said " around the corner and to the right". 

Vegas is designed to distract you from EVERYTHING, plus, you're given comp drink for gambling. I'm sorry if I've been enjoying my vacation. How about just say, " hey, it's down this hall and to the right." I'll find it eventually. 
No need to insult me or my intelligence because I am far more sober than most of these people. 
The end. Thank you. 

"Norma" was her name. Avoid her.Stay Away from this hotel!!!  I promise that you will regret it.   As we arrived to the hotel we had a bell boy help bring up our luggage to the room.   finding out a day later some of our stuff were stolen and of course the hotel did not do anything about it.   It always take almost 5 mins just to get an elevator.   The carpet in the room was really sticky!!!  It was so gross.   Customer service really sucked.   I am telling you right now stay away....   pay an extra 20 bucks more to go else where.I second the person who thinks that the hotel should be renamed the Suxor.

Yeesh, for the money they charge for a room this hotel didn't have -anything- on Motel 6.  The costumer service was TERRIBLE.  Massive lines to check in. We had to switch rooms because the Pyramid room we got first was falling apart.  Seriously, falling apart.  (laundry list of craptastic-ogasmic-ickiness: shower faucet handle pulled out from wall, AC filter on floor under AC,  TV remote did not work, TV had missing buttons, no wireless despite advertising wireless.)

Dingy, Dirty, Dilapidated, Destitute.

I've stayed in many a nice hotel over the years.  This was not one of them.

By the way, if you've ever wanted to find out what it's like to live in Orwell's 1984 the posters of Carrot Top everywhere have that creepy Big Brother feel to them.  No matter where you are in the hotel our benevolent dictator Carrot Top stares down upon us.  All is double plus good at the Luxor when Carrot Top is around.   He is our benevolent leader and shall prevail in the war against our enemies Eastasia and Eurasia (Mandalay Bay and Paris respectively.)  The Ministry of Great Customer Service provides for all.   Less rations this year mean more than ever for citizens.  All is double plus good.  The Ministry of Truth  wants to remind you that Inclinators are double plus good and a triumph of the Oceania Ministry of Peace.

FYI should any MGM big wigs ever get their dirty little hands on this review... You've got one of the coolest (and timeless) exteriors on the strip in the Luxor.  An onyx black pyramid is never going to look bad.  Take a clue from the W hotels and make this place feel as cool as the outside of the building looks.  Dump the earth tones, PAY people to maintain the rooms (I know, crazy idea, but apparently customers aren't fans of holes in the wall and broken amenities on $250/night hotel rooms), and lastly, treat your customers like you want them to return.Stayed here on a business trip. I took off a star because there is no in room Wi-Fi. Then I took off the the rest of the stars because there is no in room Wi-Fi. How is there no Wi-Fi? Also the water pressure in the shower was pretty weak.For 4 months I've been going back and forth with Mandalay fighting their $43.24 AND $21.01 double charge on my credit card for the in-room Grey Goose bottle (which I NEVER touched) and resort fee, respectively. 

These jerks disputed my claim against them by sending my credit card company a receipt for these charges...um, ok? Like a receipt process anything? 

How about you look at the fact that none of the overpriced drinks and foods in the snack console was ever handled??? (I know that the slightest touch signals the sensors so we just stay away from it completely). Or how about you look at my original purchase and prepaid resort fee from Expedia?

I HATE YOU MANDALAY BAY, YOU CROOKS! wasting my time trying to get this fixed and STILL trying to resolve (I'm literally on hold with Amex as I type).I'd just like to start off by saying I came to Vegas celebrating my birthday with a large group of family this past weekend. We had heard great things about this restaurant and since we were staying at the Hard Rock hotel, we figured, why not? Arriving to the hotel from a long drive, my group and I were beyond hungry. As expected at a restaurant on a Friday night, we did expect a wait to get seated and for the food to take some time. First off, we had waited about forty-five minutes to more than an hour to receive our food. But before receiving any plates on the table, we had asked our waitress how much longer we had before our food came out. No reply or acknowledgment. The waitress ignored at least three of my cousins who asked and walked away. We kept waiting with our growling tummies until another cousin of mine walked in to ask another waitress. That same waitress spoke to her manager and from reading the manager's lips, he said "fuck it." Whatever that meant, it confused some of us. Soon after, another waitress who apparently was a manager herself barged in to our sitting area to check out what the issue was. We told her and responded with, "Smile, youre in Vegas.... bitch." Regardless whether you're in Vegas, New York City or Los Angeles, there is no need to wait over an hour for mediocre food. Or to even receive that type of attitude/service. Mind you, when the food was finally sent out, it tasted as if they warmed it up in the microwave. End of story, horrible service, mediocre food, poor management. Pink taco needs to step it up, "you're in Vegas!"I was going to rate them with two stars till I went back to my hotel at the Embassy Suites and got a better free margarita than what I just paid top dollar at Pink Taco.  The food was half a step above Chili's. I hate Chili's!  Hard rock is supposed to be a cool place to visit.  One really cool thing is good food.  They missed the mark big time.  Stale corn chips with salsa is a crime.  We may need to get Gordon Ramsey to do an emergency kitchen nightmares.  It's all about the basics.  Bacon wrapped jalapeños sounded great but missed the mark.  Chili  reallano was a big chunk of greasy cheese.  Not good. Will never go back.Food is blah and Waaaaay overpriced!

Service: good, but our head waiter was a talker. I would like to start eating my food before it gets cold, thank you. However, very knowledgeable about the food and prompt with refilling the water.

*BEWARE if you order the "FLAT" water, they charge $7 per bottle of water (and the bottles don't carry very much water)

Food: Had the Croque Madam, it was not seasoned at all and they used A LOT of butter.  It ended up being a big pile of soggy mush with a hint of ham.  Also had the French Onion Soup, which was very good (only because I LOVE Gruyère cheese), but still overpriced at $9 for a cup.  Also tried my friend's Mac and Cheese Gratin, where's the Cheese??? It was REALLY creamy and soggy, but I couldn't detect any cheese whatsoever.

The Bill: We came in a large group of 8 so they automatically tacked a %20 service charge on there, fine.  But with a closer examination of the check, they also tacked on a $40 RESTAURANT FEE!?!?!? So they're charging us just to eat here? WTF?

F YOU BOUCHON, F YOU!Went to this restaurent with the family while we were in town to see Phantom of the Opera. The service was quite good. However, the dishes tasted nothing like French. I ordered the Chichen. My wife the lamb. My dish was way too salty. My wife complained that her lamb was very bland, over-cooked (she asked for medium rare), and tough. My kid's Croque Monsieur came with a huge pile of fries, which was also way over-salted. It seems the chef got his or her salt for free and would not hesitate to use it liberally. Overall, it was a big disappointment after reading the good reviews.This place gets decent reviews from other people...maybe the time I went was an anomaly, I'm not sure.

Anyway, I did not have dinner there, I was only there for clubbing. It was so dead it wasn't even funny. I would say the place was 30% full on the Saturday night I went. Later I was chatting with a local at another club and she told me that place used to be HOT but it's so bad now they should just shut it down (the club part).Walked to entrance and there was no one there, no one eating and just didn't seem warm at all. Maybe if I was at spa this place might have been appealing.This place is not good at all.  I was there last weekend and let me just say there are plenty of other late night options in vegas.
I would even rather go to a fast food place.  

I was here with a few friends and the service was horrible and the food we ordered didn't taste right or just looked weird...like the chicken in the salad that a friend ordered.  As for my corn beef and hash, it came out warm-cold and was too salty.

I have no clue what was wrong, but the waiter kept telling us it was the grave yard shift chefs that were the cause of our problems. 

Also, my friend got sick from his salad.  To be fair we were in vegas and it could have been the alcohol, but I have my doubts.What a fucking joke.  This place sucked.

First off, they rope off every section in the damn place so you only have access to the bar and the 20x20(ish) foot dance floor.

Apparently you have to spend a lot of money for bottle service to even be allowed to sit down on a seat.

On a good note, the bathroom was like a drug store.  The ladies inside were VERY nice and had every fragrance, soap, drugstore item available that you could ever need!

Oh, and they were charging me (per my receipt) $14 for a premium Martini + $3 Martini Bump.  WTF is that?  I was paying $17 for a Belvedere Martini.  What a joke... and I don't think they were really even giving me Belvedere.  I woke up with a headache which NEVER happens when I'm REALLY drinking B.

Ladies were free to get in on Sunday night, Men were $25Pure sucks. Pretentious + Claustrophobic + Over-hyped. The dance floor is way too small. The lounge is way too big. I can't go 3 seconds without somebody bumping into me. Yuck. Go somewhere else. See how many times you can count their name all over the walls. Ugh...This place is 100% authentic.....if your standard of authenticity permits the use of Oscar Meyer hot dogs in a German restaurant.

I can't believe people think this place is good. I remember going there with a friend. I started off with a German salad. It sucked. I felt like I was eating a turd salad. When I received my entree, we both kind of looked at my plate and my friend acknowledged before I could say anything that it was indeed a hot dog that had been placed on my plate instead of a German sausage as advertised.

I ended up tossing the hot dog at the wall.

This place will definitely satisfy your desires if you're wanting to experience a bunch of loud, annoying drunk people pretending they're in Germany. What's that? Oh, you have a giant glass boot filled with beer? You better chug that down as fast as you can without breathing!

I bet this place has to employ a full-time barf cleaner for all the times people drink themselves sick, not to mention the people who throw up after finding out they ate an Oscar Meyer hot dog filled with chicken beaks and pig assholes.

And as I recall, the entree was rather expensive. You can save yourself a lot of money and have the same meal if you just go to the supermarket, buy a pack of hot dogs, warm them up in the microwave and dip them in mustard. And don't forget to play some annoying German music and sing "ziggy zaggy ziggy zaggy oy oy oy".Run.  Run quickly over to NYNY and get a slice of pizza rather than waste your money here.  Hubby and I got a deal thru tix4tonight and decided to try this buffet.  Mistake.  I didn't think it was possible to mess up mashed potatoes-HA....they did.  Disgusting.   I'm not one to waste food but I cannot eat this.
Run away guys.  I am still at the table while writing this, that's how vested I am in saving in you from repeating our mistake.I was at The Buffet and was happy as always..I love buffet and heard this was the best one in las vegas.  So a  me and a few friends waited in line for almost 2 hrs before getting into The Buffet.  Excited like a little kid in a candy store until a friend found a worm in the food.. YES a worm and it was trying to make a run for it.  The worm was still moving on his plate of food.  All of us stopped eating and report this to one of the worker hoping they would do something about it. The only thing they did was said the manger is busy and for us to take our money and leave.  So to cut thing short no way me or my friends will eat there again.  My friend record the worm moving on the plate and yes it will be on youtube and face book.  Can believe Bellagio would allow something like that to happen and do nothing about it..SO SAD!!!!!Richard Pro here with another review. I've had extensive experience dining at Las Vegas buffets for the past seven years.

Back when this hotel was Aladdin, the buffet was unbelievable. You'll see outside when you line up all the awards the buffet has won. Sadly, this is all in the past. The buffet today at Planet Hollywood is awful and nothing compared to before. The dim lighting had always been a turn off to me, but the food used to be so amazing and unique that I had to come here every time. Now I don't make any stops at this buffet during my annual trip to Vegas in December.

Taste and variety leave much to be desired. Food here used to taste like it was made by a real chef. Now the food tastes like something anyone can make. 

One star. I hate how the buffet began as king, the best on the Strip, and transformed into a place with terrible food.What huge disappointment thankfully we used a groupon and only paid half. Everything overcooked Best part was the all u can drink. I'd say full love no thank u. Hell half isn't even worth it. If u ask me go somewhere else def not worth the wait. Plus staff horrible some old guy fell and no staff member seemed even concernedThis was my first Cirque show, and we went so long ago.  This show traumatized me so much that it took me 6 years before I could watch another (O)!  I hate how other people in the audience pretend to enjoy watching clowns or whatever bouncing on big inflatable balls or understand the "story" line, which I believe is non-existent.  

The one star is because it was slightly entertaining due to bottles of wine consumed just prior to the show...I'm confused, but amazed at the same time. I loved it, and hated it at the same time too. I am conflicted. 

The people were amazing. I can't believe they did some of the things they did. True athletes. 

The problem: I was lost like I didn't know if I should be getting something or if I was missing it. To many buff men getting to friendly with other buffed men scared me a bit. Some of the costumes were also hard to look at. 

In all seriousness. It was awesome and am very glad I got to see a Cirque show in Vegas. Next time, the Beatles.  This overall was a dissapointment and waste of money (see the confliction) ..... thus, one star and I can't recommend it to anyone and would never go to it again myself.Good music and nice interior but horrrrrrible security staff. Super rude and pushy. Nowhere to stand without getting yelled at to keep walking.. Unless you drop $2000 on a table good luck getting treated like a regular person. Wouldn't go back after how I was yelled at for not moving fast enough away from "VIP" sections.. Guess I'm to regular chicagoan for all these bottles and bullshit. Ps dont bother with a package. We did and it wasn't worth the 1 hr open bar considering the shitty ass treatment we got..So here's the deal. I upgraded to the suite this weekend with the thought that it would be nice to spend some downtime in the room. What I've discovered is that they charge, a lot, for everything. Want to keep beverages cool? $35 per night for a mini fridge. Want coffee in your room? $4 per keurig cup. Who charges for in room coffee?

Rooms are average and the tower location is away from all the hotel amenities which are located at the Mandalay tower. I really regret "upgrading" and wish I was in a smaller, cheaper room in the Mandalay Tower. 

I do not recommend THE Hotel.Wasn't like it used to be. I had the nutella crepe. It was crispy instead of soft and pillowy. I'm surprised to say that there was too much nutella to crepe ratio. Banana was fresh. Whipped cream was awesome as before. It's not the same as it used to be.see Love instead, O is highly overrated.  Would never see it again even at half price.Huge disappointment.  Years ago Caesar's Place had one of the best Buffets in town.  You can image my surprise to find how small it has become now.  They did have frozen crab legs, prime rib and turkey but that was about all they had.  The salad and side selection was very thin.  You can get a nice meal in one of the other restaurants for about the same price.Caesar's Palace is a world known hotel & casino. Now it is known as the worst and most disappointing buffet in Las Vegas, Nevada.  The selection is very small. What is served is not top notch but quality of a Hometown Buffet for $30 per person.

Why would anyone go to Cafe Lago Buffet?  Because the allure of Caesar's Palace first class aura.  Don't be fooled and lied to by employees who post here.  Lagos will disappoint and insult you for paying for what you will never get.  Service is Off and On.  Undependable.  I was warned and did not believe. Now I know that I will not recommend this POS in Caesar's Palace.  You can dress a dog and make it stand on it's hind legs but it is still a dog.  Apologies to all dogs but not about Cafe Lago Buffet. 

Lago is all about the con games played out.  Bring you in and flip you for being a fool.  So don't be fooled. Go anywhere but here at Lago Buffet and be happy, not sad.  I'm serious!What an incredible disappointment !!! A few months ago I purchased an auction item for St Jude's children's hospital , it featured 2 nights in a Luxury suite at this "hotel"...
With breakfast etc... I live  in Los Angeles  and as an active member of  The charity it seemed right to bet on this deal and come visit my Vegas friends, I invited  the manager of a CVS pharmacy, the CEO of a major Coaching company, and a lactation expert in a Summerlin famous hospital, along with 3 ,17 years old ....their kids...A very civilized and educated group of people who came to have Thai food with us in the Tuscany suite of 2000 sq feet with a large dining  table that seemed to be " inviting"....in Any case after 20 min in our dinner , as civilized and normal as could be , 9.20pm someone knocks at that door , my husband sees those 2 men, one claiming he received several complaints from guests about us making too much noise to which all of our faces dropped !! How could it BE? Were we in the famous Las Vegas on a Sunday night November 10th  ?? No School on the 11th right ? only chewing our foods and laughing here and there to our friends jokes. By the way they all intended to go back to their respective beautiful homes early (and  decoration-wise much prettier than that overdone Rococo suite) .... I think that this pretentious hotel thought we planned on ALL  sleeping there ! What a joke! They kept on coming back and the 3rd time planned on getting my non-registered guests outside the room cause they were now 6 men, 2 of them in yellow plastic suits claiming to be security ! My friends and I  took our phone and started filming ,which immediacy calmed them down ... I forgot to say that we are a group of 50 year old people and our kids were there NO WE MADE NO NOISE!!!! A DINNER that left such a bitter taste to my life after my guests heard twice they will be asked to leave!!! We all left!!!
 I feel that The Green Valley Ranch is the worst experience I ever had.... Very disappointing to look forward to a nice and relaxing 3 days week end in a "luxury " hotel and get a very angry little man, telling us to behave or else .....  It is the first time in my entire long life that I have been subject to such a treatment.
I have been a fan of the red rock hotel for a long time and stayed at the top floor suite for events, and parties  ,many times ,This really does not reflect right on the owners of the stations nor to their commitment to their guests.

And guess what... I left a message at the very apologetic reception desk asking for a follow up from someone different than the angry power tripping man in charge that night (after all I left  after 5 hours instead of 3 days )

No news.....!



.
.All the clubs at encore & wynn are beautiful.......but that's about it, the poor customer service , attitude of the employees that work there is outrageous. I'm surprised they allow them to run the place in this manner treating guests the way the do. They have treated my friends and I completely unprofessional in multiple occassions. They act like the place it's the big deal, when you go inside it smells and the music is terrible!  Doormen are completely incompetent and totally lazy. I avoid all these clubs at all cost, they  will put a sour note on your night, will much rather go to tao, marquee or blue martini anytime.We were invited to a great night at a private table paid for by a great company, then we were denied to go in when we were placed in the wrong line (all 6 of us). I tried to have the bouncer help us find our party, but was denied. We had to leave, & the company that we were to meet lost our business. It was a terrible experience due to poor service provided by the bouncers that were unprofessional and wouldn't take the extra step to help us find our group that had paid to meet with us for what would have been the beginning of a great new business opportunity. Don't go to this place to try and impress clientele, the company lost our business & so did Wynn. I will never refer any friends, family or associates to go to this place...ever! This place was degrading  & embarrassing, please don't go there. They were so rude to us! Respectfully...Concerned Business MgmtOutside of the view . . . well it is just too contrived.  Given the pricing I would expect more . . . like maybe a table cloth . . . like maybe if you sell me a beefsteak tomato salad how about some beefsteak tomatoes . . . not grape tomatoes, not yellow hot house tomatoes and hey how about some reasonable blue cheese . . . instead of the minimal square of lifeless shit portrayed as blue cheese.  The steak, bone-in ribeye, was decent although dry aged . . . for how long 2 hours . . .  well at least the sauteed mushrooms met my minimum standard

Completely disturbingly unsatisfying . . . 

In my week of extremes . . . $6.00 lunches versus $90.00 dinners sans drinks . . . well the truth is the lunches crushed the food at VooDoo  . . . poor pretentious bastards.

OMG . . . was I that brutal . . . and it was not even a real estate company . . . Well, IT SUCKED . . . but the view was outstanding  but the view is better taking off from the airport and a flight between Vegas and Southern California can be had for less cash.Worst bar ever! Bouncers were rude and mean. They were pushy and just nasty. The cigarette smoke was so bad and the security staff were busy smoking and shoving into people spilling Payton's drinks. And it was not crowded inside. We ordered one beer and couldn't leave fast enough. Don't waste your time, money, and lungs in this horrible overrated bar!!!  Yuck. Took three showers to get the smoke out of my body/hair. Clothes wreaked.Stopped in a couple Saturday's ago for brunch. The place wasn't that busy and we were seated immediately. Our server came over with water for the table and asked if we would like something else to drink. I ordered o.j and my girlfriend got a bloody Mary. After about 10 min the server came back to take our order for food and I asked about the drinks. He said he would go grab them after he took our order. 10-15 min after placing our food order we not only had not received our drinks but now our water was gone. Finally the drinks arrived with the food. Upon asking for our water to be refilled the server gave a grunt like i was bothering him!? The food was "ok". Not great but also not terrible. There are many other places I can go and spend my money and get much better service and food! This is a place I will not be visiting again. Ok food but terrible serviceOh my god!
What a complete shithole this place is!
It wasn't my choice to stay here,but I figured for 3 days,it couldn't be all that bad.
I don't mind if a hotel is older,a bit run down and such as long as the rooms are clean,stuff works the way it's supposed to and it's relatively safe.
I'm not moving in,just laying my head down for a little bit.
So I'm not all that picky when it comes to random short term hotel stays.(which explains my lack of hotel reviews here...)
Let's begin...
The place is in downtown Las Vegas as opposed to the newer,glitzier "strip".
It's anchors the "Fremont Experience"which is overrun by pickpockets,pimps and pushers.
Into the hotel we go....
Check in process. We get in line behind 2 other people waiting.The one clerk is slower than ice cubes freezing and the other one sees the line getting longer by my arrival.
So what does he do?
Closes his window,that's what!
So now it's just the one extra slow guy.
We're on line waiting when an entrepeneur(read shady looking character eyeing up the luggage)enters and trys to see what the pickins are.
Security starts to eye him as he's eyeing my luggage.
I start to eye security as they're eyeing the eye guy.
Eye guy decides to go eye someone else,and I slowly make my way to actually check in.
The elevator ride is interesting as some guy tries to explain to me that the hotel stole a thousand dollars of his and so now he's asking me for money....Yeah,no.
I get to my room,and it's a decent size with a decent view of a dismal Fremont Street.
It did seem clean enough though.No bullet holes or blood spatters so we're ahead of the game on that level at least.
The shower doesn't work in any legitimate way.It took about 20 minutes to get the water to not be scorching hot.
No fridge in the room which means I'll have to get back on the elevator more frequently than I care to for perishables.
The first day,there's a stabbing in the garage.
The victim bled to death on a colleague's car,and his car got impounded as evidence.
The second day there,another colleague got his wallet stolen by a pickpocket in the hotel.
The same day,someone had a purse snatched from the casino.
So much for security...
The next day,homeless folks wandered into a hospitality suite for the event I was attending(which was on the 23rd floor)to partake of he buffet and ask for money from varoius attendees.
Later that day,I was getting into an elevator with a security guy who was saying into his walkie talkie that he was going to room such and such for a "wellness check"...
Anyone in "the business"knows that means what he will find is anything but "well".
So on my way back down about an hour later,the bag and taggers are removing the dead body from that "wellness check "room.
Yep,the same security guy was in the elevator and even let me get on with him,the morgue boys and the deceased complete in body bag.
Fine customer service right there!He was so thoughtful to not have me wait for the next available elevator...
I travel a lot and sometimes it's not to the most haute destinations,but rarely have I found myself in such surroundings.
I will not be going back to The Plaza Hotel anytime soon.Next time, light some candles and play Marvin Gaye before you screw me.

I've been here before, but for some reason I decided to give it another chance.  Kind of like that ex-boyfriend who dumps you but then happens to call you out of the blue when his friends are visiting (he wants to show them he's dating someone really cool) and tells you to wear heels and a short dress and then introduces you as his trophy GIRLFRIEND but dumps you AGAIN when his friends fly back home and you end up feeling even WORSE than when he dumped you the FIRST time.  

Phew, you catch that?!

Anyhoo... this is the second time that the hostess wouldn't seat us outside when all of the tables were available.  Pretentious waitstaff, rubbery pizza, wilted salad, tasty bread (but they'll only bring you one piece, so grab a big one from the basket), prices in line with the area but NOT justified by the lack of quality fare.

I should have learned my lesson the first time.  

--end rant--

The espresso bean gelato was delicious.To begin; The only reason I gave them 1 star, because if you want to wright a review on yelp you have to give them a star. My wife and I,  wanted to try a new buffet. We always preferred going to the Excalibur buffet. 

Guys, its really expensive and the food is not that great. To be honest, there was nothing that i actually liked. Most of the food was cold and very mediocre, hometown buffet or even the salad bar at sizzler is way better than this buffet. The pasta bar was not good at all. They had meet ball with marinara and the meet balls tasted very funky. I do have to say the desserts where just OK. Like the carrot cake was dry and they put to much orange zest, it actually made the cake taste like and orange cake instead of a carrot cake. I do have to say that the service was really good, Sandra our server was very attentive of us, bringing drinks and picking up or dirty plates. 

So in conclusion, just go some where else. I mean honestly there's a lot of buffets in Las Vegas specially on the strip. Sorry Wynn buffet, but you guys really need to re- analyze your buffet cuz the food was not even good.Did I miss something? Was I not supposed to go to their lunch buffet? Because it was horrible. I was looking forward to trying the Wynn buffet ever since hearing about its rave reviews. Unfortunately it did not hold up to our expectations. Yes, it's a very cute and dainty place with its colorful fruit and flower decor. It's well lit and kept clean. The lunch variety was lacking and composed mostly of starches (pizza, pastas, stir fry). I was extremely disappointed. The only thing I thought was good was the noodle soup made to order and their gelato bar. For the money we paid, I was expecting some shrimp cocktail or ceviche. There was none. A bigger issue we came across was the fried chicken. It was inedible. It had no flavor and there was something off with the meat, like a bad after taste. We left unsatisfied and rarely do I ever feel unsatisfied from a buffet in Vegas, because at the end, the dessert bar makes up for it. Unfortunately, their dessert bar was sad as well. Boooooo.What a shame the groupon was the only reason I give it a star to begin with.  The meal cost us nothing but the food was worth nothing to begin with. 

There was no flavor to the sushi and the service was poor.Had a bug in my sake and they did not even care! Saryah was our waitress and although attentive not friendly nor apologetic about the visitor in my drink.... will I go back probably not....2 stars cause the food was good...too bad the service was NOTLet me just say the signage and reservation paperwork is deceiving. You think you starting at the Flamingo, but no its that itty bitty sign near the Flamingo taxi pick up. Then you have dishonest employees that steal your clothing. Two dresses vanished and nobody has a clue.Slow service, it's not efficient, food not amazing. Ain't nobody got time for that! Need to clean there chairsIf you're looking to quickly get in and get out buffet...this is not the place. We have waited almost 1 hour and 30 minutes (on a Monday!). Quite ridiculous. There is 40-50 people in line at a time with only 1-2 cashiers. Staff is not the friendliest and you have to find the manager if you want to make a complaint. They say, "you have to find a worker with a walkie talkie to grab the manager". All in all, even if we can on a groupon deal, we won't be back. Very disappointed in the line system. Not to mention the unapologetic management.The manager in the restaurant speak nothing to us and then no smile ,  the food is ok ,the restaurant is clean but a very bad service ,I can't understand how can u open a restaurant like that and say nothing to your costumerTerrible do not eat here.  For starters the service sucked.  Our waiter came once then disappeared.  After a while another woman took care of us and was kind (the only high point of the experience).  The food advertised on the menu is not what we got. A thick cut slab of bacon was two tiny bits of bacon (for 6 bucks).  The French toast was inedible. When we asked for a manager he was very rude, demeaning and certainly didn't care what we had to say.  I've never had someone so rude at a restaurant and believe me my boyfriend and I were not rude first or demanding anything crazy.  Stay away!  Eat at the creperie down the way and split.As a fellow CheeseSteak Lover, I have to try it when I see it on the menu.

Not a fan here.  First, if you want me to come back, Why do you nickel and dime me as a customer?  That's just bad business.  $15 for my meal?  It's fast food!

Anyway, I'll sum it up...  No thanks.Hello, its called the Pink Taco! Guaranteed to be just a name and not meant for any means of food quality. Hello....anyone getting this pink taco! Not tasty, no, no, no. It would be better if they served sausages and named it slippery dicks!Cheesecake. 


Meh. Looks MUCH better than it tastes! It actually tastes like the plastic container it came in, needless to say it has NO flavor. What a disappointment! I wish I would have kept walking past the glass display case the cheesecakes were in because this cheesecake was not worth the $10 price tag. I would NOT recommend this place based on my cheesecake. I mean, how can you go wrong with this?? Booooo.We heard they played HipHop on Sundays, so we thought we wld try this place out on our last night in Vegas. 

Upon walking up, the "pubber" guys didn't even give me any of the "girls get in free" wristbands (the first place NOT to). Now I consider myself a damn hott female, so i dunno what his excuse was.  Needless to say,  we stand in a hodge-podge of a line. It was total chaos. Of the 5 bouncers no one seemed to have any rhyme or reason behind how they were choosing ppl to "let" in. 
My boyfriend and I stood at the very front of the  line for about 40mins. The bouncer wld choose ppl behind us, next to us...but not us. It wasn't long before I realized that the bouncer was choosing not to let us in & had no plans to anytime soon (unless we tipped him big like others did). 

I also began to think he wasnt letting us in b/c we were black....it's 2011 dude. Get over urself. 

After about 45min we left. It wasn't worth it to me to endure that crap......AND they weren't even playing hiphop #FAiLTheir main goal is to rip you off. They say things like, "if you know anything about cars, you KNOW you've gotta do (insert extra crap here)". I will never go there again; the way they relay their information is like talking to a sleazy salesman.Unless you're below the age of 10 (or are traveling with kids), you will not enjoy the Adventuredome.

It is a waste of time and money.DO NOT GO!!!!  i was involved in an accident there two days ago.  the ride i was on broke in half and came to a violent and sudden stop.  there was 13 people on the ride, most of them small children.  the staff had no idea what to do.  no medical units were sent to check the children or adults.  we were given an attitude when we asked for our money back.  i was then contacted yesterday and they refused to give me any information about the cause of the accident.  i will never go there again, and i will tell everyone that asks about it the same thing!!Terrible experience. Rude staff. Will never again frequent this hotel or anything to do with this hotel. Just tried to go on a simple ride. If you like employees waving their hands in your face as you're taking a picture or showing no concern for you as a customer, then this is the place to go.The General Manager of Krave is an absolute liar, i NEVER hit anyone, nor would i ever do that. It's outrageous for him to post such a defamatory comment.

It was my friend who i admitted in the original review, that hit the girl after she hit him and pushed him.

The General Manager doesn't know a thing, because he wasn't there to witness it nor would he listen to me or my boyfriend tell him what had actually happened. It's appalling to see the General Manager act in such a horrific manner, lying, accusing, and posting information that is just false.i'd give it zero stars if i could but here's why we (yes, all four girls) hated this restaurant.

1) we had breakfast here, not late night food (when the choices are much more limited) so in theory, we CHOSE to eat here out of convenience since we were staying at the signature.

2) we ate at bouchon restaurant (venetian) the morning before, and had incredible - and i mean INCREDIBLE, 5 star worthy breakfast there for the SAME price.

3) the service SUCKED.

4) the COFFEE was the WORST. $3.50 for coffee (they ask you if you want coffee like it's free but it's NOT. I found out after I ordered by looking closely at the menu...if I knew, I would have spent less than that at starbucks for better coffee). They bring you a carafe that I'm assuming can be shared by multiple people because it's refillable but who wants a refill of burnt sand? Not me. I thought they'd charge $3.50 per carafe but no, they charge per mug. We ended up paying $7.00 for coffee that was so disgusting we had to ask for a pitcher of HOT WATER to dilute it and the waitress asked, "Oh, is it for the coffee?" Uh... wow. she KNEW. I bet sooo many other people asked for water to dilute their horrible coffee. I can tell you this much. that nasty coffee was the last thing i consumed in Vegas and it woke the hell out of me. I guess it did its job in a fraction of the usual sips I need (too bad i drink coffee for the taste and not so much for the kick start).

If you are going to eat breakfast, please people. go to bouchon. you won't regret it. get the sausage there. it's sooooo soft and delicious. the french toast is like bread pudding and the ham/cheese/egg sandwich is killer. the mimosa is bomb, too. since i can't give this place zero stars, might as well recommend a better choice (so my job is done).

for late night eatery, i guess you have no choice but to come here. stay away from the coffee.

(for a visual representation of the horrible coffee, I uploaded a pic on my profile page - I'm not mean enough to post it here).This buffet is terrible and terribly expensive. Unless you're just into mass consumption and just want to gorge yourself on the food, you can't get the worth of the meal out of it.  Go to the Bellagio, go to Ceasers, go anywhere but here.  The selection is terrible....

Oh and make sure you don't eat here shortly before going to the airport to catch your red eye.  Disaster will be waiting for you.first off the line to get in here was redic.  LIKE ABSOLUTELY REDIC. full of like very overweight people, old people, families, whatever. (sorry is that too much??) 

our server was SO NICE and he was the happiest guy!  we really liked him! 

the problem was in the kitchen.  my friend ordered an omelet with no cheese, and i ordered a portobello mushroom sandwich.  (easily veganizable, which i liked!) 
first off - the mushroom sandwich came out like 10 mins before the omelet which is always a peeve.  come on send stuff out together, even taco bell sends out a complete order - piecemeal makes everything uncomfortable. 
THEN my friend finally gets the omelet - and its full of cheese.  she has to send it back as she is lactose intolerant.  about 15 mins later (note: i have completely finished MY sandwich at this point) she gets a new omelet - IT HAD A HUGE HAIR IN IT.  LIKE A HUGE BLACK HAIR.  we were DYING.  but she was also starving.  she sent the omelet back.  third time was a charm and it came out with no cheese, no hair, and looked ok (*fingers crossed LOL)  but we were surprised that after sending it back twice and waiting over an hour to get her omelet that it wasn't comped.  

Vegas should be about customer service, its a vacation!  why do these restaurants forget the main rule - its about service.  

i will never go back there. 

Vegan pro tip: they have soy milk available for coffee.mediocre food at best and too overpriced for the lack of quality.  although my pulled pork sandwich was ok, 3 of my friends had to send their plates back because they were cold.  one of the steaks was completely undercooked.   i'm not a picky eater, but what i did notice about my experience was the ultimate lack of customer service on behalf of our waitress "kitty".  she just could not be bothered with the table and that is what ultimately set the tone for the experience.  she could have definitely made my score maybe one star higher, but the manager's offer of "a free desert", did not make things any better.  overall, i would never recommend this place to anyone even staying at the hotel! phoenix has far too many amazing restaurants in the same price range than to settle for this place.For a restaurant at a resort, this place was a disappointment. Customer service should ALWAYS BE NUMBER ONE....Service was not very good. I even think that we were bothering the waitress because she would not acknowledge us. So I got the attention of another waiter who ended up being our waiter....

For the meal, I don't think Arizona knows how to make a fish taco....they should ask So-Cal....IMHO....You never put iceberg lettuce in it....just crappy, especially for the price! $4 a fish taco....

The one star is for the peach tea....It was very good....

Sorry Hole-in-the-Wall, you need to work on your restaurant skills....Now I would have given no stars if they gave the option. Now where do I start... I had my bachelorette party here and it was by far the worst place I have ever made reservatins with. Thier Mgr, Robin, Took $250 to book private VIP service for my party. We arrived and we were told by security that they had no reservation for us. Needess to say, ms. Robin was off and failed to tell anyone about our reservation. I spoke to the mgr on duty and after having to yell at the guy, we were taken all the way to a back corner where he had towipe dirty tables just so we could have a place to sit(we were promised up front by the dance floor) Then it takes 30 mins to get our designated server and she complained about having to serve us the entire time. To end the night, a stupid female security offcer kept yelling at us to "Get the F out or she would hurt people" 30 minutes before closing. Of course they were ok with adding over $100 gratuity for themselves. After our horrible night, we called that robin chick and she made promises to us she still hasnt followed through.... So if your planning a special event at this location, DONT!!! Don't let them ruin it as nobody in that building gives a crap about you or your money!My husband and I showed up for an early dinner late lunch.  Prices seemed reasonable & there wasn't but a few other people in the restaurant. We order our meals: 1/2 a rack of Baby back ribs with fries and "fresh steamed" vegetables for him, and the Gilley's chopped salad with chicken for me. My husband also orders a beer. The waitress brings the beer after 3 or so minutes, he asks for a glass and she just leaves. A few minutes later she comes with the glass almost pissed he asked for it!  When our meals come out, his 1/2 rack are dry & looks like it came from a pot bellied pig, his fries are COLD and his vegetables are soggy. My salad is drenched in dressing, lettuce is soggy, chicken is dry and it's just a mess.  To top all of this off, our waitress continued to be very curt and short with us and our bill was $45! 
We just paid our bill and got the hell outta there. This town is too big with too many other restaurants with people who enjoy their jobs.  Kinda sad, we were hopeful for this place.Nothing was good here. My wife got beef and broccoli, the beef was NASTY. I got a spicy chicken dish, again, nasty. The prices are high, the food stinks... Screw this place.Went in thinking it was the usual Pei Wei, big mistake. The food was close but no cigar. Not sure what they were thinking...I just left hash house a go go and I will never go back.  I ordered the chicken and waffles.  The chicken had no flavor except for the maple syrup poured all over it.  Sweet sticky meat with beading that tasted like fried white flour.  The waffles had bacon inside, again dessert meat. I ordered a side of sausage gravy to try to salvage the chicken, I ate about a teaspoon, it was the consistency of thick pudding. Again thick flour taste with a bit of sausage mixed in.  So needless to say I wasn't crazy about the food.  However my real problem was the service.  Kelly was my waitress, and while not exactly rude, not very helpful when she realized I had a problem.  I told her I needed the gravy because I wasn't crazy about the syrupy chicken, she said " yeah, some people don't like the sweet meat, I guess you learned!". When I didn't eat much even after she brought the gravy she said, "is it making you sick?, I'll get it out of your way".  I didn't ask for a free meal, and I was not comfortable saying more because of her comments.  But the thing is, that she offered no options to rectify the situation, she did not send a manager over to talk to us, and charged us for everything.  Really disappointing experience.Bad food and bad service. $22 for some funky kalbi chicken. Overpriced menu. BTW, if you bring in a groupon, they expect you to order 1 dish per person dinning. Cheapest item on the menu is $10( I believe it's chow mein noodles). 

Save yourself the trouble with the groupon and just go to the Greenland market food court. Better food and better prices.If I could give this place a 0 I would. Horrible (read NO) service, overpriced and just a bad experience. 

We stat at at table at the end of the bar, no one ever came to the table while we were there for an hour. We stood at the self service station at the end of the bar for 15 minutes. One beer and 3 cocktails (nothing out of the ordinary) was $50. The bartender was an arrogant ass. 

Lots of other options in Vegas...skip this bar.So disappointed.  This used to be one of our favorite restaurants.  We made reservations on wednesday november 9 2011 to celebrate a new job I had just begun, and were so excited.  We wanted to take things slow, and ordered wine and apps.  When our Bruschetta came, my boyfriend and I each took a piece.  All of the sudden he looked in pain, and started touching his face.  He reached into his mouth, and started pulling out LARGE CHUNKS OF PLASTIC!    There were big pieces of plastic mixed inside of our appetizer!   He bit into it and broke the plastic into bits, and luckily wasn't seriously injured.  It was disgusting and disturbing.  It looked like pieces of a plastic spoon.  However, we wanted to be nice and calm and enjoy our evening, so we showed the bits of plastic my boyfriend had PULLED FROM HIS MOUTH to the waiter, and politely asked for our food to be removed.
Now I understand mistakes happen in the food industry.  I worked in it for years.  What I can't understand, is why after your customer BITES INTO PLASTIC SPOONS THAT ARE INSIDE THEIR BRUSCHETTA the waiter does not alert a manager or comp anything off the tab.  Our waiter said " oh well these things happen" as he cleared the bruschetta with the plastic spoon crushed inside from our plate and asked us if we wanted more wine.  WHICH HE CHARGED US FOR.  And then when we didn't order entrees because we were grossed out by the fact that our food had chances of plastic in it, our waiter made us feel bad and rushed us put.  
So we paid 60 dollars for 3 glasses of wine ( one which we only ordered because our waiter made it sound like it would be comped due to the PLASTIC IN OUR FOOD and an appetizer that was full of LARGE CHUNKS OF PLASTIC.
Olive and Ivy used to be one of my favorite places to eT, and a sentimental favorite for my boyfriend and me.  We spent many special occasions eating there, and always knew we could rely on it.  Much has changed.  The way we were treated last night was unacceptable. I regret that we were too kind and understanding. I would like to say next time we will get a manager involved, but there will be no next time.  And believe me, we will tell all our friends this storyReally?  Anyone who gives this place more then 2-3 stars literally has no taste buds.  We came here for dinner...$30.  I was expecting at least decent food and this was no where near decent.  The crab legs were grey...not bright orange/red like they are supposed to be, dull, smelled so fishy and tasted horrible.  I tried as much as I could, here was everything that was disgusting...

Mashed potatoes - Fake, potato flakes, blah.
Meatballs
All the chinese food - cold, could tell it was sitting out there forever!
Salad - No dressings were labeled, the toppings were things you would see at Sizzler, but worse.
Broccoli - Cold and no flavor
Pasta bar - watery sauce, no flavor
Braised short ribs - MSG all day
Ice cream - Non fat frozen yogurt, disgusting
All other desert - Tasted like it came from a factory

The only decent thing was the prime rib and the fact that you get wine at no extra charge, that is the only reason it get's 1 star.

Not worth the money and not worth the stomach ache later.seriously even if I'm not Zagat, I have at the very least travelled to many parts of the world and have sampled many authentic foods from different countries.  Italy being one of my favorite countries, and food.   Ceasars Palace Rao's is in my opinion a total rip off, in pricing and quality of food comparatively speaking.  When you pay 27 dollars for a spaghetti plate I expect something rather good, if not the best.  The spaghetti we got was no better than chili's or spaghetti warehouse type but they only charge 10 dollars.  Serious, I ordered Osso Buco, and it was 47 dollars, believe me, it was the worst i've had.  The buffets in vegas had better Osso Buco, the texture was bad, and had little to no taste to it.  considering the cost of this meal, come on Ceasars Palace you can do better.  Learn from Wynn, and learn from Ballagio.  The manager was nice to offer a comp desert and coffee, but seriously they should have done better, just for customer service.  I'm definitely not dining at any of the Ceasars group chains again, value is the name of the game to customer loyalty, you can't charge high prices just because, provide something decent in return.  total disappointment.The service was bad!!! My husband and I were seated by the host and that was the last of it. No one greeted us or offered us anything. We left after 5 minutes and informed the two gentlemen at the host station. The man asked which table we were seated at and that was the end of the conversation. No apology or nothing. However, great valet service...he was the only one gracious enough to apologize for the lack of service.So disappointed. This place is a robbery at gun point. Me and my boyfriend go out to eat once a week and we decided to choose this place for our New Years afternoon meal. First off, I should have taken warning to a Mexican food place with the name pub in it. The salsa tasted like bad pizza sauce. The decor is pathetic. And then the tamale I ordered was HORRID. I took 2 bites of it and couldn't believe how bad it was. I took it home and ended up giving it to a homeless person and felt bad he had to eat it. I can not figure out how this place has stayed in business and has 2 other locations. Once the check came the waitress rang up my order as a #4 instead of #14 which cost me $3 more. I was so over being there I just paid and left. I will never return here or recommend it.I put in a phone order for mild and chili line wings and got a box of mild and plain wings. Thanks for ruining my craving.Read my last review on this place before you read this, then compare. 

Once again like in years past, the workers were having some kind of altercation with each other when I got there after midnight. 

Like usual the host lady had her back turned and pretended she couldn't see us waiting. She and the other host lady have been doing this for over 2 years. This time I asked the server why that lady always ignores us. He actually explained that she does in fact ignore guests intentionally and that she is just a very jaded and angry worker. 

I'm one of those guys who write detailed assessments of food, for example I might say: "The quality and attention the chef put into perfecting the filet to a juicy medium-rare was impressive and well represented the integrity of this restaurant". But really, the only thing I can say about Grand Cafe is that the "FOOD TASTED LIKE SHIT"

If it's not bad enough that the clientele here are usually extremely drunk and shouting disgusting and stupid things, the food takes about 30-40 minutes to come out so you have to sit there the whole time and endure that shit. And most the time, the customers leave after about 20 minutes. I recommend not coming here anymore, even if you are at Santa Fe Station. Read my review of the Fatburger here at Santa Fe....I would still rather endure the service over there than eat at Grand Cafe. There are so many local 24 hour gaming bars around town that serve exceptional food and have great service and low prices. Just go there instead.THIS REVIEW IS FOR CABELA'S RESTAURANT
I ate here twice. Twice it was very bad cafeteria food. Bummer.

You are better off hitting one of the surrounding restaurants. Lots of OK ones to choose from.This was the worst dim sum ive ever had! Went there for lunch atound 1 pm there food wasnt warm because the lady asked us if we wanted it heated up. We should have just walked out then. There was a hair on the soy sauce container too. Lost our appetite after that. Grocery store dim sum would have been better.So I was coming here once a month or so maybe more, however after Happy Hour Disaster I will not be back.  I went to Happy Hour and asked if they could do a veggie taco instead of a meat one.  They seriously delivered a tortilla with peppers in it.  Thats it! No cheese, salsa, sour cream just some sorry peppers.  Then boy wonder manager starts telling me the about the bulk price of meat.  Really Timberlake knock off you think I care?  If you dont do veggie taco then dont do them.  Maybe a mea culpa would be, we dont do veggie tacos but let me take 2 bucks off the potato tacos we actually make.  Say goodbye to my 140 dollars a month, too bad because I like your food. I always recommend Agave to hungry rock climbers as it is close to Red Rock, but no more.WORST resturant i went on my whole trip!!!!!!!!! Poor customer service, after having an appetizer my roll never came and I had to tell my waitress who told me I should have reminded her my roll never came...the roll it looked all dried out and dull, and it had this really awful smell. Kind of like when you use way too much detergent in washing your tupperware, put your food in the tupperware, and then your food ends up smelling like a mix of plastic tupperware and detergent. The waitress was a hostile listener. She never came to check on us. Every time we asked her for something she totally looked frustrated.

This place is a pass. I will never, never return.I can't speak for their cooked menu but the sushi is a disgrace here. I tried the most expensive roll - Las Vegas Roll for $18. It had no Nigiri and was full of imitation crab meat and what tasted like canned tuna.  My only mistake was finishing the roll instead of sending it back and walking away.  Manager offered no refund after I complained.  

I'm literally astonished that they present this as upscale Sushi.There really was nothing redeeming about the entire time spent here...  The dinner started with me politely asking if we could have a table that was on the opposite side from the casino so I could avoid smoke (I was getting over the flu and the restaurant was EMPTY), so she proceeds to seat me at a table right by the railing.. ummm thanks. 

Moving on.. We decided to try the $12.99 special with included soup/salad, "steak", potato, fried shrimp, and pie. Stupid stupid stupid!

Waitress was slow, food took forever (again I remind you the place was empty). Chicken noodle soup was gross.. all celery and onions. The steak.. oh wow, I've never seen a more nasty piece of meat in my life, but ok that's to be expected. Moving on to the potato.. can you please cook it for more than 30 seconds so it's not cold and hard as a rock? Please?

Pie.. icey cold and basically just packaged gooey nasty pie. 

Bad service, bad food... don't waste your time. The food court is great.. and if you're in need of breakfast the service and food at Original Pancake House is great.You want to know why locals always make fun of these idiot casino executives? Take a look at this place, it was a kitschy rotating bar famous for almost 5 decades and a fun spot for people to live out Fear and Loathing in LV moments or just experience one of the few things in this town that was authentic to "the old days". Another plus for the casino is it was a draw for the non "bargin hunters" and general jackassery normally found in the Circus Circus. Instead the bone they promoted to some post wanted to make his mark by callously tearing the bar out for an uberlame snack/ice cream thing. Now if you want to say its about the bottom line and the current incarnation makes more, fine but id say your wrong but fine. There's still plenty of real estate to put a crappy snack thing and still keep a bar. Anyhow Im super annoyed so I'll stop now.First, the place was dead. As in not a soul in sight other than some burnout sitting at the bar. 

Secondly, our waitress was a complete and utter jerk and that's as lightly as I can put it.

Thirdly, put a door handle on the front door so people don't stand there trying to figure out how to get in the bar you dimwits.They basically STOLE my ticket back from me! My husband and I were flying my folks out to Phoenix to babysit our kids for a few days. We bought them each a round trip ticket from LA to Phoenix. A day later we realized we needed them here a day earlier than planned, and of course understood there'd be a $150 change fee per ticket. So, I kept the ticket as it was and purchased a new, additional one-way ticket for just my mom so she could get here early and then my stepdad would fly out a day later on the original ticket. All was good until it was time to check them in for their return flight back to LA. My mom's original return flight wasn't coming up on the computer. I called US Airways and they said since she didn't travel on her original flight out, that she unknowingly forfeited her return flight as well. After utter shock and anger, they made me buy another last minute, full-priced ticket to get her home today. So to sum it up they received twice the money from us, and then received money from another passenger for using my mom's original seat. Does this sound unreasonable to anyone else? There's no reason they couldn't have just put her on that plane this morning without charging us yet again. I'm disgusted with this airline and will avoid them as well as American, for any future flights.I'm not from around here. That being said, I wish I would have asked a local where to grab a quick lunch. Instead I was starving and only had 30 minutes for lunch, so I stopped at the first place I saw: this place and Arby's. I shoulda went for Arby's...but I'm a sucker for local businesses. At least my perception of a local business. I don't know if this place is. 
Anyway, I ordered the yakisoba with shrimp. It. Was. Disgusting. It tasted old. I don't care how many chunky veggies are in the dish, the broccoli was starting to yellow, a sure sign that it was not fresh. The shrimp were medium sized but I think I counted 5. Maybe 6? As for the noodles themselves, reheated ramen is my guess. With some pathetic, diluted soy sauce mixture pooled at the bottom. So gross. Worst $11 I ever spent. Since it was a to go order, I was not in a position to send it back. Instead I picked at the carrots and shrimp but had to throw the rest away. So nasty.It's a quite a figurative slap in the face when you support a company through purchasing the product often, promoting the company on websites such as yelp, and getting to know the staff and even establish a relationship with the owner and then get a BRUSH OFF that leaves you feeling snubbed, and worse - unappreciated.

I get it.  The owner wants to enjoy his music.  The SAME music that was playing the previous night at the SAME very loud decibels.  I enjoy loud music - I WORK IN A CLUB!  That's fine!  

NOT at a coffee house.  Everything I loved about this place - the relaxed atmosphere, the chill crowd, the great place to sketch client work and play my DS - gone.  I spent years giving my money to great drinks, sandwiches, and conversation with the overnight baristas.  
Instead is pounding dubstep music, baristas who complain about the owner's repetitious music, and six dollar drinks.  Don't get me wrong - I will pay good money for great product that wants me there.  But after politely inquiring about the volume level being turned down and having a barista tell me no and the owner refusing to even look at me - I'm done.  It's not called entitlement - it's GOOD SERVICE.   I say hello to staff, order my drink, chat for a few minutes, and get to work, sometimes ordering a sandwich or snack.  Apparently, that's not enough to justify the music getting turned down.

Add this to my previous visit when I was accused of owing the store MONEY when they confused me with another customer whose card didn't charge, making me wait for twenty minutes while the staff ran around calling individuals, then finally made me a drink and sent me on my way.  Incredibly frustrating.

I'm frankly just disappointed in this establishment as this used to be a staple in my routine and I'm not returning anytime soon.  I'll give my money to Sambalatte or hell, the ItsAGrind down Durango.


EDIT: Be sure to read the owner's response.  There was nothing polite or professional in response to my review, my opinion, labeled "crying."  Lowering the volume to music that I ENJOY is a little is a "dramatic change" that is selfish and self entitled.  Really?  Again, disappointing on all fronts.Have been here for take-out lunch several times before and all was good. Service was quick and food was good.  Not today though.  Came in around 12:20PM and one of the four waitresses noticed me standing near the "Wait to be seated sign" (she was near the bar). She said "Hi" and then disappeared.  So I stood there and waited, and waited, and waited, and waited, and waited and waited. After 5-6 minutes of waiting, none of the 4 waitresses came over and asked me if I wanted to be seated, or if I wanted take-out or anything.  No one said a word to me and no one came over. So then I started to feel like an idiot just standing there, and so I left and went down the street to Spicy Tuna. Spicy Tuna was busier than SushiWa, but they took my order almost immediately as I walked in.  So sad SushiWa!Just about the only thing I enjoyed about this place was the drinks. I had a sip of just about everyone's drink, and they were all pretty tasty.

I dined with Emily E. (below, in the party of 12), and I agree with everything she said.

While the food wasn't bad, it was not worth the price -- $65 for my husband and me. I have no problem paying for quality, but Havana Grill simply wasn't worth it.

The waiter was downright rude at times. I felt he didn't put much effort into service because he knew he was getting 18 percent gratuity (not what I would have left by any means had I the choice).

I am sad there aren't many Cuban restaurants in town, as I long for the authentic fare I ate in Miami two years ago. Looks like we locals just won't get the chance to experience something better.I ate here for the first, and last, time tonight. I can't remember the name of the sandwich I ordered, but it was steak with caramelized onions on smashed bread. It was dry, dry, dry. The onions were about half cooked, certainly not caramelized. The steak, besides being dry, had no flavor. I guess the best thing I had was a few french  fries. Two people in our party arrived late, placed their orders, and waited. And waited. Finally, someone brought the bill. All of the orders, even the late ones were on there, along with the tip, but still the food hadn't arrived. They had to ask for it again. It was never even made.Alright from the outside this place looks like it may be worth visiting and once you get inside it looks like a huge club.  But as I worked my way to the back of the club tho Gasp! I've been BAMBOOZLED!!! A mirror wall! I kept getting that same feeling the rest of the night. The more and more time I spent inside  the less and less I liked it.  From the $10 cover charge ($8 for the ladies), really for a club like this? To the excessive amounts of pork swords present that night.  There were absolutely no attractive women, lots of old folks, too many guys, there was a couple of waitresses that were decent but that's it.  Dance floor is big and super crowed.  I'm trying to think of a way to describe the interior décor in this place hmmm... what to say... how do I put this... This place is ghetto, there I said it. Standard $8 mixed drinks, if going to run this type of club at least have some drink specials or something.  The waiters were standoffish and uninterested, with the exception of a white bartender with glasses (I think he said his name was Kevin maybe???) who was very helpful, friendly, and did a great job staying on top of people's drinks, he even gave me a FREE BEER for waiting and I hardly waited at all:). You know what would make this place better? is a pirate theme:).  The staff could wear eye patches and fake parrots with those big striped black and white stocking that would be hot.  With a big fat bald door man wearing jail strips guarding the door, it would be great. I don't get why this club has vip sections, they should just have extra seating. The only thing this place has going for it is it's somewhat big, and it has Kevin (Or whatever his name is).  I would like to see clubs in Scottsdale hire more bartenders like the fellow mentioned above instead of the sweat band wearing, immaculately quaffed, Kingdom Hearts hair do, frat boys you see over there.  I even prefer Kevin over the uncaring, inattentive bartending bimbos of Westgate. 

Hurricane Bay is a great name for this place because it looks like Katrina rolled through and left it a disaster!:)Snap!I am officially not a fan. I went here tonight with some friends to see Tangled. We get stopped at the door and they ask to search my bag. First off, searching bags of customers have gotten a LOT of theaters in trouble, even sued. THESE SEARCHES ARE ILLEGAL. It's called privacy invasion. So good job there. Secondly, even if I am carrying snacks (which I was - let's be honest, those prices are extortionate even for a "dollar" theater and there's not too many vegan goods) I was still going to buy popcorn - that story will come in a moment. Debate about the ethical reasoning of bringing in snacks all you want, but I don't want anyone searching my private property unless they are actual security or police. 

So we take our snacks back to the car and go into the theater. My friends go to find a seat, and I stand in line for some popcorn. Note that there are no signs saying CASH ONLY anywhere. (NOTE: my friend paid for the movie so I didn't notice at the box office if signs were there or not.) When I finally get to the counter after 7 minutes of waiting (seriously the staff was working like they were underwater) I am told they don't take cards, but I can go to the ATM off to the side. Are you freakin' serious?! Why the hell would I go to an ATM when all I want is a small popcorn? There should be signage so I didn't have to waste my damn time. This subsequently put me in an awful mood for the rest of the time I was there. 

As for the theater - when they shut off the lights you can't see a thing. It took me 2 minutes to find my friends. The sound quality of the movie was not great and I could hear every single person munching on popcorn and slurping drinks. So not enjoyable. Kids running around screaming and crying as well - overall a complete disaster. 

Treating your customers as criminals is not okay in my book, and I can assure you I will not be back here - I would rather pay the extra dough for stadium seating, debit card acceptance, and not having my bag searched (it wasn't even a big bag!). And that's saying a lot from someone who likes spending her money on shoes. Shame on you, Tropicana Cinemas.I wanted to go because they advertise over 77 beers on tap...but not this past Friday.  The first three beers I asked for were not available.  Number four was a dog head fish IPA which they finally did have.  The terrible service on a Friday night rates less than 1 star.  This is a great example of commercial industry ruining a great concept, the pub.  Please stick to your Ultra clubs and E TV clients, thanks!Two months, I sent them a cancellation fee, and they are still harassing me, charging me monthly fees. Now they are threatening me, saying, "If you keep ignoring us, this will affect your ability to obtain financing in the future." Yeah. OK. Uh-huh.

I am at a point where I am about to file a lawsuit. 

They have caller ID on their systems. I didn't give anyone my name, yet the billing department gave me to a manager who picked up and said, "Hello Atoosa." How the hell did you know it was me? I never gave a name.

Patty said she would call me as soon as she received my documents. She never did. It's been ten days. I know it's been ten days because I have the dated, signed, return receipt from the postal office.

Read these links. These are not just one or two people. They do this to everyone. I have never come across a business this shady in all my life!

http://www.consumeraffairs.com/health_clubs/las_vegas_athletic_clubs.htmlHorrible horrible horrible everything!! Gaming sucks! Bartenders suck!! Food sucks!! The only reason for possibly a 1 star was because of a sweet server that walked by and said helloI usually do not leave bad reviews, but this time I feel it's needed. I have been here two times now and the service is just bad. The first time I walked out after never being seated or even acknowledged.  I thought I would give it one last try a few nights ago and went back for dinner with my girlfriend. No one acknowledged we were even there, we waited for about 15 minutes and finally sat ourselves. After 10 more minutes of sitting and being ignored as waitresses walked around us, we finally got up and left. I would like to comment on the food, but since we were never served I can't. This place really needs new management...It is so bad that I have to sign up Yelp so I can tell people not to waste their money.  I ordered two take out dishes: Thai Dynamite chicken and Korean spicy beef.  My verdict: a notch better than Panda, but cost the as much.  I am Asian.  My opinion of Pei Wei: go there if you like American Asian food.  If you like something a bit more authentic, go to Asian Grill on Alma School and Riggs, only 5 mins away from Pei Wei.  Cheaper too. Mind you, the restaurant is not good looking like Pei Wei.They need to change their name from "Fry's" to "Indoor Garage Sale".  Do they actually sell new items here??? Couldn't find any!

Needed a USB cable. All 3 of them on the shelf had been previously opened and scotch taped closed by either Michael J. Fox or Ray Charles!

Never again!!!came here today with my husband and daughter. we waied for 45 mins and got literally 5 feet. 

it was 230 pm and there couldnt have been more than 30 people in line. thats ridiculous. there were tons of empty tables too! 

we can be hungry and wait but with a one year old, um i dont think do. peace out!SMALL, sticky, hot, 2 tiny kiddy pools, OVER-priced 50 girls to 1 guy. Not my thing at all.I was only here briefly, but after seeing how one of the employees was totally dressed down by her boss, in front of a customer, I don't think I'll be shopping here.I was so excited to go to a restaurant that had advertised European food with "live" entertainment. My family arrived at the restaurant at 6 pm on a Saturday night.. We ordered our dinners including Hungarian Goulash. The waitress stated that the kitchen was closing and they didn't have time to make the Hungarian Goulash. Really?????? You are closing the kitchen at 6:15pm on a Saturday night? Well, they didn't have the ingredients to make the Goulash. 10 people came in after us and ordered meals. Humm..... 
The beef stroganoff tasted like the Costco special and the "live" entertainment was a 1 man band. He actually did a great job. I would not recommend the restaurant to anyone.CONSUMER BEWARE IS RIGHT!!!  I called to set up basic  cable & internet service. I was given a bundle price of which I agreed to and was a fair price. I then upgraded my cable and got a couple of new boxes. I was told at that time of my new monthly fee which was stretching my budget but I wanted the extra channels. a few weeks later I check my bill and it had gone up $40!!!! Apparently my original internet pricing was a promotional pricing and was never told. So now Cox thinks they can just increase my bill and not tell me!!!! Not even a letter or an e-mail of the new adjustment. It took me 3 reps to get to a supervisor. I guess now I have to downgrade my nternet and my cable... Just be careful of Cox!I am surprised that they have good reviews. 
I would say this was my least favorite chinese restuarant in town. 
I am trying to think postiviely after reading some of 5 star reviews, but 
I cannot forget how orange chiken tasted like a sugar chiken. 
I almost thought I was eating a dessert. 

I don't mind modern, dark, quiet atmosphere as long as the chinese food tastes like chinese food.Nothing has gotten better here... Let me tell you I have NEVER had a complaint on me and I am rarley home. Well. my neighbors are upstairs and at 1 AM last night I called security because, they're noise level is out of this world and it scares my little one. I have made the office aware of this on several occasions... Well, today the office man Josh told me that the neighbor called complaining that I am noisey (keep in mind that I have never have a complaint and am never home) and told them my husbands alarm clock wakes him up. MY HUSBAND IS HEARING DISABLED. The nerve on these people!! And my "dog is loud and scratches all day" I DONT HAVE A DOG!!!!!!! And, Josh said he is taking the neighbors complaint seriously! I have been complaining for months. i understand they have a kid but, so do I and she gets woken up and is scared of the banging! I would be happy if they transfered us... But, they want to charge us a 250.00 transfer fee and RAISE OUR RENT ALMOST 200.00 FOR THE SAME FLOOR PLAN!!!! If we went to a one bedroom it'd be 78.00$ more...  HOW unfair is that?! I understand apartment living I really do! But, midnight till six am is just tottaly un fair for us. I understand they have a kid but, so do we and we get up early. I cant hear my neighbor next door with three kids! They say were noisey? Every neighbor we have says they dont hear us and they always ask if weve been gone awhile! JOSH ALSO ASKED ME TO HAVE MY NEIGHBORS COME TO THE OFFICE TO VOUCH FOR ME. I find that so unprofessional!!!! Why bring them into this? Why even go that far? Why not transfer us and do the right thing and make us happy. I hope they let us out of our lease... I pay way to much here to be treated like this and go through this stuff. I am RESPECTFUL and if i am home... I am quiet and mostly sleep. How is it I can complain for months and the neighbor says one thing back about me and its taken seriously? Also, I dont want problems its frustrating when my baby screams and can't sleep at night... But Josh keeps telling the neighbor what I say and tells me what he says and that DOES not help at all.... I am sick of this!!!El Encanto (Cave Creek) and El Encanto Dos (Carefree Hwy) are not owned by the same folks as  the original El Encanto restaurant located in Cave Creek  and nor is the food nearly as good as.  The food at El Encanto Dos is over rated!  In the past month or so the portions have dwindled to the point that when I order the steak fajitas, I think of vegetable fajitas with a touch of  tough steak.  The flour tortillas are so hard and dry they might as well be made of cardboard. Not worth the drive!!  An experience you can live without!!!Cox is a business that truly lives up to its name.  And, no, that's not a good thing.

Their "preferred" internet speeds are slower than standard services that other companies offer, their link to register for an account to pay online is broken, and when you call-in to pay a bill via the automated system, you get disconnected (even on a Sunday morning) due to "high call volume."  

Even further, I was told that I would get a free installation, and instead they sent me a self-installation kit and had the nerve to charge me for it!  It is without reservation that I affirm that Cox sucks.Terrible Experience! They threw away my $200 vacuum!  The store manager here has absolutely no integrity and customer service is not a factor!  I took my vacuum in and left it for service.  I received a call from the vacuum service department and the man told me it was $24 dollars to service the vacuum.  I agreed and the vacuum was in perfect working order.  Under law, a verbal agreement will be binding if there was an accord on the services to be carried out and an agreement was reached on payment for this service as it was in my case.  I was unable to pick up the vacuum right away so I contacted the store.  Again, I spoke to a man in the vacuum department who assured me that it was not an issue and my vacuum would be there.  I called again two weeks ago and said I would be in soon. Again I was told it was fine.  I went in yesterday and was told that I exceeded the 30 period on the receipt and that my vacuum had been thrown away and they were not responsible.  I spoke to the manager and explained that their employee told me two times not to worry about the time delay for my pickup.  Between my last call to the store and my arrival my phone # changed.  They made their only attempt to call me during that time and since they could not reach me they threw it out.  First of all, why would anyone throw away a perfectly good vacuum when so many people are in need and there are organizations who take such items?  They chose to throw it away.  If they had donated it I would at least find some comfort in that.  The manager agreed to call me after speaking to the vacuum repair employees however no call was received.  I called them.  These people have no regard for their customers.  And the employees will only follow the manager's example.  Poor and unacceptable!I am an avid Black & White shopper, I love it! I just relocated to Scottsdale from Southern California and I have been SO disappointed with the service at the Kierland Commons location. Both my mom and I have been there several times and at first I thought it was just me, but confirming with my mom,  unfortunately we have both had the same experience. The ladies we have encountered have been so unfriendly and snobby which is so unlike the experience I have had in the past with other B&W locations. It makes me not want to shop there anymore! 
Come on ladies, it's not Chanel, please loosen up a little!Probably the worst Walmart I've been to. Do not use them for oil changes. Some kid at the register tried to rip me off 48 cents and I had to talk him through using a calculator to do subtraction because he honestly had no idea. Effin' idiot! Plus there is a lady there in a wheel chair who will most of the time stare at you and tell you to hold on, then go chat with her co-workers. I hate this place!Ever since I had my pizza thrown at my feet and change thrown to my face from the Manager of this restaurant in 2008, I have since never ordered a pizza from Domino's. 

That happen when I commented on how my friend felt uncomfortable of the way she looked at him. Then came flying pizzas and flying money, yeah fantastic experienceWe stopped in tonight for the first time and won't be back.  The waitresses are dumber than a bag of rocks.  After a few drinks one might actually call a few of them "hot" - but trust us - the gate is down, the lights are flashing, but there's just no train coming with these girls and beauty can't compensate for stupidity.  They can only hope to marry someone with money or they are forever destined to work as waitresses.  Such a paradox.

A good 45 minute wait for the wrong food and even longer for a second round of drinks.  The musical game SINGO was cool (think BINGO only with songs)  but not enough to keep us there or bring us back.  We may have thought differently and not noticed the long wait had our dumb blonde waitress (with way too much ink on her)  kept our drinks flowing, but we can only assume that pouring that 2nd or 3rd glass of wine was akin to her passing a Bar exam (pun intended.)

Trust the reviews here; this place really sucks and from what we only SAW of the food, it was mediocre at best.  Nothing that would set your tastebuds on fire.  Regular old bar food.  When you walk in you are first met with a nice woodfire pizza oven which leaves you to believe they actually might have and give their local competition a run for their money.  But it only left us guessing.  

One nice thing was the owner came by to apologize and did realize the mistake, the inept waitress and did comp our drinks - but it was just too late.  We were angry, hungry and had to get to an appointment.  Like mom always said, "Sorry is a cheap word and if you have to say you are sorry, then it's too late." 

In the same shopping center go to NYPD Pizza or around the corner go to Uncle Sams for great pizza.   They are both far better food with better service.Worst customer service ever!  Trying to redeem the check in deal was told that the special is expired and it's no good, when I just ordered $40 worth of food Togo.  The cashier was rude so was the manager..  Never coming back.Let me start by saying that this is my personal opinion - but I would never use or recommend Amerizona to anyone due to their lackluster service. My intent here is only to post facts of the events I had to go through with my Amerizona shutter purchase.  Hopefully this will help you when selecting your shutter vendor.

We wanted to purchase shutters on three windows in the home to make all the windows in the home match (there were just horizontal blinds on those three windows).  We contacted Amerizona and they sent out a sales representative. This lackluster service began with the sales representative they sent to our home.  We made it very clear that we wanted the remaining windows to match the white bi-fold shutters we had on all our other windows.  We also indicated we wanted the hinges to match the other windows, because they were a non-traditional steel-type, not painted (not white).  

The invoice listed the shutters using Amerizona codes and we confirmed with the consultant that the shutters were what we discussed.  Now I take responsibility for the fact that I did not understand the codes Amerizona utilized on the invoice and yet still signed. However, the sales consultant walked through with us the information, which included bi-folds for the large windows.

When the shutters were delivered and were partially installed I noticed that the hinges were in fact painted white and not the steel-type we had requested.  I immediately told the installer the problem and showed him my copy of the invoice. Now it is important to point out here that the builder of the shutters and installer are apparently two different organizations. The installer contracts with Amerizona or visa versa. No one could ever fully detail this arrangement with me in any of the conversations I had with Amerizona.  Since I have no knowledge of the name of the installer I will not list it here.  The installer's paperwork showed "white hinges" and he at first indicated that he did not know how to read the codes used by Amerizona on their invoice.  He contacted his manager and they said they would finish the install and come back with the correct hinges, once they verified that I was correct and in fact ordered the steel-type hinges.

As the install continued and the third shutter went up I noticed it was not a bi-fold shutter.  It did not match any of the other shutters in our home.  Again I spoke with the installer, but this time he pointed out on my invoice that this particular shutter was not listed as a bi-fold shutter.  Miraculously he could now read the codes on the Amerizona invoice!  He called his manager again and this time was instructed to stop work on the install.  He came to me and said that this third shutter he had only partially installed.  He had set it up so it wouldn't fall down, but that it was not fully installed.  He recommended we didn't open the shutters, because he had finished and had not sealed it.  He indicated that I would need to call Amerizona and discuss the next steps with them.  He then asked me for the remaining balance on the account.  I refused to provide any additional funds until the work was completed as was contracted.  He called his manager and she asked me for the payment again, which I refused.  She then asked for half of the funds as the shutters where in place.  Which in reply I explained that the installer and not even completed the install, as one shutter was not done.  She then acquiesced and indicated that they would not ask again for payment until the shutters were fully installed.

They began to remove the hinges and replace them.  The installer indicated he had finished the "non bi-fold" shutter.  However when I went and looked at it he only sealed the bottom, left and right sides - not the top.  So I waited for them to finish the hinges on the other shutters. I wanted at this point to make sure I would get my hinges I was paying for from Amerizona.  

That was when the installer's drill battery died.  He had no backup and not even a Philips screwdriver to finish the work.  I had to provide the installer with my own drill set and a screwdriver for his assistant - so that they could finish the shutter work.  

This is not the way to conduct business and I stress that I would not recommend this group of companies to anyone seeking to have an easy and professional service experience.  To ensure any customers thinking of utilizing Amerizona have this knowledge prior to their making a decision of shutter service vendors I am posting this to this site.  A more detailed explanation is on the BBB review site.  This site limits the character count.Let me start by saying this is not a one-off review.  I have been going to this place for years and it was very good. (Not the best, but good). 
This morning my wife and I took a trip over for my fav menu item. Machaca breakfast burrito with potato.  I've had this many times in the past but OMG!  I could not even finish it.  It tasted like old used fryer grease and did not even have an egg in it.  How do you call it breakfast without an egg?   Just mushy mashed potatoes with a tiny bit of hamburger in it.  (Yes burger. Not even real roast beef)  Worse yet the portion size had reduced to 1/3its normal size (barely 3 bites of filling) and was still wrapped in the usual giant tortilla.  Anyone that has been here before knows how good those are.  Er... Used to be.  The tortilla had the same used grease taste as the rest.  My wife had the chicken taco and even it had suffered major changes and used grease taste.  (How do you mess up a taco?)
 I am so sad and will be reluctant to return anytime soon 
Beware, this place may be on the way out.Terrible.  I will not go back.  Received four different stories as to where my children could or couldn't be.  Security came to us when our kids were sitting well outside the casino area (in a restaurant seating area) and told us to leave.  Not worth it.  Won't go back even without the kids.  On top of the problems with the staff, the atmosphere was horrible.   Smoky and outright boring.  Good thing I'm heading to Las Vegas where they actually have places for your kids to play and it's exciting.I took my daughter in on 11/4/11 for an eye exam, and we ordered her glasses.   They were nice, and we had no complaints about the office visit.  We were promised a delivery date of 11/13/11, which is also printed on the receipt.  
    We heard nothing, so my daughter called on 11/19, thinking perhaps they just forgot to call to let her know they'd arrive, and spoke with a lady named Joy, who stated she would get back to her.
    TWO DAYS LATER, someone else called back (on 11/21) who spoke so quickly and unintelligably that we cannot catch her name, stating that the glasses had been shipped on 11/19 and would be in the store *quote* :   "tomorrow, Wednesday, or sometime this week".   Fantastic!  Impressive.
   My daughter called again today, and they are not there.  My daughter is nearly eighteen, a college student and works full time... she is very capable, and likes to handle as much as she can regarding her own appointments, etc; but she has become frustrated and asked me to help.
    So, I called midday today, and spoke with the self-identified manager of this location, "Joe James" who looked for her glasses for a very long time, and then came back on the line and said he didn't know but 'maybe we should reorder them because maybe they got shipped to another location'. 
    I asked him to please call me back with two things:  
   1. A definitive answer on where my daughter's glasses are, and,
   2. What solution he would be willing to offer, if the answer isn't "They are here, come and get them."
   Hours later, he callec back and left a voicemail stating "the lab said they mighta got shipped to another store or got lost so I dont know but my suggestion is we probably need to reorder these if I dont receive them by tomorrow, just reorder them as "lab lost" give me a call and let me know what you think, talk to you later, bye"   .... which is NIETHER an answer as to where her glasses are (tracking? accountability?), NOR is it a solution that helps in any material way.  
    Reordering them, now, nineteen days later, when we don't know WHAT HAPPENED the FIRST TIME, where the break-down in their system is, or who is responsible... doesn't sound like an awesome solution to me.  
    We have already used this year's optical benefit to order these glasses... I already paid our $95 copay on them... what recourse do I have?    I googled issues others have had with Target, and this seems to be a recurring issue:  once they have your money and your benefit... you've got no leverage and they cease caring about it.$40 dollars plus tax for a oil change?? I think not. Drove less than half a mile down the road got it done 19.99 plus tax. Wont be returning and will be recommending people to stay away.I can't quite figure out how these people are doing better business than Katie use to do. I went to Katie weekly for years, because she was fabulous at what she did. 

First time I returned after she sold, the shop is completely packed. Instead of telling me that there was a ridiculous wait, I sat in the lobby for 30 minutes. Then was moved to the pedi station, where I sat for an additional 30 minutes. The girl who did my pedi was horrible. I could have done a better job myself at home. 
Then I get to the mani station. The arrogant woman doing my nails has an overblown opinion of her work. When I told her that I was a faithful client of Katie, they bad mouthed her, which is unprofessional and pathetic. 
Then after being told how much better and more attractive they were, she proceeded to give me one of the worst and over priced full sets I've ever gotten.I've tried this place 3 times because it's so close to my house. Unfortunately, I've been disappointed with their shamefully sloppy gel manicures each time. They always rush through the gel and either put the polish on way to thick or they don't give it enough time to dry between coats. Plus all the employees are rude and hateful. 

Like I said, I wish they were better because it's so close to home. Unfortunately, I'm much better off driving an extra 5 minutes to a place that does a decent job.On a whim, my son wanted us to stop by since this is "the pizza place of choice" for his school.  

In two words "IT SUCKED" 

The worst pizza I have ever had. Why won't YELP allow fo no stars?   It was dry, so thin, had no sauce and was overcooked. We like our pizza on the "rare" (whiter cheese) side not burnt with big air pillows of nothing.  This is Sardellas.

I should have swung by the grocery store and picked up a TOMBSTONE pizza or Costco to get a better pizza.  Not even on a drunk night would I go to this place.  Worse than Dominos and Pizza Hut.  If you are that hungry, go up the road to Burger King.

Even with all the coupons we had, it still wasn't worth it.  Thankfully my kid gets it for free at his school so we don't have to visit this place;  but one has to wonder if getting this pizza is a reward for him or a punishment?We recently have gone to picazzos and have eaten there many times. we purchase the salads and occasionally the pizza  and a appetizer. This time around we ordered wings, pasta and a few pizzas. we were so very much displeased in the meal as we had to throw it out when we boxed it up after not taking a bite of it. It looked like somebody threw up on the plate and served it to you. I assure you, if you can open up a can of spaghetti o's than you would be better off. The wings were terrible and no sauce, luke warm and the meatballs are frozen and not fresh with moldy hard cheese. The thai chicken pizza was a joke and for 30 bucks for something you can get for 15 somewhere else, its just a disappointment. I told the manager and he blew me off and told me to send in pictures of the meal that I was not happy about. who takes pictures of their food after ordering it and not liking it. I somehow knew he would ask me for that and sent them to him, totally busted right. well he came back and told me pretty much tough luck and don't come back. so Please take my advise and don't eat here. You can easily have a better meal at maggianos around the corner, get a steak at capital grill for the same price or other establishments near by. I promise you, you will be disappointed!Hummm. Large pepperoni pizza for $24.00. Taste was average and their large size is medium. Disappointing.If you're looking for anything from this company, stop and run the other way.  I had the misfortune of having them install solar hot water in my house.  They did everything wrong.  Such as installing the system and then asking for permits.  Then they had to come out and do it according to city code.  They made silly mistakes which any plumber would know, such as putting a drain pan under the tank.   The system works fine, I think. or maybe I hope.  They refuse to answer questions about their system because those in the office profess to know nothing about it.  They guy who does is always out of his office and leaving messages results in nothing....they simply don't answer them.
If I can't get information when I have nothing wrong with my system, how much help do you think I'll get when something does break.
These people really should'nt be in business and you'd be well off to seek services of some other more responsible company.They made an appt for me at 1:00.  When I arrived they said that it would be 45mins.  After over an hour they had still not started.  What's the point of having an appt?  Why tell me 45mins when you would not have even started over an hour later if I hadn't said  something?I needed new ink cartridges and OfficeMax sells their own brand.  If I ordered online, I get a 20% price break, so far so good.  I get the email that my order is ready, and go to the store.  I am the only customer and nobody greets me as I enter the store. Looks like a manager and associate at the customer service counter, I wait there, they ignore me. The sign at the end of the counter says, online order pickup.  I wait there 3 feet away from an associate wearing short shorts, she won't acknowledge me.  A male associate sees me and turns away from me.  I go back to the girl and the customer service counter, she sees me and turns away. 
I ask if I can pick up my online order, well can I ?

Thanks for nothing losers, you suck at service.
Have a nice day.With guests in town wanting an ice cream treat, we passed on visiting local favorites Sweet Republic and Sugar Bowl and chose this Cold Stone location instead. We arrived to two employees to handle our order of 6 desserts. The female employee spilled the chocolate sample offered down the front of the display case (and never took the five seconds it required to clean it, the entire time of our stay there). In an order that added strawberries, the frozen (not fresh) strawberries seemed to be a significant challenge, because as she attempted to mash the frozen fruit with her scooper (rather than slice them), she twice only succeeded in propelling them across the restaurant. This caused her to laugh about how she couldn't handle them. The replacement berries proved only half as challenging, only sending one into the atmosphere. She moved on to the banana, and had to be asked to include a second strawberry into the cream. The second order that included strawberries did successfully manage to keep any from escaping, but the strawberries themselves weren't so much "folded" in to the mix, as the less frozen outer layer of the fruit was just assaulted off the fruit's frozen core, leaving behind strawberry-tinged ice chunks.

Finally, It was time for them to make a simple chocolate shake with heath bar. Small. The attendant poured an excessive-but-unmeasured volume of milk into the blender, and scraped the sides of the chocolate cream tin and added it. She then moved on to another order in the back (I think she went on a quest for a cookie). This left the other clerk to take over, and he proceeded to blend the shake for well over a minute. One in my party said, "I hope you wanted chocolate milk, because that's what you're going to get."  The clerk affirmed my suspicions of this by complaining to the first, "This is way too watery."  Then, he turned and offered it to me!  "Would you like whipped cream on this?" he asked. I said, "I'm not taking this," certain that if whipped cream were added, the shake didn't have enough consistency to keep the added cream from sinking to the bottom.  

My refusal didn't elicit any apology, or an offer to start over. The first clerk did ask, "do you want me to make something else?" But her initial effort and the now-long line (at least 10 patrons deep) were enough disincentive to keep me from giving this dynamic duo another shot. My out-of-town guests said, "We'll never go to another Cold Stone." And we locals will have a story for a long time coming of our Bogus Cold Stone adventure, every time we treat our guests to Sugar Bowl or Sweet Republic.I received WORST service in this place. The manager is very rude. The employee tried to honor a promotion to us without coupon, the manager, Rob called the poor kid to the back and the employee who tried to help us, was back with tears in his eyes. I couldn't see this scenario and told him that he can't be rude, he said the employee did something wrong and he had to be dealt with. Then I said you should be nice to customers just like the employee. He said sir you are pushing it. I called their corporate, and the manager, Rob said you can't be in this building if you are filing complaint about me. I want you out or will call the cops. My children and I were very disappointed. I will never take my children to this particular chuck e cheeses............... The Ovens Are Off .............
   +++ Looks like Rosati's is looking for someone else ...... Who lacks pizza talent +++
The last Franchisee won't be missed.
Over the past 7 years this was the 3rd or 4th Failed Owner.

Serving up a decent pizza ....... isn't Rocket Science.

Here's hoping that Alton Brown ....... will be the new owner.UGH. I gave you another chance, Jason, and you served me a pasta salad with more oil than the Exxon spill. Thanks for the headache.One morning neither shower in my house would drain in less than about 10 minutes and each toilet was clogged. We called the normal plumber that our landlord uses but for some reason they directed us to Sun Devil Plumbing. We were quoted $133 for the job. I had never used a plumber before because I had always been in apartments, so I had no idea if this was a normal price or not. My roommate's boyfriend was at the house when the guy came, said he was in and out pretty fast, said something about how the guy told him it might be a good idea to get on the roof, but then said he was too lazy, or something along those lines. The boyfriend told us everything was fixed though, we got the bill for $133, thought we were good. We told the landlord about it and he said that we completely got ripped off and that was way too much to pay for that issue, but hopefully it would at least last. Here we are probably about a week later and we already have the same exact issue. So not only has every single person we have talked to, including the owner of the house, told us we were overcharged, but the job didn't even last two weeks. I've thought about calling, but it seems like if you call they are just going to defend their plumber and charge you again to come fix it. I don't really care what the reason or excuse is, as a customer there is no reason in my mind that we should have the same problem this soon after. A few months maybe, but not this soon. Needless to say I'll be calling a different plumber to fix the problem we already paid $133 for.Food is ok, but they do not deliver.Quite disappointed. It was the only one open on Mondays though. I was searching for something as good as the food in LA, but no luck. Food was cold, expensive, servings were small. What they had on the menu wasn't there such as pancit. They said they stop making it at 4:30 pm and the place closes at 8:30 pm...wow. Never again, no matter how Bad the craving. 

Any suggestions for other Filipino restaurants worth eating in Chandler???THE STENCH OF COW AND HORSE MANURE AT 110 DEGREES!  Last weekend we had a family gathering in Vegas and stayed at the South Point because we had good experiences there before.  This time they also had rodeo competition going on and they keep the animals next to their arena AND keep the doors open leading to the hotel.  Consequently, the smell of cow and horse shit in the hotel's Coronado Cafe took your breath away and it spread out through the gamming area.  Outdoors you could smell the manure at the pool and when you went out to your car in the parking garage that smell at 110 degrees almost stopped you in your tracks.  If you are planning to stay at the South Point make sure no animal events are going on.I went here for lunch and was very disappointed! I sat down and ordered a chef salad. After sitting there for 30 minutes and watching everybody who came way after me getting their food already, I was upset. Since the waitress never came back to the table, I had to ask someone else to check on my salad which should take only 10 minutes to make! Then I was told it was on its way out in about 5 minutes, Really?! So you forgot to make it and now I have to go back to work because my break is over. No one ever came over to apologize. Horrible customer service and I will not be back!Overpriced, sloppy work, rude, unfriendly & super dirty ESP in the waxing area...scary...Not recommended ~ Try another salon, you will be happy. There is a new place is moving in across the street from this establishment & I am thankful as I live close by & have to drive far for better service & quality of manicure, fills & pedicure! Not recommended!HORRIBLE! Never going back there EVER!
The place was nice, clean, pretty and all. But the service seriously blows my mind at how horrible they are. The woman who did my nails had no focus on my nails at all! She got up to chat or grab a drink at least 5-6 times just leaving me sitting there waiting. She did not listen to me at all when I was telling her how I liked my nails. And the WORST part: before she had even began I told her specifically I had a broken finger that was still healing up and to please be gentle. NOPE! She had no mercy on my finger after me telling her several times how much she was hurting it.

I had her do stilettos and they looked like shit. Then after asking her to fix the shape because I wasn't happy she told me she would at the end, which she didn't!!! Then when the HORRIBLE manicure was finished she then tells me she didn't even know how to do stiletto nails. WHAT?!?!!!! Why would you even attempt it without letting your customer know first!!!!!!! On top of all of this horror, the overall manicure was SHIT. They're all uneven!! My two pinky nails are literally completely off!

WORST EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE! NEVER GOING BACKHoly crap! This place is is SLOW! I think traveling a greater distance will be better than the stress of ever coming here again.This place is the king of lies! How can such a descriptive menu, that baits you
into ordering a bunch of food, yield results that make everything taste like semi-warm, grey matter? I ordered the "Big Al's Stuffed Sandwich" and it might as well have been a cotton ball soaked in grease. My buddy got the "Prosciutto Panini" and it tasted exactly the same, this also applies to the wife's "Cajun Chicken Sandwich" and "Stuffed Hot Peppers". It made me hate the fact that I have a mouth and no one in my party ate more than 2 bites before deciding to toss it out. The food is bad and you should feel bad!Took our son to this Snips & Clips on Grand Canyon. The black lady who cut our 14-month-old son's hair was very nice, but she did an awful job cutting it. She cut too high over the ears. Some strands were much longer than others, and the back was uneven. We will never be going to Snips & Clips again.I was a little fond of this place because when I had to do a smog check for state registration they were super friendly and called me back a few times to let me know where their emission guy was and when he was working.

However today I called them at 3:45 to see why time the close. 5:00 PM.  Great so I cruised over and got there at 4:12 PM.  First they tell me they only carry Penzoil.  Any self respecting car owner knows that Penzoil is one of the cheapest , crappiest engine oil you can buy.  So they said I could get my own oil next door at Checkers.  I said OK i'll do that.  Then the guy said "actually we are doing our last car now. We are doing a transmission on this car too, so we can't take any more cars".

WTF?  First of all you only carry Penzoil. Yuck.  Secondly you tell me you aren't taking any more cars at 48 min till close for a 10 min oil change?  Thanks for the warning!! Taking my car somewhere else for a decent oil change.My first experience with this bar has been less than stellar. I came here for lunch to grab a quick bite and food took forever. I was unimpressed by the bartenders lack of knowledge in the beers they serve. My buddy ordered a Heineken and got a Heineken light. The food was ok I had 2 sliders and fries and my buddy had 2 sliders as well just so happens another mishap my sliders come with no fries and my buddies does when he didnt order. The fact that they also do not have any beers on tap will be the main factor in me not returning again.Messed up our meal three times. Simple orders too. No sweet tea available. Non sense!Never been more frustrated in my life. Have a diesel truck that I needed Smog on. Guy kept telling me he couldn't pass me without a Catalytic converter. I kept saying I didn't need it for my year, which is what the Dodge DEALER told me. He didn't even get under the truck or consult his part book. I went to Terribles and they did it immediately no questions asked. 

If the guy had just consulted his book and listened to what I was saying (even showed a drawing of what is factory under the truck) he would've had my business. 

Not impressed and will be going elsewhere for my smog from here on out, even though this is most convenient location for me.I'm still reeling from the even beyond poor experience. The level of customer disservice by an assistant manager named Mark is just impossible to comprehend. How this guy is allowed to abuse customers is just mind boggling. His rudeness, disrespect, and arrogance belies how Jiffy Lube could risk its brand name. I was never greeted as I walked in, just started with "what do you want'. When I said I would like the value oil change, this "asst. Mgr" Mark barked at me they won't check anything. He then yelled out to the men in the work area not to check anything, as if I was being reprimanded. It was very degrading to say the least. When the oil change was done, he didn't address me again; he simply pointed at me and motioned with his finger for me to come and pay. More disrespect. At the end of the transaction, no thank you or anything. Like he did me some great favor. My washer fluid was empty; no fill. No quality organization would ever let a customer leave with empty washer fluid. There was no attempt to offer to fill it even if there was a charge. 

$24.95 is a premium price for an oil change in Las Vegas. Most shops charge $20 or less, and are only too happy to perform checks and fluid fills graciously. Terrible's is wonderful. For $19.99 you get the works, plus a free car wash. I was originally headed there, but saw the JL had no cars inside, and seemingly decent price, which turned out to be a come on for incomplete service.  For that price, my fluids should have been topped off, tire pressure checked, etc. Basic stuff you can get with an oil change at half the price. 

Price notwithstanding, I have never been so degraded and disrespected at any retail location in my entire life. How this guy Mark could possibly be tolerated for even one day as an employee, let alone carry a manager title speaks volumes about Jiffy Lube. I've read other posts, and this guy seems to have a reputation. I wish I read some of the reviews before I went in there.  I will never, ever, go back to any Jiffy Lube location for any reason. I might add the place was empty on a Friday; usually a very busy day. I wonder how many other customers have been driven away from this miserable business by the toxic rudeness of this assistant manager. 

If you want to be treated with any modicum of decency or respect, you should steer clear of this Jiffy Lube. Sadly, I could not give this rating no stars. The only solace in this whole thing is that I now know where to never go for service.Very over priced, food isn't bad but just not worth the price. Service left something to be desired as well. Won't go back again.I would not recommend this place to anyone.  I went in for an initial consultation, which I was told would cost around $80-$90 because I was a self pay.  Dr. Vanessa came in and looked at me for about 5 mins or less and then told me that I should get one mole removed because it looked suspicious and that I could have some others removed for purely cosmetic reasons if I wanted to.  I agreed to have several procedures done and pay for them all upfront.  When I went out to pay and schedule my procedures they told me that it was going to be $160 for the initial visit.  I explained that that amount was double what i was initially quoted and they did not seem to care in the slightest.  I cancelled the procedures and reluctantly paid the full amount for the BS visit.

I then called several other dermatologists in town and explained what had happened and they told me that if I came in to get checked out and they ended up needing to do a procedure that they would apply the initial fee 100% towards the cost of the procedure.  Four different dermatologists confirmed the same policy.  

When I called back to offer them to still book the procedures if they applied the $160 towards them they told me that they would not do it.

Thomas Dermatology does not value client relationships, they just want your money.  i will never go back here again, and warn anyone else to stay away.I had been to this place one time before my recent and LAST visit to this place. The first time around everything went smooth, the food was great, the service was great, no complaints. The second time around, it was a completely different experience. Let me start by saying ABSOLUTELY WORST SERVICE EVER. We walked in and the place was busy. When my boyfriend and I walked in we made eye contact with a waitress, who rather than sitting us down went about her business as if we were not there. Rude much? We get seated and we ordered our food. I ordered a small order or ceviche and my boyfriend order two empanadas and a tostada mixta. The ceviche was good, but it was missing avocado. Every other restaurant that I have gone to and ordered ceviche serves avocado with it. So I asked the waitress if I could please have some avocado. A HALF HOUR LATER I get my avocado, a whole avocado, by this time I am practically done with the ceviche!! The empanadas were fairly good, not the best. My boyfriend's tostada, wow I do not even know where to start! To begin with there was ONE shrimp on it placed neatly on the top of a mountain of haiva which is crab imitation. We dig through the pile of haiva only to find two pieces of octopus which did not look appetizing AT ALL. On the bottom of it all is what seems to be a tomato sauce. When I tell my waitress that I did not order a tostada de haiva and that I ordered a tostada mixta she simply told me that she was sorry but that it was not her fault that she did not cook that. She does not even offer to take it up to her supervisor or to return the food, NOTHING! At any other restaurant the least they do is ask if we want the food returned or replaced. Then I look for a waiter and tell him about the issue, and just like the waitress, he does nothing but explain that it is the way they make them there. Absolutely ridiculous, anyone can google a tostada mixta and you will see that nothing looks like a mountain of haiva. WORSTE EXPERIENCE EVER!!!!Worst customer service ever. Waited 45 minutes with an appointment and walked out dissatisfied for the second time. Why don't i stop their service?  Because they'll charge me $700 for a phone I had for a month. I wanted to just give it back but they said that's fine it'll cost you $700.Using this management company will be anything but affordable, and there isn't much "management" either. Charged outrageous fees for clean up to make rent ready. When I inspected the property several weeks after being billed, nothing had been done. Their accounting is disorganized and full of errors. Promises were continually broken and communication ignored.Had the store manager pack and ship a package for me, and even bought insurance at his suggestion. But when the package arrived damaged, the owner gave me the run around after days of haggling on the phone.  Don't use these guys if you care about your packages.Ordered take out for our 1st time trying, wasn't given my free pound of pasta from yelp because it's dine in only (which it says no where) Waited like 5-10 inside just standing in the middle if the dining room. Then I'm handed for my single meal take out a stupid Costco box with my smaller take out box in it and the little waitress had some stupid smirk on her face like it was a joke. Just basic service and even more basic food. Definitely not worth $25 for 1 ckn parm that comes with a  "Caesar salad" oh the lettuce with 1 cruton. And a piece of wonder bread with melted cheese. Won't be trying this joint again. 1 step above Olive GardenThe worst Starbucks in LasVegas!!!!!! Drive the extra miles to get the service u deserve!!!!! Always out of everything service is the worst everPay attention to their return and exchange policy! What? You can't find it? That's because there is none! Once you bought it and had it delivered, it's yours for better or worse. Even it it broke in 4 days, like mine. They told me that the policy is in writing, but I've never saw it. The only document I have from them is a piece of paper that looks like a restaurant order ticket. That's all!As I waited for the staff to figure out how to redeem my gift card, I was forced to listen to their lamenting their very existence (the gift cards not the staff), as well as the existence of the abundance of deals offered by the spa's management. After twenty minutes of waiting I eventually got up and left. Their services may or may not be good, I will never know, but their customer service is not.Pei Wei gets the bozack.

Super weak and fake (Chinese?) food.  It's like a sad, upscale aspiring Panda Express.  They even used that ubiquitous chopsocky type font from the 70's you usually see on karate schools and Chinese takeout boxes.  Panda Express is hokey too, but at least they know it.

I had some kind of beef noodle dish which I can only describe as severely overcooked ramen noodles with strips of teriyaki style beef.  They also put about 10 whole green onions in my bowl, which I thought was pretty funny.  

Another thing that bugs me is that, I think whoever is behind Pei Wei just lumps all things asian together and can't distinguish the differences.Went here for lunch the other day since it is close to work. I ordered a grilled chicken ranch wrap. Got a fried chicken wrap with honey mustard. Chicken was fatty and gross but I should have expected that I guess. Not trying that againOn our fancy night out in Vegas, we went to Mario Batali's Enoteca San Marco in the Venetian, and I don't think I've ever experienced service this bad.

We waited for our table for about half an hour before we were seated towards the front of the restaurant. The bus boy pretty much waited on us throughout our entire meal. We probably met the, might I mention, "rude" waiter only once briefly to give us cold and burnt bread and take our order. After that, he disappeared. No one there came by to fill up our water glasses, no one came by to give us our check, no one even asked how our meal was.

We ordered the vongole pizza with clams, mozzerella and chili and the rigatoni with roasted cauliflower ragu, chili, rosemary. I do admit the pizza was good. It had the crispy thin crust that I like. But, the pasta was a disappointment. It was luke warm and had no presentation what-so-ever. It looks like the chef just threw it on a plate and called it a day.

Et all, I was very disappointed with the restaurant. On my last night in Vegas, I was hoping to have a nice fancy meal, but ended up at a restaurant where they treat you like crap and serve you crappy food.I used to come here every 2 weeks religiously, but I got sick of their nasty attitudes, crooked tips & shit talking.  I had a Korean friend come in with me once, and she confirmed that they were talking shit about every customer in there at the time.  

Avoid this place at all costs.The worst, awful, restaurant.   

 The worst restaurant of my life. Today, I  think of the name and it honestly makes me vomit!!!!!!!!!  EEEEEEeeeK.   My background I'm a registered dietitian and also have a certificate in Foodservice Sanitation.   

Now I can continue with my story, my husband and I took a weekend trip to Las Vegas about two weeks ago and decided to stop by Ocean One Bar and Grille to eat before the big shopping spree on our last day in Vegas. 

Let me start by saying that the first thing that most people notice is the service.  Your waiter has to at least look the part and act like he likes his job.  Well, my friends my waiter was BAD simply the worst.  Like good people that we are, we didn't want to say anything because we felt that it wasn't his fault maybe just having a bad day.    I truly believe that he was having a bad day or something. It took about 30 min for our waiter to take our order.  Second, our main entree came before our appetizers.  

For the sake of the reader, I ordered  oysters and calamari for my appetizer and  both my husband and I ordered pasta for our main entree.  While eating my pasta my oyster arrived and to my surprise after eating a couple of oyster and moving the empty shells to an empty plate  I FOUND A WORM IN MY NEXT TO OYSTERS, A LIVE, MOVING, WORM IN MY PLATE  OF OYSTERS.  

I started to gage and ran to the washroom. My husband called the waiter and, of course, the waiter took it's sweet time HE finally came to the table and asked my husband "what was the problem".  I showed him my plate and the worm and said nothing but took the plate and came back with my check and charged me for my food and the oysters.  No apology of any kind.  Without make a big scene, my husband calmly asked to speak to the manager.  The manager came to our table and asked the same stupid question, "what was the problem."  My husband explain the problem and he said, "what do you want me to do? Sorry?" in an upset tone, as though he was not sorry.  We had paid for our dinner and my husband took the bill and took the money and told the manager, I thought that you would AT LEAST APOLOGIZE  for which he responded  "I ALREADY SAID SORRY WHAT DO YOU WANT" with an attitude.   

Needless to say, please before you go to this restaurant read my review and hope that you make a good decision before  ordering something from this awful restaurant.Being that I was out of town for the long weekend and was in the mood for some coffee, we "Yelped"  and found this location. It's an outdoor setting primarily used for karaoke and entertainment with tables and chairs decorating the front lawn. We made our way into the historic house which has been converted into a coffee house.    The lady at the counter (older lady, butch haircut with tattoos) asked what we were having and I kindly asked for any suggestions.  The menu contained numerous items and I was hoping she can help me make a decision or at least help stir me in the right direction.  What happened next, I wouldn't have expected in a million years.  She rudely replied that she does not know what I like, therefore, she can't make any recommendations. I usually ask for recommendations especially from new places and I've never had this type of response. Again, I proceeded to explain what would be considered their signature drink, something popular with their customers and she again insisted not to help me or willing to make any suggestions.  I have asked bartenders, waiters, waitresses and baristas this question many times and I have yet to get a response like this one.  They are always friendly and more than willing to share their top sellers or most popular drinks. I was so floored by her response and attitude that I simply decided not to give her my business, walked-out with no drink and appalled by her rude behavior.  If ever I'm in Glendale, I know NEVER to visit this coffee house again.I've eaten here 3 times.  3 times I've given one of these places a shot, but today is the last time.  If you're into bland, no spices whatsoever, no taste whatsoever, prepared food, lots of preservatives in your prepared food...mmmmm, this be the place!
Everything here is horrible except for the salad and an occasional soup.  
Never again.  I'd rather wait till I get home than eat at this dull place.Service was slow and inattentive. It was a long wait for food to come in, even though there was only 3 people at the restaurant. 

I ordered soondubu but the soup was like water and the tofu was firm, not soft. There was no flavor what so ever....just a pot of soup with few pieces of carrots and tofu cubes inside. It was just a very sad and disappointing dish that I had to fork $10 for.  I had to get some sweets to make up for the lack of a meal afterwards. :/I really don't see what the hype is about these cupcakes. Maybe they are better in Beverly Hills... i honestly don't know. I DO know the Scottsdale locations is overrated and the cupcakes aren't good. It's a pretty spot but I obviously don't spend almost 50 bucks on 12 cupcakes for the look of the place. 

The only person who liked the cupcakes was my dog. He has the doggy treats... but then again he is a garbage disposal and will eat anything so he is kinda biased. 

When I went in to pick my cupcakes there was a fly in the cupcake area... just flying around and sitting on most of the cupcakes. I informed her about it and she just threw one away and I'm basically looking like what about the others... (I feel sorry for the next person who came in) 

That place cost too much money to have flies flying around on the cupcakes and they not be sanitary enough to throw them out and make all knew batches. 

To top it off the cupcakes were gross, and we ended up wasting half the dozen. I obviously don't eat cupcakes for them to be bitter. If I'm going to intake the calories it better be sweet and heaven like. 

In conclusion I just don't understand why people are flipping their wigs over these cupcakes. :(While the units are beautiful and spacious, the staff at the leasing/management office effectively eliminates this benefit. In the six months we have lived here we are on our third set of staff. No one knows what the previous one had done or promised so anything we were given or promised by the staff when we moved in was stripped away or forgotten. They care nothing for current residents, have no documentation or note system to track any conversation and have never returned a call. They operate with zero skill set to effectively manage a property. I am a business consultant and I would have fired all of the previous set and the current one. There were two capable people when we moved in but then again, they may have just been nice since they were trying to get us to sign the dotted line. Not worth it folks, big no for me.This place is old, dirty and attracts an older crowd.  Not a good place if you are a young hipster.I use to love this place until they escorted me out in my heels...clear plastic of course.This is a such Company. I should read this before I buy IT.

***   BAD SERVICES *****

                            + $28 service
                             + $15 for delivery .
                         -------------------------
          I end up paid $223.00 
But they Never Delivery and I paid for Taxi to pick up ticket  . If you buy ticket at Bellagio for this show you PAY $119.00 and if you lost ticket they still print another for you to get in. The Manage at the theater tell me to call my agent because they couldn't found my name . I call my agent but they couldn't help me to get in . I need to buy another ticket to get in . That is such . I paid $223.00 and I can not get in to the show.
If you lost a ticket . They are not respond and refund . What kind the service they have . Why they charge for service when they don't have it . 
 DO NOT BUY TICKET  HERE  !!!!!!Very unsatisfied with the FOOD. Service was great, but our steak and double cheeseburger were burnt - not to mention the fries were just dabbed with seasoning in the middle and not spread out, COLD TOO. I used to enjoy coming to their café for their graveyard specials, but now it seems the cook is different. I don't really recommend coming for a quick bite to eat there.THis place has really lost so much fuel for me. I used to pump it up to those I knew who put it down. not anymore. If you cant beat them join them. j/k. 
Seriously the last time I came in here I met up with my bf who went right after work. I was ignored ... not for 10, not 15, hell not even 20 but for 30 freakin minutes. My guess was b/c I dont have a pair ... well the pair the waitresses are looking for to get big "tips" from. 
The sadest part, the manager looked me in the eye, 2x. and never even asked what I'd like to order. you can find the manager but finding the oldest lady there who happens to be the most clothed (she's the one not wearing the vest and shiny beaded belt but rather a buttoned down khaki shirt and slacks. 
I told my bf who loves this place, to count me out - he now sees it the light and started going bk to Rum Runner and Apache Joe's. 

The service at apache joe's is far more courteous.. not always consistently the same people but at least the girl bartenders notice you are there!!!I wish right now I had zero stars for this overpriced fool you into the web of sweet cream!!! I should of looked at my YELP application on my i-phone before being lured over by a "free taste". Dirty four letter word: FREE. My A$$ FREE with two small double scoops being $36. WTF? No way was I or my hubby going to pay that. We walked away with them paying for being such scammers. I understand I was in a tourist trap high end shops type of mall, but come on ICE CREAM/Gelato being more bucks then the booze slushy? At least with the booze slushy I have a nice buzz!!! 
DO NOT BE THE LICKER of the moment for these CIty Slickers of  ripping you off.I went to this place with my son and my husband.  The place was packed!! I had never felt more uncomfortable in any other place I have been to.  I had never experienced someone treating me differently because of the language I spoke.  I was speaking to my son in spanish when the waitress came up and she rolled her eyes.  I asked her if she had a problem and she was like "no, what are you going to order?", I ignored it and ordered some food.  By the time it got there my son was getting antsy and all the staff ( the waitress, hostess, manager) were looking at us.  I asked the waitress to wrap up the food to go cause I hate listening to children cry when Im eating and Im sure other people do to, so I was going to leave.  The manager came up and asked if there was a problem and I said no that my son was just antsy, the waitress and hostess laughing in the background looking at us.  I then said to the manager how uncomfortable it was how everyone was treating us.  He followed by saying  'I don"t believe they would do that, I wouldn't allow it."  I said "I am not asking you if you believe me or not I am telling you what happened".  Long story short, we left.  The food I ate in the car sucked, seriously not just cause I was upset.  I have ordered food to go from mimmy's for breakfast and it kicked ass this was just bland!  I would recommend Denny's over this place.I hope the People that own LAX would Read this review.

There is basically no dance floor, the floor is a aisle that people just walk through spilling there drinks on you. A club is where you can dance and have fun. Not just to walk and spill your drinks thats a waste of money. I will never come back there again due to they just want to profit on people paying for bottle service instead of having a dance floor.Crazy Line
Poor attitude from staff.
Bartender refused to provide tap water with drinks (answer "you can buy bottled" .. sure, when I've just bought 3 drinks that you pre-tipped) 
Nowhere to sit unless you've bought a table with bottle service.
Beware.HORRIBLE SERVICE!!!!

We can't go back there. Went there for the first time tonight and was expecting great food. We walked in, no one came up to greet us. Instead they stayed back behind the counter and told us to sit anywhere without any kind of courtesy or etiquette. Our waitress definitely did not want to be there and had an attitude. We picked a table and sat down. They were slow to give us our menus. We got our food quick enough and it was tasty but definitely not better than Lolo's. The waitress never came back to ask if we need anything else or to fill our water or lemonade glasses. We had to shout across the dining room to get her attention for more lemonade. The absolute worst was when we went up to pay, they never handed us a bill and overcharged us. The old man at the register didn't even know what we ordered and when we told him, just spat out a number "$33.16!" without doing any kind of math. He was very rude to my boyfriend who tried to pay with a credit card. Instead of just asking my boyfriend if he had cash, he barked, "Didn't you see the sign?! We take cash!" We didn't make a scene but it really pissed us off. Their signage is confusing. There was a broken machine sign on the wall but the menu said "we are now accept credit and debit cards." 

Also, the place is filthy. Dirty floors, walls, and windows. The bathroom smells like hot ass. For some reason, the bathrooms don't have AC but the rest of the restaurant does. Absolute worst! We've had great food and service at Lolo's! They definitely know how to make you feel welcomed. I love the servers at Lolo's; they are attentive, friendly, and helpful. I can't believe the two families are related. WE WILL NEVER GO BACK!Go to the original in San Antonio instead. Vegas transplants good stuff from everywhere but this location is a poor imitation of the original. Food is just OK and too expensive like everything else on the strip. 

Our waitress wasn't surly she just spent the evening flirting with my husband. The gimmick with Dick's is they are supposed to sarcastic and insulting perpetuating a good time. Whatever, I wasn't impressed with the food, atmosphere or waitstaff. 

Typical tourist trap. Skip it.Done with this place, first few times it was cool, our last visit the band was so loud you can't hear the rest of your party.  They refused to split our bill, and we saw our waitress about 3x for a party of 10.  She brought beers to the table even when we said no more.  DONE!Took my buddy here to sober him up.  Food was way over priced.  Way better places to eat on the strip.  Save your money for the bars, strip clubs and the poker tables.WORST place in Vegas to party.  I have lived in this city for 18 years.  All I can figure is that they have way too much business due to tourists and could care less about customer service.  Cuz there's no way they would make it in the real world.   Don't waste your time or money.  There's a million other places in Vegas that deserve it.Eek! Methinks not is right! I dont know why or how i keep finding myself at this place. I haven't had one good experience. One time, the place is suppose to be open at 10am and was still closed at 11am?!?! WTF Another time, they over steeped the tea and release all the tanin, the tea was soo gross and dry. Train your staff to know different teas have different steeping times AND temps. I really have no idea why i don't just go down to the coffee bean.

The staff seems friendly enough. The decor, LOVE the teas in the drawers, feels very chinese herb traditional. They have such huge potential to become a great place, but have been lacking everytime i go. I really truly hope they can get there one day, i love their concept.Worst sushi experience in Vegas. Amazed they're still open. Over priced tiny portions. Huge disappointment.If you live near fresh water (San Francisco, Seattle) don't eat fish here. Everything - EVERYTHING is frozen. Sand dab, no, - scallops - no, prawns eh, no- even frying it didn't help. just don't eat fish in AZ. 
Veggies are good 
Wait staff is good
Mojito was GREAT - not a mixMy chicken was burnt, the side that was black was facing down to hide it! I sent it back and ordered a rare steak. It came out  well done and full of gristle. Their idea of making amends, was to ONLY charge for the burnt chicken, but took off the steak! Unbelievable! We won't be back!Worst service I have ever encountered.  Passive waiters and terrible manager.  With 2 kids in tote, you would think we could have had faster service!    Would NEVER go back.If I could give it less than 1 star  I would! This show is a complete waste of time and money. The only reason it exists is the brand name of "Cirque" and to take money from unsuspecting tourists.

I have seen "O", Mystere, and Zoomanity several times and most of the traveling shows and have loved them all. 

"Love" on the other hand is terrible and not worth the time or money. 95% of the show is a bunch of teenagers dressesd in 70's costumes running around on stage dancing to Beatles music, with no plot and no "wow" moments like the other shows have. The highlight is literally 4 guys dressed as the Beatles on roller blades going over a couple of ramps. 

Trust me save,  if you really like the Beatles, your $300 would be much better spent buying all their albums!Overated!  Boring, boring, boring!  Did I say boring?

Not a real Cirque show!  Lots of running around but very little performance.  

Go to a real Cirque show like O!I've been here twice.  The service is great; the margaritas are great; the food sucks.  Both times my meals tasted like an old shoe.  I'm not sure how they get that exact flavor in the food on two separate occasions but it is not good.  Two strikes you're out.Went here recently and it smelled like open sewage; I think they were burning incense to hide the bad smell. (actually I have been here twice and it smelled like sewage both times) The men's bathroom is disgusting, the service is horrible, a customers food was left next to me at the bar for several minutes until the waitress picked it up to bring to a customers table (anyone could have played with the food during that time). The bartender couldn't handle more then 3 customers, the decor is pathetic and looks like a sloppy college student decorated his dorm room with all his sports posters; I expected to see a pile of dirty socks and underwear in the corner.
They don't appear to have much to choose from for drinks, don't expect any quality liquor; the menu is very standard. Didn't dare try the food.

It's too bad, I could really like this place, because the location is great.I've been to Fuzzy's twice now and don't think I'll be returning, the first time my Wife and I went about a year ago we couldn't find a seat inside.  the sign said seat yourself we sat on the patio and after about 20 minutes a server never acknowledged our presence.  Even though they looked at our table several times.

The second time was after a work christmas party with a few friends we stumbled in about 10PM to check out their Karaoke, some interesting characters, this time the server acknowledged us and brought us a round of drinks but they never checked on us again over a period of maybe 45 minutes to an hour, and eventually I went to the bar and asked for the tab.  Oddly enough the people that seemed like regulars we're getting service.

dissappointing to say the least.I honestly can't understand how I received such bad service from a hotel that receives 4 stars. 

I first want to explain my circumstance as to why I'm even writing this review. I originally stayed at the Venetian in April for a random trip with the girls. After a long weekend, both my friend and I notice that we had money taken from our wallets. She was missing a 50 dollar bill and I was missing 45 out of my own wallet. Now yes, normally any one can say "oh you were drunk you probably misplaced it" but as an avid Vegas goer - I can clearly state that this was my weakest trip I had been on. No drunken stupors were had this weekend. When I had called the security to make the report, not only did i have to talk to several guest services employees but I also had to wait in my room on a Sunday for them to come. When the security guard arrived, he plainly stated to me that no employee of the hotel would have taken it. (First instance of blame the guest). I was promised a call back within 48 hours about their findings. In the end, the check out time took 4 hours. Did I receive a call within 48 hours? No I did not. I then had to take more time out of my day to contact guest services. Luckily I got a hold of Marcus, who by the way was the nicest man, and he could not provide me a report on what may have happened with my missing monies. He then provided me a complimentary upgrade and 1 free night at the Palazzo. I agreed and left the headache right there. 

Several months go by and my sister offers to take me back to Vegas for a graduation trip. To help save money on the room and spend more gambling, I decided to use my certificate for a free night. I called in once and spoke with Theresa in Guest Services and inquired about rates and fees and she indicated to me that it would be best to call back and book with payment so that I can lock in the rates. I waited until payday and called back and booked. All credit card info was provided. Done. 

I get to Vegas this past Friday (9/27) and they advised me that the room went unpaid and that I owed a balance. Now mind you, I had harassed all my friends for payment. Why would I do that if I was properly told that I could pay when I got there? None of that was mentioned during the 2nd phone call when I provided my CC information. By that point I was upset bc not only was I misinformed but no one could understand why I would be upset and they continued to state that their employees would have told us the proper info (Second instance of placing the blame). Seeing how irate I was, they offered a 25.00 restaurant credit (whoopee). I ended up having to clear out my savings to cover the price of the night. They had advised me to call the guest services manager if I wanted to further complain. I advised them to contact me directly bc I wasn't going to wait in the room for a call when my trip was already off to a bad start. 

I get into our room and the guest services representative Theresa calls me back only to state that I was wrong. (Third instance of blaming) and that I never discussed pricing with her or booking. Why else would I be calling? For fun? (Fourth instance of blaming). I plainly asked her if she was telling me that as a customer, I was wrong and it wasn't her fault. By this point, I didn't want a resolution I wanted to explain why I was unhappy - what I didn't want was to be blamed AGAIN. I hung up and my friend called back bc by that point I was so frustrated I ended up taking back shots to calm myself. She spoke with Theresa manager who said nothing Theresa had said was wrong. (Fifth instance of blame on the customer). We eventually got no where. 

Please keep in mind - at no point was I reaching for more free loot. I was simply trying to explain why I was upset to someone who would listen. 

I have stayed at the Venetian/Palazzo several time before I was mistreated without issues. Now - I will never stay there again. 

They have no respect for their customers. They will blame you to cover their own behind. And to get any assistance, it's like pulling teeth. 

So if you want to pay big bucks for a pretty place with a comfy bed and you dont care about the service, then Venetain Palazzo is your best bet.Not a review on their food or drinks (don't really recall) but their service.  I was flipped off by my waitress after leaving the restaurant.  (My friend paid the bill since we were out celebrating my b-day, so no clue on tip other than there was one).  I have no desire to go to a place where an employee would do that to a paying customer, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone else either.If I could give zero stars I would. This show was terrible. I would have rather put the money I spent on the tickets into a hopeless slot machine. Superstars were unrealistic, and did not look like real singers. Overall, this show was a bust.I read Yelp about this, but still I went.  I was a prisoner to Luxor.  How bad can it be?!

DISGUSTING DISGUSTING DISGUSTING DISGUSTING DISGUSTING

You have been warned.  There is a reason why you can't see the food until after you pay!  The manager refunded me and you could tell he's done this countless times.  He seemed defeated.

Run!  Run far away!Nice service, but the food/entertainment was sub-par. $90 for 2 people, don't think I'd like to go back. Food TV did a whole bit on it and it wasn't as cracked up to be. :(You may be familiar with the term food porn. That's when your little buddies post pictures of restaurant dishes on Facebook. Food at the Sao Paulo cafe at the Rio definitely falls into the snuff porn category.

None of my friends were able to finish the food, because it was so horrible. We only ate there, because we had a conference meeting in the hotel and no time to look for food outside.I am absolutely astounded that this "Mexican Restaurant" has 3 and 1/2 stars on yelp! The only reason why they get a star from me is the bar atmosphere, they have a great bar with good happy hour deals, but that's it. 

Lets begin with the food, salsa and chips...absolute crap. The salsa tastes like canned crap from a 99 cents store, bland and just CRAP, I can go to Filiberto's across the street and find salsa 10 times better than what's at Loco's. The chips are salty as h***, tastes as if they poured the entire salt shaker into the basket, VERY SALTY, i'm not a goat, but thanks! I've been here for plenty of taco Tuesdays (mainly for the drinks). The tacos run between 1-2 bucks. The dollar tacos are shredded chicken or beef and the 2 dollar ones are shrimp, mahi mahi, and new york steak.I've tried all of the tacos, the shredded chicken and beef always dry and bland, same with the mahi mahi! The only tolerable tacos are the shrimp and new york steak, but once you go to a REAL Mexican restaurant, it makes those tacos look like poop! I've had their chimichanga's, again like another poster said about the beef, they put ground beef instead of shredded like what I expected and it sucked! I refuse to try anything from there again! If I go here it's only for happy hour once in a blue moon, but that's about it. Want to go to a real Mexican Restaurant try Los Taquitos off of 48th st and Elliot and La Canasta in Downtown, those are real Mexican restaurants. 

You know there is something wrong with a "Mexican Restaurant" when the hamburgers are better than the "Mexican food" they serve. Nuff said.I stopped going here after a completely horrible customer service experience. The cupcakes are fun, but the way the manager handled an order mishap left me speechless and searching for alternative cupcake places (there are many).One word- Terrible. After doing some major shopping around Tempe Marketplace, my girlfriend and I were HUNGRY!!! We were headed towards The Keg but upon passing San Felipe's Cantina we decided to detour. We were initially drawn to the restaurant because of it's festive decor and indoor/outdoor seating. The thought of munching on some chips and salsa over a girly conversations sounded great too! Boy were we WRONG!!! Once inside the restaurant, we soon found out that there couldn't be more to dislike about this place. The seating was uncomfortable, the staff was loud and scantily clad, and the food-ugh!! We ordered chips & salsa and a chicken and cheese quesadilla . My thought process was "how can anyone mess up chips&salsa or a quesadilla?!! So simple, right? O.M.G. Both were horrible. The basket of chips came out in a messy heap. There were two small salsa bowls but because they were placed in the basket so sloppily, salsa had spilled everywhere and the chips were soggy. Nothing worse than soggy chips. The quesedilla didn't deliver either. Bland and soggy. What a disappointment.I have Multiple Sclerosis, I can walk somewhat. However I can't walk well enough to make it through a Walmart. This one does not have any courtesy carts, they don't own any.... unlike every other mid to large store in the country. Which is not really surprising since this store is so run down and dirty, you can just see no one cares or cleans anything. I'm pretty happy I can't physically shop there and had to leave.Meh... I am not a fan. I went here for happy hour one time, and I was beyond disappointed. They must've had their D list chefs working... Cuz my food was GROSS. I couldn't even finish it. Kinda sucks spending that much money on nasty sushi.Food is good but the service and attitude of the staff makes this a no go placeDon't waste your money or your time.

What's wrong with this place:
1) You have to fill out a paper form to order your sandwich. This wouldn't be so ridiculously moronic if you didn't ALSO have to wait while the person working the register has to type in everything you just hand wrote down on the brown paper sack your sandwich ends up being delivered to you in.
2) The wait. Waiting. I'm still waiting... Now we have ONE of the two sandwiches from our order... 10 minutes later... finally we have our entire order. 10 minutes after we placed the order. TEN PLUS MINUTES FOR A SANDWICH. I don't mean to be overly negative, but at Subway I not only watch them make and toast my sandwich, it takes about four minutes from start to finish if there's no one in line ahead of me. This was the case at Which Wich. No one was ahead of me and I waited more than ten minutes per sandwich. Between having to fill our an order form by hand, waiting for the woman behind the counter to enter that form, then waiting for them to make the sandwich it took nearly 20 minutes. That is an abysmal failure of service. 
3) The food is just not worth the price or the wait. My sandwich was $9.00, it took more than 10 minutes to make, and I honestly couldn't finish it. I ordered a turkey sandwich, my wife order a turkey and ham club. In both cases the meat was minced. To be clear I mean it was chunked and what could only be described as put through a grinder so that the texture of the meat was unrecognizable to the original source of said meat. It was disgusting. It wasn't edgy, interesting, or unique. It was just gross. I literally couldn't finish it.

What's REALLY wrong with this place:
1) It feels like the concept was designed by a fifth grade teacher. It's essentially designed to make you follow a process that is both totally unnecessary and repetitious.  
2) When I asked the woman at the counter if I could just tell her what I want she said, "No." After I filled out the paper bag and handed it to her she asked me, "Did you figure it out okay?" So what she's really asking is if I'm too stupid to fill out a form. Thanks for insulting me, then serving me terrible food for which I over paid. 
3) All the food on a single order should come up at the same time. By the time my sandwich FINALLY appeared, my wife was more than half done with her food. The entire process on which this restaurants is based is designed to create a "UNIQUE" customer experience that really just translates into a stupid waste of time. 

What's good about this place:
Nothing. Seriously. Don't go here.I'm so done with this place. I ordered for the last time the other day as they are scammers. We order to-go food from here because they actually put out a rather tasty product but the process is just way too painful. Just placing the order is an incredible task as the people answering the phone speak next to know English.  Don't dare tag me a racist as I'm far from that but it's reality that you need to convey an order and have it made correctly - that's basic. To exacerbate this their on-line menu is conveniently numbered but it's THE WRONG ONE further adding to the confusion. What a hot mess. The last few orders we have gotten home and the order is wrong...errrrr! The topper is the last two times they have tried to scam when we had a coupon and that is where the line gets drawn when you lack integrity with your customers.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4Amj0F2Pk&feature=g-upl&context=G2f125afAUAAAAAAALAAChef Mario Batali should cringe that his name is associated with this restaurant. For Carnevino did not even deliver on the basics on our recent visit. 

First of all- this place has a high bar given all the talk about it and the prices that it charges. It was highly recommended to us so we decided to take our group there on our last night in Las Vegas. 

From the moment that we entered- the place was not up to a "fine dining" restaurant . . . .and trust me- I eat out alot. 

Our waiter had an attitude from the moment he walked over- wanting to know "who was in charge" and tossing menus and wine lists at us. We appointed a "person in charge" just because it seemed without it- nothing was going to move forward. 

Everything we asked for seemed to be an issue for this waiter. We wanted several appetizers to share for the table. He wanted to know exactly how many of each versus just figuring it out as a good waiter would. 

Two of us asked to split a steak and to have it sliced- he acted like it was huge imposition but we saw it being done at other tables in the place. 

Our wine sat unpoured on the back table until one from our group got up to pour the table some wine. Pouring our own wine? Really? At a fine dining restaurant? Unheard of. 

At this point- I called the manager over- but she was not very helpful other than getting our water glasses filled. I expected to her to minimally check back with us before we left to see if things had gotten any better.  But she didn't.  She didn't care either.

Our salads came up and were so bitter and salty that they were inedible so we sent them back. The pasta dish we ordered was no better than "Chef Boyardee". So far- service and the food were untenable for a fine dining restaurant. 

The best thing of the night? The steaks- but it takes a lot to mess those up. They were done perfectly and were quite tasty. But at $54 a steak- I would expect nothing less. 

This service debacle went on for 2.5 hours and at the end when we received our $1100 bill you can bet that the obligatory 20% tip for our server -who was terrible- was put right on there. Hard to believe.

There was no other compensation from the restaurant for the bad service other than they didn't charge us for the salads we didn't eat. 

Plenty of good restaurants in Las Vegas. Too bad this isn't one of them.What a joke. I must preface my review by saying that I'm not accustomed to eating at restaurants like this, where prices are so high you need to mortgage your house just to have dinner. But I was vacationing in Vegas with a large group of friends and this is where they wanted to eat. So I gave it a shot!

One quick glance at the menu and I knew I was going to break the bank. I took a moment to map out my game plan and decided on ordering the ravioli plus a side item so my wallet wouldn't take too much of a beating. My wife, also alarmed by the prices decided to order the gnocchi and a side item (quick recap, with a little wine we're way over $100 at this point. ouch)

My first red flag should have been when the waiter pointed out that the "ravioli" was actually a "raviol-o" - as in singular - as in just one piece of ravioli - as in what the hell? I scratched my head. $25 for 1 ravioli?? The price must be wrong or it must be a huge, delicious, giant, thick piece of ravioli. I asked the waiter to describe it and with his hands he made a rather large circle. So I assumed it would be a decent sized dish. OK I'll order it.

HA! 45 minutes later (yes 45 minutes) I was served the tiniest, thinnest, smallest ravioli you have ever seen. It was roughly the the size and thickness of a ritz cracker. 1 cracker. for $25!! Then came my "side item", also rather small. I wish I had a stopwatch at the dinner table - it took me about 45 seconds to eat everything. Roughly 3 spoonfuls and I was done!

My friends (all of whom have large bank accounts) ordered many dishes. I was shocked at how small everything was. A a spoonful here, a tiny dollop there, and somehow these "dishes" were worthy of $50 price tags. I just sat there in disbelief. I sat there watching other people eat because I had already blown my $100 on my single ravioli and my wifes pasta. 

In the end our bill came out to roughly $200 - for two people who basically ate nothing and drank a little wine. It was so bad it ended up ruining the rest of my night. I was not a happy camper and while everyone else went back to gambling I grabbed a slice of pizza at the hotel (delicious, i should have eaten there) and went to my room to watch tv. 

Look - I understand that there are lots of people out there with money to burn who like to live that way - they're willing to spend $50 on a tiny scoop of pasta because the restaurant is "exclusive" and has a big fancy chef's name attached to it - but give me a break! My "raviolo" didn't even taste good! It had almost no flavor and my side dish tasted microwaved. My wife said her gnocchi was fine but she had tasted better pasta at small chain restaurants back home. 

My wife summed it up best when she turned to me at the table and whispered: this is the most pretentious place I have ever been to in my life.

0 stars if I could.One of the worst experiences ever...Fantastic food, but I wish I could give this location zero stars for my experience.  

On Father's Day (two weeks ago) my family went to Black Bear Diner to celebrate my Grandfather.  There was a total of five adults and we ended up spending about $50.  The food was absolutely worth the money!  I got "The Griz" and it arrived on two gigantic plates filled to the brim.  It tasted great and was satisfying.  We were also celebrating a Birthday in the group and the server brought out a free peach cobbler for her.  

The place was busy and a little messy inside, but this is to be expected on a day like this.  Up until this point, we were having a great time, but going to the restrooms changed everything!

I had to take my very elderly Grandfather to the men's room, where there was what appeared to be a Black Bear Diner worker (wearing one of their shirts) exiting a stall, that was not properly flushed.  There was a second Black Bear Diner worker entering the men's room behind us.  The two workers exchanged fist bumps and words, before the first worker (who just left a used toilet) exited the men's room WITHOUT WASHING HIS HANDS!  I know he didn't wash his hands because since I was holding the door open for my Grandfather, my back was to the sinks and watched him slip right out the door.  

If I did not have to constantly be at my Grandfather's side, i would have followed the worker out of the men's room and confronted him.  To add insult to injury, there is a sign next to the sinks saying employees must wash hands.  After exiting the men's room and washing up, we left immediately.  My stomach was churning thinking that this guy might have handled food without having clean hands.  As we left, a worker at the front desk was notified and she said she would take care of it.  

I left an email that night with the main email address for Black Bear Diner and the Gilbert store.  After one week, I did not have any response, so I went to Facebook, where they finally responded.  I ended up speaking to a very nice lady at the Black Bear Diner headquarters.  However, since this location is a franchise store, it seems that headquarters cannot do much.  I told the lady at their headquarters to pass along my contact info to the Gilbert store.  It has been two weeks since the visit and have not heard anything from the Gilbert store.  

The best food in the world can not make up for a worker not washing their hand after using the restroom.I can not stand this restaurant. Every time I go the food is inconsistent.  I've had the "Dave's Special" (not on menu but my co-worker goes so much there is a dish named after him) with salmon, sauteed spinach, pasta, and tomatoes tossed in olive oil.  I've given this dish a try a couple of  times and each was different. Once the fish portion was slight but the spinach was perfectly sauteed and wilted. Second time, the fish portion was large but we had a BIG bowl of spinach, little bit of pasta and hardly any tomatoes and the spinach was raw - never touched the skillet.  
So I give another dish on the menu a try - the appetizer of bruschetta with prosciutto, brie, apple, 3 different types. The brie was all rind and the prosciutto is like the kind you get at the Albertson's deli.  Really!?
I no longer frequent this restaurant and boycott it if its an option for an office birthday lunch.We were ignored by the servers, received the wrong wine on a re-order and the food was disappointing. I will not come back.OMG, we stayed at Harrah's and happened to past by the cafe after clubbing and saw this huge steak and eggs deal for $5.99. When the food came, the steak was so chewy and wasn't cooked right. The hashbrown was cold, the only thing that was decent are the eggs.This is a faux healthy market. They have stuff with hydrogenated oils here. Read the labels!!!!!!!!!!!

Its not all healthy Buyer beware!!!!

I hate theis place. Plus Trader Joes is cheaper anywayThis was the worst customer service I've experienced anywhere in a long time. Tonight our party of four arrived and sat at the bar and ordered a round of beers. Noticing that a booth in the bar area opened up, we asked the bartender if we could take the booth, he said yes and we politely closed our tab with him and took our beers with us to the booth. When we sat down, a server came up to us and asked, "Do you need a server?" and we said, not at this time but we could use more drinks in a while. Then a second server came up to us and she asked if we needed food. We now felt as though something was wrong so we asked if we should not be seated in the booth and she said yes, we shouldn't be seated there but it was not big deal. It was obvious it was a big deal because she could not hide her negative attitude and sour expression. So, in short, we were made to feel bad for being seated in the wrong location even though our intention was to enjoy a few rounds of drinks over conversation. We were checked upon  every 5 minutes and felt rushed and uncomfortable by our server the remainder of the night. Sorry Cadillac Ranch, your poor customer service means a loss of 4 customers who will not be back. Good luck, there are too many other great places to choose from for drinks and relaxation at Tempe Market Place.If you really are a experience foodie whom loves seafood, you are going to hate this place. I went with my Mom and Husband and we ordered the fried Alligator to start. It wasnt bad  with the first bite but the longer it sat it turned into some weird texture. We love the Fried Alligator at Pappadeaux and was excited to have a restaurant closer to our homes that serves it. It looked different, taste different and really made us wonder what we were eating.

For our Main dishes, I ordered the boiled shrimp, hubby had catfish, and mom the Etoufee. My shirmp looked good when they came, however when I went to eat them i noticed that there were not cleaned. You can see a clear sign of both veins in the top and bottom of the shirmp. Mind you I am a seafood junkie and I have had shrimp in Hawaii from a truck and prepared the same way and were cleaned. I told the manager about this and he said that they don't clean their shrimp nor did they have too. I sent them back and did not order anything else. My mom's Etouffee looked like a can of Cream of Chicken soup an jiggled like Jello. Matter of fact it was the exact color of Cream of Chicken soup. If you have never had Etouffee this might fly. However, I have had my first experience with Cajun Cusine in New Orleans, LA and none of this looked or tasted like Cajun cusine. 

Now to my husbands Catfish?? I really don't believe it was Catfish. It was shaped like Chicken Breast and the texture was totally different. 

Needless to say, I am a extreme foodie who dines out at least 4x a week or more. I love Cajun food and was so excited to have a place closer to my house than my favorite in  West Phoenix, Pappadeaux's.

However, besides this food not tasting good, it is a disgrace to everything that relates to Cajun Cuisine. We gladly left while not to mention the Manager, Bar Tender, and waitress all decided to go for a smoke break in the front of the restaurant while patrons were still eating. We said goodbye and never returned again.Took our scooter in to get the stator replaced almost a month ago. Every single week they have had some excuse as to why it was not done. Last week we went in and were promised it would be done by Tuesday (today), but no surprise it still had not been touched.I have lived in Vegas for now over a year, and I have to say that by far this was the worst restaurant I have been too. 

When we first came in it looked fun, loud, dark - perfect for a younger crowd looking to have some fun. We decided to sit outside because Vegas weather is to be enjoyed as much as possible and were quickly concerned by the size of the menu. 

I have never seen a menu this large. Yes 2 pages are of the brews that they have on tap but the other 5 pages (back and front) are of food they serve. They serve pizza, soup, salad, vegetarian, tacos, fish, sushi, dessert, sandwiches, burgers, pasta EVERYTHING. This is when I got nervous. Usually when I see a menu over 2 pages I'm wondering if they're a "Jack of all trades and a King of NONE." As I looked through the menu every item had this grandiose listing of ingredients that looked as if they belonged in a high end restaurant. As far as I knew I was in a restaurant that cherished beer and was named the "YARD HOUSE". It was obvious that they were overcompensating or just flat out LYING about what they put in their food. After reading a novel of a menu for over 10 minutes I thought I had finally decided what I wanted. I ordered a ranch side salad and their "famous" mac n cheese. My husband ordered a BBQ burger - well done with french fries. We did not order any brew. 

When they brought out my salad I was surprised to see that they had used a hot plate to serve my cold salad. It did not help the taste. The lettuce itself was very weak and not crunchy at all like Iceberg lettuce generally is. After eating a few bites I saw something dark and shiny in the bottom of my bowl...I began to dig it out and realized that it was a long thin dark black hair. I stopped eating. 

A few minutes after I stopped eating I asked for our waitress to take the salad away due to the hair and she apologized and asked if I would like something else instead. Just to be safe I ordered the Caesar salad. The salad quickly came out within two minutes and I was excited to try it because I LOVE Caesar dressing. I took a huge bite and for some reason my nose and my pallete tasted and smelled something skunky...I had assumed it may have been the man who had just walked by and continued to take another bite. After that bite I knew it was the dressing. The Yard House had tried to "remake" caesar dressing and it was awful. It tasted like someone had just rubbed their dirty gym sock all over my salad. I didn't take another bite.



Shortly after that our meals had arrived and as I am the BIGGEST mac and cheese fan I was super excited to taste their rendition of an old favorite. They had used some "fancy" pasta with a few different cheeses, chicken, bacon, mushrooms and a bread crumble on top. The cheese sauce was good, the pasta itself was way overcooked and too soft, the bacon was soft..which was not appealing and some of the chicken was cold as if they had frozen slices and just heated them for the dish. I pushed everything but the pasta and the cheese to the side and tried to enjoy it. After a couple of bites I started to feel really sick. I'm not really sure what caused it but I honestly felt like I was going to throw up. It might have had something to do with the fact that a few seconds before the table next to us OUTSIDE had ordered fish and I was drowning in bad fish odor at our table. My husband even complained of the stench. That fish was IN NO WAY FRESH. It smelt like rotten salmon that had been sitting under a heat lamp all day. I almost gagged when they first brought it out. I think that, and the combo of feeling like I ate a dirty sock and soft pasta may have made me sick. 


My husband said that his burger was alright, and the fries were okay, but really stringy. 

Halfway into eating my mac and cheese a woman came out to speak to me about the hair that I had found in my salad. She let me know that it was NOT a hair, and that it was actually corn silk, left over from the "fresh" corn they had just chucked to make my salad. I've eaten fresh corn, canned corn and frozen corn all of my life. They have very distinct differences. I know, that that was frozen corn. It was gooey and hard to chew, fresh corn just pops in your mouth. I don't know why anyone had come out to argue with me about what I found in my salad. Last time I chucked corn the silk was usually white to a yellowish color. Not BLACK. Nice try though.



Anyway, my husband and I both left feeling very nauseous and the drive back to Henderson was NOT a pleasant one. The entire drive home I was trying my hardest not to throw up. I don't want to explain what the rest of my night was like but I'm sure you get the picture. We wont be back here.I am honestly baffled that this horrible place has so many good reviews. I will never eat here again. I'm just glad we only bought 1 of the restaurant.com coupons.

First off, they picked just about the worst place to have their restaurant, there's no parking at all. We had about a 30 minute wait, which wasn't too bad for a Friday evening. There was a mix up and they tried to seat the same party twice, when we told them those people had already been seated they made us feel like we were lying just to get the table. Between that and the parking we were all already pretty annoyed. 

Once we were seated we got our drinks pretty quickly, but for the rest of the night we had to flag some one down to get refills. We decided what we were getting but we weren't sure if they wanted us to mark it down on the paper menus they give you (since we've been to some places that just use them as menus and don't like you writing on them) the waitress finally came back, when we started to tell her what we wanted she was like "Oh, you have to fill that out" and left, didn't even give us a pen or anything. She didn't show up again for at least another 10 minutes and another waiter had taken pity on us (he was also the one who we usually ended up asking to get our refills) and taken our order. 

Now to the food! We got 2 orders of Gyoza, they were pretty good but very soggy. Not just in a non-fried way, but more a fried and then left in water for a while kind of texture, it was rather off-putting. They didn't get our second order of Gyoza out until we'd finished our rolls. Our friends ordered chicken fried rice and a Philly roll, they said both were good but they'd had better. My husband and I ordered a shrimp tempura roll, a las vegas roll and a haha roll. The tempura had been overcooked and they actually had the nerve to make the bottom half of the roll a double layer of rice and seaweed! The haha roll was mediocre at best. The las vegas roll was actually very good but we had to scarf it down because they'd forgotten to make it for us (we didn't see a waiter for at least 20 minutes after they dropped off the food) and we were late for a movie. 

They're just very cheap, they only give you 5 piece rolls and they use seriously huge pieces of cucumber and carrots so they can skimp on more expensive ingredients. I assume they do this because they offer all you can eat and because they're one of the only sushi places here that do that people apparently are content to let them get away with it. In areas where all you can eat is something you find in almost every sushi restaurant (Nevada) this is so not acceptable.  I imagine that the all you can eat option is the only reason they've stayed in business as I know of a few other sushi joints that are much, much better within a 15 minute drive. 

I'd rather pay more and have really good sushi and great service than put up with this place just for the all you can eat option.It's located in an old house on 7th St. in the Coronado area.  Patio is awesome and has a slight European/Spanish feel to it.  The food in the deli looked appetizing and gourmet.  I ordered the prosciutto sandwich and my wife had the sirloin.   The bread was quite good and appeared to be made on location.  The prosciutto was decent.

However the sirloin came out bloody at first which the owner admitted before even placing on our table.  It is supposed to be medium, per his admission, so we were confused why he even brought it out.  When my wife asked him about this he leered at her and said he knew what "medium meant", and then took it back to the kitchen.  Before this he talked to her rudely when she was looking for the restroom.  The restrooms are labeled in Italian which my wife speaks, along with French, Spanish, and English.  She paused in front of the door to adjust her purse and the aforementioned owner told her "that's right, it means ladies room in Italian", in a tone you would take with a child.  After the sirloin issue, my wife and I just stared at each other in disbelief at the audacity of this fat, bad mannered, self righteous man.

When the sirloin came back out it was cooked properly but lacked flavor.  The bread was the only thing worth eating on the plate.

The server who took our order was this prissy guy who lacked not only personality but any sense of being helpful.  I don't know if the owner is trying to create this New York/European "poor service because we can" atmosphere but, please, that doesn't fly here and anyone that thinks this is acceptable must have very low self esteem.  You can't talk to customers like that, I don't care how good your food may be, and in this case it was mediocre.

And to clarify, I hate chain restaurants, always try to support local business, and know good food and service when I experience it.  So it's not that I "don't get it".  I will never return to this restaurant and implore you not to go here either.  Oh, and if you are the owner, rest assured I will be scathing your restaurant on other review websites along with telling every single person I know how rude you are and how mediocre your cooking is.  I promise you will make less money because of your behavior towards my wife.This review is for their Lounge. 

I was walking with my group from Diablo Cantina to The Bellagio, and one of their many promoters on the street convinced us to go to Brand. I have stayed at the Monte Carlo before, and I did not even know they had a lounge. Anyways, he confirmed with us it would be $20 bucks each. He even walked us to the line. We saw that the line was a little long, but he assured us it would only be about a five minute wait. After a while in line I noticed that the only reason it was getting shorter, was because people were leaving the front of the line. Someone from the back of the line yelled at the hostess monitoring the line and told her that they were spewing lies, but some how we did not connect the dots. When we got through the rope, the girl working the line told us it would be $30 each. We confronted her and told her the name of the promoter that told us it would be $20. She did not even consider this, and goes on and on about how it was technically Saturday night, and now we had to pay the "weekend" price. Naturally, we left. 

Either the staff had NO sufficient communication, or they were just building up a line in order to get people to come to their obscure lounge.

I'm sure it must be a lovely restaurant.$$$$$$$$$$$$$ Need i say more? 
I ordered a chicken breast dish. It was a half a breast and wouldn't fill a child. And they had the nerve to charge me $28 for that! Amazing. I don't care where I am, if i pay for a meal, it should be a meal. I am a grown man, 6'3' and 215lbs. I don't expect a buffet, but this place is a joke. 
Forgot my beer. 
Terrible sushi. 
I will upload the photos so you can see this joke in real time.Keep in mind this review is based on the first time I went to this restaurant 2 summers ago- before I lived in Las Vegas.

I went here for my cousin's ballet recital dinner and ordered the portabello burger.

"Portabello" made me think of "steak" (that's right, I didn't know what portabello was!) so I ordered it. 
When I got my burger, I bit into it and discovered that it was not a steak sammich, but a mushroom. A big mushroom.

I like mushrooms and regularly eat them- so I ate the burger. Something about it was not right though and I stopped 2/3s way through.

Later that night I was having agonizing sharp stomach pains. I was sweating and drifting in and out of sleep.

I continued to feel ill and have additional symptoms throughout the night and into the day.

I started to feel better the next night and was well enough to get out of bed, and even eat at a restaurant in the hotel.


After that experience when returning to Vegas, and eventually moving here, I've time and time again disagreed to going to cheeburger cheeburger due to this incident.

I would not recommend going there- I wouldn't even go back if I was offered free food.AVOID AVOID AVOID. I was in town visiting my parents and we wanted to take a day trip to Mount Charleston. We decided to rent a car for our trip. Well, long story short, our vehicle (a Nissan Altima with only ~13k miles on it) stopped working forty minutes later on the freeway. We were promised assistance with a replacement car within an hour. It took them FOUR freaking hours to finally get us our replacement car while we were stuck on the side of the desert, even though I gave them VERY clear instructions as to where we were. The whole time the service reps were giving me the runaround on the phone, saying that the driver was on his way and was lost. For FOUR hours? Yeah, okay.

They tried to resolve the situation later by offering us two free vouchers (note: only after my dad laid out the rage). You know how terrible this company is? Well, Chinese people tend to love free stuff, and we didn't even take those vouchers because we'd rather pay to NOT ever use this company again.

Funny story: one of the service reps on the phone told us our car failure was a "known issue" with the Altima due to changes in elevation and hot weather. WTF?! Do they know they are located in Vegas.. which is in a desert climate.. and is surrounded by mountains? And furthermore, if it's a "known issue," why continue renting this car out to people? Shady, so shady.Not a fan!  Greasy, cheap (not in a good way) Chinese food.  Came here for lunch with a few co-workers.  Ordered a lunch combo came with egg drop soup and crunch things (which we had to share).  For the combo, I had mongolian beef, which came with fried rice and noodles (hence the name).  I ate it because I was hungry, but it was completely unsatisfying.  It was a waste of calories!

The food overall just had a generic taste.  Not worth coming back to.  I'd rather go to Panda Express for greasy, Americanized Chinese food next time.Although I wanted to stay here I never ended up staying due to the reservations department.  The front page of their website prominently lists multiple package promotions.  After unsuccessfully trying to book the promotion from the website I called the reservation phone number.  The lady on the phone told me that all of the packages showed no availability on any day of any month so she would override it for me in the system.  I wasn't sure what package I wanted to I told her I would call back.  When I called back I got a different person on the phone and she refused to give me the package price.  I asked to speak with the supervisor and when I was connected to Enrique he told me I should have booked with the first agent and refused to give me the package price even though it continues to be advertised on the front page of the website.  I feel this is not only bad customer service but also bait-and-switch as they actively advertise packages that they have no intention o giving you.Check in is at 3pm the resort areas close at 5pm no swimming no spa after 5pm  yet your charged a extra resort fee becuase it is a resort. No room access to patio even though their is one but its locked. You are not informed until you arive that their is a no smoking rule for the entire premises except the parking lot. Also odd but their was a note on the bed when I checked in that sheets are only changed upon request ( sick ) makes you wonder how often they get changed. The only plus was the jucuzzi tub in the room. Everything is at the Palms it is a long walk away only thing at Palms Place is a restaurant its just a condo set up you get really nothing but to pay a high price.  I am a local in Vegas and take it from me their is much better elsewhere.Airport is airport food, not the best and kind of expensive. But when your here you have no choice. Went cause I was craving a whopper. But as soon as I got there I should have stopped and turned back around to look for something else. There was a man infront of me who had complained about his burger, I should have token that as a sign. But no. I ordered a whopper with extra onions (which is $1 extra)  and went my gate . Which was a pretty far walk from their only Burger King location. Take a bite of it and its cold and only find two slices of onion. I was really upset because I had to pay extra for it. And also, who doesn't put any pickles in a burger. If your burger on the screen is advertised with pickles, I'm sure it needed to have pickles. Never again will I go there. I will happily walk myself to the E gates to get Carl's jr.REI, you had such a good thing going...why, oh why...

Sometimes an event lives great because it offers so much more than it intends. When it's a store putting it on for the sake of it's customers (and I'd like to think as a thank you for loyalty) it goes far beyond a vehicle for making a sale.

We have loved the Garage Sale that this location put on for so very long. We would get in line at 5am with the other die hards and laugh at the people waking up in their sleeping bags (while secretly wishing that we had the cojones to do the same since they were going to get the VERY best deals). A couple years running Krispy Kreme came across the street with boxes of donuts to cheer our early morning wait.

But it was the people that made it. We'd hang out in the early morning hours with other outdoor enthusiasts trading stories and secrets about local trails, lakes and camping sites.

...and then, with nervous excitement we'd charge into the parking lot like mad men, snatching up sleeping bags and hiking shoes for pennies on the dollar, thanking the REI gods that we, the chosen few, the members, would have such an opportunity to feed our equipment cravings at unheard of prices.

Flash forward to yesterday...I evidently missed the memo that the "new and improved" garage sale was happening in the store, up in the clinic room. Clutching my 20% off coupon we made our way through the crowded parking lot, J. with visions of using it for a new bike seat while I ready to fight him for a chance to restock my hiking sock drawer at 20% savings. We walked in to signs advertising the garage sale and  a very long line of people waiting to go up stairs for their finds of the year. J. got in line and I went to hunt for new feet cushions. Several minutes later, he found me to let me know that he had to get out of line to get tickets for the sale, but was assured that it was a 30 minute wait and he was going to  the bike department until our numbers were called.

I was dubious...the line looked like it was for an E-ticket ride at Disneyland and the people in it weren't looking any happier than if it was 98º with screaming kids at said park. Long story short...it was 2 full hours before we were called to that upstairs secret clubhouse. Once there, we were told we had a very generous 10 minutes to shop...we picked up a few things. set them down in frustration when neither of us could get to the clothes and walked out of the store empty handed.

REI management, this is an epic fail in my opinion. You turned a wonderful community event into a vehicle to hold your members hostage in hopes of their making full price purchases while waiting for a disappointing chance to make the killer buy that we dreamed yearly about...and worse yet, you didn't even make the sale that we intended...you didn't sell the $53 bike seat, you didn't sell the $17.95 socks but you did manage to piss off a couple of members who have been on your roster for 25 years.

Sometimes a sales event is more than the sum of the profits or in this case the decluttering of the returns bin. Sometimes it's a way to show your customers the loyalty they've shown you... we heard repeatedly that this was much easier on the employees and management than the old parking lot sale. This was much harder on us as consumers and so unsatisfying to wait two hours for a 10 minute opportunity. The parking lot sale was  one day of chaos for the employees a couple times a year...is that too much to ask from a store that we've been loyal too for half our lives?I bought an annual Platinum Wash card (60 washes) a little less than a year ago and still have 35 washes left and it expires 6/14/09. I asked if they could extend it, as I bought the 60 washes at half price and they said no which basically means that I prepaid full price. 

I left a message for Joe Curry on his voicemail on 6/11 and he did not return my call. I wanted to try to work this out but they wanted no part of it.

So I invited my friends and family down this morning 6/13/09 for a car wash on my card. After 6 cars including mine were washed the owner Joe Curry said that my card was expired and that he was confiscating it. I showed him my receipt that was just printed that said my card did not expire untill 6/14/09 and he said "Nope it is expired now" and stuck my card in his pocket and asked me to leave immediately.

Theses people are very dishonest so Buyer beware!I have been here once and the food wasn't very good. We ordered the artichoke dip and and white spaghetti. The artichoke dip wasn't very good and I could have made better pasta at home. There was an Indian restaurant that opened up in the same plaza and closed down within a couple of months due to slow business. I live in the area and drive by this restaurant several times a day and it is NEVER busy and yet it is still open. Things that make you hmmm...........The food here was delicious! The dessert is very overpriced! I can get the same dessert options at Whole Foods around the corner for a quarter the price. I was disappointed about the service. We watched as all the other tables were waited on while we sat with our waters....
After we finished eating, we waited patiently for about fifteen minutes for our check. We finally pulled another waiter aside and she gladly helped us. As we walked out of the restaurant, there was our original slow waiter sitting on her phone and smoking. 
Not going to be going back. Not worth the money with service like that.So i went in to the store because i saw a lawn mower that was on their site saying its available for pick up in store. i go in and they do not have that product. Long story short. they said they will order it to come to the store and i say ok.. I order it and pay for it on the spot. i wait two weeks as the delivery said it would take. called them and guess what. they didnt even tell the warehouse to ship it and apparently lowes doesnt even carry that product. why is it on the site then and why did you make me pay for. then i wait another 4 weeks calling every monday, wed, and friday cuz the guy keeps telling me its gonna come in on those trucks. for four weeks i did this.. and when i talked to the manager ray on the 6th week. he says im so sorry ill take care of you. when i finally recieved it yesterday and i asked for him to come. he didnt even bother, he called the guy and told em hes going out for lunch and he doesnt have time for that.. lost a customer and i wont be shopping here again. even if i have to pay 10 dollars extra im going to home depot to save time and frustration. this location sucks. plus home depot said they price match on the spot. even if you show them the online ad on your phone..Horrible service every time I come here. The sales associates in mobile have absolutely no clue what they are doing and take their sweet time when there is a line. Employees are very uneducated about the products. Spare yourself the anger and don't come hereNot sure what the big deal is about their wings. They aren't that good and most of them are sorta dry. 

I think they cook them too long or something. I've tried this place 3 times and still very inconsistent with all the wings when you eat them 

Cool that you can get all these different flavors but wish the meat would be more moist. 

Service wasn't bad at all so atleast they have that. 

Also they have the UFC fight be they charge a admission which is kind of stupid IMO. And you have to spend a certain amount during the fight. Wtf is that, this place is cheap as hell

I won't be back and I go to a real bar to watch the fights without having to pay.I'd love to give a half a star but Yelp won't let me. 

I'd have lived at Roosevelt Square since may 2010, and just recently moved out at the end of September (2012) upon moving out I was hit with a $391 bill for carpet and carpet seal replacement (I'm assuming the padding under the carpet) 

The only thing they went off is just the manager doing the walk through saying she smelled cat urine (with no real evidence, black light and/or ammonia tests done by a third party) and the funny part is that I've been chain smoking cigarettes in that apartment for two years and there was no mention of her smelling that. 

The way that Berkshire did this is really just a way to extort money out of you if you're a pet owner. 

At $30 a month for having a pet and being there for 26 months and paying a $250 'non refundable deposit' I've paid over $1000 I paid to these apartments because I own a cat. That's not including the carpet replacement that I have to pay. Berkshire Properties is obviously out there to manage (and do a horrible job of it, there has been an instance where they LOST MY RENT CHECK and I had to correct one of the office workers on the correct rent amount) but to steal money from you once you move out. It seems like the general consensus with people on yelp and even with people I know personally that vacated these apartments

Please understand if you have a pet or animal of some sort and paid that non refundable deposit, YOU WILL PAY FOR THE CARPET no matter what. (using that phrase 'non refundable' and 'deposit' together is misleading because a deposit is money you pay and get back if there is no damage) So basically look at it as money you're giving to them. 

Walls are paper thin. I've had two noise complaints against me but my upstairs neighborhood could do jumping jacks, and what sounded like roller skating upstairs and no one complained about that because he/she has been doing it up to when i moved out

Stepping in dog poop on the side walk and walking by the dog waste bins that hasn't been changed out for a while was generally unpleasant, but its not too bad i guess..

The only great thing about this place is the location, being close to the 'downtown' area, and light rail. Pita jungle is awesome and Lola's and Fair trade .

be prepared to pay some money when you leave is all I'm saying people.Love the area- too bad management was horrible.

Too many stories to post, but will give you 1 just to convey their mindset.

I go out of town, have my dad check on my place and my pet, which he has done before.

He calls me to let me know the call box code wasn't working and he couldnt get in.

I call the manager the next day and ask what was up and am told-

"we disabled the codes a few months ago"

....ok well were you going to let the tenants know?

"we figured you guys would have figured it out by now"


....uhhhmmmm, well I didn't until just now and now my dad can't get into my place to check on my cat, so can you guys turn it back on so he can or give him a fob so he can open the gate and get in

"you can mail us a money order for 50 dollars and then we can give him a keyfob"

....I'm in another state, and that will take at least a day or 2 for guys get it in the mail, is there anything you can do to fix this and am in shock that your only solution is for me to mail a MO to you guys..."


it went on and on and I thought it was a prank it was so outlandish- THEY disable the call boxes, they don't let us know, then want me to mail a MO to them so my dad can get one for 3 days.....


insane


when I left that horrible manager was promoted up....and the good people in the office were on there way out


no matter how cool a place looks, NEVER move into a place with management this incompetent!

2 years there, was going to stay another, but when this was going on (and one of MANY crazy issues) I told them the way there were handling it, this would cause me to move

"do what you got to do"


ok- in Tempe now= :DOk so heres the deal. I have had alot of sushi in my time at many different places. Out if all these years I have had one bad experience. That is here at J.K Sushi
The room was pretty dang warm, not the biggest of deals but warm none the less. 
We had the lunch bowl with eel and the caterpillar, with the crunchy roll salmon jalapeno.
The beginning starter which was the miso soup was bland and flavorless. I was like ok no big deal. The lunch bowl came out. The chicken was fried with a bottled sauce thrown on top after cooked. No real flavor and bit down on some cartlidge a few times, the vegetables were under cooked also lacking in any kind of flavor. So now we have our sushi. The sliced brownish tented green caterpillar came out and it was ok. Nothing special no biggie. Its the same for the other sushi except the eel. Eel is my favorite sushi anywhere that serves it. I try it here and my eel doesnt smell right. I take a bite and to my surprise it doesn't taste good. Not a good as flavor but i honestly think they served me bad eel. The smell was so bad i can smell it as she brought it out. We pay our bill and then she asks why i didn't tip. I was very nice to her and I explained it to her in a very nice manor and she pretended not to understand me and walked away. This was my first trip and my last. I don't ever not tip which was also a first time for me. I felt bad till she snubbed me.Pathetic, especially when the concierge says its "one of the top 10 Chinese restaurants in the nation".  

The food, even if at half the price, would be considered uninspiring.  The service was just as bad .. but at least it was expensive.  $100 for three bad meals.

Do not eat here, it's worse than bad, it's boring and expensive.  You can pay the same amount and eat at Nobu and have a much better experience.This was the worst Indian food I've ever tried in Canada. I went there for their buffet and it was absolutely horrible. Everything was bland and you can tell they reuse their old chicken in their curries. The best Indian restaurant in the KW area is definitely Empress of India. Avoid Masala Bay as they reuse old food.The best thing about this place is the location. Really easy to get to with a lot of parking. But the food and service are really lacking. Menu was typical and bland AND typical North American cuisine. We definitely expected something a little more colorful with a name like that. The service was also spotty. The restaurant wasn't busy yet it took a few minutes to seat us, never mind serve us (and we were a group of two). I sent my food back twice: once because it was cold and the second time because the meat sauce was missing (after being sent back for heating). All in all, money not well spent. This place is pretty pricey for the area and has nothing of value to offer.Absolutely the worst restaurant in town, I cannot believe it is still in business. The place is so outdated; it looked like a scene from The Shining. All I could smell when I walked in the door was cigarette smoke. When I passed the salad bar it looked like none of the food had been changed in hours, maybe even days. When we were seated the first thing I noticed was a few dead flies in the window sill and about a quarter inch of dust on all the fake plants and the window sill. All the glassware and silverware were covered in smudges and fingerprints, which is one thing if you're eating at your local East Side's but at a restaurant where the average plate is $35.00-$40.00 or more I would expect clean cutlery and dishes at the very least. When the food came several of us had ordered the New York Striploin and yet no 2 plates looked the same. Some cuts of steak were thick and short, some were thin and long, they were all cooked rare even though they were all requested at different temperatures with one being well done. One of my fellow diners had to send her salmon back twice and it still wasn't cooked thoroughly so she gave up and ate the veggies, that quite frankly tasted frozen. When we told the waitress about the undercooked meals she seemed almost offended and was defensive about the issue and reluctant to take them back. Also I should say when the food was brought back to the kitchen it came back with the meat having been re-heated and the sides all cold.  All in all I would say this restaurant was a terrible waste of money and if it weren't for the good company the evening would have been a write off too. I would not recommend going to Golf Steakhouse because it is significantly over priced and the food, décor and atmosphere seem to have come out of a totally different era.The only reason they are getting 1 star is because you can't select 0 .... But their service here is absolutely HORRIBLE!! 

We sat for 15 minutes with no one coming for our drink order even after going to the bar to ask for a waiter we waited another 5 minutes and all they did was stare at us.. Needless to say we got up and left . Spend your money some where else!I read reviews from yelp about Sugarcane and since we were eating at Sushisamba and offered to check out the place, we thought to try it out.  When we walked inside, it was practically empty (maybe 10 people at most!).  The dance floor was small and there was 1 bar to the corner.  I didn't pay attention the the music, but I know it didn't really impress me and my friends.  There were 2 girls dancing, which tried to liven up the room, but since there was no one really there, we decided to leave.  We were there for maybe 5-10 minutes, and it didn't look like it was going to get any better.  It was already past 11pm so it wasn't a timing issue.  I think that since this place is relatively new and probably not promoted as well, this place still has some time to build up crowd and appeal.The worst club that I've been to my whole entire life. Actually, PURE was the worst, so i guess LAVO gets second place! 

I've been here twice, both bad experiences. The music sucks-- it can't get any worse than that. They play old hip-hop music from the 2000s... like P-Diddy, Mario, etc. WTF?! Where's the recent hit music?! Someone mentioned that the crowd here is ghetto. It is ghetto indeed! 

The drinks suck. It tasted really watery with alcohol.I try to get my boyfriend to try new things. Especially things that I grew up on. But when I take him here, I feel stupid. Because 
1: the girl who made his ice cream put to much in his cup & by the time we had gotten home, his ice cream melted over the edges. 
2: there was a HAIR strand in his ice cream !
3: they do not filter out their toppings so the marshmallows in my ice cream were nice & hard. Gotta love hard marshmallows right? 
I love Cold Stone but I WILL NOT be going back to this one. I have never had such a bad experience with Cold stone before.This place is he absolute worst car wash in the valley! Stay clear! You wait an hour to get your car or truck back dirty! All they do is try and pressure sell you on stuff. They are really bad! You have been warned!!My classmates and I have been to the Mixed Zone Cafe quite a bit because it's close to our school. Half the time the food is good and the other half is so-so. At least until our most recent visit. The dishes we ordered came with fried rice and when we began eating it, instantly realized the rice was spoiled. After the taste came the funky smell. Definitely bad rice. The waitress exchanged the spoiled rice for undercooked white rice. Less than appealing. One of my cohorts asked to cancel the entire order, she did not want to eat food that touched spoiled rice, understandably so. 
She was told to eat it anyway because they were still charging her for the meal, regardless of the quality of the food. Then she was told to take the food home to her kids. When asked if the restaurant would be responsible for hospital bills related to food poisoning, she was told "no" because she wasn't "being forced to anything." WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER! And not to mention the HEALTH aspects!
I caution anyone who enters that place to look for a Health Dept grade. Wish we had before eating.This was my first time to a Tilted Kilt and it was awful. I had this image of this chain as hot chicks and descent food. Um...no and no. Nasty meth looking skanks and shitty food. I already felt dirty enough from being on the west side but being at this place made me want to take a bleach bath. Since I dont drive a monster truck with balls or look like I just got back from a sand rail/quad event, I was out of place. I ordered somesort of draft beer and it was delish, but that's not saying much since you can't F that up. I also ordered the calamari and ew! If you like very little squid loaded with grittle then this is your dish. After 20 minutes here I was looking for a way out. If you end up here, all I can say is good luck!I usually go to the #1 Reflexology on Spring Mountain, and I was delighted to learn they had opened another location just around the corner from my home. Since the one on Spring Mountain has always been a favorite of mine despite the fact that it can be hit or miss sometimes, I decided to try the closer location on Flamingo this time. Big mistake. I walked in and discovered I was the only customer there, and the three Asian employees were off in a corner arguing loudly with eachother. I waited a while for them to aknowledge me as I knew they heard the bell chime when I walked in. Nothing. My patience ran out when the thought of spending an hour in that room with the strong smell of freshly microwaved Chinese food overwhelmed me. It was way too overpowering. So- I left after standing at the counter for a couple of minutes with no interaction with anybody. I don't have that high of expectations when I am in Chinatown- I know the weird Asianess comes with the territory like the arguing with eachother in Chinese during your foot massage and the answering of their cell phones... and I'm okay with that- but I was just too tired to deal with it this night. As I got in my car and they realized I had left they came out the door after me but it was too late. I would give them another chance if there isn't a stinky smell of food in there next time.Awful place. The woman that works there has the most awful personality. They bait and switch the customer. I purchased a package for 5 colonic sessions I used only 3 and had 2 remaining. I scheduled my appointment and informed them that I had 2 sessions I was told that that was fine and scheduled the appointment. When I arrived she informed me my package was expired. I was shocked and told her that there was no expiration date on the package. She basically said oh well and said that she would not honor the package or refund the unused portion. I have filed a BBB complaint and have forwarded the email from which I purchased the package to the company. Nowhere does it say there is a time limit in which to use the colonics.  Incidentally they blast religious music without any regard to what you the customer would like to hear, very unprofessional and uncomfortable business.

Response to owners response:
This is just untrue! I never falsified anything!  I put my medical past on the paperwork, that's how she even knew about it!
I did contact the BBB and they have tried many times to contact her with no response from her at all!  It is an open and unresolved investigation against her.   I did have 2 remaining sessions which she took and never refunded the money!  She confirmed over the phone that I had those sessions, that is why I made the appointment and went in there.  Only to be told once I arrived that she decided they were not valid anymore. This is my experience with this business, others have put their experiences in their reviews, clearly at least 2 others rate this business with 1 star.  My mistakes were pre-paying for a package and then being stuck going in there to use the package.We used to consider going to Pan Asia as a treat, one of our "go to" places.  We LOVED the fact that they had a "special" menu on Saturday night that allowed the two of us to eat at least 2 rolls and an order of crab puffs for $20.  It's almost like once they deep 6'd that, the rest of the experience went downhill with it.  But it was still good enough so we were still going.  

Until last week.  We were there about 10 minutes after they opened on Friday and I had to use the restroom.  It stunk like garbage and rotting fish in the bathroom, which coincidentally had had a garbage can propping it open to air it out.  

We ordered 3 small salads, 2 rolls (one was cooked), and 1 order of chicken potstickers.  When our water arrived, two out of our three glasses had dead gnats floating in them.  When we told the server she made no apology, just looked at the glasses as she walked off and returned with two "new" glasses.  Only difference was these had lemon in them and our original waters did not.  The chicken potstickers arrived a good 10 minutes before our rolls did and the server didn't apologize for the wait or let us know when the rolls were almost done.  By this point, I was almost afraid of what would happen once I did eat my sushi roll!  But I did and it was tasty, yet I was still disgusted.  $50 for that horrible experience.  Unfortunately, we had a friend with us who was in town for a visit and we were embarrassed that we had told her how much we loved this place.  Add Pan Asia to the Never Again list!The staff here act put out whenever a customer walks through the door. The crepes were pretty good so I put up with the treatment for about five visits.  It kept getting worse and worse so now I'm officially done.I won't go back to this restaurant.  The food literally made me ill.

It is clean, the decor is good, and the service can't be faulted.  However, I spent all night in the bathroom losing the meal I had there.  How do I know their food caused it? I had a bowl of cereal that morning.  What I lost that was undigested was my meal from True Food's, a clear sign of food poisoning.  I had the teryaki tofu.  My neighbor had salmon and was fine.

I plan to call them tomorrow and notify them of what happened.  

My general opinion of the place if I hadn't become ill.  It is a trendy place with an interesting menu. The service was good-I had no complaints.   It was clean and the deco handsome and low key.  I found it  disconcerting that neither of us could easily read the menu due to the dim lights.  I noticed the gentleman at the next table tipping his menu to catch more light while he was trying to read it.  How long it will stay a gathering place for the for the more socially inclined, I question.   Both of us thought for the most part the items on the menu were overpriced.  The restaurant is located at the Biltmore  so I expected the prices to be at least a bit high anyway and they were.   

We did have to get a steak knife for my friend to be able to cut the bread her salmon was on. The restrooms were interesting with unique dryers that actually did a complete job of drying the hands.

Added 1/29-I decided to email Sam Fox instead of calling.  No reply as yet.
2/2-It is now the day after the Super Bowl and still no response.   That tells me something about the owner, Sam Fox, and his attitude. When I sent him a compliment on another of his restaurants, I got almost an immediate response.  Not this time!  5/27/09-never heard back.  Negative one star for this one.Dieses Hotel hält meinen persönlichen Europarekord in der Sparte Schlechtestes Preis-/Leistungsverhältnis! Im einzelnen: 1) Der Empfang, der von uns um 12 Uhr mittags mit dem Wunsch die Zimmer beziehen zu wollen, offenbar völlig aus der Bahn geworfen wurde (wir hatten bei der HRS-Buchung Frühanreise angegeben). Zimmer gäbe es grundsätzlich nicht vor 14 Uhr, aber wir könnten uns ja erst mal zum Lunch begeben, um die Wartezeit auszunutzen. Nach Diskussion mit einer hochnäsigen Angestellten wurde uns wenigstens gestattet, die Koffer in einem unverschlossenen Zimmer in einem Nebenflur abzustellen. 2.) Nach einem Spaziergang in der näheren Umgebung und Erkundung des schönen und gepflegten Gartenbereichs, war es mit Bezug der sehr kleinen Zimmer mit schön und gepflegt vorbei. Die Fenster waren undicht mit blätternder Farbe an den Rahmen, die Raumluft trotz der Undichtigkeit muffig, der Teppich fleckig und die Einrichtung recht veraltet. Der Hammer im Zimmer: Die beiden Nachttischlampen waren ohne Glühbirnen!!! Im winzigen Bad dann Rostansätze am Duschkopf und mehr Kalkablagerungen als in einer durchschnittlichen Tropfsteinhöhle. Zum Glück war man nach einem erlebnisreichen und langen Tag im wirklich sehenswerten Edinburgh so müde, dass man unter Verwendung von Ohropax trotz der Hellhörigkeit der Zimmer schlafen konnte. Eine knallende Feuerschutztür auf dem Flur hätte sonst auch das noch verhindert. 3) Sehr im Kontrast dazu die gemütliche Hotelbar am Abend und das immerhin befriedigende Frühstück am Morgen (mit genießbarem Kaffee!). Aber das konnte es nicht mehr wettmachen. Nach einem gelangweilt durchgeführtem Check-Out waren wir froh dieses Hotel nach 2 Tagen für umgerechnet ca. 130 EUR pro Nacht und Zimmer für alle Zeiten hinter uns zu lassen.I am very disappointed to here that the mini corn dogs are not on the menu anymore. These were one of the items that I came here for.  They are excellent. I would order them everytime I came in. They've been replaced by spinach and artichoke dip, not an item that should be served by a burger joint. Yuck!! Whynot add fried mac and cheese. Don't know what's going on with menu. Lbs burger is still a place to try. You'll always get great service here.Just got a text message cancelling 37 minutes after they were supposed to be here AND after being called last week and having to reschedule because KC had a "family emergency". No problem, I understand...that happens, but as I needed to have them done by a certain day, I agreed they could come at 8:00 a.m. on a holiday even though it wasn't something I would have preferred but they said they would do it. Then Vince sent the text (not a call) saying he had tried to call me several times the night before which isn't true because I had my cell phone on me. Now I have to figure out how to get my coupon money back from Yelp...I would stay away!Food was disgusting. Chips were stale. Ordered nachos and quesidillas for happy hour - both were very bland and you don't get much. The drinks are overpriced, even at happy hour. I will never eat here again.I'm seriously baffled by all of the positive reviews Lan Thai has got. Maybe I just ordered on a bad night, but I may never know as I shan't be going back.

I'd been travelling back from business in Belfast, all I'd eaten was a muffin at 8am. I didn't get home until about 9pm so I was super hungry, so my other half and I decided to order in. Unfortunately we chose to order from Lan Thai 

We didn't receive the crackers we were supposed to get for our order over £16, and the takeaway boxes were broken. No big deal, accidents happen. But the food.. urgh. I ate about two bites and was done. The massaman curry is a few bits of chicken and peanuts floating around in some orange water. The Pad Thai tastes like someone has poured lemon washing up liquid in it.

It was absolutely appalling, disgusting... urgh. Seriously, please don't order from here. You'll regret it.Stepping into the Victoria Bar is like stepping back into time - a traditional pub, mostly full of old men drinking pints and muttering in low voices about the football scores in the dark.

The pub itself isnt bad, a standard pub decor and decent in size with the bar against the far wall as you enter - however, during my (very swift) pint, the staff were rude, and sounded throughly bored with serving anybody ever again. The Victoria Bar, does however, sell a large range of ales - possibly its only redeeming feature.

Needless to say, this isnt my type of bar - i felt massivly out of place, and what was worse, I knew it just as well as all of the regulars.Unfortunately, this was the worst sushi I've ever had. The rolls and other pieces were edible, but the mackerel sashimi was simply unbearable, and I had the awful salty taste in my mouth for the rest of the day to remind me (a taste so pungent, it persisted even after having Mexican food for dinner). wow.Since we always come here for happy hour, I thought to stop by for lunch one day for sushi.  Um, yeah, there aren't very many sushi specials for lunch.  The only thing on the menu was 4 pcs sushi with soup for $10.  The menu was puzzling - had clam chowder, burgers, and non-existent sushi options.  Very disappointing.I came in because the chalkboard on the wall said "$1 Coronas" and it is 107 out today. Sounded like a good way to cool off.

Went in. Only person there. Ordered a corona. Waited about 2 min for them to give it too me. I ordered the beer & it took the guy 2 min to get me a beer & lime slice in the middle of the day when I'm the ONLY customer AND I'm sitting AT THE BAR where I can almost reach them myself!?!?!?

I get the beer and they tell me it's $4. I'm like "What about the sign outside?"
Him - "Oh that's just for ladies. Sunday is ladies special."
Fine. Whatever. I paid because I was a hot & bit hung over and a cold beer was sitting right in front of me.

I ordered some hummus w/chicken  & bread because it was 1/2 off.
There was only 1 piece of pita cut up and arranged to make it look like there was more. There was a fair amount of hummus but it was the worst I've ever had. If they made "instant hummus" that came in a powder where you could just mix with water then this would have been the generic wal-mart brand of that
It still cost $5 when it was 1/2 price so that means normally they charge $10 for it. Rape.

I was still thirsty and they had Jager-bombs on "Special" for $5 (not much of a special IMO) and I ordered one for the "wings" I hoped it would give me.
They brought out a jager & red-bull mixed in a glass.
To clarify for those of you that don't know a Jager-bomb, by definition, is Jager in a shot glass dropped into a glass of energy drink.
A Jager-Red-bull is the two mixed in a glass.
It changes the taste and is a DIFFERENT drink even in bartender guides.

Then they wanted to ARGUE with me about what a Jager-Bomber was because apparently the customer is NEVER right to these guys. The argument was over when I pulled up www.Jagermeister.com on my laptop and showed them the official definition of a Jager-Bomber according to the manufacturer of the liquor..

It was also noisy. I like music or TV or w/e in most places but they had a radio AND TVs up loud and the mix of the two was just an annoying noise. 

I complained to the manager and he gave me a few of their businesses cards that I could use for $1 Millerl Lites like it was something special to make up for everything. (There were also a stack of these cards I noticed on my way out that ANYONE could grab) Basically treating me like I'm retarded and brushing off my complaint without really doing anything to fix it.

I will never be back here. I wish it was still the Philly cheese-steak shop that it used to be years ago.

I'm sitting in here on their free wi-fi as I write this.
It's almost like shooting someone with their own gun.Service & Food here NOT GOOD!
(and that's an understatement)

The very few times I have been here the employees don't seem to speak very clear english. I have to repeat myself several times before my order is understood. Then the people behind the counter are rude, they don't seem to care about being polite, and have a "getto" type of attitude with customers. Instead of "Welcome" or " how can I help you" it's "whaddu want" or " what u geddin?" If you ask about anything other than what is on the board like TV specials or special items - they have NO clue what you are talking about, and will stand their and look puzzled, then they will just tell you NO. 

Worse Panda Express experience ever.. I will not go back to this location, I will go to the other location in Chandler.... 

Word to the Manager - Teach your Employees that Customers Service is #1 Priority.. Maybe even have them smile once in awhile, and say "hello" and "thank you sir/ma'am" would be nice...instead of the "getto-fab" attitude.MARCOS CHAIDEZ IRRESPONSABLE HAIRDRESSER, DESTROYED MY HAIR 

I called the Platinum Hair Studio to make an appointment for retouch my highlights, do hydration and cute the ends, I asked the secretary who was the best professional specialized on highlights and she booked me with MARCOS CHAIDEZ.

My appointment was for the end of February, I met MARCOS CHAIDEZ and asked him to follow the same pattern of highlight I had, it was Blonde stripes, nothing complicated to do, anyway he made me look very Blonde, he made tiny highlights with not the streaks separation I had,  the Blonde was all blended with my dark hair. I didn't liked but I was in a hurry, I didn't want spend more 2h there... When I got home I texted him to say that, and he said would be better to wait to get it fixed the way I wanted the next month to give time for my hair.

I made an appointment with him for Thus April 12, before a whole month business trip in Europe. I had to leave on Monday 16 to attend a Fitness expo in Germany( I'm a fitness model)
I arrived at the salon in the time scheduled and I explained to Marcos that was better he just follow the same pattern he did in instead of try to make my hair look as it was before he touched.

I also asked him to not bleach where was already bleached to not damage, better only retouch the roots and in instead of start retouch from the back to start from the front because the hair in the back was sensitive already.

He did start from the front, and because the aluminum foil was covering my eyes I was not really able to see what exactly he was doing, he left it over 15 min and put me in the dryer for more 10 min then washed my hair with shampoo and I felt that after the shampoo he said he will do a deep hydratation but I think he put more bleach because my scalp start to was burn a little, I start to be worried and aks him what was that he putting in my head, he repeated was a deep hydration, anyway I was not able to tell because my head was laid back in the place where they wash the hair.

Then he rinsed what I think was bleach and put conditioner over it and rinsed again, then brought me to blow dry and ironed my hair, all the time he was drying my hair and ironing he turned my head against the mirror so I couldn't really see how it looks, I saw only at the end and I noticed it was really dark on the sides and very light platinum blonde in the front. Again I left not so happy because once again he didn't follow my requests, but again I was in a hurry due all my preparation for my travel I wouldn't be able to lose any more time there and I didn't want to.

When I left the salon the hair looked ok because he sprayed a lot of products before I left and it last straight and like normal until I washed it on Sunday.
When I washed my hair it started to curl and break, I had pieces of my hair in my hands... I dried it with blow dry in a low temperature to try to take of all the frizz but didn't worked.

My hair never look so bad and damaged in my whole life.

I texted MARCOS CHAIDEZ to tell him what he done to my hair but I'm sure he knew what he done to my hair already when I left the salon that day.
He never answered me my texts or phone call.

I noticed that he tried to cover the excess of bleach dying it black what make it even worst, right now my hair looks all brittle in the top very short because it all broke and the blond with some black spots, it look really bad. 

I totally rely in my image because of my work, I was desperate with my hair that way, having to attend the expo in Europe and with a bunch of photo shoots scheduled...

I went in a famous hair salon in Europe, when the hairdresser looked my hair he was in shock. The only solution he found was use a non permanent dark color( permanent would damage it even more) to cover all the ugly Blonde Greysh color and left only the front highlights, and a week later I went back for a treatment. And buy a half wig to wear until my hair grows back in the spots Marcos destroyed.
I had to spend couple hundred Euros to cover up all his irresponsibility and lack or professionalism. I feeling very depress, I had a gorgeous hair.

I writing this detailed review because I don't want anyone face a situation like I having right nowIf I could give 0 stars I would.... Absolute worst sushi and calamari I have ever had! The calamari was rubbery and tasted like they bought it frozen from Costco. I could have bought better sushi from smiths or vons. Service was great, they understood my dissappointment. Sapporo was superb!dirty, too many flies, the staff does not wear gloves, it is gross, and the food is awful,
and, not good, the utensils are never clean, tables are dirty all the time, flies everywhere.  IT IS THE WORST PLACE TO EAT.This Circle K is awful. I was out for a walk in my neighborhood. I am a yuppie--white, ivy leaguer, graduate school background, high income, etc.--and I briefly paused outside the door of the Circle K to open a lemonade and have a taste prior to beginning my walk home. 

Though I'd been standing there about 30 seconds, some fat, bald security guard sauntered over and said that I was not allowed 'to loiter there' on the property. You don't need to be a lawyer to recognize that having completed a sale with Circle K and not staying beyond the standard time of consumption of the item, this was not loitering.

In the same intervention, Fat Boy also asked a nearby homeless that he too should leave the Circle K. Clearly, that was appropriate because this man was not a customer.

If Fat Boy is the only line of civilization that stands between the gentrifying yuppies of downtown Phoenix, and the vagrant garbage that stream outward from their nest at the Westward Ho, I weep for the future of our city.Riverview Toyota was WAY overpriced ..out of 5 dealerships they were the most expensive .. I purchased mine at Tempe Toyota for almost four thousand dollars less then Riverview wanted. I also found that the service department is much friendlier at Tempe toyota than at Riverview Toyota.. Then when I want to purchase my Scion I had the same experience the most expensive and the least friendly salesperson. Ended up buying my Scion at Tempe Scion.This place sucks. My girlfriend had her phone stolen here right off our table. Great security guys... Not really what you expect when you're paying $500We were going to try Olive's last night but found they have gone out of business.they had big groups of buisiness man it was laud and food was all messed up I complained to waiter he got attitude they charged full price all 4 meal was nasty I returned my fish dish but they did not do anything. NEVER GO BACK THE PLACE EVER!!!!!!!If I could give a zero I would! I've been going to this place off and on for years until I finally started seeing a nail tech that did a decent job. 

The nail tech I would see would blatantly  ask if I could pay her  tip in cash because the owner would take forever to give them the their tips. On another occasion I asked if she could give me a backfill but she told me she wanted to leave early for a trip and instead did the white gel that only lasted 3 days!! You would think I would learn my lesson but continued to go because I'm not familiar with other nail shops. 

Well... I went two weeks ago for a fill and a week later noticed that my nail hurt and looked green and puffy!!! Yup infection!!! I went to the doctors and was told it was infection from DIRTY TOOLS!!!! Do not go there!!! I've filled out in a formal complaint with the board. SAVE YOUR NAILS DONT GO HERE!This restaurant looked really cool from the outside.  I guess I got sucked in by all the beautiful fishes in the fish tanks.  I also thought how bad can noodles be from BeiJin?  Whua, shocker!  It was BAD!

They said they the noodles were hand-pulled.  I know how hand-pulled noodles should taste.  These were not even close.  The texture were too soft and didn't have the Q (Al Dante) they should have.  The Pork and mushroom sauce were so little, I had to add soy sauce to the noodles in order to eat it.  

The order of  'Beef Pancakes' has 2 and were the size of dollar coin.  

Conclusion - very small portion, very expensive, and very bad food!  Don't be enticed by the fish tanks like I did.  WALK FAR FAR AWAY from this place!  It's not even worthy of 1 star!this review comes some two years after the fact but was reminded of my craptastic experience by fellow yelper jay d! (thank you jay!)

this story is of a bay area girl going to vegas with her then boyfriend for a weekend of import drag races. sounds fun right?! so we decided it would be fun for us to do a road trip to vegas. my then bf was a bit of a procrastinator and could only find us a room at the poopicana..oops i mean the tropicana. i mean he could have gotten rooms at a nicer place but he also doubled as a cheap ass! :D (that is my shit talking shit eating grin.)

story continues with us arriving into vegas before our room was ready. no biggie... lunch and then check in. we finally get to check in and we are EXHAUSTED! plan is to sleep for a couple of hours then head out. lucky for us (sarcasm) our room was on the first floor located right next to the entrance of the casino. drunk people are practically standing on our little patio drunk, yelling on the phone and smoking! this did not sit well with the bf, so he called and got our room changed. 

to the next room we went. 
me: "this room is kind of hot"
bf: "i'll turn on the ac"
me: *standing next to vent* "i don't feel shit."

turns out it was broken. i called the front desk and they get their maintenance man on the scene. hours later he shows up. he does what i like to call "jack shit". the room remains hot. did i mention that vegas was in a heat wave on this particular weekend in july. i mean it's only like 130ish outside. we decide to tough it out. bad idea. bf gets drunk that night. when we got back the room was like a sauna. bf gets drunker.

next morning i can't take the 85 degree hotel room and i get us switched, YET AGAIN! we walk into our third and final room for our two night stay in vegas. it was dark but i could feel the breeze of the ac rustle through my hair! bf walks in first, i follow....

bf: "ummmmm...."
me: "are those mirrors on the ceiling?!?!?!?"
bf" "and on the walls?"
me: "is there any spot in this room that doesn't have mirror on it? OMIGOD babe we're in a '70s porn room!"
bf: "i didn't think these existed anymore?!"
me: *jumps on bed* "this could be kind of cool?!"
bf: *jumps on bed*
me: *laying on bed looking up to the ceiling* "ya... this isn't as cool as i thought it would be. the lights are staying off tonight"

it wasn't a urine soaked room like jay.. but it's probably a good thing i didn't have a black light for that last room... then i probably would have seen cum stains all over the walls! **GAG** that was the last time i stayed in a hotel on the strip! thank god for friends who live in or have vacation houses in vegas!!My roommate (who is disabled) and I stayed at this hotel for Christmas, and it was the worst experience ever. 

(1) The hotel room (paradise tower room) was filthy and did not look like the floor was vacuumed at all. There was a jelly bean, hair, papers on the floor and a big stain on the carpet. And the table in the room was so wobbly.

(2) They gave out a coupon for lobster meal for a new customer. We asked the guy at the information booth where the restaurant was, and he told us that restaurant was under renovation so we could not use the coupons. So we had to go to the other hotel and spent over $100 for lobster dinner while we could have only spent only $50 with coupons at Tropicana. Then later we found out that we could have used the coupon at the different restaurant located in Tropicana, and the guy gave us wrong information was not even an employee for the hotel.

(3) It said we get free tickets for Hypnosis show by booking a room at Tropicana, so we planned on going, but they canceled the show at last minute. We could not see the show on different night because we already planned to go to a different show.

(4) My roommate is disabled and has a help dog (with proper paperwork). We called in advance to let them know that we would bring a dog, and also informed at the front desk and security when cheking in, and they said no problem. But when Orbitz called the hotel regaring our complaints, they lied that we brought a dog even though animals were not allowed.  

(5) The food at the buffet was terrible, by far one of the most disgusting food we ever tasted in our lives. Bread and food was so dry and tasted like cardboard and water tasted like chlorine. We got sick from eating.

I will NEVER EVER go back to this hotel even after renovation and NEVER recommend this hotel for anyone!! (The only good thing I can think of about this hotel is the location)
If you want to save money, stay at Motel 6 instead (which is about a block away from the strip) and I'm sure it's much better than the filthy room and lousy service at Tropicana. Or pay a little extra to stay at different casino hotels.I love the gorgeous photo on their billboard of their newly renovated rooms. Too bad we weren't in them. 

If you're not in the updated rooms, this place is a shithole. I mean, seriously. Our room's wallpaper was peeling, the carpets were stained and dirty, the bed looked dingy, and worst of all, in the 100 degree heat (at 11pm!) of Las Vegas, the puttering air conditioning was just insulting - I'm fairly certain it never got below 80 degrees the entire time we were in the room. 

It's not even like "Well, at least we're not at the Motel 6." It's like "Holy shit, I wish we had stopped at that Roadkill Inn a few miles back!" 

Our room was $45 on a special. On arriving in the room, I immediately went to the Kayak app on my iPhone 4 (it saves lives), and looked for hotel deals in the vicinity. Rio was $55. BOOM, done. Booked that thing and checked the F outta Tropicana. 

I will say this: we called and asked for new rooms before hitting the "accept" button to reserve the the Rio, but Tropicana said "if it was any other night we could, but not tonight." So, when we checked out about 1.5 hours after checking-in, they told us they'd refund what we paid to Expedia because they couldn't move us to new rooms. The only upside to this adventure was that we didn't have to pay for it.No no no! Our first day/night our a/c wasn't working and so it was hot. Then every night we stayed there including the first, when we pulled back, what was supposed to be, clean bed sheets we found hair! And not any hair, pubic hair! Omg...*gag*...there were like 4 or 5 of them! Also the sheets had these yellowish stains from overuse. It was disgusting. And to make matters worse my boyfriend kept breaking out in hives in the morning! When we finally checked out I talked to the guy behind the counter who said all he could do was return the resort's fees. I may end up contacting Hotwire and see about getting a refund. Ugh. Never again with this place!One of the oldest casino on the strip and it looks it.  Sure they modified and revamped it, but it just doesn't compared to the other casinos and it still feels dated. Not as many table games and the slots are not new.  Even though it's on a corner with 3 other large casinos and has a bridge to access them, they seem to be be far away.  Perhaps because the other casinos bridge goes directly into the casinos where the Tropicana still requires walking to get to there place.  I think they need to tear down the place because the modifications still didn't do enough for me to want to come back.Blech....the food is nasty, everything tastes like something other than what it is and the old people, my God, the old people. I should expect no less since we live so close to Sun City; but for the love of God they are everywhere!! Maybe because the food was so bad that the old people only added to my total dissatisfaction. I will admit that I have a general aversion to buffets  because they kind of gross me out anyway. Most of the time the food is not good, nor good for you and generally the restaurants are filthy-- food on the floor from the toddler before you or the bus persons who just clear the table onto the floor and don't even clean off the condiments that are on the tables-- eeewwwww. So take this review for what it is worth and dine at your own risk.My friends and I wanted to try this place since we pass by it so often.  One Friday, we decided to try it out for dinner.  When we arrived we were told there was a 30 min wait.  As we waited, we noticed that all the tables that would normally seat 4-6 people, only had 2 people seated.  There were 2 tables available that could seat 2 (we were a party of 4).  

Our wait took longer than 30 minutes, so we decided to sit for Teppanyaki.  This took an additional 30 minutes and when we asked the hostess when it would be our table's turn for the Chef, she said it would be another 50 minutes.  (There were 6 Teppan tables and 2 chefs on a Friday night!)

Needless to say, we left and ate at the Chinese restaurant across the way.  

I don't know if their service this particularly night was out of the norm, but I would prepare would a long wait if you decide to eat here.A favorite among the university crowd. I'm not a fan. I've been here multiple times and this time I decided to write a review.

I'd gotten the "Healthy Life." It didn't seem all that healthy to me. Not really sure what I paid for was actually worth my money, it seemed quite plain and simple. And the tomatoes they'd been using were terrible. On top of that, I'd ordered orange juice. Expecting freshly squeezed orange juice, I drink a "from concentrate" glass of Oasis orange juice which I'd seen the waitress pouring for us. No. Just no. And charging us $3 for it? Nah b.

Other times I've gone, it seemed alright. A typical 60's diner setting. If you're actually considering weekend brunch at Mel's, you might to consider coming early, to avoid the rush. Other than that, the place itself isn't all that fantastic. In comparison to other places in the proximity, this place is alright. I'd only go here if I'm in absolute need of greasy food.THE WORST place for those of us who are gluten intolerant! I JUST went to this particular restaurant with a group of about 15 people who saw a movie at the theatre next door first. I immediately asked my waiter about gluten-free items and he brought me a notebook that is a complete joke for a customer with dietary needs. CREATE A GLUTEN FREE MENU like everyone has! He was nice, however I had a few questions and he told me the manager would come over to help me. Every single person was served their meal, ate, received their bills and STILL no manager to help me. I had decaf coffee ~ which I paid for. NEVER AGAIN at this restaurant!!!DO NOT EAT HERE!!! WORST SERVICE EVER!! From management all the way down to the host.....Just plain BAD SERVICE! Now let me tell you about the food. The nigiri is overstuffed with rice and can barely make out the taste of the fish. Read this article below, I have never gotten sick from Sushi until now.

"When sushi is handled properly in a reputable establishment by a master sushi chef, the risk of getting a food-borne illness from eating it is extremely rare. According to FDA statistics, you have a much greater chance of getting sick from eating poultry or beef than from eating raw fish. But if you eat a spoiled piece of sushi, you won't care about statistics.While you can't possibly know if the raw fish was kept adequately refrigerated or whether the server or preparer properly washed his hands before handling your food, you can use your powers of observation to discover clues that may help you prevent putting your gastrointestinal health at the mercy of a less-than-reputable sushi restaurant" -eHowI have been going to Turf for years.  They recently changed management and the menu (twice now, actually).  The fish and chips used to be great--some of my favorite in the central Phoenix area.  Boy, are the F & C's lousy now---greasy, heavy breading and flavorless.  The hamburgers have good meat but also flavorless.  They got rid of the bacon and chocolate they had when they revised the menu the 1st time.  Booooo.  Everything is better with bacon!  And they got rid of my pub favorite: the steak sandwich.  The chicken wings are ridiculously huge and, again, not that great.  Plus no more steak fries, which my friend really liked.  The HH food menu is lacking and was really perturbed when I went there and they had no guacamole (a HH menu item).  The service has also gone downhill.  Husband waited 30 minutes for his flavorless hamburger.  The ONLY improvement is their wine selection got better. I will avoid eating here (will eat before I get there) in the future until they hopefully make some positive changes.  Please bring back some of the old menu items!  And go back to your old fish and chip recipe.Here's what $152 a night got us... no coffee maker, no extra bed linens for the sofa bed, a mini fridge that apparently works on a timer because it wasn't on when we woke up and all our food was warm, no plates or utensils in the kitchen, no robes, no dvd player. The look of the hotel is beautiful but the virtual tour online is not the same as the room we got, which was a lot smaller. Totally disappointing stay. I won't be back for this kind of $.
This is an update to my comments above: the reason that we don't have a coffee maker in the room is that the rooms don't come with them. I mean, even motel 8 has coffee makers! AND in order to have maid service, you have to give 24 hours notice and pay an extra $45. That would have been good to know BEFORE 4pm the day before we checked out.We decided to go with Vdara since their pool and the rooms looked nice, and we needed a place to relax after our week long road trip. I wanted to try out one of the city center places and, Aria didnt have suites

I have to say, the room was pretty nice.

The reasons I am forced to give such a poor review, which I rarely do...

1) We checked in at around 5PM; 20 minutes later someone opens the door and walks in, didnt even knock.. she comes in and looks at something and said she just wanted to look at the room map or something like that! .. for real? what if I was naked? or worse doing something else? 

2) The place has only valet.. which sounded nice at first, but if you forget something in the car, there is no way to go get it.. and of course you have to go downstairs and wait for your car..
3) No coffee machines in the room? After floating in beer all day/night till 5Am, last thing I want to do is dress up and walk around looking for coffee when I get up. .
4) So I finally force myself to shower and leave the place; I switch on the "please clean room" light and leave for the day.. get back at 4PM.. the room is still not clean.. So i had to call the service desk and ask for someone to clean it.
3) Since the lady was cleaning the roomwe go to the pool.. but when we get there, the pool is closed ! at 410PM!!! are you serious? they closed the pool at 4PM...
And that was the whole reason we booked a room at this place..


4) But the worst of all this is, even though it looks like its right next to the strip, its hard to get to from the strip. Mainly because they dont have directions anywhere , even inside Aria, and since they dont have a casino or any restaurants in Vdara, you are forced to go looking for places.. 

Overall, even though the rooms are super cool, staying here was a very painful experience. I give it only one star, and I will NEVER stay here again.. 

Now I know why I love Venetian !!  cant wait to go back there..In addition to my bad review for Kaya, a shocking discovery was made when I checked out my bank statement. Kaya was not only slow during our lunch hour visit, forgotten an item, served frozen lemons with our waters, they actually managed to charge twice on my credit card and didn't charge my friend's credit card. Seriously!!?? How confusing is a Wells Fargo credit card versus a Bank of America Credit card!! She had 3 tables in the whole restaurant, during our meal (should I even call it a meal?). Apparently to the Kaya server, it is as confusing as black and white.  Willful stupidity absolutely makes me livid!

So, I phoned the manager and asked to be credited ASAP. She talked me into coming down and accepting cash for the duplicate charge.  After patiently waiting for 15 minutes inside the restaurant, I began feeling strangulated because of strong emotion that reminded me of my horrible eating experience! 

Additionally, the manager had the nerve to ask for my friend's contact information so she can properly charge him on his credit card! The frozen lemons, welted vegetables and rancid sushi must have gotten to her crazy head!  Gracefully grabbing my cash from her hand, my look of despair and silence concluded her query!! 

One great thing out of this is that my out of town friend had a free horrible lunch which I don't mind paying for....EgAVOID THIS PLACE!!!  It was one of the worst pizzas ever.  I went here for the first time, because of a coupon deal... but I will never be a return customer at Big Mama's and Papa's Pizzeria.

I should've known from the start when I called in my order and the young guy working there kept me on hold for quite a few minutes, before he rushed through my order and didn't even ask for my name.  He just hung up and had a careless attitude.  When I picked up the pizza, I saw the place was a dump... the booths are falling apart and it looks very run down.  It's gross to think they serve food in a place like this  :/

But the icing on the cake was the ***BURNED BLACK*** pizza that I received.  In all the times my family has ordered take-out pizza, we've NEVER had one that was so badly burned.  It was inedible!!  To make it worse, the young guy working there didn't think it was a problem-- he thought it looked fine!  That's the kind of employees this place has!  It's terrible service and even worse food.... avoid it.Horrible experience.  Went there with my father over Labor Day.  When we arrived the line was very long, but moving so we decided to get in.  At first the line crept along, but at least it moved.  Then it slowed down. Then it slowed down to a stop.  We had already paid so we were stuck.  We saw MANY open tables and numerous hostesses talking amougnst themselves about what to do, but not actually doing anything like actually seating the customers.  It took over 1 1/2 hours from getting in line to getting to our table.  And remember there were many, many open tables so there was more than enough seating.  Just not enough customer service.  No food, especially at an expensive buffet such as this, is worth that wait.  Will never go back.Utterly terrible on a Friday night.Should have read reviews on this place about BAD customer service. Pedi was okay for $21+$5 for the acid scrub, but the full-set experience was HORRID. Should have known they do crap work when I walked in at 6:55 and they said they would take me even though they close at 7. The place still had customers and more ladies walked in AFTER me, and of course they were taken also. Man at the front yells for two ladies to come help me. One lady does my toes: pleasantly surprised that they use a plastic foot bath lining for the pedicure, she doesn't say a word to me which is fine, but I ask her if I can pay extra for a gel coat on my toes to last longer and apparently she had no clue what I was talking about because she didn't do it, massage chair was whack and the lady doing my full-set asked me to turn it off. She also doesn't say a word to me which again I'm okay with, but by the time she brings over the UV nail dryer I'm thinking there's NO WAY she's done. I look at my CROOKED nails and I ask her if she is still going to shape my nails... obviously she didn't understand because she uttered a "yeah" and stuck my hand, crooked nails and all, in the dryer! She finishes my other hand and takes off to start another lady's nails. I'm clearly looking at my nails in DISGUST because they are shaped as if diagonally shaped nails are OKAY. THE OWNER/GUY AT THE FRONT sits down because I have an obviously HORRIFIED look on my face and he looks at my hands. I tell him they do not look good at all, he takes my hand and says they are not straight (at least he sees it!) and says he'll fix them... he files away as I try to go back to relaxing in the useless massage chair, still having my pedi/french-tip done. He finishes one had and starts to file the other side while I stare at the horrible job HE DID. He kept asking me, "is that better?" and I almost cried because it was obvious he was in a hurry, doing a crap, and my nails were not going to look good. Maybe it's because of my profession that I held back everything I was going to say, but I just jumped up, paid, and darted out of there. I LATER REALIZED THERE IS NO POLISH ON MY THUMBS - I paid an extra $5 for a gel coat and got 8/10 nails???? And crooked ones, at that?!There is a reason that on Friday nights the "seafood" buffet is only $14.50.  Pacific Coast seafood buffet is about the same price and is far better with way more options. I'd don't really have much in the way of positives to say about this place.

Wait, my server was pleasant and enjoyable.

Now, first off, I would never bring my child to this place to eat.  This has to be the smokiest establishment in metro Phx.  Even though the restaurant is nonsmoking, the casino's smoke proliferates into every available pocket of space!  At the end of your dinner, when you get to your car and open your purse to get your keys, smoke will billow from it.  

Now, on to the food...  You walk into the establishment and pay for the buffet much like u would at any casino buffet.  You leave your tip at this point too. Not an issue for me, but what disgusted me was the cashier tried to short my server on the amount of the tip that I left!  I kept telling her she wrote the wrong amount on the slip and the cashier kept pretending to not understand me.  But I've waited on a few tables in the college days, so we got that fixed.

So the seating area is approaching Dive-ey.  But looked clean.  They have an "overflow" room that people can sit in if the main dining room is full. 

The most disappointing part about RRB was the food.  I can deal with a shady cashier, dive-ey atmosphere, but bad food is not an option when I have driven 30 + mins to get to you!  The buffet bar is relatively small with salad options - green mix, romaine and Caesar.  There are the regular Salad bar staples.  They do have a lady who makes a great pepperchini and feta mix from scratch that taste great.  The hot bar has mashed potatoes and rice.  There is "prime riib" swimming in warm juice and over-cooking it.   There was stuffed cabbage that taste like u can imagine stuffed cabbage tasting like.  Oh, yeah, I'm forgetting something, the seafood... Crab legs and fried shrimp.  

Suffice it to say, I will most likely will never return.Went there this morning and service was super slow! It took 30 minutes for one breakfast sandwich and the order was wrong.  The manager Barbara seemed like she had NO clue what was going on.This is probably the worst buffet I have ever had.  And vegas is renowned for buffets.  What a disappointment.I really hate to do this, and I will be happy to edit my review if somebody from this DD can tell me WHY
EVERY time I have gone to the drive-thru, they screw up my order? First the walkie talkie thing was broken so you had to sit there and yell for 5 min to get someone to ask for the order.
Then they took half an hour and they never had any donuts early in the morning.  Okay okay I said. They just opened up! Give them a break.

Well guess what. I pay 6 or 7 bucks on Saturdays and Sundays and EVERY time, they give me a freaking egg/cheese english muffin with HAM.  I don't ask for any ham on it.  It is ON the menu without ham. Why, why, whyyyyyy do you put ham on it?  One day I sent it back and all they did was take the damn ham off it.  Yes they did.  

Plus all the times I get to work ready to eat and I remember that I shouldn't have left that window without checking.... but there it is. HAM on my freaking sandwich! 

I made a complaint online.  Nobody ever got back to me, they don't give a crap.  Only reason I go there now is for the hash brown bites, which are a little bite of heaven!I bought a Groupon for this place because my regular hairstylist's dad was real sick. 
I was ten minutes late for my appointment which I called to give them a heads up about. When I got there the receptionist said the stylist had just run to Starbucks. 
When she walked in, she said, "Is this it?" (Meaning her appointment) and the receptionist said yes. First of all, THIS???  Is this it?  Um, I'm a human being thanks. 
Then, she never introduced herself, I still don't know her name, and she wasn't very chatty at all like I'm used to hairstylists usually being. She made it sound like my ten minutes was a HUGE inconvenience for her. I finally had to break the ice and start talking to her which she did talk to me, but still didn't really engage. 
The salon itself is really nice. Their hair washing stations are super comfortable and don't hurt your neck at all. Oh but did I mention she washed my hair with cold water? Brr!!  I won't go back.My husband and I just got back from seeing Viva Elvis and wondering where I should start.  Simply put, don't go to this show.  The best way I can describe it is as a glorified cruise ship production - nothing about this show says Cirque du Soleil.  From the get go, we know it was going to be bad.  The "blue suede shoe" was purple, the acrobats were out of sync, the curtain got stuck open so the show had to be stalled,  the mc's mic did not always work, etc.  We even saw some people walking out of the show mid-way through.  At the end, when the performers tried to get everyone to stand up and cheer, the majority of the theater sat still and barely clapped.  The only redeeming part of the show was the amazing video footage and photos of Elvis.  We paid $130 per ticket (which is 25% off the normal price) and were completely disappointed.  If you are looking for a Cirque show in Vegas, steer clear of this one.  Go to Love!  Now that is a great show honoring other musical legends.  Sadly, the King did not keep up with the Beatles.Was so looking forward to this place, but it towtally let me down. It was a busy evening and we got sat within minutes. However, we sat and sat.... We noticed a table next to us and they looked unhappy waiting too. We finally left after 15 minutes of waiting.
So, we decided to try their quick order window and another let down. Over-priced, salty hot dogs with dry buns. The dessert, what I was excited about, frozen hot chocolate. Yup, another let down. No one wanted to finish an over-priced sugary drink. Boo hoo Serendipity3!On my recent trip to Vegas I was so excited to eat at this restaurant but my excitement quickly dissipated into dissapointment as we were greeted by a very unhelpful and rude hostess. She was not friendly nor helpful. (Ex: when we asked if we could get a menu to look over while we waited, she pointed to the wall and said "this is our menu").  People that came after us were seated before us and when we finally got a table our waitress was also rude and unfriendly. (Ex: When she brought my friend her tea we commented on how cute the tea pot was and she snapped back "it's hot, don't touch it!").  Needless to say we asked for the check shortly after that! For me, the service is just as (if not more) important than the quality of food for a restaurant to be successful. I was so turned off by the staff personal that I wasn't willing to sit through an entire meal. If you do decide to try this place, I hope you have a better experience! ( But if your experience turns south there is a great Italian restaurant in cesars palace called Raos that has great food and staff! (That's were we ended up eating!) Good luck to all!!We wanted to go the restaurant, but the wait was 30 minutes and all we wanted to do was to try the infamous Frozen Hot Chocolate.  So I appreciate that they had a "Fun on the run menu" which is basically a way to grab something quick. The service was definitely faster, our drink was ready right after we paid!
Half star because the place was pink and cute. Half star because it tasted good. Minus four stars because the price was ridiculous and this place is seriously over-rated! 

$10- Frozen Hot Chocolate: For taste, I thought this was chocolate goodness. However, my friend says it tasted like his protein powder mixture.

$11- Mochacino Coffee Frozen Hot Chocolate:  This was pretty tasty.  The mocha was rich in flavor and blended well with the chocolate.  I liked the espresso chocolate on top.  Although it was delicious, the Costco's version of Mocha Latte comes pretty close.


Would you pay $12 (after tax) for a regular size (16 oz. maybe) of iced hot chocolate topped with whipped cream?  Why do you call it Frozen hot chocolate when it wasn't even frozen or icy?A 40 mile round trip drive only to be told by the snotty butcher that you can only buy stuff that is listed on their web site as for sale if you're on "The List"?  Yeah, no thanks. I'll just keep going to Hobe Meats and ordering stuff online.

If you do decide to bother with this place, call ahead. Just because they have it on their web site with a price next to it apparently doesn't mean it's actually for sale.  While calling, also ask how to get put on "The List", because that info isn't on their site either.**The comment by 24 hour fitness staff on this review was kind but the staff member failed to follow through. I haven't heard back from him or anyone at 24 hour fitness (but I have received numerous annoying text message and phone call marketing contacts).***

I was really disappointed with my experience at this particular 24 Hour Fitness Location this afternoon. When I arrived I was greeted by smiling faces at the front counter and I informed them that I had filled out their FREE 3-Day Pass online. The associates guided me to a computer screen when I answered a few questions and entered in my information. A second associate then approached me and said she was going to give me a tour. I said okay great! I followed her around as she showed me the different parts of the gym and overall it was a pleasant experience....until we walked in to their sales area where she told me they had a special on family memberships (I had told her I was meeting a friend who had a membership there to play some basketball). I himmed and hawwed for a minute and said no thanks I'm not interested in a membership RIGHT THIS SECOND (mind you...I walked in the door about 2 minutes prior to this). She then said, "Okay, so you are just here to play basketball?" and I replied "ummm, yes?" hoping it would get me away from this awkward sales pitch where she was just staring at me when I said I wasn't currently interested. Instead, she then said "Okay, well since you are here just to play basketball you will have to pay our $10.00 one day pass" our associate at the front desk will help you. Then she walked me to the front and said he needs to pay the $10 and walked away. I was very confused as I had just signed up to receive emails/mail/marketing phone calls from you and in turn a free 3-day pass. The associate at the front desk said that there was a clause saying they could nullify the 3-day pass at their discretion which they do if you are just there to play basketball. I was confused to I went back to my car to get my wallet to pay 10$ to use my free 3day pass and proceeded to play basketball for a few hours.

I am new to Arizona (just got my new Arizona Drivers License today actually) and this is the closest gym to where I live. I'm probably going to go out of my way to "Just play basketball" somewhere else where they aren't time-share salesman. Honestly, I would have gladly just paid the $10 day pass but when you are presented the free 3-Day pass why not right? Here is the exact text from their email/website

So...instead of signing of for a membership (which I was probably going to do at some point) I am going to get a membership somewhere else and put your social media/yelp/etc. on blast for your bait and switch. Happy Tuesday.Sooooo..... Fight night. There we are. Every single fight. And lo and behold, KIDS are allowed at the bar until God-knows-when. Seriously. Children. In a bar. They were permitted to enter under "parental supervision" however, NO PARENTS to be found. The staff doesn't seem to mind. IT'S A COMPLETE BUZZ KILL. Also, total lack of seating for the absolutely expected crowd of games/fights/whatever is going on. Ridiculous. My point is...... STOP ADMITTING CHILDREN. This is NOT a family environment.Had gift certificates so figured, why not? Got the sampler, some beers, and some mashed potatoes. Nothing in the sampler was particularly good...and the mashed potatoes tasted like nothing other than undercooked potatoes.I phoned a front desk staffer who was so unhelpful.   She would not answer any general questions and was quite concealing in her responses always directing me to their website.  When I responded the info was not on their website, she would obnoxiously/repeatedly rephrase my questions saying she was not allowed to respond.  Truly an unfriendly experience for someone needing a root canal....guess I won't be seeing the endos as there's no transparency here.  Best to take your problem and wallet somewhere else.  Drs pls monitor and record your front desk, you may be surprised.Got Bugs? No? Want Bugs? Yes? I have your place -- apparently. 

First, nice open space, modern but comfortable with a nice atmosphere that isn't too loud or too quiet. 

Most importantly, I don't eat bugs voluntarily. I know, call me odd, but it just isn't my thing. Up until my visit to The Parlor, not one single person had made me feel odd or unwarranted in my preference to avoid consuming bugs...ahhh, but all good things must come to an end, even our hopes and dreams of acceptance. 

So, let's stick with the facts: The Smokey (a pizza) and another pizza we ordered were delivered to our table. I quickly noticed something moving on the arugula on top of the Smokey. I attempted to wave it away, thinking it was a fruit fly. My menacing wave had no impact and then I noticed that in fact there were at least 3 or more bugs moving about the arugula. With furious vengeance, I waved at them again. Nothing. OK, not eating this pizza. 

So, I called the waiter over and told him that there were bugs on the pizza. Now this is where our story takes an odd turn (really, we probably have all found a bug in our food at some point, so that's not very odd). 

The waiter responded -- "well, that's what happens when you don't use pesticides and the food is organic." He then called over another waiter and told her that there were bugs on our pizza. She inspected and concluded that it was so, whereupon she asked: "would you like something different?" 

OK. Part of me was expecting the camera crew to emerge, but alas, Candid Camera has long since gone away and instead we were having a great moment in Phoenix restaurant service history. 

Really, "do we want something different?" No no, now that we know that the bugs are organic, we will eat that pizza, and heck, order us another with extra bugs. 

And come on..."it's organic"...that's your response? -- I have organic vegetables delivered to me twice a month and I have never had any bugs (granted I do wash my produce). Also, my parents had a large garden when I was younger, no pesticides, and often there were bugs on the vegetables. But, and apparently this is a strange concept, we WASHED them off before eating or serving or storing. 

I understand, bugs happen. What I don't understand is the response we received. We truly felt like we were being odd for sending back the pizza. I know that the service level in Phoenix often hovers around a 3 to 4 out of 10, but really, this was a new low. I wasn't expecting the owner to come on out on his or her knees, but I did expect something along the lines of: Oh, I'm very sorry, let me take that away and get you a menu so you can select something else. 

Sure, eventually there was a rather late "sorry" and an offer of a free dessert, but it was a little late for that. 

On the upside it made for great humor. When the waiter asked us if we had been there before I was half expecting, if we had both said no, she would have said, well that pizza always has bugs on it. And when she asked if we needed help picking something out, I really wanted to say: yes, something without bugs. Unfortunately, I kept the joke to myself. 

The pizza we did eat was OK. The crust lacked flavor and overall it wasn't on par with the likes of Cibo, Humble Pie, or Bianco.

I could get over the bugs, but I have a very hard time swallowing such terrible service. 

...wait, maybe there is a camera on me right now as I write this and Candid Camera really has come back...that's the best explanation I have.horrible. thank god it was comped dinner still it was not good at allFirst of all... too modern of a japanese restaurant. Most of the clientele are hip caucasian people.


a true japanese restaurant would serve you hot tea or Ocha as soon as you sit down. But here you have to ask for tea, water or others.

Our waiter was a little arrogant. He seems put off by the fact that we don't drink.. nor care to drink.

we ordered the Sashimi tasting menu $85 for 21 pieces. Sushi tasting with 13 pieces and 6 rolls. And Kobe Steak with Soy Garlic.

We were.. still hungry... eventhough the total bill was $298!!!!!!

not worth coming at all!!!When at Aria...GO FOR ANOTHER RESTAURANT.

You can read my details in a bit, but overall, I think the food sucks and overprice!

I went here because my wife wanted to have Italian.  It was also last minute so I did not do research.  I though since it is at Aria, how bad could it be?  Boy, was I wrong.  We did not want to wait another 30 minutes, so we went straight to the bar section where we can still order the same food.  We got the "regular" menu and the more "extravagant" menu.  I selected the meat lasagna.  My wife was about to order to clam lingunie, but I said since we are here why not go for the lobster ravioli...so she did.  When my meat lasagna came (pictured is available by another reviewer), it wasn't bad looking.  The taste was reasonable; although I think it is microwave.  The center was hot but not the outside.  Additionally, the food got cold quickly.  When the lobster ravioli came, we were totally disappointed!!!  The ravioli was extremely small.  They are about the size of a 1/2 dollar coin and flat!  I didn't taste any lobster.  It looked like somethng you order form Trader Joe's, boiled and served.  This item cost $39!!

The service was reasonable from bar.  So I paid my 15% as a courtesy.  However, I didn't realize my credit card was missing until an hour later.  My wife called the restaurant and they said they'll keep it up until closing; otherwise, they will have to give it to the security card if I don't pick it up by the same night.  I rushed back to the restaurant and talk to the front desk.  I was then told security came and insisted that the credit card to be held at their office.  So I had to go all the way to the security station.

So, overall, I think the food sucks and overprice.  Service was so so.  I tried other restaurants and I think they were most tasteful.Beautiful room and very good service.  The down side:  very noisy, very few value wines ($50 range), parmesan crackers that were stale, supermarket quality antipasto meats, supermarket quality lasagna, and a dry veal chip that tasted as if if were burnt.I was there with my friend on 5/23 for dinner and both had the tasting menu. I also had the wine paring. If I could give a negative star rating, I would. We paid $350 in total with multiple supplements. I got tin foil in one of my dishes. I got apologies and a new plate, but no offer to discount the bill. For this expensive a place, I was appalled, but didn't want to make a scene. I shouldn't have had to ask to have them do something to make up for it.  I have frequented many a Michelin star restaurant and most of the fine dining restaurants in San Francisco and Napa Valley.  In addition, we both felt the food was underwhelming.  This lack of customer service is shocking and insulting. This was supposed to be our nice meal of the trip and I couldn't have been more upset at the experience.Does this place deserve a one star? Yes on many levels. Let's start with the price. $32 for dinner on a Monday night. OUCH! I immediately look around to see if it's the decor or view that I am paying for but disappointed to find neither. Keep in mind for this price I expect the quality to be on par with Belagio, Wynn, Rio, and the M. So you think my money MUST go to the food. No such luck as the courses are typical of all the buffets here in Las Vegas, but served colder and under-seasoned.

The bottom line is don't waste your money and your calories here.If Aria, a 5-star hotel, is going to offer a buffet, you'd expect it to be spectacular or at least up to par. Bellagio has it, so why not Aria, right? I  came here with my family yesterday--truly DISAPPOINTED! My mom took a bite of the cold cut meat and spat it out because it had a foul taste and smell to it. I saw the meat, but didn't get it because they looked like they had been sitting there for a good while. I was going to try granola with yogurt, but it had a film on the yogurt as if it had been sitting there for a VERY LONG TIME. My first round barely filled the plate because nothing looked really fresh. I am not a picky eater or a harsh food critic, but I am not going to eat something that looks like it had been sitting there from last night. The tomato salad looked like it had been sitting there for a good while, too. Management is obviously the problem and ARIA NEEDS TO TAKE NOTE OF THIS! WHAT IS THIS PLACE TRYING TO DO? GIVE US FOOD POISONING??? C'mon!!! If your buffet selection is not great, at least make sure that your food is fresh. I was at the curry section yesterday and they didnt even bother to empty out the old curry. Instead, they just threw more fresh ones on top. The old ones on the bottom will only turn bad, it's not going to make it more fresh with the fresh ones on top. The only best section of the buffet was the dessert section. Even though options were not many, at least they looked decently fresh.If I am eating in a hotel like Aria I expect the food to be great!
The food was terrible. 
We asked for mixed vegetables in garlic sauce and all we got was Chinese broccoli. When we asked the waiter he said the chef did not think one should use other vegetables in that sauce.
They did not make us a vegetarian curry either.
Spring rolls were too oily!when you go there ...watch out for the lady changing the fruit and salad station.  They wear gloves, BUT, handles cleaning rag, then puts her same hands back in the food.  NASTY and contaminating.Waiting, still waiting. Ordered a delivery and it never showed. Had to do pizzahut as a back up after waiting an hour.I can't express how awful this store is. don't go to this location. drive to any other location!  the staff is useless. no one knows what they are doing. they just wander around looking down at their iPads trying to avoid customers it seems. and if you get Mackenzie just walk away. . someone should really punch him already.AWFUL, AWFUL, they do not wear gloves they touch everything with their
hands.come to this place for take out and they will expect you to tip them. for what? they make the food and you pick it up. and if you don't they will yell at you. very rude. food isn't the best. just ok.I've been here about 4 times and the last was what made me decide never to come back. I will say, the rolls are great. They have  a lot to choose from. However if your expecting it to come fast, think again. The service is very slow here and not friendly. They take forever to come take your order and don't visit your table very often, so when I ordered from here I would try to get most things I wanted in one visit. However that's not even good enough, like I said before, the food comes out very slow. I have no clue why. Last time I ordered sashimi and some rolls. All my rolls came first and then sashimi last. What's the point in the sashimi if I cant even get that first? Anyway I was here with a friend trying to enjoy the night when I noticed a few people down the table/booth seating quickly get up and whimper. Sure enough I look down  at my seat and there's a cockroach crawling right towards my leg. I got up quickly and started to lightly laugh, even though I was less than pleased. I didn't want to cause more of a scene since the other people were furious. They left without paying. The waitress explained to us that it never happens, and they sprayed that morning. Well if have to spray for bugs.. you must have a problem with it? Anyway, we finished our sushi, and no discount was offered for the inconvenience. Needless to say, I wont be returning.Don't bother!  The view is the only thing they have! What a joke! Nobody in the bar! Could it be because of the smelly mop bucket by the front door?I thought this place was horrible.  We were here Sunday late afternoon and evening October 16 2011.  The place is lovely enough as you walk through but nothing too special by Vegas standards.  The problems I had:  It's an extremely bright facility and super casual vibe as far as the loudness of the staff  and how they carry on.  It's not a very hushed space and does not offer that zen like quality most spas strive to design and deliver. We found the furniture to be firm, cushions as hard as rocks and had that made to last quality and not at all comfortable. My spa service was in a room right off the couples lounge with a white glass wall where you see every shadow walk by and hear everything.  After my service I requested a spa food menu as I waited in the couples lounge for my husband to finish up his massage.  The employee I spoke to yelled something to someone else around the corner and that someone else yelled back tell her it will be 45 minutes and how does she plan on paying for it. Nice.  When I was handed the menu it looked like it was ripped out of something and had food stains on it.  I handed it right back, I was no longer interested in food.  The entire  4 hours we we were there no one asked if we needed anything.   The ladies locker room  was clean but minimally stocked as far as amenities and had Britney Spears playing!! Upon checkout my husbands bill was still open and needed to be paid but mine was already closed out on my credit card with gratuity added without my knowledge.  The two young girls working the desk were very helpful and seemed concerned and they went back a few times to check with the manager who appeared to be right behind the wall of the front desk area where we were standing.  The manager NEVER showed their face to even talk to us or express interest or concern with our experience the girls just passed on the message the manager said they're not sure what happened with the credit card.  We will not be returning.  There are a lot of wonderful spas in Las Vegas for us to spend our time and money at.  This was very disappointing as we do love to spend time at The Green Valley Ranch resort and have never had this sort of experience at the good restaurants or hotel there.Do not eat here. I would give negative stars if I could. Waitress charged me $10 more.  When disputing it, she said that's because of tax, when it clearly said subtotal. It was my birthday and I waited an hour and a half for my bill, missed my movie. The manager is even worse. He slammed the receipt and rolled his eyes. I couldn't believe it. I wasnt rude, I was just disputing the charge. Theres a whole list more to say negative about this place, but it would be 2 pages long. ALSO, check your bill, they will try to charge you extra than what the menu states.Some friends and I went out for some pool and drinks at spirits. The doorman told us about a $5.00 wristband deal that would allow us to drink $1.00 you call it's until 11 pm. It was about a little before 10:00 pm so we figured it was a pretty decent deal and the 4 of us paid. We each had 1-2 drinks before ordering our next round. At this point it was 10:30 pm and when the waitress brought us our drinks she graciously informed me she would let us buy these drinks for the $1.00 price but that was it. I then informed her that the doorman told us it was until 11 pm and was told, "oh they don't ever tell us anything until last minute, it's 10:30 not 11:00" we got the same awesome customer service from the clueless doorman. Now, 5 bucks isn't going to make or break me but I feel like we got screwed over and it was our problem so we could deal with it, oh well. I think that's just shady business and we left after finishing our drinks. I wasn't about to give them more of my money and I don't ever intend to in the future. If you choose to spend your free time here, make sure you synchronize your watches...I've been to this location (W. Flamingo/Grand Canyon) three times in the past month. Every time, I've had to wait 15 minutes or more for one smoothie. Twice I went into the cafe and once I went through the drive-thru. 

When I tried the drive-thru, there were only 3 cars in line. Waited in line for 15 minutes, only to be told (when I got to the window) that they didn't get my order so I had to wait another 5 minutes as they made it. 

The last time I went in (on a Sunday afternoon), I waited almost 25 minutes for one smoothie!!! It looked like there was only one person working the register and the same person was making the smoothies. Right before I left, I saw 3 other employees pop up, but who knows what they were doing the whole time.

Won't go to this location ever again.I simply came in to ask for an appointment an the Asian woman there was extremely rude. She didnt look at me at all..the place was empty and she said she couldn't provide me with a pedicure. She didn't check her schedule or ask me to come back. Don't recommended this place at all!!!!!! Staff is extremely stuck up...they do nails...come on!!! Negative 5 stars!!!Grace is extremely unprofessional. Answered her cell phone while dealing with customers to talk to what sounded like a CPS employee about a child. 

Later in the day I was called and asked to come back and pay more knee because Grace did not charge me correctly. I will never go back to this establishment.The service was horible and so was the food. I'll never go back to this place. Plain sucks and the are very cheap about the food. I was told I can have anythin on the menu and then told that I can on have 2 peices of musselsI lived in these apartments from June 2011 until about 2 weeks ago and let me say this:

This is, hands down, the WORST experience I have EVER had with a rental community. I kept the apartment in very good condition and followed all rules and regulations. I payed my rent on time as per my rental agreement and was an upstanding member of the Shade community. Shade apartments, however, failed to do the same. Where do I begin??

- Every single day, no matter what time of day, I had to walk my puppy around the piles of feces left all over the property. The ground are absolutely disgusting!

- There was NO noise ordinance despite their "rules" about quiet time after 10pm 

- There were drunk people and homeless people sleeping at the pool

- My apartment was infested with cockroaches and bugs and I am a CLEAN person!

- Now, upon move out, I am being told that I owe close to $800 for replacement of carpet because of "excessive pet damage". The carpet was of the lowest grade possible; a step up from a thin stack of papers and every time I walked on the carpet I risked getting a staple in my foot. The black top from the outside traveled onto the carpet with me which is normal wear and tear, NOT excessive pet damage. My puppy is all of 9 lbs and NEVER had one accident in the apartment. When I spoke to someone in corporate, she made it clear that she could have cared less. Her response to my concerns were "oh well, I'm sorry you feel that way".

I would not recommend this place to ANYONE!I was so disappointed! 
Petit Fromage is now located inside Delicious Dishes. There is only a small case of cheese. I asked a staff member which of the blue cheeses she preferred and she wrinkled her nose and said "eww I don't eat blue cheese". HUH?? Needless to say I was ready to walk out. I asked which of the cheeses were made locally besides the one brand of goat cheese I recognized and she began looking around to find the place of origin. 
These people don't know anything about the cheese and the selection is awful!I have been meaning to get around to making a Yelp account for a while now, mostly for all of the great places I like to go. However, the final motivating factor for me to make this account was the terrible experience I had here. 

I arrived on a weekday afternoon around 4:25. My boss had sent me out to grab us some food while he worked with a client. I ordered two chicken dinner platters to go. We had worked through lunch that day and I was starving. The food took well over 30 minutes. This is not an exaggeration, I checked the time on my receipt. My to go order literally took over thirty minutes. The people behind the counter apologized multiple times, but that really doesn't mean much to me when my boss is waiting on our food and I have to come back over half an hour later, like an idiot, from a restaurant I picked. Seriously, it is this strips of chicken on skewers. There is no way it should take that long to cook. 

Before this I had only been here once before. That previous time, I had arrived mid-day on a Saturday, half-drunk from a pool party. I remember thinking that the service was slow that time too, but like I said, I was half-drunk. 

I can now say with confidence that with both of my experiences here, the 'Express' in the name of the establishment is a joke. The food is tasty but not worth the half hour wait. I will never return to this establishment.Went there for lunch today, and was not a big fan.

They charged me extra because i wanted veggies & chicken in my burritto bowl, and hardly gave me any chicken. Came to just under $9.00.

The food was average at best, I would do Chipotle any day over this place.

The girls behind the counter were not all that helpful either.This review pertains to their subsidiary airline, "Go!" in the Hawaiian islands. Don't Fly Go!
Wow! I have never run into a less competent airline. These people couldn't run a bicycle-rickshaw taxi service, let alone an airline. If you're spending a lot of money to come and enjoy the islands, don't do what I've done, which is book interisland flights through go. They'll be at least an hour late most of the time. However, today one flight left 12 minutes early, and so I missed my connection. I watched my aircraft pull away as I was arriving on another - they couldn't hold it for two minutes. Why?
Because they don't care. At all! Not even a little. No apology for allowing an aircraft to leave 12 minutes early, consigning me to an later flight. This is, fortunately, the last flight I've booked with Go, and I will never, ever book another flight with them, or with any other Mesa Air Group airline.If you guys could only see the type of van they deliver in. After reading OnTrac reviews on yelp I instantly got frightened that my shipment containing a mother board and other expensive computer items would be lost and or stolen. So I opened my garage door and waited for them to show up. They didn't show up late but... the type of delivery truck they used wasn't even a truck. It was a beat down old shady looking van with 1 sticker on the back that had the companies name on it. The guy pulls up and asks me if this was the address and I said yes. He opens the back of his truck and the boxes are just thrown in there. I see fragile seals. with the boxes flipped and thrown all over the place. Horrible. I actually got a picture of the dude and the van.

https://pbs.twimg.com/media/A7NSII6CAAEbtUk.jpg

The guy who delivered was extremely rude and seemed like he just wanted to get his runs over with. 

Good luck to anyone else who uses or is condemned to using this company.These guys are slackers.
They screw up Amazon Prime orders and make Amazon look bad.
Waited the whole day for a package but didn't arrive, no word from anyone.
Amazon Prime never fails, unless of course its delivered by Ontrac.
Their tracking online is centuries away from FedEx and UPS.

Avoid like a plagueBeing a fan of Emeril's restaurants, we decided to go here for lunch and so my partner could watch a few games and were excited to try this place out.

I cannot rate the food because we never got to eat.  The service was spectacularly poor-  Rude waitstaff and the hostesses seems to be terribly bothered by our arrival.  We waited and waited to order drinks, and then waited some more for them to come.  The only server we could see in the place was beyond rude, and actually waled away from us while we were trying to place an order.

Though it is probably needless to say, we will NOT be back.OMG!!!!! I can"t believe how terrible the service and food was. First of all they treat travelzoo customers like crap. When they say we had a travezoo coupon they brought out this hand written white piece of paper menu. Are you kidding me. You only had four choices to choice from for apps and entree. The red head spiked man waiter is full of you know what and need to quick or quickly get fired!!!!!! I CAN'T BELIEVE EMERIL ! HE NEEDS TO PAY ATTENTION TO HIS RESTAURANTS AND NOT JUST COLLECT THE MONEY. I WILL NEVER GO BACK!!!!DO NOT GO HERE.  Reservations are recommended.  However, regardless of how far in advance you make a reservation, they can choose to rent the place out to  anytime they want.  Then they have some snotty waitress call you and try to "sell" you on attending another time.  

It's apparent that Emeril has sold out and turned in to just another jerk trying to make a buck without regard to how his customers are treated.  NOT ONLY WILL I NEVER GO BACK TO THIS PLACE... he has 3 restaurants in New Orleans and I will be sure to tell everyone I know in Louisiana to not patronize these places either.

I am shocked at how I was treated and if this place continues to treat people this way, they'll sink themselves.I made an appointment at  this location to look at dresses for my bridesmaids and myself. The customer service was definitely lacking. When my bridesmaids had gathered an armful of dresses to try on, I was the one that grabbed them and went and found a dressing room (while one of the employees watched me). They had to find their own undergarments to try on with the dresses. We had to ask for clips to pin in some of the dresses. All of this should have been done for us since we had an appointment. When I decided to look at dresses for myself I told the lady what I wanted. Instead of offering to show me what dresses they had similar to what I wanted she just said that they did have some dresses similar and left it at that. I ended up going and looking myself. In addition to having no customer service they had very few sizes to try on. My MOH fell in love with one of the dresses and decided to get it there. The rest of us went across the way to David's Bridal where we had another appointment scheduled. We all ended up getting our dresses there instead.7.14.12.  After two months of waiting for someone to replace screws into the concrete block wall from the broken security gate--the company finally fixed this.  They also finally completed the pony wall 6 months later.  We got the landscaping contract after the job was finished last year, as we were afraid our plants would die, and we wanted some insurance.  Well, the landscaping crew just came yesterday.  It does not appear that they trimmed any of the plants/lantanas or trees.  There are two plants that died.  We have generally had to wait months before the plants have been replaced.  We'll see how long it takes them to replace the two that died.  Take a look at the pictures and tell me whether it looks like our yard has been serviced by a professional landscaping company.I had a kind of unique situation in my dealings with Mini of Las Vegas. I was driving my friend's car while she was teaching for a year in Korea. Before she left for Korea, she had the car serviced at Mini of LV and was told nothing was wrong with it other than the car needing new tires. I had the car for about six months when the check engine light came on. My friend said she thought she still had a warranty and to call the dealership. I called and spoke with Chris in Finance who advised me that there was a warranty in place and that I should get the car in as soon as possible. I dropped the car off and was told there was a diagnostic fee of almost $170. I said that there was a warranty in place and they said that the $170 would go toward the deductible. I got a call a few days later from Carlos in the Service Department advising that the repairs would cost about $3000+. I asked what would be covered by the warranty and he said there was no warranty. I told him about my conversation with the Finance Department and he said he would speak to them and call me back. There was a whole bunch of back and forth between me, Chris and Carlos. I feel like it was just a total and complete bait and switch. There is no way that I would have brought the car into the dealership had I been given the right information at the time of my initial call to Mini of LV. I didn't get the repairs done and asked them to waive the diagnostic fee because of the mix up on their part. Carlos advised me that would "work with me" on the fee and reduce it to $100. When I picked the car up, I was told by the cashier that the fee was $120. Seriously? I ended up paying the $120 just to get the heck out of there. I am beyond disappointed with the false information of the finance department, the lack of communication between departments at the same location, and the lack of customer service given by all of the people I dealt with.I really don't know what the rave about this place is!?  Came here on a Monday afternoon for lunch and ordered the single burger with some fries.  The gal at the counter was super nice and cool.  

However, I can't say the same for the burger.  Pretty simple one patty burger with tomatoes, onions, and pickles....um...yeah that's about it.  My patty was not super dry, but darn close.  The bun was you basic hamburger bun.  So really why does it cost what it cost for such a simple burger.  Because it's made with a "modern" grill?  I could get the same at Mc'ds and be more content and plus at least I'll get a toy with it in a pretty box.  Mines with in a brown bag with Modern Burger stamp....yahhhh....... :(

Overall, I'm baffle why people would compare this burger as one of the best in town.  Shame on you fools!  I wasn't even in a bad mood when I came  -- was totally in an awesome mood so nope -- last time I checked I don't have those time of the months.  Maybe someday I'll feel to give this a try, but for now; sorry folks can't recommend - Enjoy!Never again. I have been to the location in ahwatukee before and like the yogurt so I decided to try to one near my house. I was ordering and I noticed the woman wasn't listening to me she was listening to two customers behind me. I turned around to see what was so intriguing and noticed the other customers were intensely staring at the ground near my feet. I looked down and there was a cockroach crawling across the floor! The woman behind the counter didn't do anything and the customers ended up seeing a random broom laying around, grabbed it and smashed it over and over again before my unbelieving eyes. I paid for the yogurt I ordered but I threw it out before taking one bite. The yogurt is good but not good enough to make me forget about what I saw.WORST FILIBERTOS EVER. They seriously just tried to charge me 6.50 for two beef tacos! This filibertos menu and their prices as well as quality of food has always been subpar to the majority of filibertos in the valley. Their food was always about 70 percent as good as other Filibertos I've been to but now charging so much it's definitely not worth the visit. Most other filibertos in the valley charged a 1.99 for a taco. I could have gotten this in a combination plate for 6.50,  same chain all other locations. This restaurant won't be around for long if they keep this upUnfortunately, the staff (non-instructors) here are severely incompetent, in particular the sales manager. My experience pertains to bringing a family member to the gym in order for her to try out the gym, which resulted in a  verbally abusive, utterly unprofessional encounter.

Upon inquiring of the staff in-person previously, I was instructed by the front desk staff to apply for a 1-week trial membership in person at the gym, as opposed to downloading online (3-day passes only). Rather than acknowledging his staff had thus misinformed me, this sales manager was extremely offended that I maintained this was the instruction I had received, and denied that the gym ever provides 1-week memberships. Verbatim, he dismissed his entire front desk staff: "don't talk to them, they don't know anything, they should direct you to the sales staff." Ironic that he would both treat his client and staff with outright rudeness.

Fortunately, am here on a short-term membership plan, would never consider long-term membership at this location.Restaurant is out of business.Very displeased with the food you get better taste at taco bell, tortilla soup literally "velveeta soup, ceviche not good, taco platter w/rice and beans, frozen dinners are better. Don't recommend it. Oh by the way the happy hour drinks not soooo good slurpees have more taste.Sorry apple. Love your products. This store needs a major overhaul of practice , procedures and customer awareness. ATTN: Manager.
I Have now left this store for the third time unable to
Complete a purchase. Hard to believe, but true simply  because no  "specialists" were available 
 to process the transaction. In the end I purchased my iPhone from at&t and it was a great experience. My iPad from target And now I am going to purchase my new Mac book online. I wanted to
Have it for today, but will have to wait for UPS. Either way Apple still gets my business .
But is this really a long term successful business practice?
Apple might want to look at GM to remind them of what they don't want to become. And yes I am frustrated. I just wanted to spend some money  and they would not take it at this store.I read the reviews before coming here... I thought this place would be a great new park to take my dog to since we just moved to the area. Prior, we had been going to the surprise dog park. Within 15 minutes of getting there my dog was attacked by 3 pittbulls. The owner could have cared less nor did he try to pull their dogs off mine. I fought these dogs off mine until I could free her. I was so in fear for my dogs life I rushed her off to the ER Vet and didn't get contact info. I had a $900 bill and needless to say I will never return. I know this is an isolated incident but please beware of aggressive dogs at this park.Hands down one of the worst cocktails I ever had anywhere!!!

Went to this places on a Saturday evening with a few friends after dinner!
Asked waiter for some cocktail recommendations...
4 of us got the espresso Martinis!
they had the cheapest lousiest Vodka (tasted like turpentine)! 
Another buddy ordered a White Russian & he was complaining of the same thing. When we brought this up to waiter he did absolutely nothing! The six of us closed our tab & left after this experience & will never go back!Yesterday was the second time I have tried this restaurant (04-15-2012). The first time the food was ok, but the service was great. And the view of the valley is amazing! This time was anything but good! The food was again, just ok. But we were just going out for nachos, so it is hard to mess those up. We sat at the bar. They had 3 bartenders on, not a one of which had a clue what to do. It took forever to get our drinks, and we were never once checked on when we got our food. When we sat for 20 minutes with empty plates and empty drinks in front of us it was obvious we were not going to be offered anything else so once we finally got one of the bartenders attention and asked for our check we were told just a minute. Five minutes later we still had no check and she was just walking around behind the bar putting glasses up. We then asked another bartender for our check. Again nothing. By now it has been almost 40 minutes trying to get a check. I am still unclear as to the problem since there was only 2 other couples at the bar during this whole time, and the restaurant was not very busy either. So 3 bartenders would have been over kill in any other restaurant in town. But not a single one of them seemed to have any idea what they were supposed to be doing so I guess they needed all 3 idiots. We finally went to the hostess stand to ask someone to get our check. When asked how our dinner was I smiled and let them know the view is amazing, the food was ok, but the service was so bad that I would never be back, and to keep in mind I have a very big mouth and will probably be telling everyone I come across about what a bad experience this was. I am a local bartender as well. I come across quite a few guests in that  general area. I would think with so many choices for mexican food in this town and so many restaurants struggling to stay open in these tough times they would be able to find someone that actually wants to make sure the guest is happy. I guess the fact that their food is just ok, and they don't seem to have to strive for better there why bother with the service? The name on our check was Adriana. I have no idea which of the 3 she was, but it really doesn't matter. All three were equally as bad with their skills, or actually lack their of! 
Save your time and money and go someplace that actually appreciates your business. This place obviously does not!IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR OVER PRICED, SEVEN DOLLAR JUICE, EXTREMELY SLOW SERVICE, AND HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE, BB KINGS IS THE PLACE FOR YOU!!!


After eating here in August (yes August, and it is now December), I will never give them my business again. I write to you months later because this is how long the dispute has been going on for, and still no one from their company has called to settle it.

 

This past august my family stayed at the Mirage. BB Kings was the only breakfast place, so we gave it a shot. After finishing my breakfast (an egg dish) and my orange juice, my party received the check. My eyes bulged as I saw the mediocre orange juice I had just finished was SEVEN DOLLARS. Listen, I am a Los Angeles girl (born and raised), and anyone who knows me knows I am not opposed to spending money on a good meal. In this instance however, next to being sprinkled with gold, this orange juice was no where near being worth seven dollars. Before speaking to someone I checked a menu to make sure it wasn't me who had bypassed the price listed, but surprise surprise, there WERE no drink prices listed. Here's where the great customer service comes in.

 

After speaking to a manager, I was asked if my waitress had warned us that the juice was seven dollars at this establishment. Clearly my answer was no. She apologized, voiced that they were supposed to inform all customers of this cost, and that she would comp "the entire bill." Sounds like a good compensation, and like I always say, it's about how an establishment handles problematic occurrences that sets their bar. I had washed my hands of the whole ordeal, or so I thought.

 

Finally I received my monthly credit card bill, and here's where the dilemma began. BB Kings and their great accounting department charged me for the whole meal and then comped me for the meal. Sounds good right? It was Void. But later down in the bill another charge for the entire cost of the meal was on my statement. Despite the easy math, no one at the restaurant could comprehend the problem with these charges. If you charge someone twice and comp them once, YOU ARE STILL CHARGING THEM! After sitting on the phone with several managers at BB Kings, explaining the entire experience several times over, and being told that someone would be in touch with me within a day, I figured it had to click for SOMEone on their end. Well that was in September...so you do the math.I have yet to hear from anyone.

I WON'T BE GIVING THEM MY BUSINESS ANY TIME SOONThis is with a doubt the worst sephora I have ever been to, and i have been to many of them! Upon arrival the store was dirty, disheveled and no employees bothered to greet me, or my sister! We walked in with the intention of purchasing a liquid eyeliner, lip glosses and mascara. We asked two different girls for help. Both times we were ignored. Finally my sister had enough and went directly to an employee and asked for help. The girl rolled her eyes several times and gave as much attitude as she could possibly muster. When my sister complimented her eyeliner she responded with "it's JUST Sephora" in a derogatory manner. Her lack of enthusiasm for JUST Sephora brand make-up has convinced me to never purchase JUST Sephora again. I will continue to purchase MAC and Estee Lauder.

Overall the employees are rude, hateful and lack knowledge about make-up products. I will never return to this sorry excuse of a Sephora for as long as I live and I will continue to spread the truth about the b*****$ that work here!

I hate to give a negative rating to Sephora but the treatment we received by the employees was outlandish and uncalled for! I guess Sephora doesn't care too much about the economic depression, but we consumers do; and I will continue to take my business to make-up personnel with knowledge, and manners who actually like the company they work for and support their brand.I have to say I was pretty disappointed in my first (and last) visit here. Upon walking in, the short brunette hostess/server with braces said "hi. Two?". No smile, horrible demeanor. After that lovely intro, I noticed the interior was very nice but the food immediatley negated it all. Our queso dip was okay, nothing special. The actual entrees were abysmal. I had the 6 rolled tacos which had slim to no meat in them and though I put sour cream and pico on them, the pico was lackluster and soggy, adding no flavor. I ate 2 of them and raised my white flag to surrender. My boyfriend got the enchilada platter and said it was "disgusting". Well, my love, you dragged me here over where I wanted to go, so. We left our plates and appetizer barely touched, paid our bill and left. Yuck. Yuck. Yuck. Never again.Brought my Buick in for a simple oil change and was told that I had $2348 worth of oil leaks. I have never seen a single drop of oil on my driveway so I took my car for a second opinion. Thank Goodness the other (more honest) shop told me that absolutely NOTHING was needed! I will never set foot in this location again!At lot of attitude and bad food? No thanks.

There's a vicious cycle when it comes to making assumptions about your patrons. You think, 'they look young and they ordered tap water. I bet they aren't going to spend much money here. I am going to ignore them." Well you know what happens when you never see your waiter again and have to order through managers all night? You get a bad tip.

We ordered some sangria, the red, which was alright but not great. Then we ordered a few plates of tapas, to get us started. We had the risotto which was just terrible and a few other things as well. The only good thing was the ceviche, but I've certainly had better. It was a tiny bit of food for a lot of money and a lot more attitude.

There are much better options out there. I will not be back.Food Poisoning (Salmonella) is what we got!  My husband and I took our 4 kids here Friday night 11-25-11 Black Friday.  Ordered the all meat pizza.  Our 7 yr old didn't want it.  So he got the PBJ and apple off kids menu.  He never ate the pizza.  My husband and two daughters ate some of his apple.  My other son and I didn't.  Later that night my 7 yr old son complained of headache and stomach ache.  He started vomiting.  Next morning my 13 yr old daughter complained of same thing and vomited all over.  Then an hour later my husband started vomiting and terrible stomach pains and explosive diarrhea.  My 17 yr old daughter then got headache. She went on to a baseball game.  While there she vomited terribly in the bathroom all over the floor, toilet and herself.  Very humiliating.  The drive home was an hour and she was so sick. My 16 yr old son and I are the only ones not sick.  The apple is the only common denominator.  Fevers set in and back/neck pains.  I have never cleaned up so much vomit and crap in my life.  

I called MM manager and told him. He was clueless.  He couldn't understand how an apple could do this.  Hello?  What do you use to cut the apple?  Where did you cut it?  Did you wash it before serving?  Did the cook wash his hands after touching raw meat before he cut the apple?  Figure it out!!! Before you get all your customers sick to death!   OMFG.   Mellow my ass!  This food poisoning was nothing like Mellow.  It was awful. 

We have been here 3 other times.  First time they burnt our pizzas.  The other two times were ok.   Pizza is not bad, but not my favorite.  Very disappointing. We won't be going back.  I'll find a better place to spend a $75.Closed.  The new restaurant in it's place is called Mandarin Buffet.  Haven't tried it yet.Wow this place sucks.  Girlfriend got sick and the food was way overpriced.  Staff was nice until they realized how disapointed we were with the purple burger buns and nasty wiped avacado mayo and ignored us, probably because they recommended the meal we got.  I think they realize how much their lives suck working a horrible sugar factory location that just poisons and robs customers.ClosedThings got ugly!!! 2 employees: 2 different stories. The customer service was lackluster yesterday, but reached epic EVIL today!! I was told by an employee I could exchange a shirt I bought on sale for my husband for store credit and less than 24 hours before and when I arrived today, the manager said, oh no it says on the receipt,  "all sales are final". I explained that I had spoken to 2 of her employees yesterday, one of whom said I COULD NOT return it and the other who said I COULD NOT return it for a refund BUT COULD RETURN it for a store credit or exchange. The size was slightly off, so I brought one of the shirts back to exchange it for some items I had looked at yesterday (in case I had to return the shirt). Amy, the manager refused the exchange saying "the policy is the policy." So when I explained to her that I was informed by HER EMPLOYEE something different she said, "I am not the owner, I don't make the policy" well, whoever the owner is, I hope you understand that is NOT the type of service that will earn my loyalty or that one might expect, especially in an upscale shopping center like the Scottsdale Quarter  (but really anywhere).  I work in customer service and I would NEVER have lost a customer for life over a 20 dollar sale exchange.  I dislike when managers don't stand behind their employees and won't do what is right for the customer. So unfortunately,  I would not shop there again and can't recommend it to anyone.This place has super fast service but that is about it.  The bread is terrible.  It is dry and stale.  They also have minimal topping choices.  I would rather wait the extra few minutes at Subway for my sandwich.My business partner and I are always all over the city and noticed the Native New Yorker sign was removed from the store and a banner for "The Brickyard" was in its place. Figured we would stop in and check it out and drop off a card in case they were shopping for a new sign. The waitress was very nice, almost too nice and offered up more information about the business than I would want my employee too. Apparently the owners disengaged from the N.N.Y franchise, there are legal issues, she's the only waitress left with the changes, etc. The place looks exactly the same, but they now advertise $.36 cent wings on Tuesday, not $.35 cents. Apparently this is a N.N.Y thing and being they disenfranchised, can't advertise it. The waitress made sure to tell me "they still only charge $.35 though". I ordered 20 wings and a soda, my business partner ordered the philly cheese steak and a soda. The place was pretty dead, but it took a good 20 minutes to get our orders. The wings were nothing special...lots of breading, sauce had little flavor. My biz partner said the same thing about his sandwich. After eating 12 of the 20 wings, I figured I would take them to go and asked for a box. I was responded to with a sign and a roll of the eyes from the waitress, who said "I can't take them". She informed us that the wing price was for dine in orders only and that I HAD TO LEAVE THEM THERE!!! She said they lose money on the wings and expect people to order other things to help offset the loss. Sure, I could see if I came in and ordered 50 wings, ate one with a glass of water and left. We came in, ordered food, at there and ordered other stuff. The waitress made a huge scene and a lady at another table overheard the commotion and let me know she ordered wings too, but the waitress told her she needed to order a drink to get the wings for that price (which isn't noted on their window advertising at all). She made a point of sitting another couple next to us and telling them it was Tuesday wing day and you can only eat the wings there, no matter what else you order. What a joke. I told her if she would have said that to me before I ordered, I would have gotten one wing at a time and made her run back and forth to the kitchen. I also asked her what they would do with the wings I didn't eat if I didn't take them with me, she said they would throw them out. So apparently that's how they treat their customers. She said she was sick of the place because this happens all the time. I guess she should be a little more clear with the customers or this place needs to stop being so damn cheap. I won't be heading back to the Brickyard anytime soon. There's a Native New Yorker on 19th ave and Happy Valley that appreciates my business.I was contemplating on giving them two stars, but I really had to reach here and think of something else nice to say and basically came up with nothing, so here goes.

This is our first visit. The place was packed so I thought, "Must be a good sign, right." There was one empty table, but the hostess didn't even move and just pointed it out to us and said, "You can just sit over there." 

Food here gets no love from me. We ordered 2 orders of negitoro and salmon hand rolls, combination plate w/ 2 entrees (garlic chicken & miso black cod) which is supposed to come with miso soup, salad, rice, and dessert. We also got a spider roll. Let's start with what I liked, which was the miso black cod. I thought it was delicious and cooked just right. I would order this again. Unfortunately, I can't say the same with the rest of our orders. The garlic chicken was so greasy and just didn't look right. I had garlic chicken before from 808 Hawaii Mixed Plate which I loved, so I was expecting it to resemble that but I was let down. The salmon hand roll is ok. I had better at a Korean/Sushi/Chinese place we dined at yesterday. The negitoro was worse. It was basically just tuna sliced in cubes with scallions hurriedly put on top. The spider roll was the worst thing I've ever eaten in a long time: completely drenched in sauce that it completely fell apart when I barely picked it up with my chopsticks. I had a small bite and quickly put it back to the plate. The dessert never came to our table so I cannot comment on it. 

At this point I just want to leave and move on so we asked for the bill. Our combo plate was supposed to be $14.95 but we were charged $29. They could have thought we ordered 2 combo plates but our bill specifically stated: 1 Combo B: $29.99. I pointed it out and the lady apologized and fixed the mistake right away. I'm just glad I caught it while we were still there. Needless to say I am not coming back.Awful. The staff here is a joke. Made a reservation a week in advance for a group of 10 people for a bachelor party. They gave away our table as we were waiting and were forced to wait another hour as other groups arrived and were seated promptly. Definitely ruined the one group dinner event we had planned and did a good job of making us feel as if our business did not matter.The food is disgusting!Great food.  Way overpriced.  Tableside guacamole.  Two people, bill was over $250.  I'd say that it was some real expensive Mexican food.Want food poisoning several times over? Then this is the place to gamble! With the last few times my family and I have been here over this past year, we've won the sickness almost every time.

When this location first started, it was great. I've been a fan of Filibertos for years, and when this opened, I was grateful. But recently, things have gone awry and we no longer go here because of the horrible problems we receive after we've eaten. Along with that, they've also gotten our orders wrong a few times. We once received a lengua (cow tongue) taco instead of our ordered beef taco. I'm disappointed in this establishment.the absolute worst service EVER!!!!!You are not allowed to use the wireless. Thats pretty sad.  But they do have diet cokeThis place use to be sushi dans, all they did is change the name.the service is horrible and we were the only ones in there during dinner, guess I know why now. I went in for the AYCE and sake they tried to charge me for the sake, even though they had a sign outside saying it was AYCE and sake. This place is a joke, the sushi isn't half bad but the whole experience killed it.There are way better sushi places in vegas than here, like blue fin!I called their 877# for information & to book a Hoover Dam Deluxe tour .  April answered both times and she is a very rude, impatient woman.   As I write this, I am currently on hold for the second time, as the first time I was "disconnected."  The first time I was on hold for 5 minutes until disconnect, and am now on hold for this 2nd call over 5 minutes.  (It's on their dime, so I don't care!!!)  Still no one has picked up to help me.  I am getting nowhere and they are not getting my money either!!!  By the way, April just hung up on me, again!!!I'm the only one here slow down, manager Kathleen isn't a very good people person. I would probably demote her to back of the restaurant so she can't interact with anyone.I have been to this location many times, as well as other locations (Bell and 35th, Scottsdale and Carefree).  It is a pretty good breakfast place, but the service can often be sub par at this location.   

This morning, I brought my parents, wife and 2 year old there.  45 minutes after placing our order we asked how long until our food would be out, 10 minutes after that I went to find the manager.

The manager treated me like I was an idiot, told me that it was taking a while because it was busy (it wasn't very busy compared to some mornings, there were a number of empty tables inside and out).  I explained to her that two tables that were seated 15-20 minutes after us have their meals, and she said it was busy again.  I then pointed out that a family of four that was seated just before us had finished their meal and left, she again told me it was really busy.

I am going to assume that the waitress did not put our meal in, mistakes happen.  I understand that we all make mistakes, but it is what you do after a mistake that makes all the difference.  Don't treat your customers as if they are idiots, tell them that a mistake was made, and that you are fixing it.

To add insult to injury, a waitress tried to carry all of our meals out on her arms with no tray, and dropped my mom's meal.  Happy Mother's Day!  They also forgot a side I ordered.  

The manager did take 50% off the bill, in the future I will drive the extra 10 miles to Scottsdale and Carefree Highway, and I suggest you do as well.We have been going to this Cracker Barrel for a year and a half, since we moved here and it progressively gets worse. The last four times the biscuits were so hard they could be used as hockey pucks. The kitchen help and the waitresses have to know that the biscuits are no longer fresh and need to be thrown away. The gravy was the consistancy of mached potatoes and the hasbrown casserole was dried out  beyond salvation. If the management doesn't open there eyes this place will soon be a ghost town. I will wait several weeks and see if they read this and make the necessary changes, if not, my money spends elsewhere.it's dennys, long wait for food, lackluster service and a hair in the eggs that tasted like vinegar make this a visit that I hope we will all soon forget. It made me feel cheap and dirty, like I needed a shower after having ate a turkey burger with a stale bun. =-(We have been going to Hula Hawaiian BBQ in Buckeye since it opened. At the beginning they were competing with the local Chinese joint. Hula's food was not great, but it was good and the portions were very generous. Later on the local Chinese joint went t!ts up and Hula was the only remotely Asian place in town. Lately the quality of the food has gone downhill and the portions leave much to be desired. The prices, however, didn't change; we spend on average $20 there. Today, 8/23/2011 at around 7pm, I went with my family again but only my wife ordered food totaling about $12 and me and my 8yo son brought a couple of sandwiches from Quiznos next door. Like we always do, we all shared on my wife's drink. We've always had free refills at Hula but today, when I sent my son to refill his soda he was told that we couldn't because we brought food from outside and can't share. WTF??? REALLY??? After I've spent hundreds of $ in that place over the years they're denying a kid a $.05 refill? Well, we're done! That $.05 soda refill just cost you our business. Buckeye is a very small town and restaurants here can't afford to lose business. That explains why the joint was empty. Oh joy! They're opening a Panda Express next door!While our buying experience was excellent - except for the 3 hour wait because they had to use the nissan dealer next door - when we received our paperwork in the mail we discovered they had not used our preapproved CU, instead they sold our paper to another lender - costing us time and money to get it changed. After reading Yelp and Google reviews, it appears this is a common practice. I'll file my complaint with the BBB and have learned my lesson - no matter how nice they are, they are still in business to make money - by doing whatever they have to.My hair still looks awful thanks to the butcher McKenzie. 

The owner did NOT handle the situation well when I went into the "salon" (aka, ghetto strip mall location, do not be fooled by the pictures). She just kept telling me she couldn't make my hair grow back...obviously. 

Please save yourself and learn from my mistake.

This place should be ashamed to call themselves a business. Look at my pictures of the hack job and see for yourself.  Somehow they got the LEGITIMATE picture I posted removed from their page...a shame really because I'm sure it'll happen again.First off,  DO NOT RENT FROM PAYLESS UNLESS YOU ARE A LAWYER AND ARE LOOKING FOR A GOOD COMPANY TO SUE.
Just to start I have rented at least 50 cars and have never gotten the extra insurance offered by a rental agency.  At Payless the agent asked me if  I wanted the extra insurance.  I had two quotes from Orbitz and Autoslash for approx. $157 for a five day rental.  I spent hours looking for good deals because Phoenix is known as an expensive place to rent cars especially because of airport and state taxes and fees.  
Anyway, the agent told me that my rate was $164 which is not much more than the $157 but I showed her my quote on Orbitz and she stated "that is just an estimate".  No big deal but now I am starting to feel like this is where they start pulling a few extra dollars out of you.  
She directs me to put my initials on about five different places on the contract and at this point I tune out.  Usually they want me to initial noting that I have declined the extra insurance (collision damage waiver) which was $26/day on top of the rental base rate of $18/day.  
Long story short.  I return the car.  By the way the guy at the counter is hanging around and asks me for the keys and contract.  Usually at returns someone meets you as you pull in to check the mileage and give you a receipt.  Then I see a receipt and charges for $334!!  I was floored and angered.  I spoke to the agent upstairs at the counter and he said he couldn't help and to call after 8am.  I spoke to the manager and she said I signed the contract and initialed that I had agreed to the coverage.
How am I responsible. Ok, in retrospect I could have looked everything over before I initialled anything and before I signed anything.  To my everlasting chagrin my verbal statement that I did not want the extra insurance was not enough to spare me from their heavy handed "upselling" of the added insurance.  Further, when I complained that they were charging me $164 instead of $157 I made an assumption that I was only going to have to pay $164 not $334 which she never stated to me.  
What have  I learned?  Never rent from Payless again.  I don't want to spend my whole life having to read all the fine print on every rental contract when all I want to do is get my car and get to bed.  
What galls me so much is that I used a website (autoslash) which will reserve a car for you and then check the prices and will rebook your car if the prices go down.  I spent at least an hour maybe more reserving the best priced car rentals for my recent trip to Phoenix and Dallas and now I feel like a fool for having spent so much time trying to get a good deal only to get hosed by Payless b/c they juiced my contract with this insurance. 
My question is whether the sales agents make a commission or receive some bonus or incentive for selling the added insurance? Sometimes, (as in this case) they sell this hard saying that your credit card doesn't really cover very much if you do have damage to the vehicle etc.Warning!  Please don't go there, fresh maybe.  Service OK.  I don't think they know how to mix flavors good.  It was freakishly weird-tasting.Everytime I come here they mess up my drink... The only I like about this location is the baked goods. Never will I return againWorst pediatric dentistry I have ever taken my kids to. I have a 5 year old girl and a 3 year old boy. Once we were called back and waiting for the dentist to see my girl, my boy gets up from his chair reaches down into something (and at this exact moment the dentist is walking in) turns out to be a disposal box for biohazard needles! I about had a heart attack! I told the dentist and his assistant that my son had reached into that box and I didn't know wether he was poked or not. They kinda just blew me off and I asked the assistant as to why that box was on the floor, open, at a pediatric office where there is going to be kids all around she said "its because it's easier for the anesthesiologist" I continued with the visit but in the end I told one of the ladies in the front & she told the manager and she filed an incident report sent me off to concentra to get him tested. Long story short they couldn't help me there so we ended up in the PCH ER room were the doctor said it was unlikely that he was poked, blood was not drawn but that Cute Smiles 4 kids had just violated so many health regulations for leaving a bio hazard box on the floor open and just because it's easier for the anesthesiologist is unexceptable. Needless to say I'm not going back!This place is closed!This place is RIDICULOUS.  Yesterday I took my 2004 Wrangler in for an alignment.  The alignment I was quoted was $89.95.  Fair enough.

Two hours later the service guy calls back with a laundry list of items that MUST be done because he says my vehicle is unsafe to drive.  The estimate was $3200.00!!  Along with the requested alignment, I was told I needed a new steering stabilizer $400, new engine seals $1020, new axle seals $512, new pinion seals $237, new front brakes $200 and on and on.  What?!

The huge red flags were that I needed a road balance for $100.  I immediately called Discount Tire, as they do all my tires, and asked how much a road balance is...$8 per wheel.  Airpark Jeep also said I needed a front and rear differential fluid change.  I had just had a front and rear diff fluid change two weeks ago!

The end result is that I walked away $119 in the hole for a list of "needed" services.  I have no idea if any of these item are legitimate or not and even if some of them are, I know I would be getting completely hosed on the price.

Thanks for confirming all the other horrible reviews Airpark Jeep.  You have confirmed to me you are crooks and taught me a $120 lesson.

BEWARE.  FIND ANOTHER SERVICE CENTER OR MECHANIC.

PS. I walked around their lot for two hours looking at new cars while I waited.  Not once did someone ask if they could help me or if I was interested in a new or used car.  Says to me that their sales department is just as incompetent as their service department.

*UPDATE* - After reading my Yelp review, Mark, the Service Director called and invited me to bring my Jeep back and go through another inspection with me personally.  While I appreciate the follow up and willingness to provide in-depth explanations of the suggested repairs, first impressions are hard to get over.  I am getting a second opinion by an independent mechanic and we'll see how the diagnosis compares.  If the second opinion lines up with Airpark Jeep's suggestions, I'll certainly revise the review.Things have gone down hill...I used to LOVE living here!  It now takes at least 2 weeks to get anything fixed!  I'm on day 17 of NO disposal!  They used to fix things in 1 -2 days...not anymore.We live nearby and thought it would be great to try a local dental office.  Both times my husband and I went in the dental hygienist talked, and talked, and talked to the point of annoyance.  Also, the dentist informed my husband that he needed a considerable amount of work done.  We waited a year (finances!) and went back to our prior dentist - listed in the Phoenix Magazine's "Top Docs" - only to find that NO WORK was necessary or even recommended.I really want to like this place. I love the location and they've done a beautiful job with the space. But I've been here 3 times now plus had takeout once and every time - regardless of how busy it is - the service has sucked. And the food is too mediocre and too overpriced to make up for slow, inattentive, unenthusiastic service. Sorry.worst Verizon store everIt's a great place for rolling up your garage, tuning your cars, and trading engine fixing tips in loud voices all night long!  And welding on a Sunday evening! Actually, it's a nightmare for anybody who lives around it and isn't interested in this culture of male bonding. I will be so happy to move away from my town home in Pepperwood next door, only because I will escape my proximity to those in Alta Ravenwood. It's that bad.HORRIBLE SERVICE!!!  If I could give them less than a star, I would!

I purchased Groupons for this place.  I get there and the owner was SO RUDE!  They had screwed up my reservation and she kept telling me I cancelled my own reservation.  I had all the email confirmations on my phone and tried to have her look at them and she sat there and argued with me for like 10 minutes.  I explained to her that I had taken a half day off work to come to get a mani/pedi, and the massage was just an extra and her reply was "Well, I don't know what to tell you, I sent my nail tech home because you cancelled your reservation!"  I was dumbfounded!  I could NOT believe the treatment!  I asked her if she could see if she could get the nail tech back and she said she would right away, but then went back to typing!  Not calling the nail tech!  I kept asking the people if she called the nail tech back and they acted like I couldn't even hear them and asked her and her reply to them was "No, haven't had a chance to call her yet".  Then they stuck me in some sort of half assed relaxation room for what seemed like 45 minutes (I was the ONLY customer in the whole place by the way).  Then they FINALLY were able to unbusy themselves enough to do a massage.  (Which the massage therapist WAS wonderful by the way - she was the only good thing about this whole horrible place).  Then again at the end, they completely rushed me out, never even offered % off future services, never even said SORRY!    I am requesting a refund from Groupon for the rest of the deals I bought for this horrible place.  You pay money to get pampered, not be treated like crap.  I would NOT recommend this place to ANYONE!!  HORRIBLE HORRIBLE SERVICE from the OWNER!!!Let our reservation go for my new bride on our wedding weekend that we reserved several months in advance and re-confirmed last weekend. Not impressed that we lost our booking without our awareness last night before we checked in because a "large party" came. Interesting that our booking meant nothing.Very bland and very overpriced. Would not recommend this place. 

The service took FOREVER (20mins and you pay at the counter) and the food was entirely trying to be too trendy and lacked in all aspects.

Pass.The food here is bland and the quality is shoddy. For 20 something I expected much better. 

We came here for lunch, and I tried some of the Italian food and Asian food. The food was bland, it tasted like poorly microwaved food. Sure there is a lot of variety, however, to my taste buds everything tasted bland and salty (especially the soups).

Bottom Line: Skip this buffet and go somewhere else.5 star hotel with 1 start service.  Got a handicapped room because we arrived late.  The shower has only curtain and the bathroom was flooded after taking just one shower.  Asked the housekeeping and was told that it was a room for handicapped!!  Called the front desk and wouldn't switch room until next morning.  Finally got room switched at 1:00 am in the morning.  The maid didn't clean up the room thoroughly, and would not provide extra soap.  Would never stay there again.REVIEW OF EVENT HELD AT COSMO NOT A REVIEW OF THE HOTEL


We attended your New Years Eve Skating rink only to be totally disappointed and when I contacted your events department via email I received no reply... please see my email below hopefully I can get some kind of reply now...

Your event at the ice rink was EXTREMELY disappointing. For $160.00 a ticket I would have expected that your event be fully thought out ahead of time and set up flawlessly. We were expecting to see and hear the Bruno Mars concert. One it finally came on at 11pm (no one could give us a definite start time) it was only on the screen for not even 10 minutes before the audio feed went out and they were not able to get it back. We stood and waited hoping that the feed would come back but it never did someone finally decided it maybe a good idea to just put regular music back on so we weren't waiting in silence. 

This was a HUGE  disappointment considering this is LAS VEGAS and everyone is paying top dollar to have a fun safe New Years.Went through a process of getting 3 bids for a move to Reno. Aaction Movers (aka United Van Lines) were the highest coming in $2900 more than the other two bids. We went with Atlas until they told us at the last minute that they had made a mistake and it would be an additional $1640 (ouch) so we went to the next low bid Allied.  Lo and behold at the final hour they found an error and also added $1437 (ouch again) We finally went back to United and said that if they could meet our time schedule we would go with them even though their price was still higher. Couldn't believe when I got a call from United saying they couldn't move us because they were not authorized to move within the state (only Las Vegas) Does any moving company know what they are doing??? Feel like I have been dealing with some very shady used car salesmen.Fees! Fees! Fees! Don't sign up for this card. They will charge you a fee for opening the card. They will charge you a fee for authorized user. They will charge you a fee for the "premium design" of the card itself. And, they will charge you a fee to pay the fees online! I would give them zero stars if I could!Upon arrival I was approached and put on a "waiting list". Looked at the phone I wanted for upgrade and took a seat. Then I was approached again and said thank you for your patience it will be thirty minutes. 1 and a half hours later we still sat on this orange bench with no back rest. They have two people working and they are both talking it up about some random crap.  How about you make a sell then move on instead of talking to some old mothers trying to get there phone numbers even though they provided them to you upon approach. Ok so now we attempt to leave the store cause I'm tired of a waiting for a phone and find this location decides to conduct illegal business practices and locks every single exit door making it impossible for us to leave on our own will. Once we pushed the door this Asian dude that works there stops talking to the moms and says O I can unlock it for you. Not a o I will be right with you or sorry for the wait but a I'll unlock the door for you. This place is negative stars. I will now cancel my phone and go to Verizon!Food was really greasy, and the carne asada was horrible, I don't recommend this place at all.PoS is by FAR my FAV sub place- BUT we went at 6:30pm & it looked closed (half the lights off, mats up, chairs upside own on the tables, and no employees inside) but the sign said they closed at 8! The door was open, the bell rang when we came in, still no one came out- waited another 30 seconds and said "hello! Anyone here are you open?" Girl comes outta the back to take our order, then a male employee comes out of the back and says , "hey baby, I'm gonna - blah blah blah" eeeeyeah more like Port of Sex! Gross! At least she wore gloves making my sandwich. Oy !I  been threading for several years. Just recently I decided to start going to this eyebrows r us because the one on flamingo and eastern was quite a drive. This is probably the the fourth time I use them. This is the last time. The woman that took care of me was extremly rough. It felt like she took sandpaper to my eyebrows by the time I got off the chair both of my eyelids were bleeding. This person was unprofessional and rude. I have never had that kind of experience at any threading place. Today my brow line is swollen and hurts to the touch. To make it worse when I spoke my mother about it she described the same treatment the last time she went as well. I will never go to this place again. To the woman that did my eyeborws: I hope that some kind of happiness seeps back into your miserable life. No one should live with that kind of anger.Worst great clips location I've ever been to! Don't even waste your time coming here. I made the mistake on coming here for convenience. I regret that decision and wish I drove a little farther to the flamingo location. I tipped the lady cause I felt bad for her, not for doing a good job. Never again will I return! The customer service sucks, they all have attitude which makes me question why they are working in this industry. And the lady that cut my hair did a horrible job.Disgusting!! Ordered a pizza from here for delivery and it had a hair!! Called and spoke to Daniel the manager he seemed like it didn't matter (apparently these people do not wear hair nets) and was only going to replace one of the pizzas we order. Then when asked to credit our account and forget the whole thing he CHARGED us again!! Horrible horrible horrible!! Never again!!So my mom recently moved from a rental into a home she bought. Her landlord got this company to handle everything and they have been a nightmare. It's apparently a family owned business, which should mean they should take things seriously but the way they have handled things so far tells me they don't.
First off they never return your calls. EVER. They scheduled a walk through date two weeks prior to the very date they wanted. A week later they called to tell us that the guy can't do that date because he's "going to be on vacation and won't be back until the first of the next month. And then he can do it after the first." So, no real date there.
Next they tell my mom she HAS to leave the lights in her name until the walk through is done, which they have no date for.
Finally I went by the old house and noticed, low and behold, the lights are on. The next day? Still on. They just left them on and never told my mom, who has been calling them for the past week with NO answer. Now her landlord is trying to get everything in his name, and apparently they aren't being much help to him either. 
These people really waste your time and never get back to you.Good selection of scrubs. With that being said- I was in a hurry on the way to work about a month ago- purchased a couple pairs of scrubs without trying them on.. I travel and finally got back into town. Came to exchange my size because XS was too small! They only do exchanges after 14 days?!? What kind of crap is that?? Not coming here again.Went to this store today to return a product that was past the 14 day return policy... I was on the 15th day. I had called and let them know that I was going to be a day late due to it being on Thanksgiving. They said it was fine and will help me out.  Got there and was past on to the Manger who's name is Anibal Culk,  he is the most unprofessional and unethical Manger I have ever dealt with, he is rude,  big headed and had the biggest power trip ever.  Told me to go sell my product On Craigslist and refused to give me the return after being told I could.  He then continue to make comments, so I went to call AT&T customer service and requested their service, they gladly went and accepted my return and will issue me a full refund. When he could have done it himself but refuse to service cause He had to be right and I was wrong. So who ever made this  a manager for this store needs to Re evaluate him and send him back to a customer service program where he needs to learn to listen to the customer and get off of his high horse. Management position.I only give this one star because they charge $25 for a haircut.  This is in Henderson. .not in Las Vegas and they are asking for $25 like they on the strip ...Heckkk no.Two words: Chile relleno. 

Three more words: With the seeds?! 

The order is small (which I don't mind) and so is the price... I figured that matched up and it was, overall, a tasty dish. But they don't clean the chiles? I have had this before when I noticed that, I figured it was an honest mistake. As I am only here about 4-6 times a year, I figured the last time had to be an anomaly. 

It has the potential to be a 3 or 4 star place for what they portray themselves to be: quick mexican food (as opposed to fast food a la Taco Bell or Del Taco), decent flavors, and good prices. I have always had efficient, friendly service and they've never balked at my customization requests.

However, when I can't enjoy but half of my chile relleno because it wasn't properly cleaned out? Not just a little bit near the top/end/etc... but half the chile had ribs and seeds. It made the dish bitter and inedible where it was present. 

Add to this that my friend's nachos were wet and missing the cheese (really?) and they forgot her side of beans.

History was already "meh," and now #lunchfail. Potential just doesn't cut it.Nail service Sucked! Came in 7/8/14 I have two weddings to attend to and I need something that will last long so specifically said I wanted color acrylic because it last longer and she puts plain acrylic with gel color over it and said this is what I asked for? Then I asked to go really thin and seem like she was getting upset because I kept saying how I wanted my nails? Then the health department came in and didn't even say excuse me I'll be back she just picked up and left. So I ask the guy there if someone else that can continue because I have to be at work and he pretended to get her. He had no client so he could have at least continue my nails. After 10min she came back didn't say sorry she jus continue in a rush! She did my nail so fast it looked like she rushed it everyone I showed my nails to said the same wasn't even even! Never again will I come to this
 place! Dazzling nothing!My husband and I have eaten here three times - the first is what brought us back and the food and service was great.  The second time we ate with another couple and we are all very patient customers until the service took forever and we noticed many of our items were not coming (we did all you can eat).  After you asked for something that hasn't come to the table be prepared for the servers to snob you the rest of the time you are there and pretty much throw the food on your table. We thought this was an isolated incident and maybe it was just a rough day for them - it was lunch time and kind of busy.  

It was our third and FINAL time eating here yesterday and what should have been no more than a 45 minute dinner turned into well over and hour and a half.  There were only 4 tables being served - one table of 6 adults.  Seemed like an average dinner time - so tell me why my husband had to get up to ask to be able to order more (all you can eat) and he had to stand up again to inquire about the orders that weren't coming.  After that -- HIS water was refilled and mine was left a third full, no smiles no words to ask how everything is going, no apologies for the HORRIBLE service, and again the food was just being dumped on our table.  

If you dine here just hope you're the only table and that they're in a much better mood than usual.Food was terrible my order was way wrong,  service was terrible & it took forever to get our food! Will not go back and do not recommendDecided to try this place after reading reviews. The service was horrible. Took forever to order food and they didn't even care to bring us utensils or plates. We ordered the crab cake sliders and the lobster rolls. The food wasn't good at all. The crab cake sliders tasted horrible and the lobster was too chewy. Avoid this place if you are looking for good food. The food is totally not worth the money.Slow!  and not worth the waitIf you love waiting this is the shuttle for you... Add another 40 minutes to your travels. This shuttle bus is ridiculous waiting and waiting is the game. Don't patronize this people - not a good start to your Vegas funI wish there was a way to give zero stars.  Went here with a group of friends and the staff refused to give us an additional chair despite the fact that there were several open chairs throughout the restaurant.  When I finally went to grab an open chair the host literally pulled the chair out from under me.  I have never been treated so bad in my life. 

Rude staff. Will never go here ever again.1/2 star. Max. I have been to different locations of this chain.  My friend, a University of Phoenix graduate, made reservations here for 12:30 Saturday 5/4 immediately following the ceremony.  A portion of our party arrived early and proceeded to order cocktails, a few apps, etc. Upon the rest of the party's arrival, the service remained decent. It wasn't until we were ready to order and notified the server as such...that our order was not taken for an additional 15-20 minutes.  She instead proceeded to other large party to take their order. Once we finally got our order in...we waited...and waited...and waited for nearly an hour (if not more by some of our party's calculations) for our food. My husband met us for lunch from the other side of town and needless to say...he had to take his food to-go in order to make it to work on time. They did comp his meal entirely as was expected at this point.  Darrell (the so called GM) apologized and made somewhat of an attempt to right the situation with free COLD appetizers prior to the meal arriving and at the end of it giant cotton candy served in large martini style glasses followed by a piss poor dessert of rock hard crumbly brownies. Sorry, that doesn't remedy the situation.

A portion of our meals were comped and rightfully so.  I can understand that they got slammed after graduation...but know your area...and know that there is a COLLEGE GRADUATION right next door to your restaurant!  Getting "slammed" is not the guests fault...it's YOUR fault for not staffing appropriately.  When I look around the restaurant and see your hostesses gabbing and standing around while our table fills up with empty and NON-REFILLED glasses and dirty appetizer plates, maybe they need to be trained to do a little bussing as well...i mean, you're ''slammed" right? All hands on deck?  I guess not.

I will never return to another Saddle Ranch... anywhere...ever. My guess is that many others will not either as this place will not remain open if this is how it's operated. Horrible.You would think that a Starbucks located in an airport would be more customer focused, extremely disappointed. Drink is terrible and this was after it was remade (which I had to pay for) and I had a rude barista.Ghetto white trashy bar. First time here and my car was broken into.Be aware! Never ever rent a car from this location!! their employees are thieves!!! I have never been so sure of myself that I accidentally left my shoes under the car seat, called their lost and found but said they were closed on weekends. So I called back on a monday but by that time they said they rented the vehicle to others already and no shoes were found. So either the employee that cleaned the car stole my shoes or they simply did not follow company procedure to fully inspect the vehicle before renting it back out again.  Terrible customer service and very bad management! They need to do a better background check on some of their employees. Something needs to be done about this.....zero stars if  I couldVery disappointed in this place.  Was told they had very good mexican food.  We ate here last week and have to say that we didnt like it at all.  The messed up the order a few times and then the food was not much better than taco bell.  Definitely not authentic food.  We will not be going backOne year ago, I would have rated the place a four out of five.  Since that time, the staff has gone straight to crap.  Front desk girls are typically either rude or indifferent and some of the trainers are jerks.  Also, as another individual mentioned, the towels they switched to are cheap and wouldn't dry off a 90 pound female.  The showers and men's locker room have always been relatively gross, so that hasn't gotten worse over the last 12 months, but it hasn't gotten better either.  

After they went to the 19.99/month plan (around the first of the year), they completely oversold their membership.  So, not only is it impossible to maneuver the locker room, it is also now impossible to manuever the weight room.  Not to mention, if you plan on incorporating bench work or squats into your workout, you can count on waiting for a bench or the SINGLE squat rack.

Lastly, the clientele of this gym is weak.  I've never seen so many fake hardos in my life.  Guys wearing sunglasses while they work out, etc., etc.

Anyway, the last straw was today when I had to wait for a locker to open up.  You must be kidding me, Gold's Gym.  Cancelled this afternoon and will be taking my money to Lifetime.I really really wanted to like this place. I moved downtown this past month, and this place seemed ideal for me. But the management of this place CLEARLY does not want my business. 

First time I went was last week. I wanted to activate my 7 day VIP pass. I didn't print out the receipt, but I had a copy on my iphone, so I thought it was OK. They made me wait 20 minutes at least to see the manager (fail #1). The guy (Ryan or Brian or whatever), gives me the tour, and brings me into his office, trying to sell me the plans. It all seems OK, and I am interested, but then I tell him I want to do the 7 day VIP pass first. He's like "You need to print it out". I'm thinking, c'mon, but I give him the benefit of the doubt--I figure there's a bar code or a confirmation number on the form, which explains why they need a printed copy. So I go home, print it out, and I realize THERE'S NOTHING ON THE PAPER -- no confirmation number, no bar code, not even my full name! WTF, why couldn't he just give me the 7 day pass when I was there in person? (Fail #2) 

Ok, I was pissed enough that I started looking hard at their competitors. They were all too far, or too expensive. So after letting a week go by, I'm figure I'm willing to give them a second chance. I figure the manager's probably a douche, but I can live with that. 

So, I go in today, ready to activate my 7 day pass (which I printed out). Again, they have me wait 20 minutes to see the manager, even though I had already filled out the registration form last time (they make me fill it out again) (fail #3). Finally, I see another saleslady (not the manager), and she seems nice. But gives me the same sales pitch (which I already had the first time) and--here's the killer--she asks me to pay for a 1-year membership BEFORE I get to activate the 7 day pass. 

Think about that for a second. I need to pay for a 1 year membership before I get to do my free 7 day trial! Holy fuck! (FAIL #4). Jesus Christ, these clowns REALLY don't want my business. And to top it off, the pass they give me isn't really a VIP pass, it's just a plastic card with a barcode, it doesn't include the parking validation, so when I go home, I get dinged $6 for parking (Fail #5). 

Seriously, dear Gold's Gym management: get your shit together! For the rest of you, I strongly recommend finding a gym that actually values your patronage. Gold's Gym ain't it.What a disgrace!

The worst service ever. The waiter was lame, rude and with an attitude. 

The food was pretty bad, overpriced (even for free would be too much for this horrible place). The decor is lame, the tables are smaller than a stool and so on.

They use plastic silverware and plates (which I guess is for safety purposes) but there are so many other plastic paper options than the ones they use.

I wrote in the bill a note about the lame service and the server instead of being apologetic or trying to understand what happened (he might be so dumb and arrogant not to know that he did everything wrong) he was all mockery and said "goodbye" with an sarcastic tone.

They are lucky to be at the airport, this s@#t hole wouldn't last a month in the real world.

Don even wast your time.Being in all elements of the industry for quite awhile it's been years since I've written a zero as a tip. I also concede being a bar owner myself I feel uncomfortable with writing a negative revue on yelp but....

I've been here about 4-5 times in the past year and I've always had amazing service sitting at the bar. As of tonight, 6-01-12, the service was absurdly bad. I don't blame the personality of the bartender, he seemed friendly enough, yet he was just not meant to be behind the bar. You can't take someone who just got their ABC bartending certificate and plop them behind the bar on a Friday night and expect good service. 

Hopefully they will get their shit together because the chef is pretty good and HRH is short on good, informal restaurants.All the other reviews for Moo seem positive so maybe we just caught them on a bad day, but safe to say we shall not be going back! We'd decided against Circle further down the street as all the condensation on the windows made it look a bit sweaty but with hindsight, condensation = lots of people = popular. Anyway, I digress. 

So we ended up in Moo which has slightly quirky decoration; the highlight (or should that be lowlight?) was a perspex box with a display made from children's farm animals ('Moo' - I get it!) which may have been hilariously ironic when placed there but over the years has become dusty and just a bit grubby. A couple of sad little cows have also bitten the dust so it's actually just a box with some jumbled toys in it.

Anyway, we only wanted drinks and I ordered hot chocolate. We'd been out for a walk and it was freezing so I was really looking forward to a steaming mug with, hopefully, some whipped cream and possibly even a marshmallow or three. I was gutted when not only did I not get any of these hot chocolate accessories but my 'hot' chocolate was more like 'luke warm at best' chocolate. My friend ordered milkshake and was excited by the fact that Moo proclaimed on the menu that it was made with Luca's ice cream. How could it fail?! By grinding ice cubes into it, not ice cream, that's how. Meanwhile, the boyfriend and friend No2 sat sipping tea and looking smug as we exclaimed with dismay over each fresh disappointment.Got the Groupon for my Mom. $90 for 5 windows on her old Range Rover. There are a total of 7 windows that need tint. Groupon listing states "Lifetime Warranty." She shows up on time for the appointment and has to wait for 20 mins. During the consult, the tech is busy answering the phones and talking to the people calling instead of taking care of the customers he has standing in front him. We knew about the extra windows and that there would be an additional charge for them. They wanted an additional $90 for 2 tiny vent windows and 2 windows in the back that were no bigger than than the door, side windows. 

After the upsell spiel, we were told that the Groupon tint only has a one year warranty and the tint probably won't last that long. 

DO NOT waste your time with these people. Horrible customer service and dishonest business practices.All I have to say is what you see on the menu is not what you're gonna get. and if you're ok with cockroaches on the walls and floors, the this is the place to eat.on strip prices, should have on strip service! easy enough right? I gave the one star, so I wont have to get into talking about how the service was. "Angela" the girl that helped me, was; sorry totally clueless, Learn how many ounces your burgers come in. its not so hard, ask your chef, or your manager, eye ball it im sure you serve it hella times in one day. Ok maybe im being unfair with the one star, but this is my yelp review. 

order:  wagyu burger with  swiss and maple wood beacon with the specification of "rare" please, and the black truffle oil french fries.  

25 minutes later my burger comes out looks delicious, The buns looked like they were glazed with love and passed though a line of inspectors for flaws, my cheese is yellow, I didnt know swiss came in cheddar! my burger pattie, very well done. 

I wait patiently for "Angela" and as she comes to my table with a distraught look on her face. I calmy explain that I ordered a "rare" burger, at this point she doesnt know how to respond to me. I explain myself very respectively, and so while I wait for the awkward silence, she says to me " well we can fire up another one, But we would have to charge you for it."  she saw my expression change even before she finished her last word. (awkward moment)  she grabs my plate and shows the gentleman who looks to be a manager, being kind and  understanding, he asked to have another burger re-fired , at this point, im knawing away at my truffle oil garlic french fries, and they are good, but first off, Ive never met anyone who thought truffle oil had any sort of aromatic value, and I understand this is a fusion restaurant, and Im assuming black truffle oil and wagyu gave them the $$. Well all in all my service was bleh, My burger, even after it was re-fired, bleh, and the $$, I couldve easily gone somewhere else and then go to another. Anyways the likely hood of me going back is slim, But everyone deserves a second chance.I do NOT recommend this moving company! I scheduled my move for a 5000 sq ft house and hired 3 trucks along with 6 men to start at 7 am sharp as it was a big job. I verified this information with the office twice during the week of our scheduled move. I was assure that they would be on time, I even explained to her that we lived out a bit so they would need to account for that to be there on time. At 7:15 no one had arrived or called, at 7:30 I called the office and got a voicemail (it was Sunday).  At 7:40 I got a call from the driver who said truck #3 alternator went out but that truck #1 and 2 were on their way and the 3rd would be there by the time they were ready to load it. They said they would be there in 30 minutes, 45 min later we get another call that truck #2 had a flat tire! At this point we have still not heard from office and tell driver that we need yo speak to manager/owner someone about this! Finally we get a call that they are renting uhaul trucks and will be there soon. One truck shows up with 4 men and they want contract signed that states hourly rate for 6 men and 3 trucks, mind you there is only 1 truck and 4 men. I say no and he says they can't start the job. This is now 9:30 am! We tell him we need to speak to Mohammed (owner) who is supposedly on his way to our house, he tells them to start the job without signature. 
Once he arrived he gave us 2 hours of work for free and the third truck finally showed up. I was thankful they had to rent 2 trucks because the first one that showed up had painted over graffiti on one side, it was so rundown I was afraid to transport my belongings in it not to mention how embarrassing it was to have that pull up in our neighborhood!  
The men's appearance was far from professional, I was hesitant to even let them stay.  They brought me 1 broken wardrobe boxes when I said I would need at least 4 and did not protect the floors very well where they were dollying items out, no regard was given to boxes marked as "fragile".
I returned to the old house that evening to find random things left behind, things that I told them were ours and needed to go. It took me two additional trips in my truck to get all the items!
Moving day is stressful enough for homeowners that's why we enlist the help of  moving companies, waiting for over two hours in the morning was completely unacceptable! Your trucks are your main piece of equipment how do you not keep them in good working order, you didn't know about the alternator?!  We were lied to continually about their excuses for not being there on time in the morning.  
By the end of the job they got sloppy leaving boxes they broke from rough handling in the middle of hallways and just unloading and shoving things in places. As I unpacked I found several broken items, they also broke several items in the unloading process.
This was by far the worst moving experience I have ever been through.All my friends and I travelled to Vegas for a bachelor party.  Ended up being a puke fest thank to STanK.  

After spending $160 each on our meals, we all took a limo to the nightclub.  Soon thereafter, I felt so sick that I asked one of the guys to get me an ambulance.  Long story short, I spent my whole night violently puking the nasty food.  The next day I called my friend to apologize for the abrubt departure and he told me how he and several other guys vomitted all night.  

Wasted vacation thanks to this dirty restaurant.  I appreciate YELP for having such a service so restaurants like this can get exposed.  

Take the $2,000 plus you made that night on cleaning up your act.  Disgraceful.This review has to do with just trying to give STK business.  I've being trying to reach them for 2 days to book a private room for 12 people.   When restaurants are hot and booked every night they think they are untouchable.  This attitude/arrogance is pathetic!  They will not always be on top and when their appeal declines people will remember how they were treated.  Good Luck STK!This rating is specifically for the planned course for our bachelorette party. 13 women, $2200, $170 per person. Many times people give bad reviews because a place is expensive. I didn't come to Vegas to save money, so that is not my gripe. The majority of us were doctors, lawyers, and those in the medical profession. We came here to throw down :) I am actually so surprised that the food was this bad. Just because our service came "family style" doesn't mean they should skimp on portions or quality (ask Robert Irvine on Dinner Impossible). This is what we all got for $2200, and I'm NOT kidding!: 

1. Bread (was the best thing I had here)
2. Soggy overdressed ceaser salad
3. ONE cocktail shrimp (ONE!!!! not a few, not several, but ONE!!!)
4. ONE lobster ravioli (ONE!!!, the size of a regular ravioli, 2 x 2). I didn't eat this one because I am allergic to lobster, so I gave mine to my friend. So she had TWO.
5. One small lump Mac and cheese (Not the good kind with the real cheese and baked crust on top, the kind you would get at a buffet)
6. One lump Creamed spinach. No real comments, it's creamed spinach.
7. Risotto swimming in what tasted like Campbells cream of chicken soup.
8. And the star of the night, the main course...dry skirt steak, not seasoned. Good thing the bride doesn't eat beef! (A lot got thrown away, no one wanted to eat much of it)
9. One glass of champagne

6 of us got an extra cocktail (well vodka and club soda for me, very small glass, not those large tumblers you get at the club). I felt like I crashed my grandfather's assisted living buffet dinner. This food was not only extremely expensive, but it would have been a rip off even if it was a cheap meal at any old restaurant. SHAME ON YOU STK! Giving us this horrible memory of our darling friend's celebration dinner. Of course she didn't complain, she is a beautiful person. 

We were all crammed in a table that wasn't meant to fit 13, we had reservations, but we were 30 minutes late because it takes a long time for 13 women to get out of the room (Know what I mean?), but geez, hold our table for pete's sake, and don't let us wait 1 hour to sit down. They ended up bringing this table from storage and making room in the bar area for us, one hour later when they could have done this from the get go when they saw their restaurant was full. There were no serving utensils with any of our platters, so we used our forks and spoons to dish. Not clean or convenient. We were all good friends, so this is the least of my gripes. 

Did we have fun? Yes, the music was all 80s, and catered to our 30 and up crowd. We thoroughly enjoyed watching the next table of 40 and overs doing the running man and cabbage patch to tunes from Tag Team and Grand Master Flash. That part was amazing. Kept my mind off being continuously tempted to speak to the manager about his horrible meal, and that was BEFORE the bill came. The service was great, but didn't make up for the horrible horrible horrible food to warrant even a second star. I had to throw that in one more time, as I get angrier the more I write.

Will I come here again, maybe. So I can understand why people gave it such good ratings, since they most likely did not order a planned course meal. For anyone thinking of having a planned meal here for large party, or possibly pre-wedding festivities, DON'T. Order a "normal" meal, like normal people do. That's what we should have done.I finally get to vent on how much of a massive shit hole this "festival" is. Worst pizza I ever had, which was comparable to bad microwavable pizza (this might be what they actually used). I also got the sausage in a dry old bun, what? no condiments?! No grilled onions or bell peppers?  Why did I pay $12 for that turd in a bun? At least the Italians serving the food were friendly... actually it was quite the opposite. Screw this place, I'm going to the Greek Food Festival.Between the bland chicken, horrible tasting condiments, and the FAKE machaca. This has been by far the WORST "Mexican" restaurant. I don't understand what triggered their mind to go into the restauranteur business!?! Machaca is supposed to be a dry beef with egg but this was oozing of water because it was broiled. Good thing I don't live around here, I had found this on Yelp from a Dr. visit.This started out as a 5 star review a few hours ago. Service was fantastic, sandwiches delicious. I got the buffalo chicken my husband the bac-hammon. Within 2 hours we are both sitting here very sick. Something was contaminated! The only two items that were the same on our sandwiches were mayo and provolone. So it was that or someone failed to wash their hands. Sorry, but after this incident i don't think we will be returning :(All i wanted was for my bangs to be trimmed not butchered!!! I will now have to wear my bangs pinned back everday till they grow back. Originally she said it would be $10 to trim my bangs....but when she saw how unhappy i was she lowered it to $5!! She should have paid me since now i have to go buy headbands!!!!the place smell so bad with smokers,we have to leave right away.I started off here early int the night to originally meet up with a fairly large group of people for the UFC night. We got there early to ensure a table for the over 10 people group I was with. At first it started off alright. I'd have to wait 10 minutes after my beer was gone to see the waitress who eventually forgot my beer, then came back with it another 20 minutes after she realized she forgot it. I was trying to be understanding since our group was so large and everyone was ordering drinks and appetizers.
Then, the crowd got large. I was annoyed to not see our waitress for over 30 minutes and so I went to the bar. There were 50 guys at the bar and they all were served before me. It was more than frustrating because I was there waiting before most of them.
Later in the night, I managed to run into an old coworker and hung out with him and a group of whom I'd call fairly attractive young guys.... they got service every 10 minutes or less. It was insane! My former coworker was ordering cheap beer and no food and managed to get better service than the group of people I was with ordering premium drinks and appetizers! Apparently it takes having a penis to get service around there!! WTF?!
The only reason why I'd CONSIDER coming back to this place is because I found out (2 hours after being here because the waitress never told us specials) Coors Lights were $2.... Guys obviously love going there because the waitresses are fairly attractive, but the bar was a sausage fest, for sure, which normally would be a good thing for a single girl, but good luck getting any form of service!This place I terrible. Terrible customer service, terrible drinks, terrible food. The best thing I ordered was a beer and that probably because they can't mess it up.Grossly over priced! Extremely slow and incompetent. I ordered a tea and my gf a coffee. Simple right. Was out of coffee and who I think was the manager said let me pour you this remaining half a cup to sip while I get you a fresh cup. Then she forgot all about getting a cup of coffee, walked by us several times at the end of the counter before we finally had to stop her and ask about the coffee. She looked at us as if we were crazy so, we had to remind her it was her request we wait until a fresh pot was ready and she would get us a cup. No apology no anything walked away got a cup of coffee and walked backed handed to my gf and without a word walked away. 

If remembering to serving a cup of coffee is that difficult (i watched them make 6 specialty coffee's while we waited for a simple cup of coffee) for the manager to remember she might want to consider a new line of work. 

They don't have to worry about me returning to over burden them this was my 1st and last experience at Sambalatte I will stick with Starbucks or Panera.Ick and Boo!  My two thoughts after bite one of my take-out dinner.  After eating a lot of average Chinese food in Scottsdale, we were excited to try this new place.  When I called to place my order, I was a little shocked to find out that all but one of the entrees listed in the "Vegetable" dinner section contained some kind of meat or fish product.   So I ordered the only option I had tofu and mixed vegetables in a brown soy sauce, and requested they add cashew nuts.  He informed me that it would be $2, and I said that was fine.  When our food arrived, my dish had no cashew nuts... "Boo", it also had no flavor whatsoever "Ick".  In fact, after taking a few bites, I began to be concerned about the quality of the food, as it was loaded with veggies and sauce, and really had no flavor at all...something was wrong here.   I ate about 5 bites total and threw it away, I didn't want to risk getting sick over it. Hottie did the same and we ate a few pieces of cheese for dinner instead.  Needless to say we won't be back.Let me say first that I love Chinese food and its hard to not impress me. With that said, this place was gross.

I came in at lunch around 11:00am and was the only person in there. Their lunch menu has a lot but its strange: you get the main food, then you have to choose between a drink OR an egg roll OR a soup. Other places its usually all three for the lunch menu. 

I ordered shrimp with garlic sauce and a large hot and sour soup because that's what I really came for and I can seriously put away Chinese food. It took what seemed like at least 10 minutes so I'm starting to think that it will come out fresh and incredible. You can see where they're cooking...looks like they're hard at work back there.

The person who took my order at the register brings the soup first then the plate of food. I hadn't noticed until I got the food but they have buckets of silverware on the table. I wasn't sure if they were used or not, but they looked used. However there were so many on each table that certainly they all couldn't have been used. I was also kind of taken aback that they serve on styrofoam plates. No big deal just that I hadn't seen that in a long time.

I start eating the shrimp with garlic sauce. I quickly find that I don't detect any garcle whatsoever. Maybe because I love garlic and they only put enough in for a normal person. I don't know. I also soon find that it tastes like one of those microwaveable Chinese meals I could have gotten at the store a couple hundred feet away from their frozen section. Ah well, I eat it all anyway.

I get to the hot and sour soup: again, what I had really come for because I had been craving it for some time and has become my measuring stick for Chinese places. First slurp: no flavor. Nothing. Ok? I put some soy sauce. Kind of better. So I'm eating it, watching a little of their TV as I go when I noticed something strange. I don't know if it was uncooked egg or some sort of gellatanous goup but there was some clear junk in the soup. I already paid for it and I got the impression they wouldn't care if I told them, so I scoup it out and put on my plate. I continue eating the soup and find more and more. And what I think was chicken in there starts to resemble children's fingers that may have slipped in. This is no bueno!

Another thing. Their drinks. They give you a styrofoam cup to fill yourself which is cool, but they don't have a lid for that size. Makes me think they purposefully did this so you wouldn't take any drink with you.

I work around here and this could have been my go to place but I won't ever be coming back. It makes my stomach feel weird just thinking about what I ate. I hope I don't get sick later on.

Yes, it could have been a bad day for them. It was Friday maybe they were all excited, I don't know. But I'm not going to chance it.Ordered my magazine through them the first time and I got my proof fast.  The images looked a bit cyan and dark so I asked for them to be lightened and for cyan to be taken out.  Got a bit of flack for asking for this but they eventually reluctantly agreed.  Got the magazines and they looked decent but the price is so low because they print on Xerox machines.. Meaning your magazine will look raised like the ink is sitting on top of the page and gloss compared to the paper.  (Also the mag had some streaking in areas)  I went to place my 2nd magazine order and changed my address on file and attached my file to the order and sent it through.  I wait almost a week for a proof and call because i haven't yet recieved it.  The gentleman tells me that they got no file and were waiting on me to send it.  A simple courtesy call could have rectified the situation and saved me a week.  "Hello sir just wondering when we can expect your file?"  So apparently the file I attached didn't attach.  I send the file through a 2nd time on a monday.. wait until thursday and nothing so I call again and they say they are printing it and shipping it AFTER 2 orders that are in front of me (we are talking about a proof not a huge order here) So I'm thinking they forgot about my order and me calling reminded them.  I get a confirmation my proof shipped and it shows my OLD address..  I call and leave a msg (sent an email right after I sent the file through and didn't get a response which is the 4th email since i've been dealing with them that they never responded to) Call again today to see where the proof shipped to and it's my old address.. I ask him if he could send a new proof to my new address and I get his reason why I MESSED UP and ticked the wrong box here or there (When I originally sent the order through I put in all new addresses for shipping and billing so why those didn't take presidence I don't know.. I unfortunately didn't check the confirmation (because I double checked the order before I sent it through and the new address was listed) which is my fault because it listed my old address.  I was interrupted while I told him I just need the proof to the right address by him continuing to tell me what I did wrong.  I said it's not a problem right now lets just work it out and get the ball rolling.  He asked if I wanted a refund.. We are 14 days into the order and I have deadlines and customers who prepayed for their mags so I can't drop this order and find a new printer and set myself back that much time I say just send the proof we'll be all good.  At sometime in this conversation he began to swear because I cut him off in the middle of placing the blame on me for another problem with the order to which I said "if I did something wrong I'm sorry lets just move forward" I get off the phone with the promise of my proof being sent out today. 20 minutes pass and I get an email from another employee with short run and they told me that they don't allow their employees to be verbally assaulted and treated as I treated him.  If anything he cussed at me. I was a bit livid but never made any remarks towards him. I did say I wasn't happy with not having a priority because of the amount of time the order has been pending.  i also cut off his long winded explanation ONCE because I had already heard it before I just wanted to move forward. My order was now cancelled and so was my account.. Wasted my time and they cost me money because my prices were based on their cost of printing.  It really feels like they let some stuff slip through the cracks and they aren't too proactive or customer friendly.  Oh and the first mag was also behind schedule because their "machine broke down" it happens so I didn't care I was nice and accepted the delay.So 1 star..... "Why Sean?, enlighten us" 

Ok, I will. The place is cute, cool 80's theme going on, nostalgia all over. However the "yogurt" isn't yogurt at all, its frozen flavored water stuff, not creamy, not the right consistency or viscosity (been waiting years to use that word). I challenge you to allow a portion of your selection to melt and witness the non yogurt substance at the bottom on your cup. 

"But Sean, did it taste good at least?" ........No. 

I was puzzled when eating it and am puzzled to see reviews praising the quality of the product. But look for yourself (at other reviews) and you'll see I'm not alone in my assessment. 

I love yogurt too, so I'll go elsewhere to get some since this place doesn't carry any. 

***Change the name of the place to "I love flavored slush muck" or just sell hot dogs. Call it "I love yogurt" still but sell hot dogs instead, that way you'll be selling something not indicated by the name sarcastically and not because you're cheapos

Ownership feel free to contact me for further suggestions, I have this notepad I've been writing stuff in since 02.Bad pizza, worst service of any restaurant I have ever been in. If you want to watch the employees watching football this is the place to goIn writing this review as I'm waiting for my food. We've been waiting foreverrr wtfff. We ordered our food 50min ago and only 1 out of 4 people have gotten their food. When I eat Vietnamese food, I don't wait any longer than 10min for my food to come out. Maybe the heat is getting to everybody here...Do not recommend.  Got a hamburger and a pulled pork sandwich. Pork was cut chunks with BBQ sauce dumped on top. Bun fell apart when trying to pick it up.  Hamburger tastes like a frozen meat bi-product with no frills.   Menu was not BBQ type foods and nothing really seemed edible.   Halfway through our food my son found hair in his fries and under his burger.   Not impressed and didn't even want to give it a star... Star basically is because they are cheap but its definitely you get what you pay for. Cheap, tasteless, and unimpressive.Oh boy was this place awful! Went with my mother for lunch, we were both disappointed and hungry when we left.  It took 45 minutes to get soup and sandwiches, the waiter never once checked with us, we never got drink refills, we had to get up and find the hostess to pay the bill.  My mom's grilled cheese was so hard (presumable from sitting under the warmer lights) that it was inedible. The waiter also never brought us silverware!  Again, I had to walk up to the hostess to get some silverware. It was in no way busy so I just don't get it. I had high hopes and the menu "sounded" good but blech.  We never got the chance to even complain since we never saw our waiter again and there was no  management to be seen.  Avoid!!I heard this place had great food and also had food ok for HCG diet. I'm on the diet and my friend isn't so I thought perfect. I try to take my out of town guests to non chain places. We walked in and not another person in the place. the waiter came right over and was very nice. He made recommendations and was very helpful. There is no hcg food and I even called ahead and was told there was. My friend ordered balsamic chicken and didn't like it at all. I ordered berry salad with shrimp. The greens were bitter and limp, the shrimp was so so. I asked to leave the goat cheese off as I hate it. They forgot and put it on and then picked it back off. The whole thing tasted like goat cheese. The waiter asked if I was allergic to it. I should have said yes. I ate the berries and 5 shrimp. It was $16.99 which I think is pricy for lunch. I wouldn't have minded if delicious. I was extremely disappointed. The only positive thing was good service.I had diarrhea for six hours.  Ruined my Friday night in Vegas.This has to be the worst place I've called for delivery. I just called and all I said was, "Do you all deliver to my area?" In a thick accent but also a hint of disconnect in this woman's voice, she says slowly, "where do you live again?." I start Sa.....I'm interrupted with, "Oh sorry we don't deliver there". Really????WOW! Is all I have to say. I have not even got onto my flight yet and I am extremely angry as I write this. 

I booked a flight from LAS VEGAS to LA to visit my girlfriend. The flight was only $100 round trip. 

I went on-line to confirm my flight and check in... I had to pay $10 dollars for a seat both ways- so an additional $20 then to even check my bag as a CARRY ON I had to pay $33 each way so an additional $66 

My $100 flight turned into almost a $200 flight. It would be nice if companies such as CHEAPOAIR or PRICELINE would advise you that when you book with this company that there will be extra fees. 

Also my bags were supposed to be $28 a bag but the on-line system charged me $33. I called SPIRIT (which had the most difficult time finding a customer service phone number) to ask them why I am paying more money than what is stated. The lady advised me that if I confirmed my flight 24 hours or less prior to my flight starting, that I had to pay an additional fee for my bag. 

HOW IS THIS COMPANY STILL IN BUSINESS....? 

I should have paid $150 with SOUTHWEST who I know I can trust. I have been reading all these reviews - and I am so scared to even get onto my flight..... I am not good with rude customer service.. especially when I am already very upset. 

Luckily it is only a 1 hour flight- so I should be okay..... 

If only I would of yelped them prior to booking.... all I saw was CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP rates flashing across the screen... and overlooked and didn't use my YELP. YELP will never fail you, because there are real people with real reviews that you can trust. Next time I will never book anything without reading about it first :(Horrible Luggage Fees. The only free luggage is one small personal item. They charge a minimum of $35 for a tiny carry-on. And it gets even more expensive after that. So if your excited about their cheap flights, unless you plan on flying with only a purse, un-excite yourself. Your flight will cost more if you plan on bringing luggage.

No complimentary drinks.
No complimentary anything.

Uncomfortable seats. 

Customer Service is lacking. 

Status of the flight said "on-time" but it wasn't. 
I understand that every airline has delayed flights, but they could have at least said the flight was delayed.

YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR.Spirit is the worse airline you can go threw to fly anywhere. Going back and forth to Vegas often which is only a hour flight and they can never be on time. Constant delays for numerous hours its ridiculous! They charge a arm and a leg for everything. You have to pay for a seat on top of your ticket plus 45 to check in a bag and its usually 25.. And that's not including they try to charge you to bring a
Carry on bag. Don't give you anything to drink and you have no leg room what so ever. The most low budge airline you can go with. Even if the prices are low it's not worth it book ahead of time with a better airline. I will never again even if the flights are 5.00!!! There HORRIBLE they should be put out of businessIf I can give no stars for this airline company I would. My mother tried to reschedule a flight for her and my father to return to Los Angeles on a red eye. The reason for the rescheduling was due to doctors orders for my fathers discharge extension from ICU at spring valley hospital. After explaining the situation and even attempting to give them a written statement from the doctor this airline company refused to reschedule flight date and give a refund. I hope this company shuts down. Bad pr, bad service, bad policy. Better of flying jet blue or any other airlines if you ask me. In saying that spirit airlines will probably be the most inexpensive, but you get what you pay for.Apparently they don't have room for new customers, but they do have a list of competitors you can have but they don't know how well these guys work so that's really of no use. Sorry you're too busy! I'll find my own company.This was the second time eating at this location and it was absolutely awful. The first time we ordered a deep dish pizza and the stupid delivery boy must have set it funny in his car because all of the cheese and sauce were crammed to one side of the box and there wasn't a scrap left on the actual pizza...gross.  My office used to order from the one on Power for lunch at least once a month and they had the BEST chicken parm I have ever had! This location however, it was not even edible. Instead of an actual chicken breast it was about 5-6 slices of chicken about the size of my finger that were all dried out and mostly burned, also the spaghetti that was in some nasty, watery, marinara soup was burned on the top. How is it possible to burn spaghetti?! Went right I the trash.Very dissatisfied......althought I am a single and its not hard to get a seat in the bar....I came in sat down and a nice waiter did ask me what I wanted to drink....served ne my first beer without asking if I acted to taste test it first....another weird thing about this guy is he smiled a lot...maybe too much and failed to ask me if I was eating. I flagged a waitress down about 15-20 minutes later and ordered a burger well done....when it came it was medium rare....the mash potatoes are supposed to taste like garlic....they didn't.....atmosphere is typically bar....I do not think I will return.This is the first place I ever walked out on... My girlfriend and I ordered a few things and noticed little fruit flies flying around... I lost my appetite as soon as a couple landed on my food.. I showed our waiter (young gentlemen) the issue, and he knew exactly what was going on so he notified a manager.. The manager comes we show her the little fruit fly and tells my girlfriend "oh that's just garlic honey" are you kidding me?? When does garlic move?? Anyways this place is ridiculous I also ordered a boba drink and the boba was rock hard. Also I feel bad for the young waiter who had to act like nothing was wrong because in sure the manager told him to act like itDon't bother going here to watch the Soccer game the whole bar has already been reserved we all left...very disappointed...This place wasn't very good with the old owners and the new owners haven't done any better.  It's a bad location so has to survive off a very small breakfast and lunch crowd which in turn means they have to cut corners.

I think they need to ditch the Zeez's grill and start a bad-a$$ hole in the wall taco/burrito shop which is desperately missing from downtown Phoenix.  Chipotle ain't cutting it.i've been going to canteen for 3 years now. recently they introduced the 10$ minimum on credit/debit cards. however, i honestly forgot my card at canteen yesterday  while bar hopping on mill and when i went back to get my card, i saw a $6.00 charge. when i questioned the charge, both the bartenders at the back bar and the manager say " im sorry but thats a credit card charge because its a $10 minimum we cant do anything about that sorry". i tried to reason with them saying "im sorry i did not know, but ive been coming here for 3 years now", however, both the bartenders respond "im sorry honey, but the $10 minimum has been going on since we opened". i tip very well when i am at canteen at over %25, but i guess non of them care. the manager just stood next to me  without saying a word just looking at me. he goes "sorry, this is how it is". my advice is go to canteen to have a good time, but please please please do not buy a drink at all. they will rip you off, go to cue club across the street to buy a drink (5$ long islands). canteen is trying to take advantage of robbie's not getting any business.No complaints about the ice cream at this location. The staff is nice and friendly. The problem starts when one tries to get a refund for a canceled cake order paid by credit card. One is told that the staff does not have a code to process the refund. The manager has to contact another institution to process the order and so on and so forth. I had to dispute the charge with my credit card company. I have never had this problem before. So save yourself a meltdown and use cash :)My daughter went for her first time last night to Diva after purchasing through Groupon.  She was told she had to wait until for the previous client to finish. When that client came out she reported the machine was not working properly. My daughter was told she would have to come back the following day, which she did in the afternoon. She got there and was told the computers were not working so had to go to a different location down the street. Upon finishing her tan she came out totally blotchy and speckled. The attendant claimed to have never seen that happen and contacted her manager. My daughter was told to go home and shower to try and wash it off. Sounds to me after reading the previous reviews this is not an isolated incident.  Hoping they can make it right on some level. :(This place stinks.  My friend had her daughter's birthday party here.  It sucks when you pay by the hour and 45 minutes of it is the staff trying to fix the bowling machines.  Not cool.  Plus the lady that runs the bowling center is a huge jerk.  Shouldn't treat people like crap when they are giving you money.  They could have totally picked a different location.  Instead they opted for this place cause it was close to home.  Bad choice. Never again.Went to new Amore Sports Grill with my wife and 3 kids.  My son loves the Amore Pizza in McDowell Mtn Ranch, and thought that this would give us a place for the kids, and mom and dad to have a beer as well.  Packed my pocket with quarters as the kids love video games etc.  On a Friday night there were about 20 ppl. In the bar and a few families in the restaurant.  We sat down ordered a burger, couple pizzas and wings.  Went over to get the kids setup on the video bowling game.  Sat down to drink my beer, when the owner walked over with the kids and said the games are really for adults, that they could finish the game as long as I stayed with them, (video games are adjacent to but not in the bar).  From what I heard they owner(s) were involved with Temple Bar in McDowell Mtn Ranch and did not like the families that came in with kids.  Not sure he/they understand the demographics of the area, pretty easy to understand with the Internet.  

Now obviously this is the opinion of a parent, so let's talk about the food.  The burger was ordered medium temp. came out "dead" done, my wife and I intended to split it, neither us finished our half.  The wings were huge, (bigger than normal) but were really tough and under cooked.  The pizza was mediocre at best 12" is smallest and was basically flavorless and had a huge crust.  

Bottomline if you want a beer and have the time to drive past, Zipps, Temple or Lazy Lizard try this place.  If this were the closest place to eat, get some gas and keep driving, it will likely be better.This is my first Yelp review. As is normally the case with first reviews, the customer is either overjoyed or bummed out. This is of the "bummed out"variety.  I tried A. Sakura tonight for the first time as the location was good and the prices seemed ok, but not THAT much cheaper than their competitors. If they were THAT much cheaper then I would be a LITTLE more okay with the quality. Fact is, for the same money, one could do much much better in Madison. 

The sushi is what I tried and rice is the main problem--FLAVORLESS!  Bland!!  Lacking enough sugars and vinegar to make it even close to what sushi rise should be (I make my own at home btw). And, what flavor there MIGHT have been in my rainbow roll was masked by too much mayonnaise type sauce and eel sauce (which normally isn't even found on a rainbow roll)!  Typical fare, such as tuna rolls and California rolls were also bland, on par with super market sushi. Honestly, if I wanted this quality I should've went to a Target.  Blah!

Look, this is Madison, folks. Muramoto, Takara, etc, all have this place beat by a large margin at similar prices. Step it up A Sakura, or get outta town.  This seems to be a place that I'd find in a small town in rural America, not Madison!Never mind trying this place. I ordered 3 pizzas to go for a poker party at our house in Southern Highlands. At the end of the party we had 2 and half left. We ordered from pizza hut. The crust was stiff and just tasted flat. We had pepperoni at ir appears thay are using inferior products. We need a great pizza place in SH and this place is not it.I learned to love Indian when I loved in London for 10 years.  This place is a train wreck.  It is ABV:   Appallingly Bad Value.  Over 
priced ( they even charge for papadoms!), horriible service and decidedly marginal food.  

We were a party of three.  Only two other tables were occupied when we arrived, although it was almost full when we left.  45 minutes after we ordered the waitress brought our rice.  5 minutes  later, the first entree arrived; ten minutes later, the second arrived: 5 minutes later, the third!  

I ordered lamb vindaloo.  Now vindaloo, by definition, when authentic, is so hot it will take off the top of your head.  But I get it; this is Arizona, were veal is exotic, and so I was not surprised to be asked how spicy I wanted it, on a 1 to 10 scale.  I asked for 8.  The dish I got was a "1" at best.  No spice at all!  the rest of the food was mediocre as well.  and this place is expensive.  Caveat emptor.Nice sales guy, terrible overall experience.   Don't shop here unless you have unlimited patience for delivery.

When checking on delivery time for prepaid order, bed and bedroom furniture, I had to call three times over 5 hours (speaking with them each time) just to get a call back with an estimated delivery day!

Then, when the day came, all furniture cleared from room in preparation for delivery, I call to check on actual delivery time on a Tues. to which they tell me .. it will NOT be delivered this week.

Now I have to move bedroom furniture BACK INTO THE ROOM so the young lad can sleep somewhere tonight and until Mega Furniture can figure out their delivery....  AND they pre-charged me $100 for delivery.

Chris, sorry, you're a very nice sales guy but unless the back office can figure out delivery services, your job will be difficult.I tried. Twice. I just can't do it again.

A large group of us went for Cinco de Drink... err, Cinco de Mayo. Partly because it's Mexican food, partly because of location, and partly (probably the biggest part) because of the specials and opening deals they offered.

The nacho specials weren't bad, but they were short lived. They are not still on the menu. While they were generally tasty, they didn't offer enough of the key ingredients (i.e. meat choices, etc.) and we were digging through the chips to find what we had ordered.

The service was bad. There's no other word for it. It was slow, even with multiple servers watching over our group and others. I had to go to the bar to order drinks more than once.

I spoke with the manager, Amy, about it. She was great helping me set up our large group and after when I talked to her about our experience. She explained the situation (staffing issues, temporary fill-ins). While I found that understandable but not excusable, we discussed the possibility of another try.

That said, a month or so later I went back for a quick dinner in the hope that, outside of the "holiday" crowds, that it would be different.

I was, again, disappointed. I opted for the custom nachos and my guest had the enchiladas. The nachos were small and expensive (I didn't even add meat), the chips seemed stale, and the sauces and salsas seemed as if they'd been left out for a day. Her enchiladas were so spicy as to be almost inedible.

The waitstaff was slow and inattentive, and we had to flag down the waitress more than once. 

We had to bring to the staff's attention that the restrooms hadn't been looked after in some time.

I will not be going back.Yes. I will give you a call after this weekend. I can assure you that was the only food we has in common in a while. We were 5 in the table. Only me and her had the same food. The rest thanksfully didnt get sickMy wife and I went there on Friday afternoon for a late lunch. We were looking forward to trying a restaurant that was new to our neighborhood, with outdoor seating. When we sat down, there were only 4 tables being used. We thought this would mean we wouldn't have to wait long for lunch. We were WRONG! We waited for 15 minutes to get service. It took 25 minutes for them to deliever  2 hamburgers that we paid 12.00 a piece for. The hamburgers were good. They add an additonal 3.00 for a side that, we thought was part of the meal. They didn't tell us there was an extra charge for the side.The menu has a limited selection for entrees. The service was terrrible. It was our first and last experienceI've asked myself each time I've gone here, why did we come here?  The service has always been terrible each time.  It probably is the worst service I have ever experienced  The food is ok, not the best, but tonight it was really greasy.  we had to ask for napkins 3 times and never got any.  There are so many servers but none of them will bother looking in your direction.
I really don't think we will go back again, and I mean it this time.I agree with with Elizabeth E.'s review.  This show does have "cheesy magic/arobatics.. definitely (little kid) orientated." I got the tickets on sale for $10 (@ travelzoo.com.)  Retail is $60 something, i believe. Definitely not worth the full price. The show evolved around 2 Japanese girls that tries to fight an evil character. Throughout the show, there will be magic/arobatics (i.e. escaping from tiny sword stabbed boxes, flying above gravity, and etc..) It doesn't come close to any Cirque de Soleui production!

I would only recommended the show if you have a coupon for $10, and need it as a time filler during your stay in Las Vegas. The show is every night @ 4pm-515ish at the Planet Hollywood. Other than that, I wouldn't suggest you booking it...I had never eaten at Nathan's before and I was really in the mood for a hot dog. Plus, like everyone else says there's not much of a choice when you've reached this stage in the race to your gate. My husband, son, and myself all ordered chili dogs, fries, and a drink. That tallied out to about $26 dollars give or take which is outrageous but not totally unexpected for airport food. After I got the bill and my stroke we sat down and tried to eat this swill. Which is exactly what it is! The cheese for the hot dogs is nacho cheese, is that normal? Is that something that's done in life? Anyway, and the crinkle fries were greasy and totally tasteless. There was nothing at all redeeming about this place. I always try to avoid eating at the airport but if'n I have to it will never be at Nathans Famous Hotdogs. One last thing, who in the heck serves chili dogs but doesn't offer a place to sit?Went there for lunch today. Wasn't that busy. It took forever to order out food, and it took even longer to get it. The service was so bad. Waitress forgot to bring some items and we had to keep reminding here and have us a crappy apology. Good was okay but very expensive. Overall i would not recommend this restaurant to anybody. The service was that bad!!For starters, I love sushi. It's amazing. So when there's a new sushi place that opens up near by I like to give it a go; and seeing as how it was valentines weekend I decided I would take my wife out to dinner for some sushi. We live near by, so I figured we would go to Otaku and see what the fuss was all about. After all, they have pretty decent reviews so far and it looked pretty promising. 

I had the foresight to call ahead because apparently the restaurant was full. I got a reservation for 7:45, showed up ten minutes early and we were seated promptly. The place was packed, the hostess wasn't kidding, they sure were full. It wasn't surprising that it was hard to get a table, because for a decent size restaurant, they have hardly any tables. Probably 70% of the seating is at two giant bars, one is more of a sports type bar with a bartender, and the other is a sushi bar where you can watch the chefs attempt to make sushi (more on that later). The atmosphere of the bar is very nice if a tad to loud. It seems like it can't decide if it wants to be a high end sushi joint, or a sports bar. And the problem is that the restaurant isn't big enough to effectively be both. So you get the dinner seating right next to the sports bar with loud music playing. There is high quality workmanship and very contemporary/modern design elements all around. I shudder to think about how much it cost them to build it, it's beautiful inside. It almost seems like they're trying too hard to be modern however, as they even use IPads for their POS system. Which sounds like a cool idea, but after observing the waitress try to use it for a while I noticed they don't have a cash drawer attached to them, which means they have to ring up the checks, print out a receipt, then walk to wherever the cash drawer is hidden and get the change. They also didn't seem to work with credit cards too well because they were manually typing in a lot of numbers when the cards wouldn't swipe properly.

All of this would be OK if I didn't run into a headache in every other aspect of our first and last visit to Otaku. Our server was Yuko and she did a very poor job. She took our order, brought us some water and ran away. She only returned once to give us refills. She returned really quickly with our tempura appetizer... too quickly in fact, as we learned that she actually stole another tables app... oops. The tempura was pretty good, although it was quite oily. Once we were done with it, we began the wait for our food... and we waited... and we waited... and eventually Yuko came by to tell us that the kitchen is running a bit slow tonight (no shit). That's fine I thought, it happens. Then we saw her socializing with a table full of drunks and wondered if it was actually the kitchen or her that we should worry about. We decided it was her, when we noticed that a table that was seated after us, and ordered after us, got their sushi ten minutes before we did! All this time Yuko was nowhere to be found. In the long run we ended up waiting 30 minutes after we finished our appetizer to get our sushi.  We only ordered two rolls: a California and a Vegas roll. The final nail in the coffin is that the Vegas roll was cold when we got it! It had clearly been sitting out for a good 10-15 minutes before it got to our table as it was room temperature and chewy. Beyond the texture, there was absolutely nothing special about it, certainly nothing to justify it's 9 dollar price. The California roll was just as generic as well. I've had better sushi at Teharu in Tempe, and it's a freaking serve yourself conveyor belt. 

By this point my wife and I were pissed off, so we told Yuko that we were in a hurry and we needed the check. She then gave us the check and never returned. In the ten minutes between getting the check and us walking out cursing the name Otaku, I saw her busy counting her tips and socializing with her table full of drunk customers, who I'm sure she realized were the only people that would be stupid enough to actually tip her that evening.  This place clearly has a lot of kinks to work out, and the lack of stars in this review is all due to Yuko. I don't know if it would be any better with a different waitress, but I don't think i"m going to worry about finding out. There are a ton of choices for mediocre sushi in the valley and I'm past the point of giving places multiple chances to win me over. I'm guessing all the other five star reviews for this restaurant were from people to drunk to notice how bad it actually is.Food was cold, shrimp not properly cooked through, workers seemed to be uninterested in service, I suppose you get what you pay for though!Bad. Bad. Bad. Worst buffet I have ever had. Overpriced and not on par with the rest of our stay at the cosmo. The presentation was great but they should invest more in flavor of food. Not one of the 3 of us enjoyed it. Rather than telling each other to try items on the buffet was good we were all sharing things to say how terrible they were. Don't recommend at all.  The dessert selection looks impressive but there really isn't a lot to offer there. Never againLet me Start,
This was now myfavorite Buffet Since they opened & we are locals. We ate here 20 Times &brought guest from everywhere to eat here. 

Here is my issue

The quality is getting worse from visit to visit. 
Price Increased of course. :-(

Came here for Brunch. Line was 2 min.  Hosts are very nice & attentive. Our waitress was nice too. She dissapeared a few Times but yes Thats Not a Problem. 

But the Food. Almost everything was cold. I Never fill up plates & Walk Around i usually go straight back but evrything was cold. 
Mussels cold, chicken cold, potatoes cold, ...

The choices are very Limited. They dont really fill up. 

Only the Desserts are Good ( choc Lava cake, gelato) evry other cake was too Sweet ( Carrot cake, cheescake) the sweelpotatoe flan was just Bad. 

We ordered OJ & Tea
The Tea used to be Great quality they now suck at Tea. Its coffee flavored tea. Not Even Tea bags. They bring it in the Cup already prepared. 

I will Not go back. Sorry but it Sucks now. :-(Unfortunately the food did not meet expectations. I was excited about the individual dishes but the quality was poor overall. Dishes were not seasoned well and tasteless. The bone marrow bones were dried out. The breakfast buffet was odd. Got there at 8:30am and there were more dinner items then actual breakfast items. Could not help but wonder if it was simply leftovers from the night before. I love a good buffet but this was not.Let Down. 

The concept is basically glorifying street food from China and Mexico, and by glorifying I mean marking the price up 200% and decreasing the size portions to basically nibbles.  The funny thing is, the whole concept behind street food is that it is really good and really cheap and you don't have to pay $4 for a taco the size of your pinky for it to be delicious. This place turns that truth on its head by doing exactly the opposite -- charging you a ton of money for mediocre "tastes" of food. I couldn't help but feel like the owners of this place are bleeding the patrons white, that is the bottom line people.  

For the price of food and all the press I was expecting this place to be upscale.  It's not that either. Avoid at all costs.  

**This review is based upon trying the following:
--pomegranate margarita (didn't like at all, too tart)
--When Pigs Fly
--Dan dan noodles
--Lengua tacos
--Pork belly tacos with pineapple
--Carnitas

Can you believe all of this was $100+? Avoid. 

**Disclosure: I am a big Jose Andres fan, live in DC, and eat at all his restaurants.Not worth your money and time. The atmosphere and decor is really cute but sad to say, that is not enough to bring me back. The Tuna Ceviche was probably the most exciting thing there. The tanginess and these crunch lil things which I suspect is fried roe makes the dish! The tacos were blah and bland and most dissapointing of all was some wheat noodles with tiger sauce. We thought the sauce sounded exciting and exotic but it was just chinese fermented bean sauce. This sauce does nothing to boost the flavor of the horribly bland wheat noodles. Totally disappointing and I will not be back!.Don't like this place at all. 

We made the mistake to go there at a holiday weekend. 

It is super small and gets pretty packed and the worst is they still let people in when there is no space to stand or dance anywhere. I know that the security there is doing their job, but when you get in you follow a hallway and if people in front of you are blocking the way and you get pushed out of the way by security then you regret having paid 50$ for guys and 20$ as a girl.If you like to be treated like a herd of cattle and feel like a sardine then by all means go but the rude as heck bouncers who are a bunch of mindless dip sh*ts  and the over prices with little chance if actually get a drink I think this place is garbageHaving traveled around the world from LA to NYC to Greece always stopping for some great sushi along the way I thought I'd try Blue Ribbon...let's say it just doesn't make the mark. I don't mind dropping a few bills on a well enjoyed dinner but not one that comes with a taste of salt and bad fish with every bite.I was with a group of 4, we ordered four types of sashimi, rock shrimp that came out in tiny balls of fried saltiness- red lobster would have done better, they lacked the shrimp inside, the whole grilled sea bass which was again salty and way overpriced at $48, it was barely enough for one person. Not being satisfied and still starving and parched we thought we'd try to order some hand and cut rolls...what a mistake we literally sent them all back. The only decent item we had was the saki and the service wasn't too bad when he remembered to bring our orders. I would never go back here or recommend this to anyone, I would say try Nobu or the sushi restaurant at the Wynn in Vegas because the $400 bill and bad taste in your mouth won't sit well in your mind after dining here. They have alot of work to do here.
  We actually ate again 2 hours later at La cave in the Wynn for some well enjoyed late night bites by Chef Billy. Thank god for some real food and truffle grits to recover from the earlier disappointment.I LOVE Cafe Rio to pieces but tonight they ran completely out of napkins and no horchata or any of their lemonades. The line to pay took forever. Our food was ready long before we could pay. Just a bad night I suppose. They know it's dinner time so they need to pick up their slack.The Forum Shops are nice... this rating is actually for Essentials at The Forum. DO NOT SHOP THERE!!! If you do, DO NOT USE YOUR CREDIT CARD. My card number was stolen and I have a pretty good feeling that it was from the clerk at this shop. My friend and I went in on August 12th to purchase some aspirin and a bottle of water. My friend purchased her stuff before me using cash. I rang up after her. I handed the clerk my card, after he grabbed it, he stared at it for at least 20 seconds before swiping it through (he also stared at the back for a few seconds, probably to memorize the card number and the secure code). I was completely weirded out by it, and almost canceled my card right after I left, but decided not to (the thought of being in Vegas without being able to possibly use it made me decide not to). I wish I would have!! Yesterday someone using my card number charged over $2000 in a matter of 30 minutes online shopping for auto parts and jewelry. I do not use that card very often, so I have a very good feeling that this was the case.

Do not give this place your business, and if you do, USE CASH. I am not one to write bad reviews, but you can tell how discouraging this could be.

Also, I did not see a yelp for this particular business on here, so I decided to write my review here instead.I wouldn't choose any stars if I had the opportunity to. I recently bought a gift card from this location for $120. When I first called this location, they said there is nothing they can do about it. When I called another location, they said that Massage Envy has the information on file, and can easily pull it up. I called the Rainbow location back and they refused to do it. They are trying to keep my $120 for no apparent reason. Why should they be entitled to my money? They have the giftcard number under my account, so why can't I use it???? No one else can, so what's the difference? I even talked to the manager who #1 wouldn't let me finish my thoughts, and #2 was very rude and hung up on me when I asked for her name. 

DON'T GO TO THIS LOCATION. GO TO ANOTHER ONE THAT WON'T STEAL YOUR MONEY.Stopped in to look at new Galaxy 5.  First thing that put me off was the music in the store was so loud you could not hear what was being said and was told no they could not turn the volume down.  Finally went to back of store and sales person showed us the phone.  When we discussed price he said we could probably get a better deal somewhere else.  REALLY????  We decided that would be our last visit to this store.Worst customer service EVER!  We called last Thursday to order 6 tickets for  Sundays game. The call went fine, however when we went into our email to print the tickets on Saturday night, we realized the ticket office had given us tickets for the WRONG DAY! We tried to call the ticket office, but they were closed over the weekend.  So we didn't get to go to the game on Sunday. When we called on Monday to get this resolved, we were told that all we could do was exchange the tickets for a future date. EVEN THOUGH THIS WAS THE ERROR OF THE BALLPARKS EMPLOYEE, THEY WON'T GIVE US A REFUND!!  What's more, they told us we had to exchange the tickets by TODAY!  I have spent my morning at work trying to contact my friends who complete the set of 6 tickets, so that we can get a new date arranged.  This has been an awful experience and really shows that Salt River Fields doesn't care about their locals They are already creating a bad image for the new park.I wouldn't even give this place one star! We researched on the Internet and decided to check it out. We drove an hour and when we reach the place it's freakn CLOSED! There was nothing on the Internet about that. Sign said closed for reorganization. So we called to see when they would be open thinking that hopefully the would be open before I leave Phoenix in a week. But guess what? The freakn phone number had been disconnected! Go figure! Even if they were to call and say we're open tomorrow I wouldn't go back.This venue is terrible! Security would continuously force out people that were trying to get in line early. At one point a few ladies were hiding out in a near by restroom in order to keep from being thrown out until security caught on and made them leave. When tickets are general admission, those that show up early often do so in order to be as close as possible to the stage, but the staff here highly opposes that practice. People holding Vip tickets ended up going first. There were a few audio glitches and I paid $5 for a CUP of water. I really wish bands would stop doing shows here.*  Hostesses are children trying to act like adults
*  Service is slow (painfully slow)
*  Employees all have an attitude and not a good one
*  Mediocre food
*  Watered down drinks
*  Expensive drinks
*  Overall dirty and sticky
*  Restrooms on one corner of the structure which is about 100 yards from some tables.
*  Need I say more?Terrible experience.

Went for a late lunch around 3pm today. Checking in at the hostess stand was normal but it wasn't a good vibe. All the employees seemed very stressed out.

We were told it was a 5 minute wait and we were seated within 10 minutes.

We were seated directly next to a giant table of children. As a well dressed modern couple with no children in tow of our own, most restaurants have the decent sense to seat us away from misbehaving hellions using their silverware as drumsticks.. Ok well the restaurant was on a wait you say... deal with it its a table.. But the restaurant was far from full, the wait was due to being understaffed. I would estimate 20-30% of the tables in view were open.

Water glasses were brought to the table as soon as we sat down. They were still steaming hot as well as wet on the inside and out... awesome :rolls eyes:

So we pick up a menu that weighs over a pound and see that they have some really yummy sounding stuff, from drinks to dessert we found multiple items we wanted to try. We picked out martinis, and decided on splitting an app, soup, and crepe so we could save room to sample desserts. We even picked out stuff to try for next time. We can walk here in 5 minutes from where we live, this menu had so much stuff we wanted to try, as well as being 24hrs a day, we were really hoping this could be a go to spot for us.

I checked my watch when we sat down. After closing our menus I checked it again, and it had been almost 10 minutes and the only person who had be to our table was the busser delivering the empty glasses.

We sat with closed menus and heads scanning for someone to notice us for another 5 minutes. After 15 minutes in total had gone by, we decided to leave.

We both decided to give it another try down the road, the menu looks great. But for now I cannot recommend this restaurant anyone. The service here is terrible.Expensive and the food sucks? Not the business my friends. The ambiance is nice and fun, but the food didn't deliver. It was bland and nothing I expected, plus I'm paying an arm and leg for it. No thanks, but get one of those giant cocktails - they're pretty neat.Found this place due to Groupon.  Got brazilian area treated, and was seeing success, but my laser tech who is super friendly does the treatment so fast, she skips over huge areas, and that is very obvious at the end of my package.  Areas of hair loss are super patchy, and if my tech had been consistent with laser pulses, the treatment would have been a success.  If you are thinking about using them, I can't help but think that they give discount treatment to discount customers- especially in large areas where you can't see the treatment.  I have one treatment left, and I'm going to say something to her about it.  I had canceled an appointment over the phone (they require 24 hours notice) and they claimed they never got my message, and took away one of my pre-paid appointments.We were visiting from out of town and like to "eat local". There were only 4 other tables when we arrived and 5 or 6 staff standing around we waited 15-20 minutes after being seated before anyone came by. I was brought the wrong beverage the large Cesar salad came with 1 garlic knot for two of us and the pizza was just ok. I would not normally leave a yelp but the service was really shameful we won't be back this trip or any other.Poor service is the status quo at this place.  I came in and sat myself after standing in the door way for a couple of minutes. I wasn't sure if I was supposed to seat myself because no one was their nor was their any signage  to direct people.

I sat at the table and waited for 10 mins and one had even said hello or made any eye contact.  There was a person at the table next to me that was having the same issue.I can't even comment on the food they serve here. Reason being, there was no food to be served. Arrived at the restaurant, never was greeted but only to sit down next to the bar. No problem with that, except no one even tried to acknowledge us. Sat unwaited for about 15 mins, being clearly visible to the wait staff. Left disappointed and clearly upset with the unprofessionalism and discern of the staff at mellow mushroom. I should give them 0 stars but you can't. Never tasted the food and staff was rude. Disappointed customer!!The food was good, but seriously.....$21.95 for a 6 oz chicken dish. No kids menu. Three servers for a thirty person party and a half full dining room. The original tutti's was much betterI really want to give a better review because the Staff seemed nice enough.  However, there were too many elements that turned me off.  This is a seemingly middle of the road restaurant, however, they act like a fast food restaurant: no glasses, napkins, or silverware...and my Bento Box was served in Styrofoam (even though I was asked, "For here or to go?").

The salad that was served with the Bento Box was less than sub par; all I saw was old iceberg lettuce.  To their credit, the piece of salmon that was served was of very good size.  The taste was nothing special, but it was not bad either.

They made the mistake of giving us a "free sample" of the California Roll.    It scared us.  If this was what we would experience when the sushi arrived, it was AWFUL because it was so obviously OLD!

The sushi was much better than our "sample" when it arrived, thank goodness.

All in all, this is a poor value for the quality of the food.  Sorry Yoshi.I wish I could rate this place higher but my blow out is terrible. I asked for a blowdry with lots of volume and curl. It seemed that the cross between the mai-tai and cosmo would be perfect. My hair is flatter than what I walked in with. My hair is curly naturally so has decent volume, but for some reason its flat! Also the stylist pulled my hair alot while blow dryng and apologized for hurting me which I appreciated, but have never experienced with a blowdry before. I don't think I'll be coming back, sad since I love the concept and the salon is lovely.

Update: They offered me a make up blow out. I decided to try the place out again, thinking it was a fluke that my blowdry was so awful. Mistake! Not only was my second blowdry here mediocre, I ended up paying for the service. I wrote to their manager who had offered the complimentary blowdry, but no response.Buying an exhaust system is really hard, mostly because you don't know how its going to sound.  So you rely on the people that work there to provide the best possible solution for what you want.   I explained exactly what I DIDN'T want my car to sound like and the goal of what I was looking for.   However, the result, is exactly what I explained to them I didn't want.

Now, the actual work seems to be good (welds, etc), but the outcome is terrible for spending $600+ on a custom exhaust system.  When I called back to express my disinterest in the work performed, they basically said there was not much they could do.  I'm assuming that means that I'll basically have to pay again to rework my exhaust.

Now I have a car that I love, but hate to drive.  It seriously makes me cringe every time step on the gas.  Also, after I turn my car off now and leave it in the garage, I have a really bad carbon monoxide smell in my garage and have to leave my garage door cracked until the smell goes away.  I may try to buy some resonators or something and see if that can help, but I won't be bringing them here to get put on.   

The only positives I can say is that they did the work pretty quickly as I went and didn't have to wait very long.  The guys were also very nice, but just didn't seem to know what I wanted or how to do it.This place has its ups and downs.  We went the first weekend they opened and, while the pizza was good, the wine selection was not.  And we were there for three hours - not what you expect for a pizza dinner.  Granted the place was packed.  I've been back a few other times - once for dinner and twice for lunch.  The last time I went was the Saturday of a holiday weekend.  The restaurant next door was pretty busy, but Brugo's was empty.  We were the only two people there at Noon.  Our server was sick.  When I asked about it, she said she had been sick for two weeks but had worked nearly every day.  (If you are a restaurant owner, please send sick people home!)  We also observed her go behind the bar and make herself a Bailey's and Chocolate Syrup drink.  The restaurant floor was not clean - crumbs under most of the tables.  The furniture looked like something someone picked up before it was sent to the trash - ripped seats, worn edges, upholstery pulling off of some chairs, etc.  Our check was $30 for two personal pizzas with three toppings each.  WAY too much for what they give you.

As we were leaving, I looked everywhere for a sanitation grade but could not find it.  Isn't it a requirement to display that?  Sadly, I won't be back.  I moved here from a much better culinary city - I live close by and miss good pizza.  Maybe they'll turn it around, but I'm not holding my breath.Not sure why I decided to go back after the first visit. Please dont support a restaurant that upcharges you $2 to substitute rice instead of fries. Cmon now.  Ridiculous. Also go check out Kyhber halal up the street insetad,Terrible service from the beginning since we could not sub tofu for meat on the lunch menu, lame! Then after taking the food home our daughter found a long hair in her soup right after she opened it...disaster!Never again.It is simply the worst restaurant  i have ever been to in my entire life. (I'm 39).

I don't even know where to start.

Even though it was completely empty; we waited several minutes for anyone to even acknowledge we were there. 

We sat down. 

The place is filthy. Dusty. Grimy. Greasy. Terrible. 

Should have just left. But I really wanted to see what the food was like. The rice was burnt and I not sure that was actual chicken in the dishes.First and foremost, where's the dance floor? 

Service was pretty fast with getting me drinks but the quality of the drinks was terrible. Vodka cranberry tasted like something with cranberry syrup and the bartender gave me an attitude about how it's not his fault so it must be mine.

Packed with zombies in dress-code uniform and a long line. Revolver would have been a much better idea and it doesn't have a cover.Hands down the worst dining expereance of my life! Went in for my birthday dinner with a group of 9. The service was horrendous. He couldnt answer any of our questions and when i asked what came on dinner sushi orders he grabbed me a to go menu. The waiter didn't take two peoples orders forgot to put another one in and brought out the wrong meals. First bite of my sushi had a bone in it. The salmon and tuna was like beef jerkey. I have never sent a dish back in my life until last night. Nothing i ordered was esible. The bathrooms had water and toilet paper everywhere. Not one person in our party was satisfied. We ended up leaving and eating after. I was extremely disappointed.Who wants to get food poisoning during your vegas vaycay place is bomb  just do not get the alpastor meat made me sick all night!Planned to go there last Sunday because of all the great things we had heard about this place!  WELL, to our surprise, they were not open!!!  the huge NOW OPEN sign was hanging in the window, the hours on the door said they were open -- there were a few people inside, looked like they were cleaning the kitchen area or something........ but alas, all the doors were locked and the people inside completely ignored us!!  At least take down the huge NOW OPEN banner in the window!!!  Or post a sign on the door explaining why you would be locked up during your business hours!!!Beware of these shady rip off artist storm chasers!  

A guy from Jasper came knocking on my door and tried to sell me on how they would essentially rip off my insurance company by claiming my roof has wind damage.  My roof is fine.  There are no leaks and I check it myself inside and out regularly.  

He claimed it would only cost the insurance deductible.  And I would get an additional benefit if I had their ugly sign in my front yard that let my whole neighborhood know "I committed insurance fraud! "

I would never "buy" a new roof from someone who knocks on my door and gives a drive-by assessment.My sister an I visited recently. We couldn't win anything on slots, they were sp tight. After losing a good amount of money, we decided to give bingo a try.  What a ripoff.  We each spent over $50 for our buy in, and never came close. This place seats like 100 people. Never again! I will stick to playing at the Fort where I can win when the place is at capacity,  and spend less than $50.Poor service, tables and seats dirty.nice design...they forgot the quality food....I agree with another reviewer that this Toy shop is more like a "labor of love" - like a personal collection in a store? Everything was over priced and much smaller than I thought - 
I really wanted to visit this store after watching Johnny on Pawn Stars, and being a huge toy fan. So I dragged my family through downtown, fought the heat and finally found this small hidden store- 
At first sight I was excited for my 12 year old girl to see all the old school toys I once played with, it was a Sunday so I didn't see Johnny there- no big deal, but no one even talked to me or acknowledged us-
BUT, what really tweaked me was there was a TV on with a DVD of a comedian that was cussing, dropping F bombs and talking about masturbating with the volume really loud???? So I quickly whisked my little girl away and walked to the other side of the store- I didn't get to say anything to the only employee there who was clueless and talking away with his buddy! 
So I gathered my family and left!! 
Johnny I'm super disappointed in the fact that a TOY STORE should NOT have a DVD playing like that!!!  I don't care if it's Vegas, it's inappropriate!!! 
PARENTS- be aware, apparently this store is for 30+ year old nerds - not children

Sorry Johnny, I'm sure your a great guy- just letting you know how we felt about our first and last time at your store -If I could give them 0 stars I would. Weekly plus had an offer for their brownies so I called Slade Grove (they answered the phone....hello.....nothing more....that should have been my first clue to their unprofessional ways) to ask them if their brownies were of a decent size to give out to my guests on Christmas.  I mentioned that I was looking to buy the Weekly Plus deal.  The man said oh yes, they are very large and that would work, so I bought the deal. The next day I went to order the brownies and was told by voice recording only that I couldn't order them for Christmas.  That was the sole purpose for my purchase and the reason I called and spoke with Slade Grove first.  I tried several times to reach them by phone but only ever got a recording.  I also left several messages which to this day have not been responded to.  There is no brownie in the world that is worth this terrible service.  Beware of this company.So Friday night and my car needs a bath. My normal spot is closed already so I went to Ecowash to give it a try. On their website they show all these people hand washing your car and since I have an expensive new convertible this is exactly what I'm looking for.

  Unfortunately that is not what I get. They sent it through their tunnel and had someone go around it with a spray washer like you see in the self serve car washes. Needless to say when they pulled it around it was still covered in all kinds of dirt because they never used any kind of brush on it. I spent $35 on a wash that would have cost me $3 in quarters. They did a good job on the vacuuming and leather ($10 extra) but the windows looked like crap with lots of lent and missed spots.

  When I mentioned to the manager how what I expected and what I received were two different things, I got a pat answer about how the brushes didn't touch my car. He didn't seem to care at all that my car didn't get cleaned well and never offered any discount or apologies. He did, however, go outside and yell at the guy who took my car in like it was his fault.. great management style-   :rolling eyes:

  I still tipped $5 but just because I always tip, they really didn't deserve it. After spending $50 I'm about to go outside and finish the job myself. 

  Steer clear (pun intended), there are much better places to give your car a bath.First off walking in the establishment, I see a green B and two red C's posted in the front counter (during the time of my visit). So that kind of makes me wonder. But anyways, the service isn't that great at all. I know dim sum restaurants typically don't have great service but this place blows them all out of the park. The food was bland and they offered to heat the noodle dish they served to us. They came back with it and it was still COLD. The fried squid was very mushy and tasted a little bitter. Dumplings were probably the best thing to eat there. Oh and you have to ask like 5 people to bring you rice. I wouldn't want to come back here.Worst burger I have ever eaten. Went here on a groupon and would never go back. The burger on the overall just tasted bad/funny. I think it was the sauce and lettuce. I deconstructed the burger and still only ate half of it. The meat really had no taste. Sucks to say but on my burger journey this place was rock bottom. 

The only redeeming quality for this place was the maple bacon shake. Now this was tasty. Don't see myself going out of the way for it. 

Definitely a skip over this place for me.Having visited The Barrymore twice previously for lunch, I was looking forward to giving it a shot for dinner. Unfortunately, bad service and below average food ensure I won't be returning for a fourth time. 

Our group received slow service every step of the way. Despite the restaurant being 3/4 empty, we had a long wait to be seated, receive menus, have our orders taken, receive our food and get the check. We had to ask for a drink menu and bread. We had long stretches when our server was nowhere in sight. 

I ordered the filet cooked medium. It was raw. Others in our group also received their food undercooked. 

I liked The Barrymore as a hidden gem away from the bustle of the Strip, but after this experience I won't return and will quit recommending it to others.


Update: Management from The Barrymore contacted me as a result of this review in an effort to get more information and to make things right. I declined the offer for a comped meal, but the genuine concern from management is a good sign that they're trying to do the right thing.Miserable experience on 10/17/2013.  I specifically asked that a certain sandwich not contain any garnish:  nothing.  I just wanted the turkey, bacon, bread and you're done.  Prior to finalizing the transaction, the guy that took my order would say something like, "so no mayo?"  and I'd be like NOTHING other than what's listed on the board minus the dressing.  I don't want anything.  Then the sandwich preparer person, a female, barks that the sandwich also comes with onions.  And I'm like uh, I don't want ANYTHING on the sandwich.  I got home and it was loaded with tomatoes and onions.  I started picking them off but the sandwich stunk of onions so I said screw it, I want my damn money back.  So I drove back and asked for the manager and I told him how I thought this experience was a sick joke since I specifically told his subordinates that I wanted basically a plain sandwich and that I just wanted my money back.  He said that they could fix it and I said no.  That I would not allow them to fix it and that I just wanted my money back.  So this white older gentleman who was listening in to all of this whom presumably owned the place as he was coming and going as he pleased into the back of the restaurant comes out and hands me a $10 and says "here, happy now?" and I'm like "I don't want your money.  I am not owed a ten.  Your staff made an error and I just want my refund back."  He proceeds to tell me that when I was there earlier that he listened to me making my request that I wanted the sandwich to be plain and that he hoped that his staff got it right.  So I tell him that then he should be a little bit more sympathetic for my frustration as I had to come back from my home, almost getting rear-ended in the process and now I'm having to deal with this.  He seemed  more agitated with me than with the fact that his staff couldn't get a simple order right.  When he came over to give me his personal $10 bill, he walked over to where I was and was right in front of my chest in a confrontational manner.  What a great example you set for your staff sir.  Way to salvage a customer from this bad experience.  I will never return nor will I ever recommend this place to any one else because of this incident.  Besides, I never really cared for their food and only frequented it because of its convenience.  Jersey Mike's kick their booty anyway but they are too far away.Worst bar in Tempe. They don't even know how to make a Long Island Iced Tea. Enough said.Disappointed. 

I came here on a Saturday night for dinner. There was a live band that took nearly our entire meal to set up. They were testing their equipment and the sound the entire time we were there. While they were setting up, the restaurant was trying to hide how loud the band was by blaring loud music overhead. I do like loud music, just not blaring like we're at Axis/Radius while I'm eating. 

The service was ok. The drinks took longer than our appetizers. They didn't even have enough shrimp to fill our one order of coconut shrimp. I had to get up and get my own salt and pepper from the bar after not seeing my server for nearly 15 mins after our entrees arrived. 

The food was AWFUL! I ordered the salmon and my boyfriend some handmade pasta Alfredo dish. Mine was just salmon and couscous. Nothing special and bland. The dish wasn't seasoned. My boyfriend had the same problem with his food, bland. Right after we left I felt sick after eating the little bit of food I did consume. 

To top off our "super great" experience we were overcharged for our wine on the bill. At this point we were far too annoyed to say anything and just paid the overage and left. I think its safe to say we wont be coming  back. Such a shame too, considering we've been looking for a great new place. Stay clear of this overpriced gross food. You would be much happier with basically any other restaurant in Old Town.From the frozen hash brown patty to the overcooked low quality ingredients in the breakfast burrito and the almost absent service this place is the lowest of the low vegas has to offer. a shame for this location.Disappointing overcooked tofu cubes.  Food did not appear or taste fresh.  Will not return.I would give this place zero stars if I could...I purchased a package of Zerona treatments (guaranteed to take inches off your waistline...not). I went in with the intention of purchasing a treatment for my stomach and got talked into buying an additional treatment for my arms. I was hesitant to do so because I had a suspicion that this treatment would be totally bogus. However the sales girl Jade, promised that it would if I followed the intensive list of directions you must follow while getting treated (including not drinking coffee, alcohol, exercising for a half hour every day, taking a $60 dollar supplement, drinking half of your weight in water, etc.). Well folks, I followed every single direction and guess what? I LOST EXACTLY ZERO INCHES. 

I wasn't upset at the outcome as I figured anything that promises extreme inch loss is more likely than not to be bogus. However, I did become upset when after my failed stomach treatment I asked to be refunded for my arm treatment and they refused! They told me that the two treatments were purchased as a package and because I was given "special pricing" I could not get my money back for a treatment I know doesn't work. Special pricing my a$$, one of their sales techniques is to pretend like you're getting a great deal, but it took one or two times back in to realize that EVERYONE GETS "SPECIAL" pricing. Also, the contract you sign is very misleading, I read that you could be refunded for unused treatments, but really they will give you credit towards some other stupid treatment I don't want. As far as the staff, they're really super nice on your consultation visit...but that ends the minute you sign your money away. DO NOT WASTE YOUR HARD-EARNED MONEY HERE! It would be better spent being set on fire, at least that way your time will not be wasted too.Online Order would not work...
Called in Order...
New Employee, gave order 3X
Arrived Wrong!!!! Pizza under done, No side of marianara as ordered.

Why bother Order from a cpizza hain if they cant do anything right?
Ruined the whole reason for ordering a pie
For 30 bucks I can grill steaks

That is what I will do in the future
Papa Johns SUCKS!!!!!!!!Let's start out with the $66 admin fee for a 3 month sign-up. Cost me $206 out the door....

Take that, coupled with someone who has no clue on what he is doing, and you have a semblance of a gym.

Take my $210 and invest in either marketing or value-added benefits.

You guys need help...Went for lunch buffet during the week, the restaurant was quite empty and remained empty thru lunch hour. Food was okay, the rassum was excellent but rest of the food was pretty much just okay. The buffet menu is v sparse, perhaps the weekend buffet has a better selection. $8.99 seemed a bit steep considering the selection and the taste.Please don't waste your time nor money. I did. The manager seems nice but screws you over. I left work for a 2 hour job and it's been over 4 hours now. And this is my second trip due to the techs not doing their job.Ok, so I agree his place needs to decide what they want to be.  I like the decor changes, and was actually excited about the German menu, and really liked many of these Options.  Alas, last time we went in, menu back to standard Cave Creek bar/Mexican/generic fried offerings.  Oh we'll, decided to give it a try anyway.   Took some time to get initial service despite being quite empty.  Ordered some drinks and apps.  Apps came out before we got our drinks, OK, then the waitress drops a wineglass on the table completely shattering it.  Still Ok, these things happen.

Then the wheels came off.  We moved to a new table, as ours was completely covered in glass, and the server tried to move all our drinks that were on the table at the time of the incident to our new table.  We were like, those may have glass in them too, could you bring us new ones?  She says sure, then another server comes over and tries to give us our glass shard containing apps back.

That was it.  I'll wait for new management before going back.  If this is going on right in front of the customers, I shudder to think of what may be going on in the back.This place looks like a cool bar/restaurant but it was terrible.  We waited 30 min for a burger and then the server charged a $5 split plate fee because my husband and I split!  He didn't even make us aware of the charge until we got our bill and then told us that it was noted on the menu so he couldn't reverse it.  We called the manager after we left and he said he would credit our check.  Well he never did it!
The burger was overcooked and the fries were cold.  I would NEVER visit this place again!Worst wait ever. Longer wait than a doctor's office just to return some equipment.  This store needs to hire more people.Same experience as everyone else; why are these clowns still in business?!?!

The service guy came out and, with a cheery smile, told me that the switch I needed him to fix had never worked in the first place. 1st time-  "Just so you know, it never worked that way." 2nd time- "Hmmm...just so you know, it never worked like that." 3rd time- "No, it never worked like that." Every time he argued (as he's staring in confusion at the light switch) I told him, "I've lived here ten years and the switch worked until I changed it."

SOOOOOOOO insulting! And in the end he couldn't fix it because he wouldn't even consider that I was right. He was opening outlets that have never been touched and trying to figure out some random outlet that the switch MUST go to. Refused to use a wire tracker and blew my brakers trying to attach the switch to an outlet it didn't belong on.

The "dispatcher" refuses to give prices over the phone because if they told you that they were going to charge you FIVE TIMES the normal rate, you'd hang up on them.

$156 to change an outlet?! $350 to "diagnose" a problem? $39 just to show up?

Plus this guy was a scam artist on top of being incompetent. I had a coupon for $49 off of service and the guy said he'd let me keep my coupon and just wave the $39 service charge. Ummm....that's a deal? They don't require you to know math to be an electrician?

Others have said that they wave the service fee if you hire them to perform a job anyway, something the dispatcher didn't tell me. Total extortion! You have to pay just to find out that they're going to over-charge you and that you don't want to hire them?!?!

Incompetent. Rude. Over-priced.

Don't be scared of your local electrician that charges by the hour. He's probably more familiar with the unique problems associated with buildings in your area than some random contractor from across the valley.Gwen put a few feathers in my hair that stayed in for about 3 weeks. She also used a white bead, and I have dark brown hair. WTF? Am I supposed to tell you how to do your job? When I tried to make another appt with her she was too busy, couldn't be bothered.Stupid crapWas extremely disappointed. I understand they just opened but it was a pretty bad experience. First off the workers on the line (food is served cafeteria style) didn't understand English. Items listed oh the menu were no longer available. ALL of the food was cold. Bartender sent two wrong drinks to start. Wait staff was too busy talking amongst each other to address their customers. Last of all, the price, it's way too expensive for the type of food offered and the quality. Maybe this place will make some changes in the future but for now I'd steer clear. Manager did the right thing by offering 50% off the bill and even she said that some changes need to be made.Am not sure who those 8) reviews were but this is the most horrible nail experience I've ever had.....I've asked for a mani-pedi.... Started w pedicure but technician rushed off to another client without finishing w me. I got passed on to another technician for manicure but I waited so long I lost interest.Yesterday i happened by Caketini at Fashion Square near Nordstom's.  I was doing research for "wedding" cupcakes.  I tried the "Tuxedo" cupcake to take home.  The person behind the counter said the frosting was their "signature" buttercream- so I assumed it would be good.  When I got home I tried a small edge of the frosting. It tasted like Crisco! Not Butter. I love to cook and know what butter tastes like. This frosting is not butter.-I spit it out.  Not good.  The cake itself was ok.Tourist trap, for the really really dumb tourists. My friend works here and offered us free tickets to go ice skating. We excitedly go down there with my 3.5 year old ice skating prodigy of a daughter and 7 year old son. We redeem our tickets and are told we can't go in until the next session... And that they won't allow under 7 on the ice... 

We get out there half an hour later, for our half hour skating session, and realize they can't allow anyone under 7 because they will die. This isn't ice. It's plastic. It's slippery it's absolutely no traction. You can barely move without slipping. The skates are terrible fits with them being so big and bulky at the top. Half an hour later, they kick you out after the tourist schmucks paid $15/person. 

Here's my tip. Somewhere else very nearby on the strip, is a big casino also with outdoor ice skating. Except, it has real ice, no time limits, and you can even go up there to watch without paying!! Take that 30 minute walk and get your money's worth and don't bother with the plexiglass.I had a root canal done on June 14th and 3 weeks later went back for my permanent where i complained of pain to eating cold and hot. His assistant took x rays and told me it was cement in my teeth when he was removing and cleaning up my temporary crown. Dr Moeller came in didnt say a word about my x ray and put my crown on. then i go again August 8th to have them find out why im in more pain and called ahead and said i dont want to be billed and im not paying anymore money until u tell me whats wrong. so i go. and they bill my insurance. and he tells me some patients dont take to a root canal and might need surgery. So far from the truth. so September 4th comes and im in excruciating pain constantly now. I go to an endodontist of my choice and find out that my root canal was not done properly. it needed to be redone and because my insurance is now tapped out due to Dr Moeller i now have paid $1000.00 out of my pocket and find out he billed me for a filling i already had. So now my insurance has paid $1400.00 and ive paid $375.00 to him and now $1000.00 out of pocket for retreatment. I went to get my crown filled and find out its also not done properly so now I need to pay $1400.00 out of pocket for that. Im at $2800.00 out of pocket and my insurance is at $1400.00. This place is a joke and so is he. Very unprofessional when it comes to taking responsibility for mistakes. I couldnt eat for days or sleep. i was on pain pill and anitibiotics and lost wages from having to miss work to run around a deal with this. With no help from Comfort Dental. Please do not go here. His lack of concern has now cost me money and pain and put my family out.1 star for the awesome view this spot has to offer..  

My experience here was a whole other story.  We went into Hyde to scope out the spot.  While deciding what to do next, a handful of patrons started hurling racial slurs at us.  NOT COOL.  Management did absolutely nothing.  I would never step foot at Hyde ever again.Went there first time on Sat night 1-27-13, Don't get the floor plan layout of this club. You walk in and wayyyyy in the back is one bar with over priced drinks!!!! This club is not even on the strip and they charge wayyy to much for drinks, unacceptable. The dance floor is round and people always walking by you to get to the bar way in the back!!! The sound system is one of the worst in Las Vegas gay clubs, there really no bass. Most of their VIP tables are right in the middle of the dance area, very annoying if you're paying for bottle service and people knocking into you... The lighting is bad too.. I would say Piranha night club is much better for music, drinks, and location, much closer to the strip hotels...Promoters just tell you what you want to hear so they can make their money.  We were told we were going to get out at the front of the line and get in free with drink comps.  We ended up waiting in 2 different lines and left before they sent us to the 3rd line.  They basically just fill you up with false hope.Smelled REALLY good, looked REALLY good but wasn't able to get any!  :(

Went today, Saturday, at 2:00 and waited in line for 15 mins without moving.  People were coming in behind me and leaving because it was taking WAY too long. Other people who had ordered and were waiting for their food were also upset because they were having to wait too long. Couldn't even take a menu because they were out. 

Will give it a second chance, maybe during the week or see if they accept carry out calls.It's a shame.  I really wanted to like this place. ...as I live close by.  I went there at 6pm on a Friday.  There was only 2 other tables sat in the place.  FYI, this place is basically just like the inside of any gas station, but it has some tables in one corner that they call a restaurant.  They have a sign that says "please wait to be seated",  I stood next to this sign for 10 minutes before some one walked by, and I had to stop them and ask "How do I get seated?" To which he replied, oh, I didn't see you.   I was with my wife and son,btw.  We get seated, and my 23 month old son is cranky, so I order a cup for him that I can put his milk in, and me and my wife order a water and a coke,  the waitress comes back with just my coke.  I ask again for the cup for my son, she then brings it.  i order fries just to have something quick to keep my son happy while we wait for our food and me and my wife get the caprese flat bread.  By the time someone else brings the food out, it is cold.  My son starts into the fries right away (which weren't bad despite being cold)  My wife and I try to eat the cold caprese flat bread and it was so bland, there was no balsamic vinaigrette that you normally get with a dish like this.  We have to grab her attention again to order our food, and order a side of balsamic vinaigrette.  After 20 minutes, with a cold uneaten caprese and fries almost depleted, i go up to the counter and request the vinaigrette again - she finally gives it to me, and we dump it on our cold soggy flat bread, which makes it about 1% better.  Another 30 minutes pass, My son has now finished the entire plate of fries, too full to eat any real food.  i go up to tell our waitress that we are going to need our food to go.  She says ok.  Minutes later, she walks up with our food on dishes, and sets a couple boxes down with it.  basically saying, i know the food was bad and late and you're had shitty service, but here, you can box it too.  This was the icing on the cake.  Bad food, horrendous service, bad atmosphere.  Did I mention over-priced?  $14.00 for a sandwich and the smell of the car wash coming through, no thanks.If I could give no stars for this place I would. A childs first visit to the dentist should be a somewhat comforting pleasant one. The only thing my 3yr old grandson remembers is the dentist putting his hand over my grandsons mouth to cover his crying. When a child is scared to death and crying you dont cover his mouth. This place just gave me a bad vibe. He definitely will not be back and will not be recommending this place.I stopped by this place so I could give a small local owned business a chance to earn my business and at 11:30 AM on Friday morning they were not serving sandwiches because their manager wasn't there. ??  I went across the street to Wendy's and they were happy to fix me lunch and take my cash. 

The location is terrible and I actually had to make an effort to find them in the strip mall that they are located in. You would think that they could at least be ready to serve lunch at lunchtime.The meatloaf sucks!

We love their ham, sandwiches and sides, but  yesterday my wife bought a meatloaf and side of loaded mashed potatoes from Honeybaked Ham.  What a horrible meal.

The meatloaf is dense and has a thick layer of ketchup.  When I say dense, I mean it is about the size and density of a brick.  The taste was not actually bad (once you get past the ketchup), but texture is something I just could not adjust to.

The mashed potatoes -loaded style- had bacon, chunks of potato, and probably sour cream and cheese.  Not suited to my taste. 

I will buy from them again, just will stick to the ham!After some people had mentioned that they liked this place, my wife and I decided to go and test, yet again, another Peruvian restaurant.  We ordered 3 different meals, lomo a caballo, arroz con mariscos, and pollo a la brasa.  The lomo a caballo would have been pretty good, but the sauce they had was sweet, which I didn't like at all.  The arroz con mariscos was bland, hardly any flavor.  The pollo a la brasa was far from the real deal, being dry and unflavorful.  we did get a free soup with our meal, which was the best thing we tasted there.  The sodas tasted like there was dish soap in them, and were not refilled until I finally had to ask.  We also had to ask for the sauces for the pollo a la brasa.  The aji that was served with the bread was pretty decent, but not enough to save the rest of the meal.  Overall, it was too pricey for the service and the quality of the food.  Sadly, we haven't been able to find a Peruvian restaurant that we like in AZ, and this one was probably the worst one we've tried.

Wow! It's a good thing you can edit these reviews.  A lot has happened since I made this review, which the last time I checked is an opinion of what I think.  The owner of this restaurant, upon reading my review, posted it on "Peruanos en Arizona," a group on Facebook.  He mentioned my full name in the review, opening it up to his "friends" to personally attack me.  He also said that that I went in to his restaurant complaining of the decoration of his restaurant. (which I didn't).   My wife made some comments, defending our opinion, and then he scanned our yelp coupon (which has my full name on it,) and order sheet that was made when we paid, and posted it on the same page as a picture, claiming that he was right about me making comments about the decoration. (which is not shown in the picture.) He claims to be a professional, but is far from it.  I had nothing against him personally, until now, but in one of his comments he says that there is no possible way that so many things can be wrong with his food unless I have something personal against him.  I don't think I need drive to a place and pay for a meal to make a review on someone who I personally don't like. He also posted the same review on his personal facebook page, to which his "friends" responded things like, "poor gringo, he only knows what frozen hamburgers and hot dogs taste like" and "He doesn't have the smallest idea of what real Peruvian Food is, he probably hasn't even been there," "with a last name like that, what does he know," "He's one of 'those' customers", "I hope the seafood got him sick,"  words like jealous, ignorant... things like that.  Now if I didn't know any better, I would think that a gringo's opinion doesn't matter when it comes to real Peruvian food, too.  However, I HAVE been to Peru, I DO know what good Peruvian food is supposed to taste like, and my wife, who is actually FROM Peru was equally disappointed with the food, and service.  Her mother cooks 50 times better than this guy, and we both know that what we ate doesn't compare to what real Peruvian food is supposed to be.  So, instead of taking this as constructive criticism, the owner has taken it as a personal attack against him, and has to look for validation from other people who surround him.  We probably would have been back there again, because my wife's family would have wanted to try the "new Peruvian restaurant" which has happened before with others, but now no one that we can tell to about our experience will ever go there.  There are also many many many other sites to review a restaurant, not just Yelp.  I'll make sure to put this same review on other sites, too.  That will also give me time to think up other things that I didn't like that I didn't mention on my original review.  Like how this "professional" was negotiating delivery prices with a meat driver right in front of the guests.  When I made this review, Yelp posted it on my facebook page, but I took it down because it was negative, but I will be sure to post it now.  I don't know if what this guy did was legal, but I'll find out soon enough.  I just hope he doesn't put my Debit Card number up on facebook.  So, if you're going to give this place a negative review, watch out!  You'll be personally attacked for your OPINION, and be lied about and be told you don't know what you're talking about.  He has since taken down all his posts, but I saved all the screenshots if anyone is interested.Always like to check out new places, this place sucks and it's overpriced. Although the Reuben hamburger that my ex wife got was pretty good, everything else was just the same ol bland crap that you would get at any other average restaurant. I definitely won't be going back there, I'll be surprised if its still open after six months. I'll give the owner some credit, she greated us at the door and was very nice. I had the turkey burger with fried okra and didn't like any of it.Messy and not enough AC. Too crowed with sweaty smell. Will never go back.Burger was good, but the service is AWFUL!!!! We sat down on Memorial Day (Monday) and waited 1:00 for 3 burgers and a kids meal.  Really!!!!!????!!!!  The AC was blaring, the wait staff seemed embarrassed by the delay, and we were told we were going to get taken care of for our trouble (we really didn't complain a lot about the lousy service at the time).  Our waiter graciously (sarcastically) took of 10% of a whopping 25$ bill...Wow, if I made $2.50 an hour it might of been worth my wait, fortunately I don't.  Avoid until they get their stuff straightened out, the food actually was not bad.I felt robbed! Not only was the chicken super salty but I paid $15 for  a two piece over cooked plate with super salty mac n cheese and DRY chicken breasts, a 4 piece strip meal that the fires tasted the best. I had the greens as a second side on the 2 piece meal and it was ok, but tasted like it was from a can. I was soooo disappointed! After all that I realized I should have received a drink with my 2 piece meal. For the wait and the quality of food I was better off doing it myself or going to Church's. At least I know that I would have received my drink and really needed the handful of napkins for my fingers...Sorry Flav....but either it was the wrong time of day or some people dont have taste buds. My blood pressure was off the charts after your food and it was from more than the salt additve I ingested. Dont buy into the hype folks. I was really suprised after looking at some of the photos posted of their meals because my meal didnt look nothing like what was posted. Dry overcooked and salty I cant say it enough.Ridiculous! Sandwiches are lackluster, overpriced and taste like something purchased at a gas station.

I ordered the hot Roast Beef sandwich ($6.29)

What I received was a stale onion roll with what I have to call "roast beef" and wilted lettuce. No cheddar cheese, caramelized onions or avocado (which I paid extra for).

If you live in the neighborhood, do yourself a favor and go to Subway or Jimmy Johns!

Simpo Sandwich is simply another example of an unskilled (and unqualified) businessman thinking they can get away with selling garbage. Unbelievable!

Written by SgroAll these locations are just true crooks let's file class-action lawsuit against them for being thieves!I really miss the OLD Cheers. I loved the old bartenders, regulars, and dive-y, chill atmosphere. 

Since they have reopened, I have given Cheers Tavern several opportunities to make me a regular. It seems that this place has no desire to keep the old clientele. It's disappointing that I have lost a place to hang out -- at least there's still Tony's. 

New Cheers is too pricey for a dive bar. I don't see why this place is ever busy because of the prices. Although, if this place was slightly enjoyable, I would gladly pay for their over-priced drinks.

They are competing with the other bars in Glendale, for the douchey-ist bar in the valley. Which is sad because there are so many bro-friendly bars on the westside. None of the old regulars come to this bar and, from what it seems, new Cheers doesn't even attempt to retain the old regulars. Also, the owners' responses to the once-regulars' reactions on the changes are crass and appalling. VERY UNPROFESSIONAL. 

Although, one plus-side is their bathrooms are no longer disgusting -- hence, the one star. 

I miss Sunni, Missy, Jess, and, MORE IMPORTANTLY, everything about the OLD Cheers. Once again, they have lost another paying customer, who was once a loyal regular.I would not return to this restaurant. Not so much because of the food, which was ok, (not good or great.) but because of their lack of customer service and unfair price advertising.

Their menu does not correctly reflect their prices and they charged me for fries/salad on top of the price of the gyro. The menu states "served with fries or a salad" but when I got my bill I was charged additional money for the side items. When I questioned it, I was told that was a lunch special. The menu is on their wall and there is a menu handout and there is nothing about lunch specials or lunch pricing.

They would NOT take the charges off, but just kept arguing with me.Service is bad, bad, bad. Although the food is okay portion, the staff there brings this rating way down. 

I was there during a lunch rush, although it wasn't completely slammed, a female server was heard yelling from the kitchen about how SHE IS F****** WORKING!!!! Crickets after that and everyone in the dining area turned that direction in complete shock. 

Aside from this little mishap,  you can't get seated, order you meal, get your check and pay in a timely fashion at all. I almost left exact change when I got my bill, but decided tip lite anyway. 

Food is full of grease, just about everything on their lunch menu is fried. What a disappointment. 

I won't be back and I hope for the sake of this place they will consider hiring staff with some customer service skills. 

Oh and WTF, FOX news is the only news network they show!NO stars if possible! I am reviewing only on the nightclub aspect. The sound system in this place is terrible, you couldn't even hear the music, only bass bass bass. Drinks extremely watered down and only 2 bartenders in the whole place! At least 2 fights broke out and the people that were fighting were not even taken out of the club. Avoid!This place is located inside of the Flamingo. I am a betting man and I bet in a year or less this place will close. The drinks and the food are terrible. I wish I had lost my money gambling. If Yelp offered a 1/4 star I would have checked it. Go to Margaritaville you will get fantastic potent drinks and great  food. Adios Carlos and Charlie's. Never ever again!We were wanting Mexican food and this place was located in the hotel where we were staying....ideal we thought.  It was absolutely terrible!!!  Service was bad and food and drinks totally over-priced.  I got a chicken chimi and the chicken was spoiled.  I took one bite and literally gagged.  My husband is a chef and smelled it and immediately knew it was rotten.  I lost my appetite so did not re-order.  Husbands tacos were tasteless. They did not charge us for my meal but our bill still totaled $50.  A total disaster!!Today Sunday March 30, 2014 just came from Firefly S.Eastern location in Las Vegas. Here and order from the breakfast menu.....what I found and got
Wet table, dirty chairs and floor you can actually see the food under the table.
Asked for a Café Latte, was asked if I wanted milk ??????Hellooo
Asked for a glass of water, could not drink out the glass Dirteyyyyyy
Order Bacon, got burned strips wll behond well done (I did not asked)
Paid the bill and after 45 minutes of done eating had to asked the server to please clean the table. The staff is very young with no experience nor training in the restaurant industry.   Never again.....Customer Service in this store is deplorable.  I have tried to consign several times and run into lack of an organized system and just plain rudeness from the employees. All I want to do is track the items that they accept and know what they sell for. This seems like it could go on some kind of on-line system. Instead, anytime you want to know if your items are available, sold, or donated, you have to ask for a print-out. The staff hates to give printouts and most of them don't know how to do this. I have asked for clarification--"What should I ask the clerk for--is it an inventory sheet? what is it called?" I just want to track my sold items and be able to easily pick up items about to expire.
Every time I go there they act like I am putting them out and they have no idea what an inventory sheet is.
REALLY?  I think I have a right to know what is happening with my items. Afterall, Turnstyle is making a nice profit on these. 
Isn't there an easier way for the consigner? This is a business.  Turnstyle is making lots of money on our stuff.
I would welcome a manager to email me or let me know how to contact her.  I read in the 2/20/14 post that there is a regional manager named Gail. 
Gail--pls contact me so that I can give some constructive feedback. I would like to come back and become a consigner again, but your staff Scares me!
Also, I think the timeline for how long you keep the items is too short. Two months (sometimes it is this short) is not enough selling time.
Also, is there a better way for us consigners to "find" our unsold items before the expiration? Otherwise, if you leave them there, you lose all rights to the items. Even if the item sells, if it goes past the expiration date you are not entitled to any of that money.   That sounds ridiculous.  I think 4 months would be a more reasonable time frame for all times of year.
In light of all this, I think that the small amount of money you MIGHT make on these purchases is not worth the hassle. I would rather give it to a charity that appreciates it than pad the wallets of Turnstyle executives.Beautiful bar and hotel ... but skip it for happy hour and watch out for deceptive wait staff.

Problem with the Blue Hound is there are too many choices nearby to make coming back a possibility. It may feel cool, but a lot of other places nearby feel cool, too. It's worth a visit just to check it out, but then ... it will never enter your mind again.

The Whoohoos!! - Beautifully decorated, great feeling and vibe, as another reviewer stated. It feels like a nice change of pace for Phoenix restaurants. The poolside bar is awesome and I'd go back there before this place.

The Sad Pandas - Happy hour SUCKS. I work nearby and go out at least one night a week and the Blue Hound will not be on our rotation list. "But why?" you ask ...

Set the scene ... four women out after work. Not looking for dinner, just some snacks while we have a drink or two and catch up.

Popcorn - sounds nummy! Not if you want more than two handfuls. For $6, we were delivered a teeny, tiny wooden bowl that you'd expect salsa to come in. In it was two medium sized handfuls of this caramel popcorn (and a lot of kernels and broken pieces). This should be given to the table gratis, if you're going to give something so small.

Deviled eggs - Wow, the presentation was beautiful I felt like Gordon Ramsey must have perfectly placed and spaced the eggs on the plate. And the four of us, now totally stuffed from our half a handful of popcorn stare down at three deviled eggs. Good thing Maria was on a diet, of else we'd have to arm wrestle for who got the eggs.

Drinks - not the worse priced, not the best. Problem was our waiter didn't seem to have a Fing clue about their unique lineup of beers. I asked for something light and summery - to which he suggest a "summer shandy."

Assuming this summer shandy was the same as every other summer shandy I've had (beer mixed with lemonade), I agreed to try it on the waiter's "It's amazing"

What I was given haunts me in my dreams. A oddly shaped beer glass was delivered with a light, almost water color and a GIANT FREAKING CUCUMBER stuck in it. 

Was I supposed to put this on my eyes? The drink smelled like a combination of facial moisturizer and salad ... both appealing combos in a drink.

That's about when my friend found the drink in their table top menu and pointed out the $10 price tag and list of liquor. This was NOT a normal summer shandy and the waiter should have told me and either pointed to it in the menu and listed the price. Granted, $10 isn't horrible, but what if I was watching my money?  When someone is trying to spend my money to raise his bill and tip, be honest with me or I'll slam your tip and warn others to be wary of the wait staff at the Blue Hound.

So bottom line ... I think this place is worth a visit, but given my experience, I will not be returning on any regular basis.Was looking forward to authentic menudo ... it was disappointing - flavorless!  Really bland!  Not even the extra spices and salt helped.  It was like eating boiled tripe.  blech. And their super nachos?  They didn't use real cheese. Looked & tasted like velveeta!  We left and ate somewhere else. Wasted $$One thing i left out. House keeping WILL ENTER your room no matter what. Even if you have privacy do not enter they will. We left our Tv on Saturday and came back to it being shut off. We then noticed a piece of paper left that said house keeping comes in for a safety check. F U HOLIDAY INN!! Your people are corrupt and i am sure they are in cahoots with the thieves!You have to love tow-n-impound places. I'm not sure if my HOA started hating me but I've had to deal with this place twice now, about 14 days apart.

While they seem fairly nice, they aren't so nice to your wallet. Their hours are squarely at times when you are working, meanining that when you call them "after hours" they will charge you extra to bring someone "off-duty" to get your car out. What a racket.

When I was there the second time someone else had their car towed by Monster as well, only they said Monster just picked their car up in a legal parking spot and hauled it off and never told anyone. While I can't say whether the car was parked legally or not I can say that taking someone's car and telling nobody (mainly the police in this case) seems wrong. To me, that seems like vehicular ransom. The first time they towed at my place I called the police and the police had no record of it being towed. The police called back and said Monster had informed them they were in posession of the car. The second time I didn't call the police so I don't know if they ever informed the police (I already knew who took it so I called them first). I wouldn't doubt if they were into that type of thing honestly.

2-stars for being fairly nice. And 1-star if I could confirm that they were into car-ransom schemes.I REALLY wish there were reviews for 1NS from last year. Unfortunately (like the 10+ people who wrote reviews), I feel COMPLETELY ripped off, with the WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER. 

I would NEVER use 1NS group EVER AGAIN!!!!!! 

All the details that others provided are real and legit. The customer service is good ONLY up to the point that you buy them. It says that refunds are available if you contact them before EDC for bus shuttles only, but no one responds. 

If you're going to take a shuttle, highly recommend the OFFICIAL insomniac one. Yes, maybe the lines will be long too (but honestly, it's impossible to beat traffic unless you go early and leave early), but at least you know that it's reliable and will be running all night.

PS. I love that they don't post their NUMBERS for anything so that you can never contact them and emails are easy to delete...this place was a real dump  thus it closedI use dry cleaners quite frequently, spending roughly $80+ per month on dry cleaning.  My wife had been wanting to try the Tide dry cleaners so I let her take them there so we could get a feel for how good of a job they would do.  We took 5 dress shirts, 6 polo shirts and 3 pairs of slacks.  When taking the polo shirts out of the plastic, I noticed that they looked a little faded, but what struck me the most was the smell.  I can only describe it as a synthetic body odor.  It made me clinch when smelling it because it was so bad.  I took my dress shirts out of the plastic and found that they too had the same smell and they were not starched.  I pulled the slacks out of the plastic and they too smelled, but not as pungent as the polo shirts.  I couldn't wear these close because of the smell and the dress shirts wrinkled immediately without starch.  I decided to take the cloths back to the Tide dry cleaners and I spoke to the manager about my issues.  She told me that she couldn't smell anything bad about the shirts and that it was probably a fragrance added to the dry cleaning solution.  They added that horrific smell?  She told me that she would "try" to rewash them without the added fragrance.  No thanks.  She also told me that there was nothing that they could do about the starch because we needed to request it when we dropped them off.  That sounds like a cop out to me.  I would NEVER take any of my clothes back to this dry cleaner again!I had heard nothing but good things about this place so I was more than a little disappointed when we tried it. I had the pork dish which promised to be full of flavor. Far from it, it didn't even have salt. It was extremely bland & boring to say the least. The hubby had the beef tacos which tasted more like pot roast than Mexican food. Maybe the chef at the Phoenix location gets it right. This one surely doesn't. By far the worst food ever. I gave it 1 star because the waiter was great.The owner/manager of this so called Spa is awful, lacks basic customer service skills.  Cares only about the money, and if you dont become a member treats you like crap.  Even after meeting me MANY times, acts as if she has seen me for the first time when I come in.  Cancelled my membership, this is just another Massage Envy but WORSE.
Some of the front desk staff are very nice, too bad the manager is NOT.AKWARD. Really disappointed by the service. We were ignored, skipped, helped, ignored, skipped, and then the people before us were about to be rung up and we had to interupt them to remind them they were ignoring us again because we'd be sitting at cash for 5 minutes while they worked to help their friends. There was one guest ahead of us and one behind, and all of this took 1/2 hour. WHAT?? We weren't acknowledged when we entered the store but the people after us were- all three employees were catching up with them because they were obviously friends. It was REALLY bad. . . so embarrassing. The cookie sandwich was great but our guest experience was really a bummer.I'm giving this company a zero, because Scott the guy I spoke on the phone with was a complete zero. I set an appointment on Monday morning for Thursday at  8:30. I received a call at 4:00 on Wednesday afternoon and was informed they were changing my appoint to 11 am-12. My problem property is a rental and I couldn't arrange for later in the day.So Scott just canceled my appointment and told me to find another company. Did I say Scott was very condescending!!!I brought my car to Allen's because my headlights stopped working. They were very nice and got my car in quickly. They gave me a quote of $631 for a replacement headlight dimmer switch. After the initial sticker shock, I decide to research the part myself. I found the part online for $199 when Allen's was charging $460. When I called and questioned them about it, they said that is what NAPA quoted them. Sooooo, I called NAPA. The price they gave me was $350 (still $110 less than Allen's told me). I decided to order the part and change it myself. I feel like they were trying to get more money out of me unfairly. My quote from them has an "other charge" of $20 on top of the part from NAPA being marked up $110. I'm sad and disappointed that they tried to scam me out of money. I can't comment on the quality of their work as I decided not to go use their services. All I can comment on is that I feel as though they were dishonest in their part price quote. I will not be using or referring Allen's in the future.My favorite bar and grill in Surprise! Absolutely love the staff! Food is very good! Love the blackened chicken sliders! Oh and love places that give you peanuts and you throw the shells on the floor. Very nice patio!

Loved this place and was a regular here. Now they suddenly close and give no explanation. They removed themselves from Facebook where they could have posted a reason so regulars like us were not wondering why. Business always seemed good too. Thanks for nothin uncle bears!You know that little voice in your head that says not to go down that alley or drink that last drink? I was feeling that when booking for this show, but I thought, "Hey, it's Michael's music, I can do that." 

Boy, was I wrong.

Any time that you are seeing an impersonator, you have to remind yourself that they will never be as good as the original. Good, maybe even mediocre, and most of the times just god awful. This falls into the category of sheer fuckery, almost comical, and a bit sad. 

If you're playing Michael Jackson, you have to have the chops to not only sing, but dance as well. I felt that I was at a Happy Hour Karaoke, the dude's voice annoyed the heck out of me and he also forgot the lyrics most of the time! The mic went out at some times too. I found myself completely ignoring him and focusing my attention on the dancers and the musicians--that itself tells you it wasn't worth the price!!

As much as I was glad it was over, it was only an hour! Really?? I hated that the switching from song to song was so fast, it didn't give enough time to let the moment simmer, so to speak. It was like a game of how quickly I could get through the songs. SMH.

The audience seemed amused. Some people really go into it, so what do I know. The place is circular with seats, plus a bar that charges ridiculously for their drinks. Meh. 

Do yourself a favor, save your money and go see MJONE at Mandalay Bay.My car had trouble starting yesterday morning. I knew my battery must be going bad. I dropped my kids off to school and went to O'Reilly's to have them check my battery. (Since it should still be under warranty) For 8AM they were busy. I waited and finally an older man said he would test my battery. He asked me to start my car. It started up fine.  He tells me that there is nothing wrong with my battery. But will check it anyway.  I turn my car off and he hooks up his little device.  He tells me that my battery is 30% low and that I need to charge my battery. He said that my battery has a lot of life in it still.  He told me to come back this afternoon and he will charge it for me. He then told me that my alternator was bad and it wasn't the battery. He only checked to see if my battery was bad nothing was checked about the alternator. I leave and run some errands. I stopped to get gas and went to start my car up and it wouldn't turn over. AAA came out and with the same little device told me that my battery has a bad cell.  Printed off the report so I can prove to O'Reilly's that it is the battery. AAA jumped my car and off I went to another O'Reilly's they checked my battery and Alternator. He told me that my Alternator was good but I had a bad cell. I explained to him that I went to the 59th Ave store and they told me that nothing is wrong with the battery. Gary at the Lake Pleasant store told me that I should call the store and let them know that their machine might be broken since I did have a bad battery.

Called asked to speak to a manager. Spoke with Jess who I told him first off that I wasn't calling to complain but, I wanted them to be aware that their battery test machine might be broken. I also told him that the older man told me that my alternator was bad. I also check with my mechanic and he told me that I would know if it was my Alternator.  Told him the story and he proceeded to tell me that he was  a certified mechanic and me and my Mechanic didn't know what we were talking about. He got really defensive. I told him that I was just call to have them check their machine not to start anything. He then was completely rude. I told him that I will go to a different store instead of the 59th Ave. store.  He then hung up on me......

I had always bought my batteries and other car needs at their store. Not anymore.Like other reviewers, I really wanted to like Rusconi's. The chef/owner is makes an effort to greet customers. The same can't be said, however, about some of his staff. My husband and I tried the restaurant on several occasions. We want a non-chain restaurant to succeed in this location. We've experienced lapses in service and the food has been unmemorable. A particular visit particularly stands out. We brought our family to Rusconi's for lunch. The bartender acted very disinterested. We sat for 15 minutes without being offered water or drinks. When he did bring our food order, the food must have been sitting for awhile. The fries with the burgers were cold, the bartender/waiter had mixed up two of the orders, and then there was the posole. The posole resembled dirty dishwater. There was literally one piece of posole floating in the broth. When we asked our waiter to split the checks, he sighed and said it was a "big deal" for him to do so. Needless to say, we won't be back nor will any members of our party.I reserved a car for 8:30 am friday the night before. When I came to Enterprise to pick up my car at 9:15am, they said that the car was just having an oil change and it was going to be on its way soon. The car never came. They kept on telling me that the car was coming and I didn't have a ride so I couldn't leave. I asked if they could drop me off so they did.  They picked me up at 11am and gave me a 10%discount but didn't think it was worth it. I will never rent a car from them ever again. They wasted my time!This buffet sucked! You'd be better off going to Hometown Buffet. The Rio and Mirage buffets are still far better than this dive. The design and atmosphere is simplistic and strange.  They could have made this place much more Romanequese. It may have been named after a Roman God but the food and atmosphere wasn't even good enough for mere mortals like us.I think this is not a new buffet in town!! I just went there on Thanksgiving day, which is not the first Thanksgiving day. OMG I have to wait for 5 hours to be seated. Unprofessional management, there are a lot of table empty but no one clean it, so there are only 70% can provide to customers. 30% left unattended. 

They charge for $10.- extra for Thanksgiving but no sign posted. 

There have only 2 staffs working for almost 500 customers. Those 2 staffs served only their "DIAMOND" guest. The rest, just keep waiting, they don't care!!! 

When I complain to one of their staff, she complain to manager, who standing and do nothing, I just got bluffs back that he will kick me out from the hotel!!! WTF 

He treated his staff better than his customers.

The food is great!! but I lost my appertise already.One of the worst customer service I have experienced along with crappy cheap furniture. Bought entire living room, three bed rooms and bar stools. Had problem with the stools, took it back and the store blamed me for the problem. CUSTOMERS BE ALERTED THESE PEOPLE DON'T WANT REPEAT CYSTOMERS.Had heard nothing except rave reviews on this place, so decided to check it out.  BIG MISTAKE!  Over priced for the quality.  Mixed "Vegtables" on menu... not vegtables.  Was a veggie.  And if you have a coal burning oven, why would I get some nasty snap peas!  Grilled peppers, squash, eggplant seems to be a much better idea.  I went in the next day to complain and was spoken to by a bartender who spoke extremely dissrepectful to me and never offered to even get a manager.  This place won't last with a $6 burger at Flemmings that KILLS the quality and experience!  Too bad!The Grind on Hayden is a disappointing facsimile of the Grind in Arcadia. In Arcadia, my experiences with the Sweet and Spicy burger, peppercorn burger, and mesquite wings were extraordinary. In the Hayden Grind this afternoon, mediocrity reigned as the barbeque burger lacked any essence of barbeque sauce, which was overwhelmed by the bland mozzarella cheese. The mesquite wings which Arcadia served plain were cooked less skillfully @ Hayden and covered with some superfluous orange-colored sauce. The onion rings were pretty good. The beer selection in both places is very good. I thought I had scored big when I purchased a groupon for the grind. Apparently, not so much. I'll drive to camelback next time.It smelled awesome walking in, so we were really optimistic at the start of our dining experience.  The food was very disappointing.  The catfish was the toughest fish I have ever tried to eat.  The thinner parts of the it were so hard I could not eat at all.  The fried chicken was super dry.  I dont know why they served it to us because it was visibly overcooked.  The marshmallows that I'm assuming were meant for the sweet potatoes were melted on the bun for my catfish sandwich.  The gentleman behind the counter was friendly but nothing was brought to our table.  Which seemed a little strange considering I need to use a cane to walk and I was there with an elderly parent- so to have us keep getting up to come to the counter to get the sodas he forgot to give us, then the chicken which came out later, then sauces.  We took our leftovers with us (which there were a lot of) but we just threw it away somewhere else because we were embarassed that none of us liked it and felt bad throwing it all away in front of them.  Seeing all the good reviews on here I might go try it again.  I really like to support locally owned business.  But it was really bad food even though we wanted to like it.The reason why I only star because I came there once to have the rusticity chicken and it was okay even though that it wasn't on "Brazza" the sauces were not right than I came last Saturday to have the paella and I went to Peru once and lived there for three months so I know a little about their Cousine but what I had it wasn't nothing even close I understand that Wisconsin's not the best place for seafood but at least  I had tasted better paellas.. Poor service ,Poor quality, and worthless.used to love this place...they changed the crab they used...which is more like a crab stick...makes the roll taste dry and flavorless. got a shrimp tempura roll not even sure if Shrimp was in it. will not return....Ordered burger and grilled cheese. Fries and drink with both sandwiches. $26 ticket!!!!!  Not going there again.One good flavor out of the ones "available" to test. I think it's stupid how its a juice company and yet you can't try all the flavors they sell, only a certain few. Second if you live in Vegas and are willing to drive to the actual location you can't use the discount code they offer to their online people. They'd rather you spend the money on shipping than give u a discount for actually going there. THIS IS STUPID. Nothing against the place I think it's great but offer discounts to customers who actually show up at your door and not just online orders.Is this place ever open?!  I've gone twice in the past month during their supposed business hours, and it hasn't been open.  What a waste of a drive!  I'll update my review when/if I finally get to try it.THE ABSOLUTE WORST burger I have ever had! The meat patty was so thin I almost missed it. American cheese IS NOT REAL CHEESE and who puts thousand island dressing on anything these days.  All in all just 100% AWFUL. NEVER EVER Again.So my mom and I went here to get pedicures together. We didn't mind we had to wait a few minutes so we could get them done at the same time. Half way through, my mom's technician gets up and goes to wax other clients who walked in after us. This tech was gone for at least 10 minutes while we waited. Unacceptable service. We'll take our business else where from now on.Horrible service. We walked in when it was empty to order food to go for work and it took 10 mins for anyone to even notice us. After reading the great reviews I though the food sounds like its worth the wait. When I got to my job our pho had none of the chicken or meat that we ordered so we only had the noodles and broth. I immediately called back and explained that I couldn't come back at the moment but what their procedures were for this. The guy told me that they were busy so to come the next morning and they would refund me. So I went and the owner Annie went completely crazy shushing me out saying that the guy who answered the phone didn't know what he was talking about and saying she didn't care what he said that she's in charge and she can't help us. I'm always very understanding but the manager clearly doesn't care about her guests.went in to replace radiator for my corvette.  The mechanic was totaly incompetant. mechanic had to disconnect transmission cooler lines, but could not figure out how to refill transmission fluid, or check it. mechanic said it is ok to lose transmission fluid. (about a quart was spilled on floor.)Mechanic installed wrong coolant. I insisted they install dexcool, as per mfr's strict guidelines.  After getting car home, i inspected for leaks, and found that several coolant hose clamps were not tightened at all, airflow baffles were not re-installed but were in the front bumper, fan shroud retaining parts were not installed, air cleaner not installed right, and a 103 dollar plastic air filter retaining clamp was broken in half. 
   I also discovered that transmission cooler lines were now leaking at the radiator connection. (not installed correctly.) When mechanic installed the correct coolant, he mixed it himself with 50% tap water. Now I need to flush the sytem myself, and install a premixed 50/50 dexcool mixture of coolant, or risk engine damage. 
 The managers are friendly and seem to care, but the mechanics are total morons and a$$ clowns. I complained to customer service, and a diistrict manager ordered the manager to refund the total repair, and buy me a new plastic air filter clamp. I still had to take my car to another shop to repair the transmission cooler connectors, and properly check the transmission fluid. (complicated procedure on corvette involving car on lift, engine running, and removing drain plug, and injecting fluid with hand pump.) I would not trust firestone mechanics to work on my lawnmower, let alone my corvette. take my advice, and stay away from these idiots, if you want youre car fixed right. Sure the managers are friendly, but the mechanics are worthless. 
  This shop has only recently opened. Makes me wonder how these guys lost their last jobs, before they came to firestone. I wonder how many customer cars they screwed up at last job to get fired, then go to firestone.I would give this company negative stars if I could. I called in the day before to make sure that JMLTSS had received a payment because I could not remember if I had paid them or not. They told me to come in the next day to see if they had it on record in the computer. It turns out they did not have a record of my payment, but they let me take the first half of the class up until lunch break.  I was told that during lunch break I could try and get a money order. During lunch I told them that I did not have cash on me for a money order and the only thing I had was credit and this is when Jennifer, their front desk person started becoming extremely unprofessional and displaying a ghetto attitude with me because she thought I was trying to get out of paying for the class. She suggested that I even incur fees with my bank trying to take out money via credit card  to pay for a money order. After going back and forth with them about not thinking that a cc could be used to get a money order, I reluctantly went to the Fry's down the street to try to get a money order.I came back upset because sure enough, Fry's would not a take credit card payment for a money order.This was the last day that I had to take my traffic survival school class before my license would be suspended and I was desperate to work out a solution with them even though they were being unreasonable. Jennifer ended up running my credit card through Paypal and I was told I could sit in for the other half of the class. Ten minutes later they told me that they would not accept my payment because Paypal would take two days to go through and they made me leave. They told me they would give me half credit for the class, but at this point I had already made the decision to not go back and find another tss school since my license would be suspended anyway. This is by far the worst experience I have ever had with a company and I am by no means a confrontational person. I felt that I got taken advantage of and I am shocked that these people run a business like this. I took accountability for my actions, but customers should not be treated like this in any way. I still remember Jennifer shaking her head from side to side and raising her voice at me when I was trying to work out a payment method with her. It is my impression that Jennifer made me go through all that fully aware that I would not be able to give her a cash payment that day and that she simply wanted to seek give me the run around.  Horrible experience!!

About a week later my boyfriend drover me all the way to Stop and Go traffic survival school in Gilbert so that I could take the class again. The instructor was friendly and I was finally able to get my ticket  taken care of. 

Later on I had to dispute the credit card charge that Just My Luck did  through Paypal and I was able to get a refund. Jennifer never acknowledged that she ever kicked me out of class . I had to prove that she never paid me the $60.00 back, and after looking through her records she found out that this was true. I threated to go to the Better Business Bureau to report her if she did not refund my money and she eventually paid me back by check through the mail. 

Till this day I will not go back to Just My Luck Traffic Survival school.I highly recommend going elsewhere to fulfill your driving school or traffic survival school requirements.Was not happy about this place. Very disappointing. The restaurant that was there before was a lot better. Both dishes that we ordered did not taste very well. The guacamole was terrible! No flavor at all. Most likely never coming back.Very disappointing place. Went there since it was close to my house but as soon as I got there a post-it with "back in 15min" was on the door. There was no telling how long the person was already out for. So very disappointed for a place to have an open sign and not be open. Will not go again.This is the second Gordon Ramsey place I've tried and I can honestly say he's the most overrated celebrity chef. A few years back had drinks and food at LONDON in NYC and it was like, meh. Nothing special, just ok and a little disappointing. Shrugged it off and just resigned myself to the idea that it was better to watch him on TV than to actually go to one of his places....then Vegas happened. 

It was late and BurGR was almost the only place open so why not. The place looked great-nice, clean, and modern. Hostess was friendly and our server was really nice. Menu looked interesting and enticing so it seemed like there was hope. 

I know it's a burger place (hence the name - duh!) but the hot dogs looked really good so I decided to order one. Bad idea. It took a little long for the food to come out but that's ok. We were in no rush and our server was friendly. Finally our food came and it looked amazing. My plate was huge, looked great and then I took a bite. It was the worst bite of food I've ever had. It was super salty. I mean SUPER SUPER salty. So salty that I almost spit it out like the restaurant's namesake does on TV. I thought it was me so I took another bite and it was confirmed. BLEH....!

I'm not one to complain to a waiter, have food redone or replaced. When the waiter came and asked how everything was my friend insisted I say something so I did. Our server was apologetic and kind. He offered something else and insisted I pick something else. By then I was so turned off I would of honestly preferred a return but graciously accepted a hamburger. He took it away and apologized and told me I was not the first person to complain and that the kitchen was working on the recipe. Really?!? Not the only person to say this and the kitchen is working on this....really?!? (My guess is that they have the hot dogs custom made for the restaurant.) Sorry, with a big name associated with this place I'd think this would of been fixed BEFORE you even opened the doors.  

Burger came, was decent but by then my taste buds were so blasted by the salty dog it was pointless. (BTW: If you're ever in NY Shake Shack is the place for a good old fashion juicy burger.)

If you go get the burger, forget the hot dogs until they've improved the recipe.The only reason there is one star is because I can't give less - that and the Manager, Benji.

Started out with a 45 minute wait when there were open tables. Seated, waited 20 minutes before the server arrived to take our order. Watched another server scratching her hair / head. She did NOT go and wash her hands. Ordered. Thirty minutes later still waiting for food. Thus far, I am unimpressed.  (Had dinner the other night at Chef Ramsay's Pub at Caesar's Palace. The food was extremely good and the service was friendly, efficient and very well executed).  Food finally arrived after complaining to the useless waitress.  The server that had been scratching her head brought the food.  My burger was overcooked and luke warm.  My husband's burger was cold and overcooked.  The only reason the fries were hot on the top was because they'd been under the heat lamp for heaven knows how long!  We asked for ketchup - never showed up.  We spoke with the Manger Benji - very nice man - who freely admitted that the daytime service at BurGR is awful.  He invited us to return the next time we're in Vegas which we will do but certainly not with the same anticipation. 

 Looking around there were more tables waiting for their food than tables eating.  There are orders stacked up under the lamps waiting. I haven't seen our server even bring out one order yet.

After such hoopla and anticipation over BurGR I am so dissapointed.  The food was horrible - certainly not worth the price tag or the hullabaloo.  I really like Chef Ramsey's other restaurants - I just hope that he finds out what a travesty BurGR is truly.  It is EVERYTHING that he preaches against:  awful service, awful food and, as far as the wait staff goes, a complete lack of regard for the patron.  I actually saw one of the patrons tip the busboy because he was more helpful than the server.Loved the incredible music and talented singers.  Hated the frequent sexual innuendos and overt sexual references (including a couple "doing it" in a bathroom stall).   Too much crude humor and playing to the lowest common denominator  This overshadowed for me what could have been an awesome trip down my own 80's memory lane.   Was embarrassed that I took my wife to see this, and we left at intermission.Came by last night with my boyfriend, and as usual the employees have closed up shop by 9:30 (although the restaurant is open until ten) and so we decided to try the drive thru. Big mistake. It's now 11:43 the following day and he's currently lying here off work, ill in front of me. It was within an hour of eating but half the meal, that he was vomiting, and didn't sleep at all throughout the night. Wish these stars could go negative. Beyond the unprofessional and completely lazy staff, THE FOOD iS NOT BEING KEPT AT TEMP! PEOPLE ARE GETTING SICK! BEWARE! 

And to the night staff of this establishment - you should be reprimanded or fired for your carelessness. He's pointed out after reading the recent reviews that he's not the first to get sick for your simple minded laziness and low self standards.I wish there was a rating below 1 Star.

One word describes this hote....DISGUSTING.

It is gross, filthy, dirty, HORRIBLE.  From the staff to the rooms, elevators, everything is gross.  The only thing good there is Hash House and that is really not the hotel that is a chain of restaurants.

The rooms are disgustingly dirty.  Ceasars, Harrahs, every hotel associated with the Quad should be ashamed.  If you are going to have a shit hole hotel, wait until you fix it up before you open it.  This place is as creepy and dirty as it gets.  The elevators take FOREVER, there is always bottles or wet stains in them, the doors typically don't close either.

I tried to call the front desk multiple times but they don't pick up their phones, there is always a 45 minute line to check in, even at 1am.  They just really don't give a shit, plain and simple.

And if it's Friday or Saturday, just drive to Harrah's and park, the parking lot will always be full at the Quad.

On second thought DONT STAY HERE!  Stay at Treasure Island across the street and have a REAL Las Vegas experience.I was checking prices for cheap hotels on Expedia.  I came across this hotel for very cheap during the week.  It was a MAZE to the parking garage from Las Vegas Blvd!  I'm surprised that I found a spot.  Hopefully I will remember where the car is parked.  I'm scared about that.  I know what level I am on, but I took like 3 different elevators to check in.  

The hotel is under construction.  The line was very long (Late at night).  Hour later I finally was served.  The lady said that there is a $11.00 "Resort Fee".  I'm like, WHAT?!?!  Resort Fee?!  When's my Tee time?!  She giggled.  I said that I wasn't aware of that fee.

I was tired, so I paid it and was going to leave a poor review on Expedia.  I sign in and I coudn't leave feedback on Expedia!  I kept following the links to leave feedback.  The only feedback I could leave was for Expedia themselves (Which I did).  Too bad they got the brunt of my poor attitude.  They received 1 star, and I will not be using them again.  Soooo many places that can get me a deal!

So....  I would read the fine print first!  Their so-called "Resort Fee" is going up to $15.00/night August 1, 2013.

The room is mediocre.  I stayed in Tower 5.  It's an older hotel, so it's not fancy like the Cosmo (Killer place!).

If you want to find a cheap hotel (So you have more $$$ for gambling/etc), you won't save much here!!  They mask it up so you 'think' you are saving.This place is a friggin joke. I live here too. Old rooms , it's so convoluted. It's amazing they didn't knock the whole thing down and start over!! Good luck with the following: parking, the room, construction.  Even for the cheap price there's better options out there.  I asked the front clerk.  It's about a 2 year project to be done.  GOOD LUCK SUCKERS !!Being a newly opened place i figured it would be pretty good, wrong!  We went on fathers day evening and were one of maybe 5 people in the whole place.  we got our food quick which was great, however being that they were not busy there should have been no rush to get it out to us and it was obvious it was rushed.  My daughters chicken fingers looked dried out and kinda gross but being 3 she didn't care.  My husbands eggs were cooked on way to high heat and had a gross crispiness sunny side up eggs shouldn't have and my soup of the day- which our waitress didn't even know what the days soup was- tasted worse then hospital food and the veggies in it were still a bit crunchy...  I left still hungry due to not wanting to finish what i ordered.  I usually love Ihop, but wow, Dennys it is next time!!!I plan to visit New York one day, but if this is an example of their food I'll skip it. We ordered a pizza and wings. The pizza tasted like deep fried cardboard with Chef Boy R De De sauce on it. Bland does not come close. Imagine if you took three day old dried bread and put a dusting of ketchup as a topping. 

Wings! Oh my sweet goodness, the Wings!! Take a plain wing. Cook it in its own fat, then drench it in vinegar. Serve. Run before anyone tastes it. There you go. 

Worth skipping. I'm not a Dominos fan, but I'll take one of their industrial pre-fab pies over this place any day of the week. 

Off to go brush this experience off my taste buds with a turpentine/Lysol mixture. Argh!!!Went there the 2nd week it was open and it was beyond bad.

I figured I would give it a 2nd shot but sadly they need to close this hole down.

Food is over-priced and poor quality, staff has a "we don't care" attitude and the management seems to think they are all gods who are there for you to worship and not help the customer.

Why do people post good reviews about this place and rave how great it is when it is pathetic..

Wake up people you are getting ripped off by this waste of space...Where do I start? Well to be clear, I never actually ate here...unless you count my stomach eating itself from utter and total starvation! 

Coming all the way to Matts was a stretch for us, living on the west side and having a breakfast place we already love. But...we had heard great things and wanted to check it out. MISTAKE one. 

We called and were told there wasn't much of a wait. We arrived and were told it should be pretty quick. I think that's the point where they realized we had kids. This place HATES kids. MISTAKE two.

We waited for 90 minutes! We watched parties come after us, get seated and leave while we were waiting outside. And these were parties of ALL sizes. They even LIED to us and said we were next and sat a party of the exact same size that arrived 20 minutes after us. 

We left and went around the corner to the Phoenix Public Market. I doubt that the food here could be good enough to put up with their complete and total bullshit.This only applies to their pho. It's basically hot water, meat, and noodles. There is no flavor whatsoever.called in ahead of time to let them know we had a large group coming in.  few of us get there, I let them know we have more on the way and would like to be outside.  The bar tender was too busy being bothered by us customers to care.  He was pretty much rude to us right from the get go.  we order 2 drinks, gives them too us in plastic cups, my friends ordered after me and all got glass drink ware.  other than the bartender, no one cared that we were in the outside patio, ever came out to check if we wanted food.  After one round of drinks we were annoyed enough to move our party across the street to the bar and bistro.HORRIBLE!!! DO NOT GO HERE!!

They have definitely gone downhill from mid year last year. They now make you pay upfront for your meal rather than later like they used to.
They still have the hibachi grill & pho.
The service area was messy and my wife had calamari which was not breaded and cold! The hot & sour soup tasted like it has been there awhile. The meat and chicken were way over cooked ( at least they weren't raw). The damage for this torture was $6.99 per lunch NOT including drinks. Will NOT be coming backMy son ordered the Sweet and Sour Chicken along with the Shrimp Fried Rice, which he enjoyed.  My husband was not impressed with the Broccoli Beef.  While I ordered the Hot and Sour Soup and the Hot and Spicy Lamb.  The Hot and Sour Soup was mediocre I've had much better and the Hot and Spicy Lamb was extremely greasy.  
The quality of the meals is not what will keep up us from coming back.  It was the fact that as we were waiting for our check my son noticed a cockroach next to my husband's shoe on the floor. Which brought our attention to the reminder of the dining room floor and we saw another one.  Totally gross!!This place is terrible.  The first time I went they couldn't do what I wanted.  Said it was company policy - ok, fine, not a big deal.  I wouldn't hold that against them but the employee I talked to wasn't particularly friendly.

I went in yesterday to get a battery replaced.  I walked in at the same time as a family that had apparently already been in for service and came back to complain about something not working.  We waited a good 5 minutes before anyone came in to help us.  

After they were finally dealt with he came back to see what I needed.  Told me it would be at least 15 before he could help me but checked to see if they had my battery.  He went back outside to finish what he was doing without taking any of my info.  

There were other people in the waiting area so I ended up having to sit under the TV.  I don't know what show they had on but it was Kyra Sedgwick repeatedly screaming and calling some woman a bitch in a terrible southern accent.  During my time sitting there people with kids were coming and going through the lobby, and I couldn't help but wonder why they thought it was appropriate to have this on.   I would have asked someone to change the channel but everyone was outside working on cars.  Don't get me wrong - I don't have delicate ears - but there are some things a responsible business just doesn't do.

The rest of the time was spent listening to the phone ringing incessantly, because, like I mentioned, everyone was outside.  

I brought a book to read while I waited but between Kyra screaming and the phone ringing there would be no reading.  Instead I used my time to Yelp another nearby location with higher ratings.  I found one closer to my house and walked out.

I won't come back.I must be really spoiled by the Wynn & Encore and regret not staying there. 
Upon arriving to the Nobu hotel, there wasn't any bell staff to help with your luggage and when you travel with kids there is plenty of it. After wheeling my luggage through the casino we came to the Nobu check-in - no lobby area, no chair to sit NOTHING remotely welcoming. The elevator was having issues so we had to have the desk people call the elevator with their keys every time we wanted to go up to our rooms. The rooms are cheap and über simple, no electronic drapes, no TV in the bathroom, NO BATHTUB (really sucks if you have kids to bathe), no shower door or even shower curtain (really bad if you're trying to fix your hair while someone is in the shower, steam flattens hair), shower water pressure was HORRIBLE, no double sink in the bathroom, poor drawer space for clothing, THIS PLACE SUCKS, will most likely go under really soon!Good beer and that's just about the only good thingThere are so many things that displeased me with the Hard Rock Hotel. My friends and I thought we got a great deal here because it was 30% off for summer nights or whatever. Sadly, it does not even throw off the hidden fees that get tacked onto your bill. 

The rooms were okay, but the shower was freaking short. I'm 5 ft 2 inches and I was able to reach the top of the ceiling, how is anyone that is super tall able to shower?! 

Anyways, there was a security deposit fee that is non-refundable that is $30. On top of that we didn't notice that there is a $15.00 resort fee that is tacked on to the overall price when you check-out. It came out to like $16.80 with tax each day for this service. The resort fee "covers 2 complimentary rock spa gym passes per registered guest per day, strip shuttle service 10am-6pm 7 days a week, free local and long distances phone calls within the contiguous 48 states valet parking is complimentary and available at all times to hotel guests." 

The only thing that bugs me about this service is that we had to PAY for complimentary services, seriously, WHAT THE FUCK. They don't even mention this at all and leave a tiny card as a little disclaimer where your card keys all. 

Another thing that baffles me is how Hard Rock Hotel's website shows pools that are all lit up and pretty at night. Thing is.. they close off the pool the moment it hits sunset. 

The last final thing that bugged me was that we did get minibar charges and we didn't touch anything at all, my friends and I made sure we weren't even close to the censors, but somehow we still got charged. At least, reception was able to clear that up right away. 

The only good thing was the one worker that opened the door for us while we were leaving. I guess that was the only good service about it and that's probably because he saw how angry we were and how we wanted to get out fast. 

Don't even come near this place when you're considering VEGAS. it's not even near the strip at all. :( You will get ripped off for staying at the Hard Rock, STAY AWAY FROM HERE!The worst hotel I have ever stayed in the States! Avoid this hotel if possible. They have all kinds of hidden fee and charge. Extremely disappointed and unsatisfied!! If I can I will rate it as -5.Wasted an hour of my time  on a beautiful Sunday at Otro. The service was the worst I have had in a very,very long time , repeatedly asked for chips before they arrived and waited 40 minutes for our lunch. Unfortunately  the food was not edible and  we had no silverware .In retrospect they may have been trying to discourage us from eating the awfull meal.I ordered heuvos rancheros and my mouth tastes like charcoal  2 hours later. How do you butcher eggs and beans?The real issue is lack off emphasis on timely service.I can tolerate imperfect food (awfull) if I think the staff cares.I don't understand how this place got the reviews it did, maybe friends and family. It's just another below average mexican restaurant. Same old beans covered with jack cheese, converted rice cooked with tomato paste and canned salsa. The tamales had little filling and the masa wasn't cooked. Look I'm not gonna criticize everything. If your idea of mexican food is cheap canned product covered with cheese and "red or green" sauce this is the ideal place.Horrible horrible.

Came here Saturday night to see Tiesto, but ended up leaving at 1 when being so fed up with crowds and "security" or bouncers, whatever they're called.

Arrived at around 10:30, and went to look for prepaid line, was told it was on the other side because the line was "overflowing". Which when we get to the over flow line, was called back to the original spot we were standing in. There was one small group there ahead of us. At one point in line I overheard two of the staffers talking about some girls tramp stamp, loudly and not discreet at all. Rude. 

Inside, no real standing space. You're either on the dance floor, in a bottle service booth, or in the way. To which one staffer made it his job that night to keep telling me and my boyfriend we couldn't stand wherever we were standing. But whenever it was girls standing there, he had no problem at all.

After having enough of that guy, we headed to the jammed packed dance floor, which was probably smaller than my backyard. Everyone was shoulder to shoulder pushing and shoving.

The worst part was the things that happened on the dance floor. Two girls were so drunk out of their minds, a group of guys were passing them around taking turns making out with them while another guy took photos. Lifting the girls dresses, sticking their hands on their panties, even though the girls knew enough to keep pulling down their dresses and saying no. Practically rape. Fights nearly breaking out, people falling on the floor. Horrible.

When we finally had enough, trying to make our way out, some girl was openly lighting her bong in the hallway. Idk how that made it in but yep. 

Police, fire Marshalls etc. need to look into this place ASAP!  Horrible. 

Oh, and sister ended up leaving at 1:30, and still no Tiesto.Went with 2 other people, got seated but never had a sever come to the table.  Sat there for 30 minutes before we got up and left.  What a joke this place is! There were maybe 5 other tables occupied so it was not busy at all.  Will not be back!Very cold atmosphere. The prices are insanely outrageous. Everything they sell can be bought online for half the price. No juices on display. Just a complete rip off. Don't waste your time.Well this was are second time and I think our last.
It started  off bad and ended up bad. When a manager and a waitress had to apologize,  I counted 6 times, then there is something not cracking well at the old pecan grove restaurant.
Here are the highlights:
Were sat at a dirty table
The ice tea was not fresh even thought she said it is made every morning. 
Traded cloudy ice tea in for coffee and it tasted like it was from the early morning breakfast.
We ordered the BLT with crispy bacon and we got crispy charcoal. So I think you call that a, CLT.
I felt bad for the waitress as she kept apologizing along with one of the managers who actually was the one that sat us at a dirty table and brought us the cloudy bad tasting ice tea.
In talking to this manager about  the issues, she was apologetic with a bit of a defense  in her voice and explanations
We were offered free pieces  of pie and chose the Butterscotch which they did not have.
Went to pay and this manager was at the cash register. She was a space cadet, as she saw us walk up ready to pay and then was ready to allow another customer to go right in front of us. I had enough and had to say something, she again said for the 6th time she was sorry...............really.....really.....really
I have read other reviews on this restaurant and they had their meals comp., and was offered a piece of pie. 
We should have been comp. and give a whole pie, not Butterscotch of course.
I guess we should not fell so bad, two other tables were having issues as they were also offered free pie....................!!!!!!
They may also want to check with the smoking laws and where customers are allowed to smoke. They have a free standing ash try right outside their front door, maybe 6 feet from the front door. I think I read the law states 50 feet from any entrance. Yes, you have to walk through some ones nasty smoke and yes there were two guys standing their smoking as we walked in. Should have been my clue to turn around and get back in my car.I ordered the Swiss Mushroom Burger but since I am very particular about how my beef is cooked I asked if it could be  medium rare and she said no problem. I dont like my beef over done. If it couldnt be cooked med rare I would have ordered something else but since that was no problem I went for it.    The burger came and it was very  well done.  While everyone else at my table ate I looked around for my server to tell her.  Finally the manager noticed I was looking around and came over to see if I needed anything.  I explained that the burger was too well done.  He asked me if I wanted another one.  By this time everyone else at the table was finishing up with their food so I said no. I had already waited for so long that I didn't want another one any more.  The bill came and they charged me for the burger that I didnt eat because THEY OVER COOKED IT.   The manager was surprised that I didnt want to pay for the over cooked food.  He said that the policy was that if they didn't take the food off the table then they don't take it off the bill.  If that is the policy why didnt he take it off the table? It was not how I wanted it. It was dry and unedible ad far as I was concerned.
The server was nice, the manager was rude and unprofessional.  I would never go back to this place.  Everyone else at the table said the food was not good. The onion rings were dripping with grease.   The place was very noisy and the bathroom was filthy.  Dont waste your time.I really wish my experience at Zipps was good, (I would have even been satisfied with average) but unfortunately it was miserable! We started with chips, salsa, and guacamole. The salsa and guacamole were very bland, and the chips tasted stale. My wife ordered a chop salad with chicken. She said it was the worst salad she has ever ordered! (and she orders salad a lot!) The chicken was rubbery (like it had been cooked in the microwave) and had no flavor, just rubbery texture. About half of the lettuce was extremely soggy. (I'm guessing the salsa that came on the salad had been sitting for too long on the lettuce... yuck!) We also ordered a burger, a kids meal, and a cheese pizza (which our waitress forgot to put in the order.) We received the salad, the kids meal and my burger, and no pizza. Mistakes happen, but when they do I feel the waitstaff should do their best to compensate for their mistake. We were offered nothing. She did ask if we still wanted the pizza? Maybe she thought the two members of our party that ordered the pizza wanted to starve? I tried the pizza, I wish I wouldn't have. It tasted like a pizza you make from a kit in a box. The onion rings that came with my burger were awful! They were lukewarm, and the coating on the outside was chewy. (I have eaten quite a few onion rings in my lifetime, and I've never had an order with a chewy coating. Disgusting!) It's almost like the temp of the fryer was not hot enough, or they had been sitting for too long. My burger was fine. This experience goes down as the second worst meal I've ever had to pay for.Super annoyed.  My boyfriend and I (both under 21) have been there more than 3 times after 11 pm to eat and always had great service. This last Sunday we were sitting there at about 10:55 where we placed our order for an appetizer and drinks, then about 10 minutes later our waitress walked up and asked for our id's, to our unknown knowledge you had to be 21 after 11 pm. The manager then came over and explained to me the law and how other managers failed to enforce this, even though he was the only manager that we have ever seen there...awk. 
So they then charged my boyfriend and I for our chips and salsa which we wouldnt have ordered if we would have known!?...the whole thing was annoying.Is there a rating lower than 1 star??? 

So I decided to stop in on a whim while driving by.  Big mistake.  I walked in and went to the counter to order - had to wait for someone to actually notice me there.  The young girl told me to grab a seat as I decided to eat in.  I grabbed that seat and ordered a glass of water which she brought promptly.  Without a doubt, based on the stale dirt taste, this was unfiltered tap water.  So I look at the menu and it takes me about 1 minute to decide on the gyro... 5 minutes go by.... 10 minutes go by...   17 minutes and FINALLY I catch the attention of the girl delivering food to the only other customer's in the place.  She comes over and asks if I've ordered and proceeds to take my order.... Thank goodness it didn't take as long to get my food because I was starting to shake from hunger.  Apparently I got someone else's french fries with my order - according to the other customer in the restaurant as she was very vocal about  telling me and the server that I had her fries.  Like it's my fault and I served them to myself? It just keeps getting better.... So I dig in to my gyro... It's cold.  Everything is cold.  The meat, the pita.... ? What the hell? Then another couple comes in and they are immediately offered a basket of bread while they wait... Ummm.. I could have used the bread while I was sitting there STARVING, waiting for my order to be taken.  I had to go up front and ask for ketchup for my fries - I got handed packets.. ummm ok. Packets in a 'restaurant'.  Then as I sit down tearing open my ketchup packets she brings the other customer a bottle.  Really? 

Anyhow.. so there I am eating... while I am doing so the girl comes to my table and reaches over my plate to take two of the three empty ketchup packets off my tray.  Why? Over my food? Only 2 of them?  By this point I am just thinking "don't come near me again" over and over in my head. 

Well, she did.  Not only did she drop the bill and tell me "no rush", another girl came by and started resetting the table while I was sitting there eating!!!  CAN IT WAIT?????!!!!! I'M STILL EATING HERE!!! 

By now I'm fuming and know that this was the worst lunch decision I've made... I walk up to pay the bill and provide an adequate tip for the level of service I was given... 1.00 (Lucky to be given even that much).  As I turn to walk away the girl at the front counter decides to make a noise like a cat growl and a comment about the tip.  She's lucky I continued to walk out instead of turn around and verbally lash out at her unprofessional/rude ass.  

First and LAST time I will ever go there... and as far as recommendations... FORGET IT!My husband is from Detroit and was very excited to see an ad for this place. When we went. It was extremely hot. We asked them to turn on the air twice. We could see the temp and it was at 90 in there. They never changed the temp. It just kept getting hotter. We got the Coney Hot Dog and my husband saw that there was a loose meat sandwich on the menu and ordered it. He was so excited! While waiting, I heard the cook start chopping something on the grill. I jokingly told my husband that it was his loose meat sandwich. He said no way. Needless to say, they brought out a chopped burger patty on a hot dog bun. It was awful. My husband said that that's not how you make a loose meat sandwich, he said it was an embarrassment. Not thrilled with our experience!Whatever you do, just take the damn taxi. It's not worth the hour wait. Yes it's cheap but not worth it. Totally not worth it. 

5 minutes becomes 10, then 15, and an hour. It's those damn crooked cabbers that resorted me to this and now I'm regretting it. Crooked cab to the strip $35, normal cab fare $20, this damn slow shuttle $7.25. Pray you get a normal cab.So after seeing all of the race reviews and having driven by this little place, thought we would go see what it was all about. Upon first walking in the door you are greeted by a strong coconut smell. Not bad. And sort of expected. But strong. Then we walked up to the counter where who we can assume was the manager was arguing on the phone with someone and didn't give us a second glance. The cashier walked by us and said we would be helped in a moment. So we looked over a very undescriptive menu. To our right was another employee eating their food. To our left was the owner. When the cashier came back we told her it was our first time there and then she told us "well then wait a second" while she left to talk to the employee eating. We stood there and waited until she came back and half heatedly tried to explain the menu options, only confusing us. I wound up ordering the fish burger and my mother had the "new England clam chowder". I'll get to that in a second. So while this happened the manager is still arguing and the owner is on his laptop. So I go and get some "iced tea". Which apparently translates to "Luke warm tea". It was so nasty and left a weird taste in my mouth. I've had that brand before and always liked it. So I was surprised. All of the tables were filthy, despite the employees hanging around and the lack of any customers besides ourselves. There was trash pieces on the floor. We essentially bused our own table before we could even sit down. Then when our food finally arrived I was told that I basically ordered my food incorrectly for asking there to be no tartar sauce. Not one but two employees came to tell me so. I don't like tartar sauce. On the walls are all of these praises from varying sources! So I thought "well the food should be good!" Upon closer inspection all of the framed reviews are from their Hawaii location. Not the Scottsdale one. Seemed kind of weird to us. But oh well it's a new location, right? All of numbers are super worn and faded and the drink machines look crazy old. Well maybe they were saving money for the decor? So I take a bite of my fish burger and the bread instantly tastes chalky. The fish was alright so I ate that instead. My mom had the chowder and the coleslaw. The coleslaw was bland and gross. Just like cabbage with a cream over it. The chowder tasted like it came from a can. And it had tomatoes. Which is really weird. I was born and raised in boston. I had never seen a "new England style" chowder with tomatoes. So we picked at our food. Cleared our plates. Bused our table. Again. Then slowly made our way to the door. We were completely ignored. No one said goodbye, or even acknowledged we had been there. Bottom line: won't be going back. The establishment wasn't even slightly impressive. We talked about our concerns next to the eating employee who stared at us then walked away completely ignoring what we had said to her.I was so excited to see this revolving type sushi restaurant open up.  I love sushi and being from the Pacific Northwest, these type of sushi places are everywhere.

OMG...the worst sushi I have ever had...so sorry to have to say it.  It was warm...ick, when have you ever had warm sushi? 

Service good.  Very clean.  I hope they get the sushi to a better quality and cold!  Would love to see them make it...but it doesn't look good.Elitist Detail is more like it. If you want to give money to someone who judges you by the car you drive, this is your man. I bought a detail from living social and the customer service was pitiful to non existent from the beginning. 

On the scheduled morning of my detail, he called me around 8:30 am to ask if he could come "way" earlier than scheduled. I replied sure, just give me a call to let me know when you are on your way. I never received a call back, and he showed up an hour before the original scheduled time. Not my idea of "way" earlier.

When he arrived with his assistant, I showed him my back seat and said that I understand if they cannot vacuum up all the dog hair (my car has woven cloth seats, not ideal for a short haired dog, but I didn't know I would be rescuing a dog when I bought my car) His reply was, " Well, I don't know what you are expecting for a coupon." Really??? I'm expecting the same quality of service that you would give to anyone, regardless of whither they purchased a "coupon" or not!!!

While he and his assistant were working on my car, they were overly boisterous and so loud I could hear their conversations inside of my house.....just slightly annoying.

When they had finished working on my car, I asked Mr. Jensen how much he charges for a monthly detail, minus the engine cleaning. His response was, "It would be more financially feasible for you to just go to a car wash." What??? I just drop $100 (including a tip for the jerk)  for a half priced full detail. I chose to try mobile detailing because of the pathetic job car washes do, and the time and expense of waiting for or dropping off my car. But apparently Mr. Jensen is too good to detail my car. He quoted me $60 for a monthly detail, which is less than I've been paying at a local car wash for a crappy monthly detail.

This man is so judgmental and arrogant. Why is he offering coupons on living social if he is not looking for new customers of all income brackets?Do not go here. I actually thought the doctor was good, but the rest of the staff is so horrible it doesn't matter. I went two times the doctor was helpful, but followup and post care was a nightmare. Manny the front desk gives wrong information about needing to come in and payments. They seem to only really care when it comes to getting paid. I had no help with refills for my medication which is standard and was told I would have. The office refused to give me a standard doctors note (which my two previous doctors before moving were more than happy to help with) they refuse to let me speak with the doctor or explain my needs directly to the doctor. They lose files, don't return phone calls, and when i expressed that I did not feel helped, Lynn in a very rude way told me to go else where and hung up on me. I've never been treated by a doctors office this way before, i noticed many of their patients are elderly and hope they are not scammed. bottom line the doctor shouldn't be nice just to get your money but follow through with care. This doctor does not take any responsibility for her staff, but will take your money.The food is ok(for Mcdonalds), but the service is some of the worst I have ever received at any Mcdonalds, They are also out of everything, and I have been ignored the two times I have been in there, Horrible service.  Hopefully this is due to being a new store and they work some of this out.The worst pedicure I have ever had. Their $20 pedicure hot stone massage is a joke! When the nail tech scrubbed my food with the pumice scrubber, she completely skipped my heels! She only did the bottom of my feet which are soft and missed the most important part. When it came to the massage, all she did was briskly put lotion on my leg and squeezed my toe, there was not massaging at all! Then when it came to the hot stones, she briskly rubbed them on my foot but still, no massage! It was so fast and NOT  relaxing one bit. It was not crowded and there was only 1 person waiting for a pedicure. I was done before the woman sitting next to me who started way before I did! There were also 5 nail techs so honestly, there was no reason to rush because they were staffed an only 1 person waiting! I am not really sure what I paid for, I will never go back to this joke of a salon and suggest that if you want a relaxing experience and to actually get your moneys worth, go somewhere else.Horribly overpriced. Live right behind this place and ordered 2 shots and 2 beers and had a $23 tab (before tip). I'd understand the price if I was buying drinks at The Palazzo on the strip, but for a "bar" way off the strip?? C'mon... Furthermore, it took over 7 mins to get our shots and the bar was NOT packed at all and the shots were the smallest shots we've ever been served. At $6.00 per shot, that was a RIPOFF. And they run NO happy hour past midnight. Won't be coming back. Save your money and avoid this place, completely ripoff.Worst food ever!!! The service is terrible and the food is awful!!
We ordered the beef kebab and what we got was a dry too salty beef, 2 spoon of dry and old rice and 3 leaf of salad.  
Worst middle eastern food I ever got!This place has not been the same since it turned into 24/7. Glad my hair/nail lady moved.Devin Luzod is a scammer !!!! Never adjusted just sales pitched and shown videos .. Waste of time  and $we just ordered from here for delivery and a guy named albert messed up on our orders. when we called back to to tell them they messed up he decided to act and speak like it was our fault.. we tipped the driver good cuz it wasnt her failt and she was nice.. 

it sux we always have great service and food from them till nowYelp rarely steers me wrong, but this time it happened. I ordered take-out and was so disappointed. The hot and sour soup was neither hot nor sour. The crab puffs were some of the worst I have had, weak and soggy with no crab. The mu shu chicken lacked flavor and I honestly think they used tortillas instead of crepes (I couldn't taste any sesame oil). 

The pricing was a bit high and the place was a dump. I'll stick to China Chili in the future.If I could give Sophia Fiori negative stars, I would. Please do your research online and you will see they are SCAMMERS!!!! I wish I had....The only reason I purchased from this company was because we had a friend working for their co. She actually drove me to their warehouse where I hand picked the jewels that I wanted. Mind you, I know jewelry and I knew these were not DeBeers or Harry Winston, but they were beautiful pieces, plus I wanted to help her and let her get the commission. I should have know something was up when they didn't want to take American Express! This was the first red flag. I insisted, as this was the only card I had on me, and they accepted it. I purchased the jewels and enjoyed them, but a few months later, my friend told me that she saw the EXACT SAME bracelet I purchased for $18k on a cruise ship (SF sells on ships- another red flag), for $8k! I never had the jewels appraised, so I wasn't sure. I contacted Bernard Bachoura, who claims to be the designer who joined his family's business when he was 16. I was pretty upset, as you would imagine, well Bernard's smug, arrogant attitude did nothing to calm me down. My husband called him back and apologized, saying I was tough, but I honestly did not like the idea of my husband buying me this beautiful jewelry that was actually all a farce- because it was A COMPLETE RIP OFF. In any case, Mr. Bachoura explained that if we got an appraisal we would "see that the bracelet was worth 18k." He claimed he would "stand behind his brand". Really? My husband and I knew this was a false claim, but went and got the appraisal anyways. Guess what:  we got the bracelet appraised (by a leading jewelry co) for $8400.00. So when we sent this to Bachoura what did he do, he disputed our dispute with American Express, never return phone calls, never returned emails, and the only thing he is standing behind now is shadows. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY. THEY ARE SCAMMERS. He may give out swag to celebs to get some press, but the REAL CLIENTS PAY FOR IT WITH SUB-STANDARD PRODUCTS AND SERVICE.I went here last night with my boyfriend and we were quite disappointed. They were out of guacamole and tortilla chips, and they don't (yet?) have beer as advertised on the website. We were the only customers there the entire time and got a pretty awkward vibe from the two gentlemen working. We will not be returning.I have been dying to check out Geisha House for months because all of the rave reviews on Yelp! My expectations were somewhat higher than usual simply because of all the great reviews. Although, I had an absolutely horrible experience. The server didnt seem interested in waiting on our table. We waited a good 5-8 minutes before she greeted us. I did order some wine which I enjoyed but honestly that was the only good part of my meal. I decided to get sushi and my date ordered a meal. His meal came out within a reasonable amount of time, but we were not impressed. I ended up not getting half of my sushi. I told the server I would just go through a drive-thru and gave up after waiting for them to correct it. Our bill was $70 & I didnt even get my sushi rolls!We checked in last night, 2 adults and a small dog. The lady who helped us check in, was cold...at best. She seemed to judge us by our "driving attire", and not the money we were spending (to keep her employed). She explained that the elevators were "down the hall, and around the corner". After wandering around, and looking inside 3 elevators only to find floors 1,3 & 5...no 2nd floor. After I went back and asked the gal for directions, she apologized for her mistake, and now explained I had to go past the first couple sets if elevators prior to finding any that go down to my floor. 

After a night's sleep, we decided to go to the Casino Monte Lago we read about on the property's website. We walk up to a door with a small sign that read (to the effect of) "casino is closed, sorry for the inconvenience". 

Granted, we chose this property to be away from the craziness of the strip. However, had we known there was no gambling whatsoever on property (meaning I have to decide between 1-being on a schedule for shuttles while trying to relax 2-drinking and staying on the property 3-not drinking, so I can drive to a casino) we would have chosen another dog-friendly property to stay at. 

For our troubles, we were offered a voucher to the spa. Come to find out, it can be used for the sauna (I live on the coast of Cali, hot and steamy aren't attractive to me) or a "clothing-optional" same-sex hot tub. That means I don't get to spend time with my wife, but a bunch if naked guys I don't know. What a way to say, "we're sorry for ruining your trip". 


Trust is everything to me. I no longer trust that when Hilton Hotels says, "this is an amenity we offer". 

I just removed one of the 2 stars I had previously given, due to just finding out THE POOL IS CLOSED!The line was long and food was as expected. They wouldn't give me a cup of water. They said they'd run out of water cups but they had plenty of soda cups... They said they couldn't out water in one. Haha. It's more fun to break the law. I tried two different employees but got no water. Good thing we weren't in a desert.NOT the same as the original locations. Food was not hot and just doesn't taste the same.  Dissatisfied. Very.If I could give zero stars I would. We ordered 4 pizzas and were told it would be 45-60 minutes. At one hour we called and were told 10 more minutes. At an hour and a half we called and were told any minute now. At 2 hours we called again and they called the driver, who arrived about 10 minutes later. It wouldn't have mattered if we had gotten "pizza". Instead we got something that made us all sick. The buffalo chicken pizza had no buffalo sauce on it - in fact no sauce at all. Order from another pizza place, unless you like chewy dough and salt.I know they just opened but the food is disgusting. The service is super slow and the staff is extremely rude. I would NEVER spend another dollar or step foot in that place. It sucks because they are right next to the building I work at. STAY AWAY! Its not worth your money or time. Food is crazy over priced and its not even worth it. If I could have given a negative star I would have. Good luck Americas Taco Shop.I had such high hopes for this store to be great. Unfortunately due to poor customer service I have no hopes for them any more. 6 weeks ago we ordered a sectional that was to be delivered in 2 days. Did I say 6 weeks ago? First they couldn't find the sofa portion, then they could only find the right sided chaise, then they couldn't find it again. I had to call each time even though they said they'd call. They have been so poor in communication and follow through. We still don't have our sectional, we still haven't heard back from them. DONT GIVE THEM YOUR MONEY, YOULL NEVER SEE YOUR PURCHASES. If I could give a negative star I would. My only hope now is that they close their doors and go away.I have since stopped going to this cleaners. This is nothing negative towards the employees that process the orders but the location that does the dry cleaning. On too many occasions now, my shirts have come back in less then stellar condition. They started coming with creases and broken buttons. I don't have the time to send shirts back to be repaired and pressed again. I would suggest finding another cleaner. And to the cleaners, it may be time to do some quality assurance at your factory.I am not sure what the food is like but the hostess was rude and condescending.  We showed up at 5:10 on a Monday evening.  We were treated to a lecture about not having reservations; not once but two times by the same person.  If you can seat someone then do so graciously, I am not there to be lectured that I did not have reservations.  We did not stay, and we will not return.  The menu looks interesting but I guess you need reservations.Here we go. Maybe it has been a while for me hanging out in Tempe. But I will start with this... Paper plates? That just doesn't seem right for a Mexican restaurant. Also, I asked the server for a napkin and she brought me a stack of cocktail napkins. And the chips sure seemed like some kind of Doritos to me. The salsa was ok. I asked if they have multiple choices for salsa and nope just one. I ordered the chicken tacos they were ok. But phoenix market has been flooded lately with tacos shops and burger shops and these tacos were nothing to brag about. Service was good . Server was good. Bunch of tv's looked good. Probably wont go back.DON'T DO IT!!! This place is gross, calamari tasted like  frozen fish sticks :(. Medium well burger was medium rare and zero flavor.  I assume it also came out of the freezer section of Costco.  Hey chef, freezer burn isn't a tasty seasoning choice.Wow... I can't I have to write this review about a place I used to love. 
I just checked and in October 2014 I wrote a 5 star review... little did I know that a few weeks later I would be treated so poorly. 

Towards the end of November I received a call from someone in the office. (Unfortunately, I don't remember her name) She explained that my Pap Smear had come back abnormal and that I needed to come in for another procedure (Colposcopy). When I asked how much the procedure was for she told me that with my not having met my insurance deductible for 2013 year it would be around $200. I explained that I did not have $200 at the current time and that I would like to wait until January to have this procedure if possible, so that I could save up the money and also so that it would go towards my deductible for the whole year (2014). She seemed aggravated by my reply and hastily informed me that I needed this procedure as I probably have cancer. And this is not something I should be putting off. I told her that I didn't have a choice and this is what I had to do at the moment. I informed her I would call back in January.
 
Fortunately, for me I've had a very similar situation happen to me when I was 20 years old, so I am aware that often doctor staff is not well versed in explaining procedures to patients. I was a little shocked that she would basically threaten me with cancer, but also tried to understand that she was hopefully just looking out for me. I'll be honest I found her to be incredibly rude and had considered writing this review at that point. The holidays got in the way I let it go. 
 
On Jan 15 when I called to discuss scheduling my appointment, I was pretty shocked to learn that the doctor had dropped me as a patient and that I would have to see if she would consider taking me back on. The girl was a lot nicer this phone call, but I was furious. I have been a patient for a few years and I was very upset to have to go through the horrible process of trying to find a new lady doctor. 
 
This is outrageous to me and honestly if this is how they run their business I don't want to be a patient. I feel like the doctor/staff only care about my getting cancer if I am able to schedule my appointments at their convenience. If this was such an important procedure for me to have, you would think the doctor herself would have contacted me.  
  
Personally, I think it is inappropriate for anyone other than the doctor to be discussing whether or not I may have cancer with me over the phone. That is a very scary thing to tell someone and I don't think it should be thrown around so lightly. Clearly the patients are not that important. 

It's a shame because I really liked Dr. Haydee Docasar and thought that I had found a permanent OBGYN. I'm really disappointed that I have to find a new one..... Tried this place for the 2nd time. They were out of soda. Only had water. They messed up everyone's order. Terrible. I'd give 0 stars if possible.Just witnessed a few Duck Dynasty looking bikers wielding foot long army knives reach over the bar, grabbed bottles of alcohol, and walked out.  But it gets better...they walked back in, sit down at the bar, and are getting served shots.

With 1 waitress, 1 female bartender, and 1 bus boy manning shop, not sure if they saw it or just ignoring it.

Either way, I would not recommend bringing your kids or date here. 

On the food:
Braised oxtail is good

Scallops so-so

Seared prawns were sent back as all of them were mushy and rotting.  Even the Buser said it stinks when he took it away

This place doesn't seem like it would be around after another few monthsMy friend's 30th- got on the "guest list " but still had to pay cover charge- late by 20 min. No one dancing except our group, even the gogo dancers were not into it. We were there on Saturday night around 1230. Asked  one of the employees if it was always this dead- he blamed it on change over between krave and after. Totally not worth the $40 cover. Supposedly after doesn't get busy until 4am.I have been here probably 2 times, each time more disappointment than before. I ordered the largest pizza they had with olives and mushroom. Being the pizza lover my family and I are we got it with high hopes but were very displeased with the results. Each slice I picked up fell into pieces, on top of that it was greasy, bland, and just plain gross. The garlic crust is was literally the only good thing about it.
The second time I ordered a cheese pizza on a Wednesday to be delivered. I waited and waited and waited until I finally just called up an hour and a half later and asked about the status on my pizza. The response was they had forgotten about my order and were right on it. The manger gave it to me for free because of the wait but it still has the same crappy taste but now it came along with bad service. Don't go there. Just. Don't.Had great reviews and a coupon, so I tried Cu still. I went in on a Friday night around 7. Every table had a party seated. 

I order the baked and grilled wings, a scorpion burger with waffle fries, and a bacon avocado tomato grilled cheese sandwich with garlic fries. 

The wings came charred black. After one wing I sent them back; they were all crispy black. The waiter offered to have them redone correctly but that carcinogenic burnt taste in my mouth lingered for a long time an I was done with wings. 

Burger was a home made patty. Not medium but juicy. Small patty, there was plenty of just bun and lettuce bites to my burger. 

Grilled cheese came cold with some of the cheese not even melted. Not much bacon, especially for 8$, and I guess it was my mistake for thinking a mushy avocado would be good on grilled cheese. Completely missed the mark.

Garlic fries were bleh. Not good. The waffle fries on the other hand were awesome. 

I really wanted to like this place. I had good service from my waiter Nick. Nice atmosphere with big booths. Maybe I'll give this place one more chance in a few months on a time when it's empty to get the mushroom burger and Phoenix sandwich which looked good, but not likely.It does not deliver the authentic taste of good crawfish..I spend $33.00 on two pounds. They were super tiny and it's crawfish season.  I ordered the spiciest with two potatoes, three corn and four sausage.  

The crawfish were drrrrry and had no flavor with no spice at all. The corn were decent.  The potatoes were biilg gigantic rustic potatoes cut in half. I am use to the small red potatoes the seasoning soaks into those easily.  The sausage were literally four cut small sausages that you had to search in the rubble for instead of whole sausage links.

I will never return. I just got back from Houston so the taste is no comparison.  I just wasted my money and time. Or go to Vegas.

They do not serve liquor either..The bowl of salsa that came out had something strange in it (I was thinking a cilantro stem or something) so I fished it out. I found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa. The waiter wasn't quite sure how to handle it and couldn't find a supervisor to help him out. With our stomachs turning from the thought of wire or other "extras" that may he included we decided it was time to go. I really wanted chips and salsa too.On top of extremely slow, discourteous  service and 45 minutes to prepare food, the drinks are extremely weak. Had the margarita, had a very slight taste of lime and no taste of tequila at all. (Check out Ztejas margarita, a good model to follow). Three lime slices helped taste, but not much more. The Pinot Noir was my first choice but they ran out of that before 6:30.We attempted to have a nice dinner at Chao. We walked in and did notice that it looked like they weren't quite set up all the way, but decided to still give them a chance. Someone came by and brought two waters with some very melted ice, and he offered no straws. Then the man who sat us at the table came by and took our drink order. We asked for hot tea but again no sweetener was offered. Fifteen minutes later we were still sitting there with people walking around looking busy. We saw two other tables who got there after we arrived get their orders in. We finally decided to get up and leave 20 minutes later. My husband went over to "the server" and gave him $10.00 for the teas. The server didn't apologize for never coming back around to take our dinner orders he just took the money and said nothing. We walked over to BLD and had a wonderful dinner. We won't be back to Chao!Do not live here please! This place has been nothing but problems. Myself and everyone I know who lives here hates it. The management gets nothing done and is always very unhelpful. This place is to expensive for how terrible they treat there residents. If you don't believe me just go there and ask the residents how they feel about the place. I'm not sure why anyone would give this place more than one star. To be honest they probably work there. This place does not care about its residents, they just want your money.I had visited Nekter two other times this week, once in the afternoon and yesterday morning. I went for a third time this morning because their juice is quite good, and also reasonably priced compared to competitors. After telling my friend about this place, she asked me if I had a punch card with them, it's a pretty good deal: spend $25 and get a free 16oz juice. However this was never offered to me, and I didn't know about it until after I had purchased a few juices. 

The reason for the 1 star review is because I walked in this morning before work, and there were two staff members at the register. One staff member was showing the other how to do something on the register, not a problem, I understood this and I'm pretty forgiving, but I was standing there two feet away from them waiting and it was as if I was invisible. I waited some more..........no "Hello," no "We'll be right with you,".........no acknowledgment at all. Feeling super awkward and unsure of how long I was going to be ignored for, I turned around, left the store and went to Juby True across the street.

I totally understand the need to train someone to do their job, but I think it's common courtesy to at least acknowledge your customers. I'm pretty sure I will not be returning here, as their customer service was non existent this morning.I hate to be redundant but Suzie's review from 6/16/2014 is spot on. 

Priority appliance was assigned to fix our dishwasher by our home warranty company. No one ever answers the phones. You are given a few options/departments to choose from when you call and then you can leave a message but good luck getting anyone to call you back uncles you leave a barrage of messages. 

And then when they "schedule" an appointment they call you the day before between 4 and 4:45p and whether you answer or not they tell you they will be there the next day within a 4 hour window and That they will call again when the Tech is on the way and if YOU DONT ANSWER then they wont show up. So you have to literally sit there staring at your phone waiting for their call otherwise if you miss the call it's not like you can call them right back and say you're home. You call them and they never answer and that's ok. They call you and if you miss that call... Well then, too bad for you. 

What is wrong with this company???? 

The most frustrating thing is that we are at their mercy since we are going through our warranty company to get the dishwasher repaired. Otherwise I would have changed to a different company already.This place is just absolutely horrible. Went in to check it out and have some dinner. 45 minute wait not a big deal, decided to go to the bar and get some drinks. I was looked at and past over by 3 different bartenders (presumably because I am a female). Word of advise ladies- we will tip you well also as long as you give good service. Two gentlemen at the bar had to ask the bartender for the drinks I wanted because I was being ignored. 

Buzzer for table goes off right as I got the drinks.  Get shown to the table (good thing I got two drinks at the bar), it took 10 to 15 minutes for the server to show up.  And talk about stupid.  I understand the concept of the restaurant but seriously train your staff better.   We were going to order a bunch of starters (what they call teasers). There menu is not that big.  Ordered soft pretzels,  they wes out.  Ordered pulled pork sliders,  server said I think we might be out,  can you go check so we can make a decision.  Yep, they were out. Asked the server,  what do you have?  She says everything else. Ok.  What kind of fish is used for the fish tacos,  oh we are out of fish, but if we had it tilapia.  (How do you run out of half the items in your menu? ) Do you have any wine?  Yes,  chardonnay and white zinfandel.  Do you have any red wine?  Yes, it's a cabernet, I think.   Food was so so. 

Time to pay the bill, have her $32 in cash asked for the rest to be put on a debit card.  Only puts in$22 in cash and the rest on a credit card.  Called her over,  told her the mistake and she gets mad at us.  Sorry darlin' you were not worth the $10 you tried to pocket.  

Again ladies,  just because we are not interested in your Twin Peaks doesn't mean that you have to ignore us and give us crappy,  no horrific service.  If you givegood serviceyou willbe tipped well.  Gengerally 20-30%.  We are all in the industry and if you worked for me you wouldn't have a job.I'm so glad Scott answered you yesterday Mike B.  Or someone who say they are Scott.  What I would like to know Scott is how do we receive the IPad/Tablet as promised.  I was finally contacted by Cody Powel 5 days ago after writing the company several times and this is what he wrote to me

The thing is we attended way back on February 25th, 2014 that was 5 months ago.  We haven't seen a list come out yet for Bermuda.  So actually how long does it take?  We only had 32 people in our class so we are way under the amount requirement for the gifts.  I would just like to see them honor what they said and provide the gifts.  If you cannot make good on this, it makes it very hard to believe anything else.  Another question I have Scott is where are you and why wasn't you at the 3 day seminar?

I do not know why this is showing for San Francisco CA but we are in Bermuda.Do not rent from Haven homes. they have the worse property management and customer service.they require you to use their pool service but I have a leak on the pump for 3 days now and the owner of the pool company haven't sent anyone to fix it.. its a crazy company managed by unprofessional incompetent people.I'm still trying to get a couple of problems taken care of in the house and we have been here for 2 months. Once they get your money you are on your own. they'll never answer or return your calls. Ryan is the worse realtor I've had to deal with.Really wanted to order takeout,  as I've wanted to try this place since they opened...... But ended up ordering elsewhere as there is no readable menu posted.... FailWorst movers, scammers will charge for a step, will charge $39 fro blister wrap horrible peopleI too was excited that this restaurant opened and I have to agree with most that posted on here.  Each time I come here, now 4 times, the place is not busy most times empty and the waitresses have no clue how to make someone feel welcome or provide service. It's obvious that the waitresses are only there to socialize with each other and if you ask for something you're bothering them.  While  food most times is good it's also  unpredictable.  What a frustrating dining experience.  As good as their pizza is most times, I will not ever be back.Spent like $10 bucks on a salad and drink that wasn't even that good...I could make something like this at home. Not impressedI'm a fan of Guy Fieri, he's from Vegas and I love his Diners, Drive-ins and Dives so I was excited to try his new restaurant.  The place had a cool casual decor, wood and metal.  Went on a nice Sunday for lunch.  We were seated after about a 20 minute wait.  We ordered our drinks and it came.  Flagging a server was like trying to flag a taxi -- can't find one.  I don't know where our server disappeared to.  After that it took about an hour to get our appetizer which came with our sandwiches and tacos.  Presentation was nice!  I ordered the big dip or whatever it was called -- I can't remember since it's best to forget how dry it was -- it needed au jus which I recommend on the side.  My son ordered the fish tacos.  He said it was plain and not much flavor.  My other son ordered the blackened chicken sandwich or whatever it was again.  It was easy to forget because he said it was just ok.  The truffle fries were great, skinny cut and flavorful.  The server forgot my daughter's water.  She finally got it when our food was brought out.  Service was 1 out of 10.  We ordered another appetizer which never came but were charged and also a beer that we didn't order.  When our server came to bring our check and I told him how bad the service was he started to argue with me and made excuses.  I don't want to hear they just opened 4 days ago.  Apologize, give me a free soda or something for me to return!  Which I won't.  Did he come  to see how we were doing during the hour wait?  Not!  The lunch experience left a bad taste.  We live in Vegas and expect much more from a Strip restaurant especially from Guy Fieri.We received horrifyingly poor service. I complained to the manager about the disorganized fashion in which people were being seated, and a man claiming to be the owner escorted me and my 3-year-old daughter outside, and yelled at me to "GET IN MY CAR, LEAVE AND NEVER COME BACK." I've lived in Las Vegas since 1975, and have never received such awful treatment at a restaurant. 

To give the full story, I took my 3-year-old daughter to the Cracked Egg for the first time, and was told it would be a 25-minute wait. There was no place for us to sit in the front, and I saw what looked like a place to get coffee in the back of the restaurant. We strolled back there, and was told (with a bit of attitude) by the same guy who threw us out that if we sat there, the hostesses wouldn't come find us when it was our turn. I got a cup of coffee, and returned to the front of the restaurant... the whole process took less than 10 minutes. We waited another 10 minutes or so, and I asked the hostesses if it would be our turn soon, and they said they called us awhile ago... clearly it was a 5-minute wait, not a 25-mintue wait.

I asked to speak to the manager, and began complaining to her about the disorganized process, when a man identifying himself as the owner approached me, angrily escorted me and my daughter outside, and rudely told us to leave and never come back. I asked several times that he listen to me, and he rudely told me to "look around, you're not the only one here with an infant."

Unbelievable.tried this place 5 times since they opened and each and evey time was an epic fail.

1. Went during morning rush before work, went inside to order a decaf and bagel NOT toasted w cr cheese. Had to repeat my order at least 7 times to the cashier she could not comprehend a simple order for some reason. Then I had to wait 20 minutes for them to make decaf coffee (apparently it came as a total surprise that someone might want something ready during morning rush?)
Then they could not quite grok the concept of an UNtoasted bagel...
Took a half hour all together to get my order
2. Yesterday drove thru and got LARGE iced coffee.
After I drove away I realized I HAD NOT GOTTEN WHAT I PAID FOR they gave me a medium instead but I had paid the large price
so
3. as a test I went back this morn and ordered same and again they tried to pass off a medium  to me but I called them out and they dis ingenuously went oops and gave me a large, so I ask it is a policy to try to rip off customers this way?
also
4. Ordered bagel w VEGGIE cr cheese and (got in drive thru) and after I drove away I discover it is plain cr cheese.

So in conclusion, they have never gotten a single order of mine right, they rip you off and they are ill-prepared and obviously in need of some sort of competent manager.

I predict this location will close within a year since the other location at Tatum & Bell has a competent staff, never have problems with my order thereliving socail buyers beware. This is not her first company kike this that offers terrible service, and only wants to "sell you" on more services. They are terrible to try and get anything scheduled, took me 3 weeks to find a day and time that would work with my schedule, then they don't even show up when they say. I moved all my furniture waited to be able to prepare dinner for my family( as they were supposed to clean my time and grout) only to have them say they would not even be able to show up until after 5 pm. I just cancelled, and told them I would like my money back, and he said to take it up with Living social. Very unreputable company !! and shame on Living socil for not checking them out better. This seems to be a common theme with their "service type" offers.After suffering the mediocrity of Agave, the terse life of Dos Caminos, and the overly authentic Toros, I was super excited to dine here.

Unfortunately I won't get the chance Due to a 'private event' booking the whole restaurant on a Tuesday after work. Nothing like spending millions on renovations and not letting locals access it. 

Thanks Mercadito, we're off to a great start.
