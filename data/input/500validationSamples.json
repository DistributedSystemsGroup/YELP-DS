The crust falls short somewhere in between the line of cardboard and the styrofoam you'll find in a car bumper. The pizza as a whole looks like something you'll find in the frozen aisle and tastes even more disintegrated. That may be attributed to them baking cheese pizzas and reheating with whatever toppings you order. It doesn't work that way and to do so in New York would be an automatic death sentence endorsed even by their appalled Jersey neighbors.

I came here with a group of friends for dinner on my birthday. First the good part, the food: I'm not a fan of thin crust pizza, so opted to go for a couple of the appetizers instead. Ingredients were fresh and tasty, and portions were reasonable. I ordered the caprese and the salami/cheese sampler. Strangely the menu said the caprese came with bread, but the sampler did not; the sampler also only had 4 small pieces of the same kind of cheese, instead of an assortment as I expected. Good, but still odd. My friends all ordered pizza, so I had a slice of the Margherita just to try it, since the friend who recommended the place had raved about the pizza. It was actually quite good; toppings were flavorful and the crust in particular was very nice, chewy and substantial enough to be filling. If I came again, I would probably order the pizza. I wanted to order soup, but the choices were uninspired: a white mushroom soup and a red tomato soup (although now that I think about it, that's exactly how the waitress explained them, so she didn't exactly make either choice sound good).\n\nWhat put a big damper on the evening was the waitress. She was friendly enough when we arrived, but very quickly I noticed certain things. It was like she couldn't be bothered with us; she hardly ever came to check on us, never asked if we wanted more drinks, and never asked if we wanted dessert. When our food was delivered (not by her), she was never there to make sure we got the right orders and we were happy. If we wanted anything, we had to flag her down and she would walk away without saying anything. My caprese came with nothing on top except fresh basil and the bread that was promised on the menu never showed, so I had to call her over to get olive oil and balsamic vinegar; she was already leaving the table before I could ask for the bread. After this happened, I commented to my friends that I didn't like the waitress because she seemed very snooty and apparently had better things to do than her job. Later on, as we were finishing eating, she brought two checks over, one for a friend at the end of the table and the other for the rest of the table. Apparently she separated out the check for the friend only because she asked, but never checked whether anyone else needed a separate check. This was a problem for a couple other people, who felt they didn't even get a chance to say anything. When they asked very politely if the waitress would mind splitting the rest of the check up, she rolled her eyes and said \"I mind\" and walked off. She finally did come back with separate checks for the two of them, but still didn't verify if anyone ELSE wanted separate checks.\n\nWe had a movie to get to by that time, so didn't hang out for long, but as we were walking out, I realized she never asked us if we wanted dessert. On top of that, my friends had talked to her in the beginning about my birthday and supposedly she was going to bring something out, but it never materialized. Not that I minded that part, as I'm not into that kind of thing, but I don't know if she forgot or didn't care or what. And not even a mention of it to me. Anyway I doubt I'll go back again; there's no excuse for hiring bad servers in what is otherwise a decent restaurant.", "type": "review", "business_id": "x5LrBYPOFlarnDvUTouL7Q"}

I sat outside and had a very friendly server, she was prompt and personable. The food was ok, nothing spectacular but worthy of a second try. The new Vig is pretty cool, very similar set up to the Arcadia one, nice open patio and Bocci ball court. \n\n2nd experience at the Vig was awful!! The service was horrendous, but let me back up... I arrived just before 6 and attempted to pull in to the parking lot.. I saw the valet guys making wild hand gestures to cars, but wasn't really sure how to interpret them. Cars were honking trying to get past me on 16th street, I pull in and they tell me the valet is full and I have to park across the street, another valet has parked a car in front of me and there were already 2 cars that pulled up behind me. Where was I going to go? I finally was able to get out and park across the street, and when I walked over I saw about 3 other cars going trough the same ordeal. Here is a tip - Put a sign out saying Lot Full. It's not brain surgery, its Valet parking.\n\nI got in and joined our table of about 20. We had one server for our table, he was flustered and had a really bad attitude. He seemed to be only serving half of our table. It took him 25 minutes to make his way over to us and take our order.. Well partially, he took my order an then ignored everyone sitting next to me. He actually ignored Nathan for about half an hour.. At one point he turned to some one and said \"You'll have to wait because everyone is yelling at me at once\" Sorry buddy, maybe you should have more than one person serving us if you can't handle it. Yes my food is getting cold and no you still haven't brought me that fork I asked for 10 minutes ago. Better yet why don't you take it out on the customers here. What an ass.  \n\nIn addition to the service, they ran a charge for $348.00 on my card. It didn't actually post as a charge because they caught it, but it took away from my available credit in my checking account for about 6 days. \n\nI will go back, because the food is decent and the d\u00e9cor and ambiance are great. I'll just make sure to park across the street and get a different server.", "type": "review", "business_id": "WS1z1OAR0tRl4FsjdTGUFQ"}

Because there are many rooms. Many, many small rooms. And narrow corridors. Yes, there's some novel, 'ohmygodlookhowCOOL' type things: like shackles (wrist and neck) affixed to a wall that make ideal comedy-photo-opportunities. And there are many rooms, including a small cinema. This is great, really. (It was showing Indiana Jones when I was there).\n\nI'm just not sure if maybe it's because it's a victim of its own quirky success, but on a Saturday night past midnight it was a bit...hmm...yeah let's leave it there. The sort of crowd you'd expect from a quirky, haunted, alternative venue. And I normally fit right in. But I just couldn't settle into the place. It was really cold in some parts, it had ghost tours of completely sober tourists and OAPs circulating randomly at 1am, mixed in with really, really drunk tattoo-convention folks. Maybe I came on the wrong night, but like I said, I just couldn't settle.\n\nI would come back again but given I have limited drinking time, it's not somewhere I'd choose.

This place was recommended to me numerous times and I desperately wanted to try the 'jalapeno bacon'.  Different circumstances (like the fact that they are closed on Monday's) kept preventing me from trying that glorious bacon but when I finally did - it was love at first taste.  I then went with friends for dinner the other night and just have to rave about the outstanding service and delicious food that night as well.  So this is a 2-part review:\n\nBrunch: I went to brunch with my Dad on a Saturday morning and because we are early risers, we were in the parking lot 10 minutes before they opened.  I had already been warned that the place fills up fast and I couldn't stand to miss another brunch opportunity without trying this place out.  We both got a bloody Mary, where previously mentioned glorious bacon was had and solidified my belief that dreams do come true (atleast when it comes to food).  \n\nThe options on the menu are solid with the Caribbean influence apparent in the various flavors that are mentioned.  I went with the \"DW bowl of New Mexican-style slow-cooked pork\" and asked to substitute spinach for the rice. (In order to make the dish Paleo-friendly). HOLY! I don't know if I have ever had a brunch dish in my life that is more delicious than that bowl that was placed before me.  Between that and the additional side of jalapeno bacon that I ordered, I was in Paleo-foodie heaven.  My enjoyment of the dish was so apparent that one of the owners stopped me on the way out to comment on my clear satisfaction with my choice.  We shared a giggle in which I reassured him that when it came to food, I had no shame.  That interaction sealed the deal that DW would be my new favorite place to dine in Vegas.\n\nDinner: Impromptu dinner plans with fellow Paleo-eaters on a Saturday night lead us back to DW Bistro.  I was once again nervous that we would be faced with a hellacious wait but was pleasantly greeted by the second owner at the host stand who reassured me it wouldn't be long at all.  Our server (I never caught his name unfortunately) was equally as pleasant and very patient with our various modifications as the night went on.  My friends ordered the 'Hummingbird Carafe' which was presented beautifully and apparently extremely tasty.  I stuck with water and am so grateful for how quickly my glass was refilled every single time it was empty. For an appetizer we shared the \"DW Spanish chorizo with shrimp\" which I believe was consumed in a record 5 minutes flat.  I then was SO tempted to get the previously mentioned slow-cooked pork again, which also appears on their dinner menu. I knew I needed to try something different though so I went with the \"Pan seared salmon\" sans rice and sub extra veggies.  I'm not going to lie - it wasn't as mouth-gasmic as the slow-cooked pork but it was yummy.  The best part was the various farmer's market veggies that the salmon was served over.  \n\nI can't recommend DW Bistro enough.  The staff seems happy, the owners are present, helpful and friendly and the food has yet to disappoint.", "type": "review", "business_id": "y6NFyThUU2wtTNa0rX7VrA"}

Boy did they do a 360 for the worse. They still have the $19.99 special with a players card. The menu has changed a bit. They got rid of a lot of stuff that was really good and added a lot of fillers mainly flat breads and sliders. \n\nThey added sushi onto the menu but heres the problem with that, my friend ordered a roll and you'd expect a freshly made one but what he got was a sushi roll made who knows when that just came out of the fridge. Also when you read the fine print on the new menu it says along the lines that sushi may not be available depends on their supplier or something. So the sushi is not made on the spot it's made somewhere else and brought in and refrigerated. \n\nAll the tasty items like the miso bass now has an added charge of $4.00\nadditional on top of the $19.99 you just paid. I ate like 20 of those the last time. \n\nany item worth eating has an additional charge per item.\n\nSo basically you will pay $19.99 base price then another ala cart price on top of that. WOW.\n\nIf you still are dying to try this place read the menu carefully before entering the restaurant and you will see what I mean. \n\nAlso by the way besides the price, the food quality has gone way down. Nothing tasted like it was freshly made like before, tasted microwaved.

Full disclosure: I had dyed my hair brown just prior to trying out Vdara (to cover 6-stylists-in-9-months' worth of bad highlights) but was looking to come back to blonde. That being said, I've gone from brown to blonde several times before with no problem. My Boston stylist just does the same foils as always but a little denser and I'm a darker blonde for a couple months. \n\nBut at Spa & Salon Vdara there was a big issue of lack of competency. In Boston, my stylist would do really dense foils with a couple different colors, break up my base color, tone it, and I'd be done in 3-4 hours with a cut. It turned out my expectations were LIGHT YEARS ahead of what any of the girls at Vdara were capable of: it took SIX hours for Kelsey to do 1/2 head foil of one color, without toning and without a cut with another stylist, Lisa, assisting for about four of the six hours! \n\nShe also charged me not for the 1/2 head foil I got; not for the full head foil I asked for; she charged for a double process color because it took so long! Um, where I'm from that leads to a discount and an apology, not an additional charge! \n\nI was desperate to find a regular salon here in Vegas so I went back hoping that I could deal with them at least keeping me blonde using a technique within their comfort zone (even though I was paying more than I did in Boston). The second time there, Kelsey was out for 3 weeks so I saw Lisa, who had helped work on my hair last time. I made it clear that I wanted to be blonde, not a streakily highlighted brunette. \n\nI should have run screaming when I saw the vats of bleach coming out. \nShe bleached. my. whole. head. \nLemon yellow. \n\nAs if  that's not bad enough, she had separated out the highlights from last time so the bleach didn't melt that hair, but this meant she didn't get the bleach up to my scalp. I had at least an inch of dark brown hair at the top. Then Lisa gave me a \"choice\": I could leave with 1\" of dark brown hair, or I could see another stylist, Amanda, to dye my roots. Obviously I wasn't going to leave with roots, so off to Amanda I went. \n\nAmanda dyed my dark brown roots with a light blonde dye. Anyone who's ever known someone with a home done box hair dye mishap knows what blonde dye over brown hair leads to: ORANGE.  I had ORANGE roots and LEMON YELLOW hair. Oh my god. \n\nIt had taken six hours again, and I was so eager to leave, that I checked out and paid for a double process (the bleaching, even though it was technically only a single process as they didn't even tone... I'll get to that in a minute...) PLUS a single process (the dying of my roots - a surprise to me for sure). \n\nNow here's where I plead temporary insanity. Desperate to salvage something from this experience, I called the next day and asked them to at least tone my flaming brassy locks. They did, for another $85!!!!  And she asked if I wanted to pay for a blowout, which I absolutely did not, so I left the salon with wet hair. But just like you can't fix stupid, you can't tone orange. Toning did nothing. \n\nI called and spoke with the manager, and he oh-so-generously refunded the $85 for the toning.  \n\nI should have never gone back, I know, but they should never have graduated beauty school, so I'll call it even. When I went to get that mess fixed by Paul at Christophe, he asked if I did it myself. Ouch. When I told him that no, it cost me ~$500 he was flabbergasted.

But it is the best place to see raw talent and bloody good shows - mostly put on by students of the close by university or small theatre groups doing productions of thier own device.\n\nMostly staged in the round, the Bedlam Theatre houses only enough room for 50 customers max at a time, but this is to its benifit as a real sense of being in the action and transfixed by what is going on is always felt. The actors who perform are, in every show I have been to see, hugely talanted and passionate about thier arts - a testiment to both them and the booking team who select the shows at Bedlam. The last production I saw here was Alice in Wonderland, and the effect of being so close to the cast and feeling part of what they were doing was simple sublime.\n\nThe theatre itself is slightly in need of a decorater, but once you get passed that and into the acting, you will be hooked forever.", "type": "review", "business_id": "smyeENLUbQzz8mTwIJmKrQ"}

It is a great way to eat in Vegas and check out hotels at the same time. You have 24 hours to eat at any of 7 different hotels buffets for only $50. If you get a players card it is $45 but remember in order to get the discount each adult will need to get a players card. We managed to have 4 meals and ate at 3 different buffets.\nDay 1:\n-6:00pm We started off with dinner at Planet Hollywoods Spice Market Buffet.\n  Overall: 4 stars\n  Line: ~30 min\n  Ambiance: Decor is simple and modern. Movie posters on the wall :)\n  Buffet set up: really nice and easy to follow\n  Food:The food here was really delicious. It was flavorful and they had a really big variety of foods including Mediterranean, Asian, Seafood, Mexican, and American. Some of my favorite dishes was the warm crab legs, prime rib, skewered tandoori chicken and beef. Their deserts were to die for, especially for me who has a huge sweet tooth. They had a crepe making station, cotton candy, yummy creme brulee, and don't be fooled by the soft serve machine. I thought it was just regular ice cream but nope it was vanilla custard soft serve which had a really thick creamy texture.\n\nDay 2:\n-9:00 Le Village Buffet at Paris Paris\n  Overall: 4 stars\n   Line: ~40 min\n   Ambiance: Cozy and cute. Decorated true to its theme, like a Parisan village\n   Buffet set up: This is why I I couldnt award it 5 stars. The buffet set up was very muddled and it was difficult to find things. Some food items were somewhat hidden behind lines of people waiting for omelets and crepes. Also these stations had extremely long lines. It was alot less organized than Planet Hollywood and other buffets I have been to.\n   Food: Food was really good. I am not really a big breakfast person but I really enjoyed that even though the spread was your typical breakfast foods they had a variety of each food. For example they had several different types of sausages, I tried andouille which was really good.I also tried the banana nutella crepe with candied walnuts which was sugary bliss. Make sure you have the rosemary red potatoes!\n\nWe planned on having Caesars for lunch but unfortunately the information desk told us the buffet had closed down a few days ago. This was a little ridiculous since Caesars was listed on most of the ads and was even on our wristbands. Nevertheless we took it in our stride and decided to try Harrahs.\n\n-1:00 Flavors Buffet at Harrahs\n  Overall: 2 stars\n  Line: ~20 min which was really ridiculous because the restaurant was not packed at all. \n  Ambiance:Simple but clean\n  Buffet set up: Easy to follow however alot of the sauces were unaccessable. Also alot of the deserts are behind glass so you have to ask an attendant.\n Food: None of the dishes were exceptional but nothing was bad either... Cookies and cream gelato was really good though.\n\n-5:00 Spice Market Buffet Round 2!\n Yep it was that good! We decided to go again so we could end our buffet experience on a good note and it was 100% worth it. I got to really enjoy all the dishes I liked the previous night. Best part was there was no line when we arrived!\n\nThing to keep in mind:\n-There are lines so make sure you go with people you like, anybody the is a wet blanket or picky eater will ruin the experience. I was lucky that everyone I was with were down for anything so it was really fun.\n-To get the most bang for your buck have a late dinner one night and then have breakfast, lunch and dinner the next day. Remember it's 24 hours.\n-Be open minded and just have fun with it! Treat it like an adventure and you will be good to go.", "type": "review", "business_id": "cRfn_vMQ9YExuKb378CwjQ"}

It smelled like wonderful herbs and incense in the spa. I last minute decided I wanted to have acrylics (I'm not really a fan) and I couldn't be happier. Paula the salon owner was very intent on customer service and satisfaction offering her clients fruit mineral water, or a glass of wine. I smudged my toe(s) from having my pedicure done earlier and she fixed the toe(s) no problem at all. The only thing that I was a little annoyed with at first was she took a walk in right before my scheduled appointment at 6, but to be fair; I had pushed the appointment back from 5:30 pm to 6pm. She is a business owner trying to make a living and a name for her establishment, I understand completely. Even though I had a small wait time (I was nervous about missing my show that I flew into Vegas for) she was speedy and proficient, the nails look great I'm still wearing them almost two weeks later! Paula then proceeded to give me a ride back to my hotel (not very, about a mile to 2 miles up the road) so I wouldn't have to wait for a cab and be late!

So many of my Yelp friends gave it rave reviews that I was really excited to try this place when my friend was in town in March.\n\n(It was also one of the only places that you could get boba at 10pm.)\n\nSo we go inside and there's a strange mix of smells.  At first you're like, \"Oh, this is different\" and I try to associate different with good, but the smells change and you're like, \"Hmm, not sure if good\" with a confused look on your face.  I think the servers are trained to ignore that look, because I caught a couple of people who walked through the door doing the same thing.\n\nIt was pretty busy when we went but I could see at least a handful of tables clean.  We still waited about 10 minutes to be seated.  We almost walked out but boba was the main goal so we stuck it out and sat down.\n\nWaiter was OK.  Definitely not exceptional.  He wasn't thrilled when we first ordered waters and boba.  The boba was slow to come out and wasn't really boba... definitely wasn't 5-star worthy in any way shape or form.\n\nI decided to suck it up and order an appetizer - their oxtail chili cheese fries.  Sure, why not.  They were decent, but certainly nothing to go crazy over.  And the sunny-side up egg on it was just...no.  Didn't really fit anything.  That's kind of how I felt about the whole menu, though - trying to be hipster and cool with all their \"weird pairings\" that didn't make sense unless you were also hipster and cool.  I dunno.  I'll eat damn near anything, but 95% of the menu sounded weird, ridiculous, or both.\n\nAnd because of that, they feel like they can charge exorbitant prices.  $12 for chili cheese fries?  Ox is NOT that expensive of a meat, so sorry, I don't buy that.\n\nWe paid our tab for half-eaten fries and sub-par boba.

It was a 40 minute wait but it wasn't too bad--I just wish that they would have additional seating other than the 8 they had inside the restaurant. However, this doesn't affect my review; more seats would have been nice.\n\nWe were seated in and everything was so loud and fast-paced. Our server wasn't very good at listening to our orders however, but it was probably due to the loud noises (even though we practically yelled our orders). The server was also a bit irritating because when one of us wanted to get the burger cooked well-done, she asked if we wanted all the orders to come together since preparing a burger well-done would take a while and we said it was fine but she insisted on bringing the orders out as soon as they're done. We had to reassure her like 3 times that we wanted them out at the same time. \n\nI ordered the Ronin and it was very delicious, however I tried the Miyagi my boyfriend ordered and it was even better, but to me it wasn't THAT great like everyone said it to be. Same with their truffle fries--quite delicious, but nothing too special.\n\nDespite its deliciousness, I didn't think of it as being amazing as others think it is.

I got that vibe about The Clock, and I was certainly not disappointed.\n\nIn an area with cheap eating options scattered all around, it can hard to settle on one of the many cafes. But something about The Clock stuck out from the other contenders vying for my hungry attention. \n\nPerhaps it's the neo Victorian fronting, complete with pillar box red paint. Or maybe the clock decorating on the exterior struck me as being different from the remaining cheap or samey options. But whatever it was that lured me in, I'm very glad.\n\nThe Clock is somewhat new to the scene but I can see it being really successful. For a start, it's chilled out, nicely decorated with neutral art and cream coloured walls, and is spacious if you're in with a larger group. It may appear smaller on the outside but they have a secret spiral staircase taking you to a much more open dining area downstairs. If you can't get to this area, there's enough space upstairs for wheelchair or buggy access.\n\nSecondly, along with a vast array of delicious, well prepared food, they also have a bottled beer and wine selection! This added bonus, along with the healthy portions you receive with main meals and even with lucnhtime snacks opens it out towards evening diners.\n\nThe staff seemed to genuinely care about the customers and were certainly passionate about cooking. This showed in the standard of my panini (which was also generously served up with chips and crispy salad). I opted for the Turkish sausage and it was outstanding. For a lunchtime snack it was way above par - definitely of a higher standard. I also received the best hot chocolate I've ever tasted, it was perfect. The girl's skills put me to shame since I would definitely 3 star my efforts half the time. But this one was a work of art! And all of that for a fiver!\n\nIt's very rare that you find a cafe with such incredible choice. But what really stands out is the pride the staff take in their work. They went out of their way to look after their customers, and the cooking was to die for. \n\nWatch as word of mouth spreads about The Clock - in time, this will become one of Edinburgh's dining highlights.", "type": "review", "business_id": "OAzuzSsLxQH42I3YiUux7A"}

There is so much to say. I guess I'll begin by saying that this is one of the most unique sandwich experiences I have had. The friendly staff had to school me on how to order. Basically, there are certain classes of sandwiches that belong to numbers which in turn correspond to a specific bag. You grab a bag on which you place your order. You mark what sandwich you want and the toppings you would like, place your name on it and pay. A few minutes later you have a sandwich. The sandwich was good. There was not a lot of meat on it though it was enough to satisfy. The cool, fresh vegetables were the perfect compliment to the hot meats and cheese (I ordered mine toasted). The cappicola was awesome. A great spice balanced with the hammy goodness I have grown to love. The hot pepper giardinniere (note to self, check spelling) provided not only the spicy flavor of the peppers but also the contrast of crunchy celery and cauliflower. The toasted wheat bread was still soft enough on the inside to remain edible but crunchy enough on the outside to say \"Hey, I'm still here and I matter.\" I was pleased to try a great sandwich. As for the staff, they are eager to greet. Every one of them screamed a hearty \"welcome\" as soon as I set foot inside. If everybody was as eager to greet as I am to eat, the world would be a happier place. We need more like the staff at Which Wich. My only concern was the two young gentelmen making my food. I don't quite trust long haired individuals to make my food when all they wear is a loose fitting ball cap.

They have every brand, from In The Groove to the latest version of Pump it Up, and even old school Dance Dance Revolution and a Disney version.

There is a section for Console games, where people can bring in their own equipment to play games - This is a very thoughtful gesture as there isn't much else to do here.\n\nWhile I am disappointed that there are no racing games, It's clear that this place has honed in on a demographic of the Arcade scene that is still alive and well and damned if that doesn't make it a perfect spot for anyone still interested in dancing games!", "type": "review", "business_id": "d3-ivsteSO_4I1RkO54LPQ"}

There are also lots of grills and picnic tables with seating. There never seems to be a problem finding parking, and there is lots of space to roam. Dogs are supposed to be kept on a leash (we got a warning), but we did see plenty of dogs that were off the leash to play with their owners.

They actually ran out of about 4 types of rolls and the \"sushi chef\" only prepped cucumbers for our entire meal. The folks that came in after we arrived only got to look at empty trays with crumbs and sauce still on them. we would walk to his area and he would look up then continue prepping but not preparing anything.

Their public range has a side for rifle and pistol, all for $7 a day! It does get a little crowded on the weekends when I usually swing by so be prepared to wait in line. Plentiful range safety officers and fellow gun owners are always talking guns with those around them, which makes this an easy going environment despite constant gunfire going off around you. They also have a pro shop that sells ammo, drinks, snacks, safety equipment, etc at reasonable prices. You can also rent firearms, safety equipment, rangefinders and similar equipment. They also have archery, skeet/trap, and competitive ranges but I have yet to check those out. If you're coming with a class or a large group, they have private ranges that can also be rented out and they're just as nice, just away from the crowd of the public range.", "type": "review", "business_id": "nrL_Ip2-dEG4vjm6Ps9rFw"}

A small restaurant that mainly focused on ramen with decor that was similar to that in anime, UNHEARD OF. I was blinded by Monta's kool-aid. However years later now and most likely because of the raging success Monta has on the Vegas valley, ramen proprietors came from the shadows and declared Vegas ready for legitimate ramen. For me a cause and effect of the boom is that Monta has fallen in the ranks of preference and not only because of taste, but from the swarm of different styles of ramen that became available. \n\nSure Monta is not what it used to be pre-2012, but it is consistently now what it is. For myself it overwhelmingly salty, thin, and a lack of depth. That might not be the same for everyone, as I know that some of my friends do not particularly enjoy the thick rich broth from other providers. The chashu is more fat than anything else. Monta also consist of ridiculously long wait times, its insane to wait anything more than 15 minutes when a handful of options are only a 5 minute drive away. \n\nAlthough this may seem like a bash on Monta, I think that everyone should try it at least once (when the wait is not ridiculous), sort of paying tribute to Monta because without it, we (Las Vegas) would not have all delicious alternatives. \n\nThanks Monta", "type": "review", "business_id": "DjOxXobyGDwWt89q4z1twg"}

I really wanted to love love love you but that just didn't end up being the case.\n\nI liked the hotel itself, the decor, the color scheme, and how it felt like all of our friend's Vegas condos but we had some issues with the place so I wasn't totally in love.\n\nLet's break it down. I'll start with the pros.\n\nPROS:\n\n* So many of us stayed here so when I came out of the sliding doors and walked out it felt like I was walking to my friend's condos. I liked how it felt like we all lived here.\n\n* Music playing outside.\n\n* Hammocks.\n\n* 24 hour pool and jacuzzi.\n\n* Good food at the restaurant.\n\n* Nice decor, purple/grey wall paint, and modern furniture.\n\n* Rain shower.\n\n* Comfy comfy bed.\n\n* Cozy feeling. \n\n* Had a nice time overall but did not like dealing with all the following cons.\n\n\nCONS:\n\n* Does anyone work around here besides the security guard? Loved Vince.\n\n* I specifically requested that we have a fridge when we arrived. I was promised that one would be in my room when I got in by the manager. That didn't happen and after many calls, waiting, emails, and calls, that just never got resolved. Finally after a day and a half someone finally told me they only have several fridges and don't have any at the moment. Why didn't you guys just tell me that instead of making me wait and check back, etc?\n\n* Why it takes a day and a half to get an ash tray on our patio I will never figure out.\n\n* Many of my friends reservations were messed up and the check in process took forever.\n\n* Sliding door had to be opened and closed several times before locking properly.\n\n* No place to put your hand soap. Has anyone heard of a soap dish?\n\n* Phone had the wrong room # on it.\n\n* After waiting for the bell boy to come and get my stuff after check out for almost an hour, the security guard finally helped us out. Actually he ended up helping us out with several different things. Doesn't anyone else work?\n\n* No menus in room so we can call in orders or even have the option of eating in the room.\n\n* Jacuzzi tub is not a jacuzzi tub since the jets are all closed. The front desk guy told me at check out that they closed all of the jets because they had problems with people putting dead flowers in them and it makes things messy? Um ok. They should just be called TUBS then not jacuzzi tubs.\n\n* Tub wasn't cleaned before my arrival which most of my friend's had issues with too. They had partially uncleaned rooms. Thankfully mine was clean except the tub. \n\n* Wifi goes in and out. The front desk told me that there is a user and password to get in but it's an unsecured connection so the user and password is not needed. \n\n* Manager says something will be taken care of yet I need to keep checking back and following up. Did not like that.\n\n* At the end of our stay, even with the contacts with the manager, we only got a credit for the resort fees? Not sufficient.\n\n\nAll in all I did like the comfy feel of the place. I guess it helped that so many of us stayed at the hotel. We were all on the bottom floor except for one room I think so it was nice walking to everyones rooms and hanging out outside. I just wish I didn't have to deal with the emails, calls, and all the waiting. I definitely could have lived without that.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Zp9CZaLRPRpdS6zSaZBf4w"}

It is not fair to judge a place just for a quick trip to pick up dessert, but Kinh Do makes one of the worst Che Ba Mau I have ever had. The mung beans are replaced by whole white beans from a jar.

It was not sweet at all. With so much ice in the cup, it quickly melted and watered down everything.\n\nInstead of giving an unfair and scathing review, the true test of a Vietnamese restaurant lies in one of the noodle soups; Pho, Bun Bo Hue, or Hu Tieu. An order of Pho Dac Biet went in and what was presented was a large bowl of steaming hot, meat filled glory. Add in heaps of bean sprouts, mint leaves, jalapenos, and a squeeze of lemon and it is ready for devouring. Are their better pho out there? Sure, but my dad is probably happy that I don't harass him to spend 14 hours watching over the pot. Kinh Do will do until he busts out the pot in winter.\n\nThe Cha Gio were also delicious.

Love the painted walls and the layout is not too crowded and not as loud. I would suggest a long communal table- truly Spanish style!\n\nHostess I called was much friendlier and more helpful than original location, and we had no wait to be seated (a first!)

There is always a learning curve at any new place, and I took that in to account in this review.\n\nGarden Variety Salad- smaller than the original location and not as many \"goodies\" but still very edible!\n\nBoquerones (Anchovy toast)- Good but bread not toasted- had to send back.  Beautiful presentation and this cook likes to use his sauce bottles;)\n\nArtichoke toast- Bread not toasted (really? it's on the menu as toast) and there was a little push back from the waiter when I sent them back to be toasted. Oil and dressing were fanstastic on these- much more flavorful than the original!\n\nMac n Cheese- excellent!\n\nStuffed Chilis- Amazing and on par with the original location.\n\nStaff\nWaiter had too many tables and wasn't all that attentive. He wasn't as familiar with the menu as I would have hoped- but again, they just opened. Luckily for him, he had good support.\n\nBusboy- AMAZING! If he wasn't trained at the original location, I would be surprised. He was very attentive and bent over backwards to make sure our meal was perfect after we sent back the toast(s).\n\nManager?- there was someone in a suit flittering around, not sure who he was, but he didn't stop and address the table- only the staff when we sent something back. Would have been nice for him to have received our feedback personally, not just from the staff. No harm done though, and I was glad to see someone was there.\n\nOverall- I can't wait for this place to gain some more experience and really shine!

I told them Millers Ale House was a good choice.   We arrived and there was a bouncer at the door he stopped us and informed us that there was a cover charge.

I cannot recall the exact charge but regardless, they would not let us in to eat unless we paid for a UFC fight that we did not want to see.  \n\nSo my problem with this place is an obvious identity crisis.  They did a great job marketing themselves for dining and drinks now they want to charge a cover to watch a UFC fight that myself or my group could care less about.  I watched as several other customers left disappointed because they just wanted to dine as well.  I had no idea that Millers Ale House was a venue for UFC fight broadcasts.  So if this is they're business model, count me out.  I do not follow UFC and I am certainly not going to take a chance that another UFC fight is going to exclude me from dining at Millers.  \n\nToo bad, because they accomplished building a repeat customer base only to alienate and exclude them from coming back to dine.

Now that Tempe Improv is closed, I would say Stand Up Scottsdale is my new favorite comedy venue in the Valley. I love the dark atmosphere, the wait staff is super-friendly and down-to-earth, and the comedians who perform are seasoned.\n\nOn Thursday night, Bully Mammoth put on a phenomenal show, with a variety style that included fun trivia games, engaging characters doing their own stand-up acts and a few sketches in the format the troupe is known for.\n\nI was highly impressed that all their material was completely different than what I'd seen at Tempe Center for the Arts a few weeks ago, and it's nice they respect their regulars by bringing new material to their shows. Catch them next at Tempe Center for the Arts Saturday, August 18.\n\nSaturday night's show featured members from another local sketch comedy troupe, Duck in Cover. This was my first time seeing any of the members perform, but I'm definitely going to be checking them out again soon.\n\nBesides being talented stand-up comics, the ensemble also makes comedy videos. Member James Mabry did a great job opening for Bully Mammoth earlier in the week, and last night Matt Anderson, Jeffrey Wiles and Ricardo Rocha kept the crowd laughing. They perform together as Duck in Cover Wednesday, August 15, at Stand Up Live in Phoenix.\n\nThe house was packed for headliner Rothbart, who really impressed the crowd throughout the night with his intelligent comedic approach.\n\nHe touched on everything from crushing children's dreams, to the scariness of babies, to dolphins raping humans -- and it was all super-funny. Rothbart has appeared on MTV's Punk'd and is an actor splitting time between Los Angeles and New York. He'll be appearing in the new Martin Scorsese/Leonardo DiCaprio film The Wolf of Wall Street, which I am so excited to check out!\n\nStand Up Scottsdale owner Howard Hughes also performed Saturday night, and it was neat to talk to him after the show and hear his insistence that only high-quality performers grace his stage. It's nice to see such a passionate comedy venue owner, and with affordable ticket prices, there's no reason you shouldn't check out the venue, too!", "type": "review", "business_id": "M3cJ47HMJaObeI5WtIw71Q"}

CHICKEN (STRIPS) DINNER!\n\nLooks like Raising Cane's just might have some competition! When you think of chicken strips, what comes to mind is deep fried battered chicken strips. Traditionally, that's what has always been known. \n\nBut then this place turns it up a notch, actually two notches, not just by offering you FRIED, but also GRILLED and BAKED as well. \n\nIt's not just your typical battered fried, but they use PANKO breading, which makes it very crispy on the outside while it stays juicy on the inside. \n\nAt first I thought the GRILLED would be kind of dry, but with the first bite, I was pleasantly suprised at how tender and juicy it was with the taste of Asian marinade and honey.\n\nSame goes for the BAKED. It has a wonderful rotisserie flavor to it.\n\nAs for the sides, you have BAKED MAC N CHEESE, FRENCH FRIES, and GRILLED VEGGIES. You can't go wrong with these selections but make sure at least one of your choices is the baked mac n cheese. Not only is it what you expect, but they also put MOZZARELLA on top of it!\n\nOf course you gotta have a sauce to dip you chicken strips in so here's the lowdown.\nYou get your choice of 9 sauces. (in alphabetical order)\n\n1. Barbeque\n2. BFG\n3. Buffalo\n4. Cheese \n5. Honey Mustard\n6. Ranch\n7. Sweet Chili\n8. Teriyaki\n9. Wasabi Cream\n\nThese are all self explantory except for BFG and Wasabi Cream.\nThe BFG is there secret signature sauce comparable to Raising Canes. The Wasabi Cream tastes just like a sweet, cream cheese type of sauce with just a little bit of spicy kick of wasabi.\n\nSince this is the only location in existence, any time you are in the area, try to take advantage if you are close by. If you are gonna dine in be aware that they only have about 6 tables inside and about 3 tables outside. They are located to the left of Home Depot.\n\nAll in all, I would definitely go back and recommend this place to anybody. Service was nice and they get your food out to you pretty quick. The one only negative I can say is that the strips are just a tad bit small. If you are really hungry, you just might have to order extra strips or sides to compensate. \n\nSo what are you doing still reading this review? Go already! What are you, chicken?

Laura took care of us and did a great job being our server. We started the festivities off with the happy hour nachos which comes with ground beef, sour cream, pico de gallo, cheese and jalepenos. The nachos were ok but nothing spectacular.\n\n Then my favorite part of the evening came next, they had Strawberry Lemonade on the menu,,,,,,,,,,Win! My wife loves Strawberry Lemonade and this Blue 32's version was definitely 5 stars. Every restaurant we go into she asks if they serve Strawberry Lemonade, the answer is usually no. Then she asks if they have Rasberry Lemonade and the answer is usually no. Then the server will respond that they have regular pink lemonade (the smart servers usually offer to have the bartender attempt to make the drink anyways). And she ends up having water. Needless to say, we saved a good 5 minutes in the ordering process.\n\nMy sons wolfed down the bacon cheeseburgers with the fries. They commented on how the fries were different and very tasty. Obviously the burgers were tasty as well. My wife enjoyed the grilled chicken sandwich with the honey mustard. \n\nI had the Monte Cristo Sandwich which comes with this outstanding rasberry jam and fries. But I swapped out my fries for onion rings for an extra buck. The sandwich is cut into quarters, although I wish it was cut into halves since the meat kinda slips out of the bread when cut into quarters. I enjoyed the Monte Cristo, it was ok but not outstanding. However, the rasberry jam saved the day and made the Monte Cristo very tasty, I even had to ask for some more jam. Their Onion Rings are some of the best I have ever had (they also have them on the happy hour menu). The bill came to $57.03 for 4 entrees, 4 drinks and an appetizer. Part of the equation in rating any restaurant for me is the value for the meal when combined with the taste of the food, service and ambiance.

The food on the other hand , blah.

They called it aioli ,it wasn't even close to an aioli, but delicious all the same.   \nAlmondigas con Tomate - essentially frozen meat balls sitting in canned spaghetti sauce.\nTortilla de Patatas - Potatoes used to make it - frozen \n Pisto gratinado~ cauliflower in Iberico b\u00e9chamel sauce covered in puff pastry - 2nd best dish we had. \nThe highlight of the meal was an open faced empanada with roasted garlic and goat cheese. I don't see it on the online menu to get the actual name but it was gooey, garlicy,goat cheesy and I could have eaten 3 of them. \nCava Sangria - tasty, tart and a great deal. The Sangria on its own is $8 a glass but by the pitcher it is only $36.

I'm also not going to go to detailed into the service because the place was packed and had several large parties of self entitled Scottsdaleites blocking the aisles and demanding much more attention than was necessary but I will say it was about 30 mins before we got our drinks and over an hour before we got our 1st dish.

I'm talking a serious customer base that will elevate this unique little Hawaiian joint to the level it deserves. \n\nIt's completely different from any other Hawaiian food out there. Honestly, most of that island fare is kind of bland by my standards. Bland macaroni salad, bland rice, bland pulled pork. Blah, blah, blah.\n\nMaui Dog turns all these tired standards on their nose and tosses some wicked ridiculous flavor combos together. Who would have thought that a sweet pineapple and coconut slaw would have worked so well on dawgs and sliders? The aioli and shaggy-style island dog are also pretty fantastic. \n\nPlus they have Spam. SPAM! I love my pre-formed, processed pork products. Mmm hmm. \n\nAlso a big fan of the fries and tater tots. (Everywhere should offer the far superior tot as an option in my opinion.) They are a bit soggy instead of super crisp, but I'm one of those queer birds that just loves soggy taters. Grease esssplosion in yo mouth!\n\nThey have a drive-thru! They take cards! The guy that owns the place is hella nice and will chat your ear off! It's colorful! And different! But not so different that it's pretentious and annoying! I can't offer any more justifications. Get your ass to Maui Dog.

Out of 4 (of a block of 6). I'm probably not going back for my last 2. Bristo Yoga does get a 3rd star because I did enjoy the '1' of my 1.5 class, but the rest of it ends in an 'eh'. \n\nOn the first day of class, I turn up 20mins early (eager beaver) but due to some seriously poor directions and map, myself and 6 other students end up in the wrong place - turns out there are two St Columba's up by the Castle... and we were at the wrong one. Arriving 20mins late meant a mild rebuke from the teacher, initially offered no changing area (but then suggested that I could creep over to the bathroom), no warm up, a rushed yoga session (I did ask for the teacher to slow down at one point), and I hurt my neck trying to rush a shoulder stand. I walked out feeling stressed and angry... and really not feeling the benefit that normally comes with such a class. After wards, I felt mutinous more than anything and not really in the mood to return. \n\nNow, as a gesture, Bristo did offer an apology and a free drop in class. So that was nice. \n\nI made myself return for week 2 - that was a very different experience from the first. The session was smoother, the positions more clearly explained, and I didn't walk out in a pissy mood, so I felt in a much more positive position about the class. Hurrah! The only downside was when asked for injuries, I noted I had bad knees only to be brushed off with a comment along the lines of 'oh well, don't we all'. Right, everyone's smashed their legs up in motorcycle accidents? Of course, silly me... I would have preferred possibly a less cursory response.\n\nWeek 3 was a washout as I was ill. \n\nWeek 4, I had the day off. That meant in order to come to class, I was going to have to travel for a solid hour in order to get there in time. It was, in fact 90 mins, with another 30mins prep time. 2 hours, in total as Lothian Transports estimates were completely messed up. A bus expected to arrive a good clear 30mins early, meant that I arrived instead 30mins late and have hmmm... 5mins to run from George Street, up to Johnson Terrace. I made it to the venue, 3-4mins past the start of the class. When ringing the doorbell, there was no answer. I rang a couple of times, before another girl joined me. After the third, failed attempt, I decided, time to go hit up the pub. For you see, it was my birthday, and I figured, do I want to spend more time being upset outside of a yoga class, or should I just go and enjoy the remainder of my evening? Given that I had given up the opportunity to spend the beginning of my 33rd year with my family in order to go to my yoga class, traveled for so long and to be felled at the last (well, 4) minute, just brought it to a head for me. So I embraced the unhealthy option of a couple of rum and cokes at Banshee Labyrinth waiting for the Silent Reviewer to show up. \n\nThe fact that St Columba's is a pain in the ass to access (ring a bell, wait a good 5mins for the teacher to climb a couple of floors to open the door, this may take a few attempts) and the zero tolerance on tardiness leaves me just... disappointed and disheartened. Although I appreciate that late attendees can have a minor impact on a yoga class, in previous experience it hasn't been that big a deal - and until Lothian Transport smarten up their act, I don't feel confident that I can always make it to a location in time. I had heard so many good things about Bristo Yoga, but in reality, I didn't experience the warm and fuzzies when I went to class, week 1 made me feel as unwelcome as rotten fish in a fridge and week 2 whilst an improvement, didn't have me in the land of friendliness. I still enjoy practicing yoga, but perhaps for this particularly yogi-newbie, that practice will be taking place elsewhere.", "type": "review", "business_id": "RZRZeFDqPJXq485DMUJh7Q"}

The only snafu I can recall is the back bar running out of clean pint glasses, which resulted in a completely benign wait. \n\nPerhaps my expectations aren't as stringent as other reviewers but I've found the waitresses and bar staff to be both competent and charming. Really, there's so much going on around you, what with bowling, club music, sports and pretty folk everywhere, who notices if the food is coming out slowly?\n\nSpeaking of the food, the price of the lunch and bowl special, which includes a choice of two sliders, fries, and free game of bowling, recently rose from 5 to 9 bucks but that was to be expected, plus it's still a really good value. The sliders (beef, pork sausage, chicken or tuna) are no joke and the fries, which come in modern stainless cups, are always hot and flavorful. I can't speak to the small plates, salads or pizza but I'll bet the menu redefines the words \"bowling alley food.\"\n\nQuick Tips: 1) Make sure you get on their mailing list to receive the food and bowling coupons; and 2) If you're planning a large party--corporate outing, birthday, whatever--make sure you call and try to work a deal.

I was successful in getting my girlfriends to agree to not go to the same Mexican place we always go to for lunch in Vegas (it's good, but I wanted something new), we were going to try Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill in the Forum Shops in Caesar's Palace.\n\nLuckily for us, Mesa Grill was closed between lunch/dinner hours. \nI say luckily for us because instead we headed over to Max Brenner's at the request of one of my friends who had heard the menu was all inspired by chocolate. I was thinking things like Mexican moles, or cocoa rubbed steak. I had no idea what was coming!\n\nWe headed in starving, after a long afternoon at the beautiful Mirage pool, and were ready to go to town on some grub. As soon as we opened the menu, it was like angels were singing from the high heavens. So much to choose from! \n\nWe started with two appetizers - the spinach artichoke fondue dip and the AMAZING chicken, bacon and cheddar rolls. The spinach artichoke fondue was pretty much like any other I'd had before, which didn't make it any less amazing. Very tasty and piping hot. But the real star was the chicken, bacon and cheddar rolls with a maple glaze. \n\nThey came out, and really weren't what I expected when I ordered them - they were better. Everything good in the world, chicken, cheese, bacon, maple, spice rolled up and stuck with a toothpick, with some yummy sauce at the bottom of the plate for dipping. JESUS these were good. Perfect amount of spicy, melty deliciousness! My mouth is watering just thinking about them. \n\nMy friend Kristen and I also ordered a side of the waffle fries dusted with cocoa powder and some spice. They came with a delicious spicy mayo type of dipping sauce. These were the perfect consistency and they flew out of the cone they came in and into our mouths!\n\nWe had already done more than our fair share of eating by the time our entrees came out, but that didn't make them any less exciting! I had the pan toasted penne alfredo. GOOD GOD was it delicious! The alfredo sauce wasn't too think or creamy, just flavorful, which was amazing. The pasta was the perfect consistency with a little bit of bite back - al dente. It also came with two DELICIOUS breadsticks with melted garlic and butter and a very spicy but delicious powder on them... chipotle? Chili powder? Dunno. \n\nThe other star of the table was the extra cheesy crunchy macaroni and cheese. This thing was gigantic and SO GOOD. Toasted cheese on top for crunch, creamy cheesy macaroni, plus fresh diced tomatos and BACON. Plus a side of marinara! We were all reaching across the table to steal bites of this from our friend.\n\nTwo other friends had paninis. I didn't try them, so no review, but they looked great!\n\nWhen our waitress asked if we wanted dessert, two of us were shaking our heads \"oh god no\" and two were shaking \"oh hell yes.\" So they ended up getting the S'mores Concoction... chocolate mousse, marshmallow fluff, graham cracker bits and melted chocolate. Plus saut\u00e9ed bananas and an actual s'more, with a side of caramel for drizzling. HOLY GOD. Even though we had said NO WAY to dessert, we couldn't help indulging in at least a couple of bites and they were heavenly. \n\nI'm coming back to you Max Brenner! I LOVE YOU! LOVE ME BACK!

It is pretty extreme, but I decided to brush it off.\n\nThe plane slowly started to take off and we started to see that there were already some problems: the plane was old and couldn't resist turbulence. For the first 15 minutes that the plane was in the air, the entire cabin was shaking around so much that the passengers started to hold on tightly to the walls of the plane. I felt nauseous by how much the plane was dropping up and down and twisting around. It didn't feel safe at all. \n\nThe second issue is that most of the flights are delayed. The planes arrive late frequently and it's hard to get to another connecting flight if it is an unreliable airline.\n\nThird issue is the customer service through the phone. I tried calling the 1-800 number for baggage service and information about the airline. There are only four options and you can not speak to a single operator. The phone line hangs up on you after 10 seconds if you don't respond. \n\nUnreliability is one thing. Just because you consider yourself a discount airline doesn't mean you should be making your flights not safe for your passengers. I'm sorry, but that is where I draw the line. No thanks, Spirit, not again. \n\nOn another note: Spirit Airlines will call themselves the fasted growing airline in the US. I just hope they look into replacing their airplane engines if they are honestly the fastest growing airline.", "type": "review", "business_id": "GhQQsSApIRfUmIcqzmSaGA"}

It was authentic home-cooked food, made with love.  Sounds corny, but if you spend much time on the road, it's not worth guessing by judging a book by its cover.  And this strip mall appearance would normally just result in a drive-by.  You would never even see it set back from the road.\n\nHad the herring appetizer which was awesome, and the swai filet.  It was buttery and soft, as you might expect.  The side dishes (kraut, cole slaw, beets, potatoes) all had a very original flavor and I liked most of them...a few were kind of heavy/creamy (the beets) and dill is used often - but that's what you mostly expect from cuisine from this region of Europe.  Gave 5 stars for the overall experience - food quality, price, quantity, ambiance, service, and love.  As Hanna (the owner) said about running this restaurant, \"You have to love it\".  And everyone there does, including the many regular customers.  I'll be back again Hanna.  So you can call me a \"regular customer too\".

You also have to order a miso soup or a beverage to get this deal, so it ends up coming out to right under $20 w/ tax, which is still an outrageously great value.  **A few of the items require a $2 up charge, but you don't have to order those.  \n\nWe ended up ordering two of the specials, here is what he had:\n\nMiso Soup - Balanced flavors, a little on the salty side but still quit satisfying.\n\nJapanese \"Ceviche\" - Chopped sashimi (tuna, salmon, and yellowtail) with some jalapenos, red pepper in a soy/miso based sauce.  This dish was tasty and fresh, but not a lot of fish really.  \n\nAgedashi Tofu - Topped with grated Daikon radish in a light soy sauce.  Good flavor, but the inside of the tofu was a bit slimy.  It didn't seem like they used firm tofu, which could be why it was more gloppy than I've had elsewhere. \n\nCreamy Rock Shrimp - Small shrimp tossed in a heavy mayo/sriraucha sauce.  The shrimp were mushy beneath the heavy sauce.  I'd avoid this one, there are better options. \n\nCreamy Rock Shrimp w/ spicy tuna sushi - Same complaint about the shrimp as above, although this time it was on top of a spicy tuna roll.  It was just too much going on, too much mayo, and not enough pronounced flavor.\n\nCrispy rice w/ spicy tuna - The rice was perfectly crisped to give that crunchy texture, but the tuna itself was lacking a lot of flavor.  It wasn't spicy, however the sliver of jalapeno on top helped add  a little heat. \n\nShrimp Tempura roll - Very standard.  I liked that the roll wasn't huge, so the pieces were a reasonable size to take down in one gobble.  \n\n\n\nI left the meal with a bit of a stomach ache, most likely from the heavy mayo sauce on the shrimp dishes.

We had heard that you can order food from Al's Garage, since they are owned by the same company.  He said yes, and brought us menu's.  Another 30 minutes went by, and I had to go up to the bar to ask the bartender to get the server for us so that we could order our food. \n\nI do have to say, the inside of the establishment was completely dead, so we couldn't understand what the problem was.  The server later told us that he was also the only server working the outside patio, so that turned out to be why we were being ignored.  Hire more people!!\n\nOnce we finally ordered, the food came.  I ordered a quesadilla, and it was actually pretty good.  I had given my drink back to the server, and ordered a Mr. Pibb instead.  My girlfriends ordered chicken fingers. How can you mess up chicken fingers? They said they were really good.\n\nI liked the decor.  The bathroom smelled wonderful with whatever air freshener they use, but it was very broken down.  The first stall glass was missing, so that one was out of order.

I told him to just check the pool. Darren told me to keep the level lower because it was leaking around the top, and he put skimmer/underfloor valve back together wrong (or broke it, I need to get someone else over here to fix that). Why he messed with it at all, when I said to just check the pool, I have no idea.\n           Then Darren got hostile with me over the phone when I called him after I checked the system.

Food consistency is crap. Either the chicken taco's are too spicy or very bland, or the green chile burrito is too hot or barely spicy.

The ambiance is lovely too - I am so in love with the piano behind the bar and the wonderful musicians they have!!  \n\nThe thing that's best about this place is that the food is always so flavorful and there is no guilt or remorse for eating too much or eating food that makes you feel overly full later.    Often I leave here with leftovers too, so portions are still filling.  My favorite meal is the Scallops by far, always so good!   The filet won't lead you astray either. \n\nI was doing HCG and hadn't eaten out in months.  I called ahead and asked if the chef could prepare a meal with no oil, no sugar, no dairy and lo and behold they happily agreed.  This was the first restaurant that said 'no problem!'   \n\nI ordered jumbo shrimp and it came well seasoned and with assurance that it was prepared to order.

I ordered them and out came a cast iron skillet of shrimp and sausage in a tomato sauce, with some grits in a bowl on the side...not what I was expecting!  The tomato sauce was really bland and gave no flavor whatsoever to the shrimp.  The grits were nice and creamy, but nothing special enough to save the dish.  I fished out the sausage, which had a nice heat to it, and just ate that.  The cheddar bacon biscuits on the side were quite good, and I was glad I had them.  I also had the Tomato Ricotta salad to start...I don't think the lettuce was washed very well because about half of the bites tasted like dirt, but I enjoyed the fresh ricotta.\n\nMy family enjoyed their food more than me, but I was blown away by the staff's service and concern that I had not gotten enough to eat.  They wanted to bring me another dish and when I declined they even offered to package me up a meal to go, A+ for service!  I declined and opted to order dessert...it was my birthday after all...and when the bill came they had removed both my entr\u00e9e and the dessert!  I will say the white sangria was excellent and the mac & cheese with pancetta was delicious...I would be willing to give Beckett's another try...just not when I am in the mood for shrimp & grits!", "type": "review", "business_id": "I4bSn5gXsHuSPu7L-d_8nQ"}

We were greeted warmly and taken to the table. Interesting enough, the first thing i noticed here is the deco, very contemporary american diner setting, yeah, that's how I could describe. The dinner tables and chairs are clearly divided into two colors, beige-ish or dark chocolate-ish, somehow there were no specific color match arrangement or setting, it was a bit random to me.\n\nWhile the hostess was very nice, our waitress had a I-do-not-want-to-work-on-sundays face, I think that just described enough. My entree was the butternut squash risotto. The presentation of this dish was good at a first sight, but when you look at it closely, I don't understand why the fried almost turned black brussels leaves are floating around, it was oily and tasteless. If you want to add a touch of green to the dish, maybe don't fry it as much so it would stay at green. Overall the dish was too salty for me, and a bit too rich as well....Though my friend enjoyed his shrimp and sausage dish very much.\n\nMaybe next time...", "type": "review", "business_id": "I4bSn5gXsHuSPu7L-d_8nQ"}

I do agree that our server was inappropriate with the comment she made referring to you and your friend being Loud and Making a Scene in Public, nothing to do with being gay, how would she even know? Yoli says that your friend repeatedly told her you waited 10 mins not 15..Maybe the wait was to long for your taste since you were really hungry. It was a beautiful morning and enjoying the patio and the beautiful garden it what people do. Possibly taking the other tables order was an oversight, You stated that since you waited to long you were going to leave and not pay your bill for the coffee, that Teddy is theft and you would never do that if you where in a store and the line was too long so you just walk out with a drink, right? The server more than wanted to accommodate you after you made a fuss, including my wife. Regardless if there were 3 tables or 30 tables full, learn to have patience. Yoli was busy in the kitchen helping make 2 large to-go orders, many things you don't know happen in a restaurant. We both have Family and Friends that are part of the LGBT community and we nor our employees would ever discriminate against anyone. The whole new level of 2nd class citizen was really Amplified by your friend calling my wife a Wetback which you failed to mention in your review. He should be ashamed of his actions. We care about and even love our customers which you could still be, as we invite you and your friend back for breakfast or lunch and we both can make some apologies and have a better day.

Such an amazing concept to have an open kitchen that allows patrons to see their food being prepared fresh! It has such a great vibe and a big reason alone I love this place! I know that when I dine at True Food Kitchen that I will be not only getting really fantastic food, but I know that it's fresh! \n\nTheir menu is full of fresh and seemingly healthy options - and It's all great tasting too! The several times I have been here I usually opt for a Kale Aid juice, which is freshly juiced and might I add delicious concoction of  Kale, Apple, Cucumber, Celery,\nLemon & Ginger. It reminds me of a drink that I used to get at Pressed Juicery in Malibu CA! The Edamame Dumplings are fresh and tasty - the only criticism I would give is that the truffle oil really over powers the beautiful flavor of the edamame, I think in the future I would opt for the dumplings minus the Truffle Oil.  But the absolute best thing on the menu would be the Panang Curry! It rivals some of my favorite and might I add authentic Thai joints in Los Angeles....  it's full of Brown Rice, Potato, Broccoli, Ginger, Carrot, Mushroom & a beautiful and flavorful Coconut Shellfish Broth. \n\nIt's a great addition to the Arizona food scene and if your in the area and looking for a healthy and casual but still trendy option, True Food is for you!", "type": "review", "business_id": "Zh_y9AmSfWZpR2JB9wye-A"}

I have no reservations going here for lunch or taking my family out to eat. I have been here by myself and with extended family on several occasions and the quality of food and the staff is consistent.\n\nBarro's pizza is second to none. At least for me that is. It isn't my wife's favorite but she knows I like it so much that she takes one for the team for my sake. All of the pizzas I have had from pepperoni to the works type are very good. Fresh, good ingredients, a little more sauce than other pizza joints make for an awesome pie. Please don't go here and buy a salad. That would completely negate the awesome which is waiting to be made for you.\n\nThe other options are also rather good as well. The wings are not my favorite but they are still very good. They are bigger than most wings in the area and the sauce is thicker and stickier than comparable wings as well. They aren't the style I usually prefer but they are big and meaty nonetheless. The flavor is good and the heat is predictable depending on the grade you select. The salad bar always has fresh ingredients if that is your persuasion. I have had one before and they have some good dressings as well. Thankfully, my wife really likes to eat the salad while I devour the pizza she doesn't care for very much.\n\nIt's a great little pizza place. Good service, good food, good location and ambiance. Booths and large tables for lots of people or little tables for a quick lunch. I would definitely recommend.", "type": "review", "business_id": "xbZo8aMOOobPRzHKqmA88g"}

It's very comforting in an age where fast food means sloppy and processed to be able to get a quality burger, made quickly with fresh ingredients. \n\nIn-n-out has a pretty extensive \"secret\" menu that can take your meal to the next level if you so chose. My order always includes well done fries (extra crispy), mustard fried patty and chopped chiles which add an amazing bite to an already delicious burger. \n\nOne of my friends has a gluten allergy and this is one of the few traditional fast food places where she can eat the fries because they're made fresh and don't have preservatives (where the gluten apparently is factored in). \n\nDon't eat meat? They apparently make a mean grilled cheese but vegans beware they cook it on the same grill with the meat. \n\nThis location is always packed at lunch time but the staff moves quick and it doesn't take long for them to get your meal put together from scratch. \n\nIts very simple: you love in-n-out or you don't!", "type": "review", "business_id": "7WGQoWtfHYnjMtFAoEv99g"}

My guy got the unlimited wine, but the server was not very attentive, so we really paid $9 for two glasses of wine.  Not terrible, but still, we were there long enough that she should have at least offered a refill 4 times. \n\nThe food was mostly fabulous! Almost everything is in a small bowl, cup, plate, Chinese take out box, pot or pan.  Very cute presentation.  Bone Marrow! I've never had bone marrow, but it was delicious! Duck Ravioli with a delicious creamy sauce; Fried Mozzarella Risotto Balls; Wild Boar Sloppy Joe Sliders; shot glasses with shrimp cocktail and ceviche; a wide variety of special salads (I had the roasted beet salad - yum!).  Seared salmon with parsnip puree, BBQ shrimp with white cheddar grits.  They also had a fabulous fruit, cheese, and charcuterie display.  Delicious Maytag bleu cheese, brie, something semi-hard with a coating of espresso, prosciutto, olives, marinated fancy mushrooms with focaccia and burrata cheese; hand pulled and rolled mozzarella.  My mouth is watering just recounting all the delicousness!\n\nThere was also buffet basics, like chilled crab legs (same as almost any buffet) and prime rib (delicious!)

Nicely fried with a delicious red sauce and aioli . These disappeared very quickly.\n\nGambas al Ajillo (shrimp with garlic sauce): The sauce on this dish rocked my world. Garlicky of course, but with a very deep flavor. We both wished for bread to get some more of the sauce. \n\nRape Donostiarra (monkfish with sherry): Very thinly sliced monkfish, which tastes similarly to lobster. Light sherry/olive oil sauce which was mild to let the taste of the fish through.\n\nMejillones Vapor (mussels with lemon and olive oil): Mussels were very little and the ones that weren't gritty tasted excellent. Sauce was very buttery, but went well with the mussels.\n\nSetas al Ajillo (wild mushrooms): Hen of the woods mushrooms with a side of mashed potatoes.

You don't even realize the noodles are whole wheat, because they're just so good with the sauce and the shitakes. Our waiter suggested we opt for the Tuna Ceviche as opposed to the Ceviche Pargo and I could've, no wait--should've hugged him for it. The tuna was so fresh. The soy it was bathed in and amaranth seeds that topped it really enhanced the fish in a way that is pretty indescribable. \n\nWe also ordered the Queso Fundido, and the XO Scallops in XO Sauce. I wouldn't recommend either because you didn't really come here for melted cheese and I don't want you to pay $18.88 for two golf-sized scallops, respectively. That was our mistake--but don't make it yours! A side note, they were both good, but not great and your hard earned dollars deserve GREAT, okay?\n\nAfter dollar signs kept racing through my head as I tried to figure out the damage, I wasn't really up to pay another double-digit figure for dessert, but the lady next to us devoured her Mango Sticky Rice in a matter of minutes, so we thought, we'd come this far. #YOLO \n\nAnyways, it was so incredibly good! It's not your traditional Thai-place-MSR by any means. It's so light and airy and everything in it just works so well that as I write this all I really want to do is drive down to the Cosmopolitan in my jammies and order it. \n\nAs far as the service, and given it was a Tuesday night, we got seated right away. Our waiter, Miller, was awesome! He didn't shy away from putting his two-cents when he knew we were making potentially catastrophic mistakes trying to decide what to eat and God bless him for it.", "type": "review", "business_id": "cMvN1j-LK64zqmT4vnl8NA"}

Besides a large blow-up zebra being thrown off the stage, lots of smoke, flashing lights, and random exploding things...I don't remember much about his performance. But, I had an awesome time nonetheless. The energy of the crowd was off-the-wall and was probably one of the primary contributors to the awesomeness of the night. \n\nWe mainly stayed on the top level since this was where LMFAO was performing. However, this suited me just fine since the top level was also my favorite. Similarly to XS, it features the 1/2 outdoor-1/2 indoor layout with a pool as well. \n\nIf you're coming on a night when LMFAO will be there and you actually want to see something, DON'T MOVE if you manage to squeeze into a spot with decent views of the stage. As it gets closer to performance time (1am on the night we went), they start roping areas off, leaving only crappy side views behind. \n\nThe only drawback to Marquee is all the stairs you have to hike up before entering the actual club. I'm sure many lady reviewers have mentioned this already, but hiking up a few flights of stairs in 5 inch heels is no fun :( Lucky for me, quite a few of my friends are podiatrists in training, and given all the abuse I put my poor feet through, I'm almost positive I'll be needing their expertise sometime in the future. \n\nI'm not sure how much cover would normally be for guys and girls since my friend who knew a promoter got our group of 15 in for free. But even if I had paid $20-$30, I still would've managed to party my money's worth. \n\nI may have been hurting on our flight back home the following morning, but Marquee was well worth the discomfort.

It could have benefitted from having a side of clarified butter that I could apply as needed (quite the opposite experience of my roll at Rocco's).\n\nFor those looking for a roll where the lobster is in a mayo-based mix with celery, green onions, etc. they have a lobster salad roll for $7.99.\n\nMy UConn roll was pretty good, but not as amazing as I had hoped. Not a big fan of the crinkle cut fries either. The value is decent for the amount of meat you get, but I'm not sure I'd get it again.", "type": "review", "business_id": "UFf1nfDi1p_301ty6u9IFA"}

After walking the strip to check out the new Bagatelle, my husband and I decided to stop for lunch at this cute cafe next to the pool.  We probably waited about half and hour to be seated, but understood that there was a small line, so we were patient.  After being seated, we ordered and were given  our drinks....and we waited...and waited.  We were seated at 2:00.  At 2:42 I was tired and starving, and annoyed, with an empty iced tea glass.  No one came by to let us know what was taking so long or to fill our glasses.  So I called our server over as she walked by (and she was not easy to catch)  and politely asked what happened to our order.  She said the kitchen was busy and everything was taking a long time.  About 10 minutes later, our order came...and I couldn't believe what was on my plate.  I had ordered a smoked salmon salad that was supposed to have bacon hazelnuts and figs...sounded delicious.  Well, when it arrived, is was some of those pre-packaged lox on a pile of wilted lettuce covered with vinagrette with 2 figs and a sprinkle of sliced hazelnuts. It looked awful, and certainly was not worthy of the $16or hour long wait.   I was starving and did not want to ruin our day, so I called our server over and asked for the bacon that was described on the menu.  She brought over a small plate of bacon.  I poured it on the salad and tried to eat.  I could not cut the lox.  They had gotten hard and dried up.  So I took a bite of the salad and it tasted as though it had been doused with pure vinegar.  The harshness went straight to my stomach and I ran straight to the ladies room for fear of throwing up.\nMy husband was going to try to eat his sandwich, but when he saw my order he stopped mid-sanwich so we could go somewhere else.  I asked him to eat if he was hungry, but he described the chicken as \"rubbery\" and was happy to find a different lunch location.  At least they did take the price of my uneaten salad off the bill. \n \nAvoid at all costs.", "type": "review", "business_id": "9SrR4mkEsyimsimrc-vP4w"}

He said to bring the car by anytime and he would run a test. I took the car in later that day and he dropped what he was doing to run a test and I was on my way in no time. He gave me his recommendation which turned out to be correct and he did not charge me for anything.  I was impressed with how I was treated so made an appointment to have my ATF, fuel filter, and oil changed the next week. Again, the work was done and, since I had just purchased the car, he went over my whole car and said everything was good and did not recommend any additional work to be done.

While sitting out on the patio and enjoying the breezy late morning environment (they open at 11 on Sundays), I enjoyed the Market BLT which was a fried egg topped with pancetta, ricotta and served on brioche. I only ate about half of the bread it was served on because it was such a large portion, but the meal was pretty good. I would have liked it to come with some fruit but I'll know to ask for that next time. I noticed a dog sitting on the patio, which made me wonder if they have a dog friendly patio.

The beef stew noodle was also lacking in the amount of noodles and the noodles were still clumped up. The beef was so tough, and there were 7 or 8 pieces of anise in the bowl. Too much.\n\nThe mongolian grill was next as I figured, this will be better since I can choose my own stuff. NOPE. There was hardly any flavoring in the stirfry, the meats were awful quality, and no sauces really to flavor it all.\n\nThey have standard \"Chinese\" buffet fare like beef broccoli, spring rolls and orange chicken, in addition to some dim sum.

Next up, a plate of tender and rosy duck given texture not by crisp skin but rather crunchy pistachios and millet nearly the texture of mashed potatoes tinged with rosemary and bitter greens.  Not to be outdone, my mother's meatloaf was rich and artistically plated; a classic texture made unique with rich herbal/earthy notes to balance the briny demi-glace and pork.\n\nHeading to the home stretch and opting to outsource sweets to Tracey Dempsey, a wise move made by many local kitchens, I think I can confidently say that what landed before me was good but what was presented to my mother is a dish she still talks about today - a layer-by-layer temporal change in texture and flavor that was not quite a budino or a pot de cr\u00e8me, nor a parfait - just a decadent sweet-meets-salty amalgam that was truly amongst the ten best desserts I enjoyed in 2012; a reason in and of itself to visit Citizen Public House...amongst many others.", "type": "review", "business_id": "MuIXnv7Oq7X3-4aEsp9dDA"}

It is amazing. Reservations are highly recommended to this place. We were seated immediately after checking in with the hostess who happens to be outside La Cave (one of the walkways of Wynn).\n\nWe were seated in a dark room with a view of the pool area. In fact, the whole place was dimly lit. Our waiter took forever to serve our table (15-20 minutes after being seated). I was rather disappointed with this. He apologized for this, but this is not the way to make a good initial impression. We started out with wine flights. I had the French wine flight and one of my other friends had the Italian wine flight.  The Italian wine flight was clean and crisp, typical of what you would find in an Italian villa. The French wine flight was full of flavor with a kick after each sip. I believe that both of those wine flights were great. I think that the Italian wine flight was $25 and the French wine flight was $30 for 4 tastings each. The wine flights had half reds and half white wines. You drink incrementally from light to dark so you drink the whites first before you drink the reds.\n\nMake sure you bring lots of money because for the three of us, it was almost 100 bucks per each person. I have to say that the dishes we had were so good. I think the combination of all the flavors as you take a bite of each Tapas item was orgasmic. We had the Jumbo Lump Crab Cakes, the Diver Sea Scallops with Polenta Cake, the Gorgonzola Salad, Sliced Sirloin Steak with Mushroom Fondue, Mushroom Grits, Beef Filet with Crostini, etc. Do not order everything at the same time. Order in batches so your food is warm when it comes out of the kitchen. Some dishes are quick but some take a while so you should consult your waiter about the lead times.

On one hand, the experience was ridiculously amazing; it is nice being diners #140 and 141(since the place has opened).  But on the other hand, the food was not. \n\nIt's challenging to come up with an appropriate star rating to balance out the two.  It's also hard since the price was $250 plus tax/per person.  As the previous reviewer mentioned, that price does include food, wine, gratuity, and an awesome experience.  I keep asking myself if it was worth it...I'm not sure that it is.\n\nThe evening was a special one though.  We arrived, checked in at the reservation desk and were waiting to be seated for the 8:30 seating.  One of our 'hosts' came to us, letting us know that we would need to wait for a bit, as the previous seating was wrapping up and they were preparing for our seating.  She would like to know if I would like a glass of cava while I'm waiting.  But of course!  So we're chilling in the Cosmopolitan's fun little sitting area (with billiards, checkers, funky chairs, etc.) enjoying some cava while we wait.  As we're finally seated, much of the busy Jaleo watches the 8 of us as we walk into the private E room.  There are 8 of us seated, with 5 people making sure our evening went smoothly.\n\nAnthony, our specific server, was funny, helpful, and hooked up the wine.  Frankly, I didn't care for most of the wine as it was incredibly sweet.  In fact, most of the dishes had more of a sweet element to them rather than salty or savory, which was what I was looking for.  All dishes were served at one time by the two chefs, so we needed to coordinate bathroom breaks over the 2.5 hour meal.  When it was an appropriate time to go, Anthony walked me all the way to the restroom; what a gentleman!\n\nSome of the highlights of the evening food wise were the Beet Jewelry (salty, crispy, gold-dusted--yum!), caramelized pork rinds (there's nothing like making chicharrones high class!! haha), the smoky oysters in escabeche, secreto of iberico, and, the star of the night really, the Jose Taco and artichoke with caviar.  The Jose Taco was a lovely slice of Jamon Iberico de Bellota with a dollop of caviar on top, to be rolled like a taco (really a taquito, i think).  YUMYUM!!!  And the roasted baby artichoke with caviar and quail egg inside. Divine!  I would like ten more of those please, rather than some of the flowery, fruity dishes we were given.\n\nThe most disheartening thing of the night (other than the bill, haha) was the Whole Lobe of Foie Gras baked in Salt.  I love Foie Gras, seriously.  They showed us this beautiful lobe that has been crusted in tantalizing sea salt and baked.  I was very excited.  We were all given our own slices; they were sitting there, glistening in the plate, waiting to be devoured.  Then they poured an orange juice type sauce on them.  Travesty!!! It ruined the Foie Gras.  The texture was mushy and all I tasted was juice.  Why, Jose?! Why?!\n\nI know this review reads a bit like a schizophrenic's journal, but this is how I feel about E by Jose.  The experience was once in a lifetime and the staff could not have been more accommodating.  But the food was, overall, a disappointment, especially for the price.

The meat is proportionate to the bun size, and as I said already, it was tasty.\n\nOverall, it's more like 3.5 stars, but Forefathers is still the best cheesesteak I've had in the East Valley.", "type": "review", "business_id": "3f9oR4imL5js4nMPvNIauQ"}

My friend and I went together, there were 4 couples there and a guy playing pool by himself. The bartender must have know the couples at the bar because my friend and I could barely get service when we walked up throughout the night. The place was empty!\n\nI decided maybe Thursday night wasn't their thing and went back on a Friday. There were lots more people, but mostly people watchers (like in other reviews.) I'm sorry, but if I have to be 21 to get in, I'm pretty sure you can keep \"shit\" in the song and not bleep it out.

What? $20 for $12 on a $80+ bill? \n\nWe sit down, order our first $12.50 drink, and say all you can eat, oh and, we have a GroupOn. They say \"That is not valid for ALL YOU CAN EAT\". I say, check the GroupOn fine print, there are no specifications! I spent $135 in this restaurant last time I was here. It's only $8 off! \n\nThey refuse!\n\nI pay off the drink and walk out. I eat out nearly everyday, and I will not be going back. Perhaps the manager needs some management skills. They would have easily made $500 off me this year. It's not like they didn't need the customers, we were the only table seated as the only other patrons walked out moments after we walked in. \n\n~~~ Previous review. \n\nYou can get nearly any kind of awesome seafood or meat all unlimited for like $25! Oh Gosh! I love it. They actually comped a drink for me because they were out of what I wanted! Now that's great service. \n\nThe only thing they could do is have charcoal grills, they really intensify the flavor and make the meat so much better. That and temperature control (the AC was blasting so much I had to bring in my blanket from the car) are the only reasons I'm not giving them five stars.", "type": "review", "business_id": "kvQ2riK7acx0HGNKRsbang"}

I ordered a trio of tacos (carne asada, chorizo, pastor) and a bean and cheese burrito (made with queso fresco) because I love a good flour tortilla. I washed my food down with a Mexican Coke and a horchata garnished with melon and walnuts (NICE touch, and possibly the best horchata I've tasted).\n\nMy co-worker also had tacos, plus the 'molete' (SP?), basically a mini-chimi-looking fritter filled with chorizo and potato, and lightly covered with mole sauce and sour cream. His expression told me to order one next time we go. I'm very happy to find this place so close to work, and the prices are a bargain for the quality of food being served.

They are bigger than what you are used to if you get tacos from a truck! It is twice the size of that.

The chicken tacos were okay.. it could have had more of that grilled taste, but nonetheless, I would eat it again. The carne asada tacos were my favorite! It was filled with a lot of meat and toppings on top! At the restaurant, they have a few sauces in bottles. Its fun to just try a whole bunch of sauces, but be careful if you do not like a lot of spice! The bottles are just red and green and you do not know what the spice levels are!\n\nMy favorite dish from this place that I crave all the time like a pregnant woman (i'm not expecting, however.. I just love this dish that much...) is the CEVICHE!!!! Their shrimp is made perfectly and it is so juicy with the sauces they put on top! It is dry-- not your typical wet ceviche but for sure.. THIS IS A MUST TRY dish! It is so addicting. It does not come with a lot of chips so make sure you ask for extra on the side.\n\nOverall, this place is one of my favorites.
