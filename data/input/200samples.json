The area feels a little run-down and the store itself has a plain cement floor and industrial style shelving throughout. Take the 'warehouse' part of the name very literally. The aisles and displays are also a little too close together, resulting in a mildly claustrophobic feel. The same goes for the parking lot. I imagine the narrow spaces barely hold larger trucks or SUVs.\n\nBut the 'cons' are minor quibbles compared to how frustrating it can be when you're searching for one specific product and just can't find it. BSW is easy to get to from Highway 15; check it out.\n\nEDIT TO ADD: I checked the price of the scalp treatment mentioned above at a local CVS this weekend. $6.50! This means Beauty Supply Warehouse is almost $3 cheaper. And that is insane.", "type": "review", "business_id": "wndccLJ8zbhlwhwYrfEWNg"}

I've gone to a few other places but finally decided to go down to see Camp Randall and get some Ians and see if it really is what many people call the best pizza in Madison.  I arrived and despite the fact that the shop was practically empty was ignored for about 10 minutes by the guy making the pizzas.  Yes he obviously saw me but didn't so much as say \"Be with you in a second\" or anything.  Some young college students came in and a girl came out and waited on them promptly.  It was as if they knew I was from Columbus and Buckeyes were second class citizens or something!  I even joked about this later and they did not find it funny.  Despite me talking about how highly they were rated and the like they pretty much were very standoffish and very unwilling to talk.  Ok, so much for customer service, but hey even the best food places can have totally rude help if the food makes up for it right?  \n\nWell not here my friends.  I had one slice of the famous mac and cheese pizza.  I LOVE Mac and Cheese and I love Pizza so it seemed like a hard thing to mess up...but it was not what I thought it could have been.  Looking at pictures on Yelp the recurring thing I kept thinking by looking at the Mac and Cheese pizza slices is how dry they looked. I hoped that once I bit into it that there would be cheese sauce or something that would prove me wrong.  But the slices just looked dry and not very cheesy at all.  However, photos can be deceptive, it's the taste that matters.  Well biting into the Mac and Cheese pizza I realized all of my worst fears.  It was tasty macaroni but the slice was very dry and did not taste cheesy in the least.  This is not Mac and Cheese pizza so much as Mac and dough pizza.  As you can see from my picture I sprinkled a dash of hot sauce at the end at the advice of the woman at the counter.  I found out why after tasting the slice that she recommended I do that, because it added some much needed moistness and taste to the slice.  \n\nThe bottom line is that I threw away about 30% of the slice.  I *NEVER* throw out food, you can ask my girlfriend and/or look at my waistline for proof of that, heh.  But that indeed is what I did in this case.  In hindsight I guess I should have just coated the whole slice in the hot sauce (which was great tasting hot sauce btw) but I didn't want to dilute the purity of the taste of it by doing so and skew my review.  I really wonder if maybe you do have to be kind of drunk and in the moment at 2am for this pizza to taste good because to me it made me question how this place stays in business.  It's certainly not their friendly employees or their tasty food if the Mac and Dough...er Mac and Cheese slice, is any representation.\n\nTo be fair Ians does have a LOT of other combinations and I'll bet if I were to try some others I'd be much more impressed but at $3.50 a slice I'm not going to be trying that anytime soon.  Honestly if I lived here I'd probably give them one more chance and that'd be about it.  Maybe I'm too old, maybe I'm too much of a pizza traditionalist or maybe Ians just is highly overrated.\n\nAfter throwing the last part of my slice away I got into my car and drove back over to Pizza Di Roma, a place that has vastly superior pizza in my opinion.  Sorry Ians, you may be a landmark but you're not on my places to visit if I return to Madison anytime soon!\n\nP.S. - One reason I waited to try this place for so long is I knew it was on campus and I wondered if there'd be a place to park within reasonable walking distance.  There are plenty of places to park in front of the building (about 8 to 10) but they are all metered so have your change ready.  So don't let the fact they are on campus stop you from visiting here if you do want to give them a try.", "type": "review", "business_id": "hSl4HdPdu6ohwFKJPfj93A"}

Back then, the restaurants intentionally placed their slicer containing a huge chunk of genuine roast beef where everyone could see it.  Their sandwiches were, as you would guess, superb.  \n\nI can't remember exactly when the chain made the 'conversion' to pressed and formed imitation roast beef, but the current product is nothing more than a poor man's lunch meat ala Subway.  Several years ago, it occurred to me to ask a store manager why they had stopped selling genuine roast beef and he gave me some fairy tale story about a shortage of \"quality\" beef.  I do on rare occasion fool myself into buying one of their \"roast beef\" sandwiches, but more than one visit every few years reminds you of why you stopped eating them.  The dead-gray flaps of \"roast beef\" under the bun are quite unappetizing, so it goes down a little easier if you don't look.  \n\nI couldn't - in good conscience  - recommend eating these faux roast beef sandwiches to anyone.  It is a shame some entrepreneur hasn't opened a chain of restaurants replicating the real roast beef sandwiches of back when.  I would pay $6 - $7 for the real thing.

All that is gone as they have grown in popularity. \nThe wings used to be some of the best ever: grilled, not fried. Now, they are just fried but still good (not great). For bar food, this is still a really good place to eat. \nThe place is clean as well (one of my big pet peeves). From what I am able to observe at the Scottsdale location, they have taken the high cleaning standards required for the brewery and kept them in place for the bar/restaurant. \nThis location will get busy during happy hour, on game day, or anytime after 5pm. Be prepared to stand and bump shoulders with beer in hand until a seat opens up. \nThe crowd is an eclectic mix of post college grad's, professional's, and nine to fivers just getting off work.

They have no consideration for the disabled, boo. The problem with these shows is that every show has different rules and the Rio nor the radio station promoting them let anyone know the changes until you get there.  The best example is my girlfriend is disabled and cannot sit on the hard ground.  The first 2 shows we went to there was lounge chair seating, the next show we were told we couldn't sit in the loungers, the next show after that we could, then couldn't.  Last month we tried to go and was told no seating but we could bring our own chair to use.  I asked security \"Any chair?\" and was told \"Yes\" but I know for a fact if we came back with just any chair they would not allow us to bring it in so we had to leave.  The other things they change is one show you can swim, the next you can't swim but you can use the jacuzzi, the next show both are off limits, the next show the pool is open again, what the heck?  And the last reason not to go is the alcohol, they offer an \"open bar\" which consists of 1 free drink of whatever they decide that night whether it be flat, warm, foamy beer or watered down who knows what.  The Fosters big can is the best deal but one show it is x ounces for x dollars, the next show the same can goes up 2 dollars, the next show the price goes back down but the can is smaller, the next show the price is higher for the smaller can.  Its been 3 years that I have been trying to attend these shows and nothing has changed in that time, still inconsistent and just plain wrong.  If you want a good pool party/free concert with open bar go to Hard Rock on Fridays in the summer, its always righteous and a good time without all the frustrations of the lame a$$ed Rio.", "type": "review", "business_id": "8IMEf_cj8KyTQojhNOyoPg"}

However, a MUST try are the fries and the baklava. I don't know what they do, but have some of the best fries in the city. Super crispy along with a tasty fry sauce make it a must-have when stop by here. The baklava is incredibly flakey with subtle hints of honey and nuts.\n\nThe restaurant itself is pretty standard. Coming in you see a variety of chairs and tables, and you walk up to the front counter where you place an order. It's a cross of a restaurant (the food is usually brought to you and it takes a while to make it fresh) and fast food (you order off a menu board, pay right away, and get your own drinks), Tucked away in the corner is a lounge/couch area where they used to serve hookah and drink. They got rid of hookah, but the area is still open to those who wish to lounge around.\n\nI consider the prices to be a big high for the UNLV/Student budget. At about $10 for a combo meal, its definitely approaching sit-down restaurant food prices.

We were told there are no non smoking rooms left, and despite booking one it is merely a request. This is supposed to be the hotel with the most rooms in Vegas. After getting upset, the guy spoke to his manager and miraculously \"found\" a room.\n\nUpon entering the room - it smelled... It was bad. The carpet was filthy... So much so that when my son took off his shoes his socks turned black.  The comforter on one of the beds had stains on it. \n\nAt this point, rather than complain, I figured I would just make do. It's late and it will get better right? So I simply remove the comforter cause I generally don't use it anyway. \n\nThe next morning when I wake up, there is something uncomfortable under my sheets bothering my back... What is it? A large bottle cap, in between the sheets and the mattress. So does that mean the sheets were not removed when the last guest stayed here?\n\nThursday, we left the room early in the am around 10am  Or so and  returned around 3 pm. The room was not cleaned yet, so we left. They had almost 6 hours to do so, and it wasn't done? Well it's a big hotel, I can get over it. We came back around 6, and it was finally done. Once it was finally done, guess what? The comforter was still there! Big surprise. So again, I just kicked it to the floor. \nOn Friday, we returned again around 3 or so and it wasnt cleaned. When housekeeping came, we sat in the room while they cleaned the room and even tipped her $5.00. I didn't even bother pointing out the comforter since I won't use it, I just asked for 1 extra towel. \nAgain, I usually don't complain. But I did watch her change the sheets. \n \nFriday night, we went to bed around 11. The connecting room next door was making a horrible amount of noise at midnight. Shouting, laughing, music. Me, my wife, and my kids could not sleep. We called the front desk and they took care of it. It started again around 2 am. I called again. And again they said they would take care of it. \nIt is a little after 4 am now - and guess what? They are doing it again. I call once again and  am assured it will be dealt with. Of course, we have not slept all night. And the woman on the phone offers us a food credit for our inconvenience. \n\nAre you kidding me?\n\nWe come to Vegas 4 times a year, literally. We have stayed all over the strip. We are also a family that travels a lot.\nWeekend trips, long vacations. So we know hotels. And honestly, we haven't had an experience like this bad before. \n\nThe funny thing is, I've been to this hotel\nMany times before to eat,\nBecause it houses some of the finest restaurants   in town. And I assumed that since that is the case, the hotel\nItself must be pretty amazing. L'altilier, Robuchon, and Craft Steak are 3 of my favorite restaurants  in Vegas. I've eaten at each place multiple times. These restaurants are simply too good for this place. \n\nThis hotel  is  horrible. And the worst part, No one cares. \n\nI check out in a few hours, and I will definitely complain. \n\n5am now and the guys next door are banging on something. I have come downstairs to complain to a manger - cause clearly calling 3 times doesn't work. There is no one here, and the guy went back to get his manager... It's been almost 10 minutes. \n\nDo yourself a favor, don't stay here. I know I won't be returning.\n\n\nSo last night, the night manager Cesar promised to comp the night that I had the problem with the unruly neighbors. This morning I go to the front desk to double check... And guess what, not only did they not do it, but allegedly they can't because I prepaid through a convention group I came with. All they can do is offer me a free upgrade upon my next stay (no chance in hell that will happen). They have to go through all the convention attendees accounts, all 6,000 of them, before they can offer a credit to the convention group who will then credit me. BS. Absolute crap. The day shift manager told me,  don't store cash and we have no means of crediting your credit card.... So this casino that deals in millions of dollars a day can't give me $189.00? Why didn't she just tell me the truth which is \"we at MGM grand would like to say F-U and think you for your shitty stay!\"", "type": "review", "business_id": "eWPFXL1Bmu1ImtIa2Rqliw"}

She didn't mind our room as much as she minded the location of the Hotel (with regard to it's proximity to anything else). This place is just too damn far from anything cool (even the Vegas Monorail).\n\nI didn't think our room was worth the money we paid either, the room was at the very end of the hall completely opposite the elevator, so it took AGES to get to the door, especially when we were trashed. On top of that the furniture was beat up and the curtains were stuck part way open.\n\nThe beach is awesome, the lazy river wasn't exactly lazy (what with all the kids and pool toys), the wave pool was nice and warm, but the life guards are overbearing (\"Get behind the blue line!!!\" Ugh! Shutup!), and I got sick from the fried chicken at the To-Go Grill. The Shark-Reef is pretty great, which is a significant compliment, especially since I've been to the Monterey Bay Aquarium and Academy of Sciences.\n\nMost of our time was spent walking away from here because there wasn't any other entertainment at our hotel while we were there, which is stupid considering they have a giant convention center complex attached. The Mandalay Place shops are pretty weak too.\n\nIf you stay here, check out the Reef, Minus5 bar, and the beach. They are all pretty cool. Bring extra money for cabs, this place is at the VERY END of the strip; or if you have an aversion to cabs bring comfy shoes, take the free tram to Excalibur, then walk across Tropicana Ave. to New York New York, then across LV Blvd. to MGM Grand and then take the Monorail ($5 a passenger). \n\nI will mention, my wife got sick on the carpet and they didn't charge us to clean up.

Not really knowing how the menu worked, I just ordered the \"Jade Red Chicken\" rice bowl because it was supposed to be the most popular item on the menu. I was pretty disappointed when I found out that I had gone all the way to Phoenix (for the Fiesta Bowl) for a bowl of General Tso's chicken with white rice. As I was eating I saw people order eating some pretty wild stuff (like chinese bbq pork \"char siu\" quesadillas, etc.) so I was pretty adamant about coming back and trying this place again. \n\nI got a chance to go back two days later and instead of getting a rice bowl, I got the combo where you can choose two items off the menu (and turn them into a burrito/quesadillas if you'd like) along with rice of your choice and beans. So I got the jade red chicken again (this time in a quesadillas) and then I got the emerald chicken, which a buddy of mine had last time and looked good, along with jerk fried rice and black beans. \n\nBeing both a fan of chinese and mexican cuisine (in the traditional sense), I knew that this place was going to challenge my view of food marrying the two together. But I actually really enjoyed it. I should strongly stress the point that you need to \"get\" the menu before you should order. The staff is pretty nice about explaining the concept of the menu to you (it'd help if you ask, which I didn't the first time until AFTER I ordered). \n\nWith the freedom in the menu, however, I should probably warn my fellow Yelp!ers that I can see how some of these combination can go wrong and come back and blow up on you (or maybe inside of you, hahaha).

The inside looked too quiet for us anyway.\n\nThere's no kid menu, but they were happy to make a plain, grilled chicken breast for our son. He deemed it the best chicken he's ever had. At $17 for a kid-sized portion, it better be.\n\nOur food was excellent all around. The half dozen Kumumoto oysters ($23) were meaty, mild and delicious. My wife's order of steak tartare ($21) and ringo roll ($24 / spicy tuna, apple, jalape\u00f1os, tuna, cobia, spicy garlic ponzu, kabayaki sauce) were nearly flawless, albeit expensive even for the Strip.

Even the cornbread and crackers in the bread basket were great. The cornbread, by the way, came in handy for soaking up the sauce from my dish.\n\nI'd be happy to recommend this place now.

It also has a very overpriced gift shop out front. They also have people in stilts walking around making balloon figurines, which made me feel a little awkward. Also the servers just aren't ever very friendly.

Once we could breathe at our new table, she finally got our drink order and it took forever to get them. My glass of wine was the smallest glass of wine in the world. It was about the size of a shot. I also ordered a soda and it sat empty the entire dinner experience. \nOur salads and food came out together- after about 50 minutes. The table was really crammed since it all arrived together. I didn't particularly want my salad after that long and didn't eat it because the entree seemed more appealing by this point. \nThe food was OKAY. That's the only reason for the second star. I had mac and cheese and the husband the \"Cheeseburger in Paradise\". He had wanted the \"cold draft beer\" to go with it- but they have NO draft beer.

As we walked in she was greeted formally by name by each technician (totally obvious that she was well known here). In any case, their policy is that they all needed to speak english and no speaking in vietnamese as it makes the customers uncomfortable. The room was painted in a light pink with zebra chairs lining the walls, they also had a bar where you sit while you get your nails done. I only paid $17 for a spa pedicure + an additional $5 for a french tip. My polish was perfect and never chipped! With $22, my polish stayed on for a whole month and looked fresh as it did when I came in.

This is MY restaurant and I'd like to make you happy\"\n\nYou have to give kudos to a GM who approaches two unhappy, snarky women with a warm smile and a conciliatory approach. A GM who makes you feel like they WANT you to stay (as opposed to the assistant manager who stood there shrugging his shoulders at us.) Af GM who solves the problem and so we can  move onto a really nice dinner. Our bumpy start did not belie the rest of the evening. \n\nFirst up, the food:\nWe started with the Burretta ala Panna, which is essentially a totally dressed-up-befitting-of-Scottsdale bruschetta...as in FAB-U-LOUS!  We also had the scallops which were perfectly cooked, a lot of places just don't do it right - they do. Yay! Then for dinner we split the Proscuitto and Basil Wrapped Borzino.  I have to say, I normally SKIP the fish entrees in Scottsdale (because I am spoiled rotten when it comes to fish) but THIS..THIS my desert dwellers is worth coming out of your shells for.. Interesting dish, great textures and perfectly seasoned. Memorable. It made me look up the chef..THAT'S how good it was. I figure we'll be hearing from him again. Our side of sauteed spinach was perfect and not dripping in goop, and our desert of green tea creme brulee with a totally tasty macaroon was creamy, yummy goodness.  \n\nWe didn't graze the cocktail menu, though I wish I would have. We DID have a couple of wines by the glass. I will say, I wish those offerings were a little more extensive, but we did  find a nicely balanced Paso Robles Syrah that was new to me (and I am a Paso fanatic). I suspect there are other under-rated finds on the wine list. I love that, don't you? Finding some new wine to adore?\n\nThe service was genteel and warm. My only comment about the service is that our server was new and he could have used some training on the menu. He'll be one of the best when he's been there a bit longer - go see him, he's adorable: Les. \n\nThe atmosphere is Scottsdale-lush. We sat outside on our particular evening, but the restaurant's interior is GORGEOUS. I hate to bring this up because its plain bizarre, but the bathrooms are lovely. I mean, really, gold leaf wall paper? Doesn't feel like a recession in there. \n\nHonestly,despite all the raves, the most impressive thing about this restaurant was that they turned it around. We were ready to leave and we ended up staying because they made it clear that they wanted us to..and I am glad we stayed, we would have missed out on a great night. \n\nI'm sure I'll be back. It was worth coming over the entire Pacific just for that Borzino!", "type": "review", "business_id": "ymwr8OUokLLxG89gjJ1hjw"}

A great coincidence for us. Anyway, we were starving and could not wait to tear down some exquisite pieces of the finest animal flesh a bunch of cave men could inhale. We filled up 4 private taxi's and off we went. \n\nThe place is nicely dressed and that's about the extent of the good parts. The service was decent considering that the place wasn't even packed, the food was bland, and good drinks are everywhere nowadays. We drank, we ate, we laughed, looked cool, and left. \n\nBeso's is not a place I would come back to again, nor will I ever recommend it to anyone for any reason, and I don't mean that in a mean way. Just as honest as possible. I actually will never brag nor mention having been there to anyone. The only reason I even considered writing about it is because, I may actually help someone save well earned cash. \n\nThere are a lot better places to eat at for atmosphere, and/or, for actual well prepared food in Vegas. At least for the money you will spend here. \n\n3 stars is actually 2.5, and that's because we had a blast either way.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Q5Ndbf-kGsUMAQrG8aoDkw"}

The show consists of five \"superstars\", which change quite frequently, to keep things fresh and to keep audiences returning to see the show.  \n\nEach tribute performer is backed by a live band, backing singers and dancers.  There's VIP seating at the front - kind of theater-like seats in rows, but with a little cup holder so that you can keep your drink with you - this is Vegas after all!  There's booths with tables in the center and towards the back, and as you get further back, the level is raised, so I should think everyone gets a good view.  There are two large screens either side of the stage, used very cleverly to show footage of the real star, along with live footage of the stage show as it happens.\n\nThe show I saw, on a Sunday night, was pretty packed.  We had dinner in the casino's Asian restaurant - service was speedy, as we told them we were going to a show, and the food was very good.  The audience had a wide age group and everyone seemed to be having lots of fun.\n\nOur first performer was a Michael Jackson tribute.  The dancing was fabulous, from him and from the backing dancers, they did a great rendition of Thriller and he even moonwalked.  He didn't score as highly on sounding like him, as he did for dancing like him, but he did pretty well.\n\nThe second performer was a Justin Timberlake tribute.  I refer you here to the name of the show: Legends.  I do know one Timberlake song, but they didn't perform that one.  Again, more excellent dance routines, and the singer was charming and funny.  As we left I heard other people commenting on how he had got into a \"Legends\" show, a strange choice, in my opinion.\n\nOur third performance was a Blues Brothers tribute.  These guys were getting on in years, but still danced up a storm, like the real thing.  Great soul and blues songs, great jokes, a nice, playful set.\n\nThe next show was put on by a pretty convincing Tina Turner tribute.  She was a fit and lithe older lady with an amazing set of lungs, just like the real thing.  More great dance routines and some killer songs.  Since it was Sunday, she did her version of Tina's version of Proud Mary.\n\nOur final performance just had to be Elvis, didn't it?  He did the classics, interacted with the audience beautifully, made us sing along, and made us laugh.  This was the section with the best costumes, and the showiest lights, but then, that's how it should be for Elvis!\n\nThe show lasted around an hour and fifteen minutes.  There was a bar in the theater, so you can keep drinking if you wish.  To my mind, the greatest stars of this show were the backing dancers.  Even if I didn't know a song too well, and that's always a possibility when you see a mixed show like this, they entertained me.  The backing band, singers and dancers were one stage the whole show, and if they were tired from working so hard they didn't show it.  The costumes were incredible and we got at least one costume change per performer. It's a treat for your eyes as well as your ears, but the only drawback is that you don't know which five \"stars\" you will get for your show.", "type": "review", "business_id": "hkeYoEfdlCks_rFeIWHOkQ"}

You get well seasoned octopus with great char from the grill     \n\nI had the grilled Mediterranean Bass (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/YRyYbOSwvHkZsZOLv98oQg?select=ZHxqPjGi3u3VHfB-WvHMWA) as my entree and it was the epitome of what I love about  Greek seafood dishes - the olive oil, capers, and lemons... so simple but so delicious. The fish is served whole so there will be some bones but it was a very well-prepared fish. My friend had the lamb chop (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/YRyYbOSwvHkZsZOLv98oQg?select=JPMx_KuND2Sb_T6rO6JNCw) and he said it was decent. I guess this is a signal to stick with seafood here. \n\nI had the yogurt martini (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/YRyYbOSwvHkZsZOLv98oQg?select=FjlBOb4mUpo-ux8CTfcxbg) to round of the meal and I liked it. The yoghurt was just the right amount of sweet counterbalanced by natural tanginess. Nice light desert to cap a meal. My friend had the walnut pie (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/YRyYbOSwvHkZsZOLv98oQg?select=yNpyFpainXX8wHBr--EasA) and it's decent. If you like deserts with some spice in it then you'll probably like this one. \n\nAll in all we had a good meal at Estiatorio Milos. It's a bright and airy restaurant with lots of natural light. Our Japanese server took good care of us and for the most part, we enjoyed our food. But again, the lunch special is truly a good deal so definitely pencil it in if you're in town.", "type": "review", "business_id": "_6gbnNRPIc-iM_0cBLPX1A"}

SECRET PIZZA.  Located in the Cosmopolitan, finding the little pizza parlor is an adventure in itself.  Secret Pizza is located at the end of the corridor by the pool tables.  There are no signs for the entrance which makes it a bit difficult to find.  I would definitely recommend the white slice, then adding a meat such as pepperoni.  They do offer pies as a whole for sale as well.  One big advice: avoid going to Secret Pizza around 3AM on a Friday or Saturday night....

FIrst, service was great.  Went there with 4 kids, and very friendly and competent waiter brought them small rounds of dough with a pizza pan.  What a great, simple idea.  The dough occupied all children (ages 3-9) the entire meal.  THey made fake pies, desserts, etc.  Next, I could not choose between two white wines and waiter described them like he knew them and then offered me a taste of each. Wow.  Again, very simple and inexpensive for the restaurant, but meant so much to me.  They won me over at this point.  Again, when I was thinking of a red wine to have with pizza, he gave me a taste of a delicious blend from Paso Robles.  Pizzas were good.  We had two, both with red sauce.  One with sausage, the other with meatballs, ricotta and garlic on half, the other half being olives and mushrooms.  Tasty and fresh.  Sauce is a little sweet and not herbified with oregano or thyme.  People can endlessly argue about pizza styles, sauce, etc., and I am one them, and, I can say a sweeter sauce is usually not my style, but I found the sauce pretty good.  The crust was a littler thicker then I expected, but was cooked until dark and crispy.  Overall a B+ pizza.  The garden salad was $5 and was fresh and big enough for me and my two kids.  I did not eat dessert, but friends said cheesecake very good.  This is a solid place with great customer service.", "type": "review", "business_id": "OVU0pQ85Zf74OVgDyPFvGQ"}

My fianc\u00e9 had always been a very selective eater and wasn't open to raw fish when we met but has since been willing to try anything. And boy was he impressed and awed. Paying that much for a dinner was not his thing but by the last bite of dessert we were blown away, full and happy.

But when it came time to find a new optometrist...I looked at my provider services guide, and then I turned to Yelp to give me the details the provider guide didn't. Yelp helped me narrow down my choices to two. The first choice was closer to where I live but they were so rude that they got a bad review of their own. But my second choice...turned out to be my best choice and that is Clearvision Southwest. \n\nFrom the time I walked in the door I was greeted with a smile. The forms were short, the paperwork easy to read. I was able to see Dr. Wong within 10 minutes of my appointment time which always impresses me. And while they were having some web based computer glitches today, the rest of the office was equipped with up to date equipment...including testing equipment that didn't freak me out. (The one machine that puffs air at your eyes...Dr. Wong's machine didn't freak me out like other equipment has in the past!)\n\nDr. Wong took the time to listen...and I say that because she caught something my previous optometrist had done and that is to slightly over-correct my vision. When I peppered her with questions she took the time to answer. And even though I had pushed my contacts a bit hard of late, she didn't give me a hard time over it. And one more very important thing. She smiles. You don't feel like line #39 on a daily patient spreadsheet, you can see she gets it, and she does care about what's going on with your eyes. \n\nThe front office staff can make or break a practice, and Dr. Wong has Rhonda running the front. She's very knowlegeable, she tells it like it is, and she's able to help you make the best choices to maximize your insurance coverage. I did not feel pressured into making any high cost purchases, and from start to finish I was listened to and treated with respect. \n\nIt has been many, many years since I had an eye care experience like the one I had with Dr. Wong and Rhonda at ClearVision. But...it won't be my last. I look forward to taking my family there and I don't see a need to look any further...I've found my eye care professional in Vegas. \n\n4 Very Strong Stars. So why not 5?

Anyway, the week before xmas this place was busy. The line was almost going out the door as people were buying stuff for friends, family, or co-workers.\nIf you're gonna get a large order, it's better to call ahead to guarantee the flavors you want. Many of the flavors on the racks were reserved for such orders. The display was somewhat bare as many of the gourmet donuts were purchased.\n\nThe size of the donuts were large, so you may want to share. One donut was enough to fill me up. The tart filling in the keylime donut was great, reminiscent of a good keylime pie. The s'mores wasn't bad. I liked the marshmallow flavors that were present throughout. I'm glad I tried the nutty pig but I can't say I'm a fan. It's a combination of flavors that isn't for everyone. My least favorite part was the cold and chewy bacon bits. Personally, I prefer my bacon piping hot and crispy. The pumpkin cheesecake donut may have been my favorite. The rich and creamy filling provided all the goodness of a pumpkin pie in a donut.\n\nWhile I'm not typically a fan of donuts, the ones here are creative and delicious enough for me to want to come back. Obviously, I'm not the only one to think that, as they've expanded to a kiosk at Town Square and elsewhere around town. A location in the southwest would be more than welcomed. \n\n4.5 Stars", "type": "review", "business_id": "mDU31M4xdY7IDux_LwBiPQ"}

You never know what you're gonna get.\"\n\nWell, no... actually Forrest Gump said that. MY momma always said, \"For God's sake, Ryan, why can't you put down that Nintendo controller and play outside with the rest of the NORMAL kids? And what the hell are you wearing all that TINFOIL on your head for?\"\n\nNo, Forrest Gump was the one who talked about chocolates, and Bubba always talked about shrimp, hence, we now have the chain of the Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. restaurants. They're all over in touristy spots, and the Seestur raves about the one in Anaheim in Gardenwalk. She even sports the sweatshirt proudly. This from a girl who would practically retch if she even got near seafood.\n\nSo boy, howdy, was I excited to see that there was going to be a Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. on the Las Vegas Strip. So excited, that I didn't even care it was located mere steps from the horrifying (to me) Goretorium. I was going to brave the danger and go to Bubba Gump, and if one of the evil scary monsters from Goretorium and/or one of the sleazy porno-card giver-outers on the corner of Harmon and the Strip came after me, well, by God I would buy fresh boxers from the Bubba Gump store.\n\nIf life is like a box of chocolates, I should have tried poking the bottom of the candies before coming here. I got stuck with that one everyone else dodges. You know, the one with the pink cream-ish center that's supposedly cherry or raspberry but tastes more like Pepto Bismol.\n\nLas Vegans hardly need a reason to celebrate but we find them anyway, and as I had just been unceremoniously and hurriedly booted out the door by my former employer, ironically who stood across the street from Harmon Corner and rhymed with \"Bosmopolitan,\" I decided to have a little \"New Beginnings/I Got Fired\" dinner at Bubba Gump's.\n\nFiguring I was the last one there (as I usually am) and not wanting a demon to jump out of the Goretorium and eat my soul, I asked one of the store clerks, \"So... I'm in the store... but where's the restaurant?\" She smiled and directed me up the stairs toward the back of the store. A sign or something would have been nice.\n\nI headed up the stairs, where I was actually first, gathered the party, and we were seated. They explained the license plates on the table that say \"Run, Forrest, Run!\" and \"Stop, Forrest, Stop!\" which I thought was a cute touch.\n\nThe crew was stellar. Our main waitress was super bubbly and thrilled when she heard we were all locals (like, apparently they had not been frequenting the place... what a shock no locals on the Strip). She was very attentive to our needs, to the point where we never really needed our \"Run/Stop\" plates on our table. She even regaled us with ghost stories in nearby mining towns. So despite whatever else I say in this review, the staff was great and should be commended.\n\nAnd with that being said... well... \n\nWe started with a round of drinks. Since it was my firing party, I was ready for something nice and strong, so I went with Bubba's Blue Hawaiian: vodka, rum, gin, Blue Curacao, pineapple juice and Sierra Mist, yes, please, come to DADDY! The menu says $8.99, but don't be fooled! That doesn't include your collectible Bubba Gump glass, so you're more looking at $13. You have to specifically ask to NOT get the collectible glass, whereas I think it should be the other way around. But the drink was pretty good. Not quite an AMF, so it won't belt you on your ass, but not a totally tame drink either.\n\nDinner came around, and I have to say I was gravely disappointed with my dinner.  I got the Shrimper's Heaven, which along with french fries came with Fried Shrimp, \"Chilly Shrimp,\" Coconut Shrimp, and Shrimp Tempura, along with three sauces: Asian, cocktail, and a Cajun sauce that reminded me more of orange marmalade.\n\nI started with the \"Chilly Shrimp,\" which I thought was just going to be cold shrimp like you might find in a shrimp cocktail. No, in fact, that is wrong. \"Chilly Shrimp\" is Bubba Gump's version of \"Peel-n-Eat Shrimp,\" which means the shrimp is cooked inside its shell. Yes, shrimp have shells, and shrimp have legs, which took that portion of the dinner from \"tasty seafood morsel\" to \"creature that used to be alive, probably leaving behind a family he supported and a shrimp company job that will have to do some PR work to explain his disappearance and he was probably named Charles.\" I can't eat things that could probably be named Charles. So there's a quarter of the dinner shot down.\n\nThe rest was tolerable. The coconut shrimp and fried shrimp were kind of dry, but the shrimp tempura was fine.\n\nWhat wasn't fine was the bill: for JUST that and the drink, after gratuity I was paying $55 BY MYSELF. People, I just got fired! Just because I was paid out my vacation pay doesn't mean I need to be spending it all on dinner! I'll stick with Lazy Joe's for some good, affordable shrimp from now on.\n\nI guess stupid really is as stupid does.", "type": "review", "business_id": "cP6pQuoPKIoaFQBa09e-Vg"}

I'll start with the fact that I'll never waste my time on that joint again. We visited McFaddens at about 4pm on a Monday afternoon. Not exactly a busy time of day. There were approximately 4 tables sat in the entire bar. We were the fifth and they sat us behind a pole in the back of the restaurant. Apparently, it was 100 miles too far for the waitress because she took FOREVER to give us service. My husband ordered a Corona Light and I water. It took about 15-20 minutes for his beer to arrive and it was warm!  Then we ordered nachos with guacamole and beans, chicken wings and mozzarella sticks. Guess how long it took to get our food.....40 minutes!!! We were informed that no one realized there wasn't a cook in the kitchen. That's awesome management. Well, once they got that figured out, I think they put half a cook in the kitchen because our nachos had no beans or guacamole and the mozzarella sticks had leaked the cheese out the bottom. So, all we had was hollowed out bread crumb casings with a giant ball of cheese on the bottom. The food wasn't even good. It was a waste of calories. My husband dared to order another beer which took another 20 minutes. It came after the food was gone and it was also warm. It was happy hour but, who cares when you only get 2 drinks every seven days. The service was SO slow! She was nice but, slower than molasses! There were like10 employees roaming around and only 5 tables and it took us 1 1/2 hours to wait for food, drinks and service. At that pace, we could have enjoyed a nice fine dining meal. We can easily spend 1 1/2 hours in a bar but, that's when beverages aren't strapped to a turtle's back. I'm not a complainer but, save your time and money, at least in the middle of the afternoon.", "type": "review", "business_id": "jS3cHd1E5TuUZbQWpBZqVg"}

I know they are not made to order  but you expect them to be warm.\n-Calamari Fritti. You basic calamari with 2 slivers of a banana pepper and grilled lemon. Another dish that came out cold.\n-Lisa V's Linguini and white clam sauce. This dish has the most balanced flavors and a decent amount of clams. This was the 3rd dish in a row that was cold. I would have mentioned it to our server but he wasn't around much.\n-My mother in laws shrimp scampi. The one dish that came out warm . It had pretty good flavors but not the best scampi I ever had. My mother in laws is much better!.\n\nWhere most authentic Italian restaurants might offer you freshly grated parm you had to ask for it and it took a few minutes to let the food get even colder. We also asked for some bread, mainly for the scampi since it had a nice broth build up in the bottom of the bowl. The waiter looked as if I was asking for ketchup at a steak house.
