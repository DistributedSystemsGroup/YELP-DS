He asked me a few times if the temperature was okay, and provided me with a calm, quiet ride to my hotel (which is always appreciated after a long morning of travel.) Plus, he taught me how to pronounce the name of my hotel correctly which absolutely prevented me from sounding like a total dumbass later.\n\nHe gave me a receipt without me having to ask for one, had change for my larger bill, grabbed my bag out of the trunk and was on his way.

The other place refused to do anything but full-scale sedated surgery; this place offered (reluctantly) other options.  When I asked what the downsides of alternatives to stitches might be, they said he might develop slight scarring.\n\nOur dog is no show dog.  I figured that we would save the extra $400 stitches for a real emergency.  A week or two later, our guy was back to his usual antics without so much as a limp (or a scar, incidentally).\n\nI thought I may have found a vet in Phoenix who was willing to talk about pets like what they are - well-beloved animals.  Then I came back when our dog had a really high fever.  He'd recently had ticks, so I was concerned that it could be tick fever, which I know can act really quickly.\n\nHere's how the exchange went down, more or less:\n\nMe:  He's got a fever and has been lethargic this morning.  He recently had ticks.\n\nDoc: Well, it is probably Disease A, which will be cured by the end of the day with these antibiotics.\n\nMe: Oh, great!\n\nDoc: ...but it COULD be Valley Fever, in which case we need to do a blood test that will cost about $100.\n\nMe: Ok, does he have any other symptoms indicating it could be Valley Fever?\n\nDoc: No.\n\nMe:  Then why don't we treat the likely culprit, and if he hasn't gotten better in 24 hours we'll run the other test?\n\nDoc: Sir, if we don't test for Valley Fever, your dog could be dead by tomorrow morning.  DEAD BY TOMORROW.  But if you don't want to test, feel free to go against my recommendation.\n\nMe:  Er... okay.\n\nSo, the good news is that our little guy was hale and hearty again by evening.  The antibiotics prescribed worked like a charm.  The bad news is that the test results the doctor ordered didn't come back for 5 days.\n\nLet me stress that - \"He needs this test, or he could die tomorrow.\"  The results came back 5 days later.  I asked if this was an irregular amount of time for the test to come back and was informed that it was not.  Either the doctor was exaggerating the seriousness of the potential illness or the test info really needs to be turned around quicker.\n\nI am giving this place 3 stars because they will offer treatment options beyond the most expensive.  Plus, they actually keep their appointment times, which seems to be a gold standard for Phoenix vets.  They also don't charge a ludicrous \"exam fee\" every time they see your dog because they put him on a scale.", "type": "review", "business_id": "QEgP-kDuXD2fQJHBm3HoFw"}

I'll start with the best parts and slowly but surely make my to the less desirable attributes of this below-par hotel/motel. First of all, despite being suspicious of said Squaw Peak reviewer, the restaurant is actually really good. I had a tuna salad as well as a vegetable stir fry, and they were both very tasty and hit the spot. The view from up there isn't really like some spectacular thing, but I guess it is a view of Phoenix. \n\nAs for the hotel, I've stayed at many Embassy Suites and this one was by far the most disappointing one I've ever rested my head at. First of all, it was definitely some motel changed into an Embassy Suites. All the rooms have doors that are outside and face a courtyard. That wouldn't be that big of a deal if the area that the hotel is in wasn't so sketchy looking. \n\nThe actual suite itself was alright. The paint and doors of my room seemed as if someone had drank too many free drinks at the complimentary happy hour they have there and just decided to use the room as a one enormous punching bag. The beds are comfortable but I didn't feel the safest when i was going to sleep because of the whole door on the outside thing. \n\nIf I return to Phoenix, I will definitely be looking to stay elsewhere.

Normally when a minor mistake is made on a bill ($10-$15ish for four of us), the restaurant will comp it.  Normally with you order something and a server comes back 5 minutes later to tell you that they're out of that item, especially when there's such a limited menu, they'll do something nice for you, right?

It turned out that I couldn't have asked for more.\n\n1st - I love the CHC for being honest. It's a straight-up, no frills, burger and hot dog stand. It totally reminded me of the roadside burger joints that my family stopped at as a kid, and 30 years later, their prices aren't even that far off. A 1/3 lb. charbroiled burger for under 4 bucks? that's a solid value!\n\n#2 - The sliders. Everybody seems to like the doubles, but I think that the single cheese burger slider is just the right slider-ific proportion of bread, meat, and cheese. They have some options to tart them up a bit, but I just went with the onions and a bit of ketchup. I wouldn't say that they are a one-for-one with the White Castle sliders, but pretty close, and quite possibly better. Order two for just over $2...\n\nC. - Chicago and hot dogs, a culinary dynasty. You can argue about which city has the best pizza, but those kids up near Lake Michigan have got the hot dog market covered. CHC has the all beef Vienna dogs, the poppy seed buns, and all the right fixins (scary green relish, sport peppers, tomatoes, and celery salt...) to throw down with a nearly perfect \"Chicago Dog\". Comes with Fries for $4... Eat one and smile while you think about enjoying the taste of Chicago without the January weather.\n\nLastly, I did make it around to one of those peanut butter milkshakes. It was great. Thick enough to stand a spoon in, and plenty of real peanut butter. It's not so sweet that one can't enjoy it as an accompaniment to to the sliders and dog, instead of dessert.\n\nIt's not too often that a place lives up to its own hype, but the Chicago Hamburger Co. was everything that I was craving and more.", "type": "review", "business_id": "iNvY0zAlaD_ye7Z6rHu-Ug"}

I've taken the Jewelry classes mainly as a refresher and I like seeing if I can learn new tips and tricks from the instructors.\n\nLast summer (2007) they taught a wonderful class on stone setting. For those who can't afford going to school at the GIA or the Revere Academy in San Francisco, this is a good alternative right here in your own backyard.\n\nThe studio at MAC is top notch as are the instructors. Polly, Alison and the new enameling instructor are well worth the time spent here. The studio is ... AWESOME. Complete with 4 - yes FOUR - kilns to enamel. A casting area with a centrifugal forge...and some wonderful tool benches that make me cry when I have to use mine here. The torches at the studio are acetylene and oxyacetylene - wonderful melting power! They also have a vulcanizer so you can make molds and the ventilation for the studio is superb. So many wonderful amenities that are useful - you can tell a lot of time and thought went into the studio when they were planning it.\n\nIt's advised that you bring your own tools - like your own investment if you want to cast, casting grains, etc. I like to bring my own tools because you just never know who used it before you and if they've ruined it somehow either through carelessness or just being new to jewelry making.\n\nI sign up for classes for the sole purpose of using the jewelry studios. It's a wonderful place. Also the students that go there are somewhat few and far between, even though the classes can be full, most students show up every other week! That means more space for me to work in. ;)", "type": "review", "business_id": "XKrEnL9yCtlhhIa6efbtGQ"}

It was painfully obvious that the girl running the seating, was very inexperienced and they need someone with more experience. \n\nWe were finally seated after about 45 minutes and were really looking forward to having a positive experience. Well, there is always hope. \n\nFirst the waitress was a bit sloppy and we felt rushed. I use to waitress, you never ever ever rush the people you're waiting on. Then it took about 10 minutes to get our drinks and the only people who recieved water were the people drinking alcohol. There use to be a time that they put in on your table the minute that you sat down.\n\nTo make it short and sweet, the food. Waaaay over priced for what you get. The appetizers were just ok. Nothing to get thrilled over. My daughters fish was over cooked, the hawiian rice that it came with was too sweet, there was nothing balancing it out. My sons huge Black & Blue Burger had this little tiny bit of blue cheese on it. My giant baked patato cost over $8 and the toppings were hardly enough for a mini potato. About 5 minutes after I ordered it, I told the waitress that I had changed my mind and she told me that it was too late. Really too late to change my mind on a baked potato?

Normally a customer of \"Prestige\" in Scottsdale, I was hoping to find a local Dry Cleaner in town. Mistakenly, I took for granted the 'skill' it takes to dry clean, as well as the customer service it takes to keep a business thriving. I dropped off a Winter Coat, Black Sweater (somewhat dirty), and 3 pair of dress pants. The Coat was fine. The Black Sweater I literally had to get a roller & wet rag to finish cleaning. I never had something returned so sloppy. And then the pants.... all 3 of them had almost the exact same markings on the legs - as if someone spilled a solution or pressed too hard with an iron or something; I'm speculating because I don't know what goes on inside a Dry Cleaner! What I do know is that the Dry Cleaning process did not go well and though they were 2 different styles and colors, all three were stained the same way! I brought them back for re-do - already worried. They were returned the same: essentially RUINED. Luckily, the pants were still posted on the Express website, so I printed out the pictures & costs of all three and brought them in for reimbursement. Fairly straightforward, except for the fact that Mr. Le Baron Manager (Owner?) decided he was going to \"challenge\" me on the garments. Yes, apparently it's more important for him to be right than successful, because my clothes are now in a 'Trial by Jury' process, with the \"Jury\" being a group of Dry Cleaners to whom he pays a monthly \"fee\" in order to issue a  'report' in situations much like... this. Color me pessimistic, but I'm not feeling that \"report\" is going to come back in favor of me (the person that doesn't pay 'dues').  Oh ya... it takes a month.\nAs I said in the beginning, Enter At Your Own Risk: knowing that your clothes may come back dirty, knowing that your clothes may come back ruined. And if they DO come back ruined, well, you just might be out of luck as the likelihood for proper reimbursement is slim. Actually, who am I kidding? Why would anyone want to enter this Dry Cleaner at all?\nI'll keep you posted on this, folks.", "type": "review", "business_id": "ocvZJ86LjiGIcRVS57aR6w"}

Honestly, its pretty impressive how nice they are considering that they are located in a mall food court and have to deal with rude, hurried shoppers all the time. They were very courteous about my groupon and explained the different pitas they offered over the phone while i placed a carryout order. Service wise, these guys were top notch-- very accommodating, very patient, very polite.\n\nI ordered two of their original gyros, a chicken fajita gyro, and an ultimate chicken gyro which came with feta cheese and lettuce. It's definitely not bad. Their gyros are packed with meat. You honestly shouldn't be ordering fries if you are already getting one of their wraps-- it's surprisingly filling. The quality of the meat was so-so. Better than your average fast food style gyro-- the meat seemed to be more thickly sliced. (Don't ever buy a gyro at a place that doesn't explicitly specialize in middle eastern or Greek cuisine) However,  I think you're better off eating the gyros at nearby Greek Bistro. They added sliced tomatoes--pretty standard stuff. The bread was ok, thick but I would have preferred something that wrapped a bit better. But ultimately, the sauce just didn't impress me that much. I was expecting more of an authentic, cucumber based hint to it and it didn't taste much different from standard plain yogurt. Not saying that it WAS yogurt-- I really don't know what it was. But it didn't impress me.\n\nThe specialty gyros we tried were decent. The fajita style gyro is definitely different. They used what tasted like yellow american cheese and grilled bell peppers and onions. A tasty alternative to a chicken burrito you might find at your average fast food mexican place. But just ok. The ultimate greek chicken did have that tasty feta cheese in it but it didn't blow me away. The chicken was plentiful but could have been juicer. I think it would have been preferable if they had used chicken kabob instead of sliced bits of chicken breast. \n\nAt no point during the eating of the aforementioned products did I think this place was bad or regret my purchase. At the same time, there was no point at which I found myself moaning in delight over the flavors. These guys are probably a good bet if you find yourself in the mall food court, but I otherwise wouldn't recommend them as an outing when there are noticeably better greek places nearby in Henderson. Despite my lukewarm review, I WOULD come back here again in the future, but probably only with another groupon, or to try some of their dessert options.", "type": "review", "business_id": "LsUJZOMKl4QpWbVCV2nVqQ"}

I've tried many items from the lunch specials to the entrees and have never had anything I disliked.   My favorite item, the Baby Spinach Curry  happens to reside on the lunch special menu so bonus for me.    With that you get a healthy serving of rice that you can smother with the tangy tomato curry sauce the baby spinach will be drenched in.  GET IT SPICY.  I find it most enjoyable when you get the perfect mix of curry and sweat dripping from one's brow.  I also order a side of Regular Naan and substitute the ghee butter for EVOO.   Dip that right into the curry or make a little pita out of it and go to town on it like I do (unless there are people watching).\n\nAlso a fan of their veggie samosas (if you put it in the name of your restaurant, it better be good), and their chicken curry is good as well.   Oh and Veggie Kofta Curry.  I have no idea what exactly that is, but it was delicious.  Kinda like little vegetarian meatballs or falafel but in a delicious curry sauce.\n\nRick is always great and I've never had an issue with the service, though on days where it's packed he can sometimes be stretched a little thin and it can take a little longer that way.

We were sitting at a long table with benches. However, refreshingly, our waiter was really cool...checked on us enough but definitely didn't hound us to order drinks or food.  I was truly impressed, especially when a drunk stranger sat incredibly close to one of our friends...he calmly said to guy, \"Hey buddy, your seat is over here.\" and then the he led the buzzed stranger to a seat near the bar. Very cool, very well played. \n\nPizza tastes very homemade, I don't mean that in necessarily in a  good way, but it really wasn't that bad either. Just like that pre-made unroll and bake dough you get in the grocery store (BTW, I despise square pizza) and topped with premade sauce you get in the grocery store with processed semi-fake pepperoni & sausage (added soy filler), and cheese that is probably the generic big bulk block o'cheese from Costco or something.  The last time I ordered the \"Naked City\" pizza  was \"To-go\" and it did not taste good at all. This time it was perceived as solid \"bar\" food, and the meat didn't taste sooo mysterious.  Maybe it was because I was very hungry...remember I ordered my first beer in 6 years...so I guess this is the beer munchies?  Bear in mind, I did not eat the crust, which is a huge component in judging pizza. \n\nWhile the pizza doesn't necessarily bring me back to this place, a good cold beer with great service does.

So we descended in the tower elevator to see what Roxy's on the casino level had available.  The dessert case in front featured various small cakes that appeared to be too large for just two people.  But, after perusing the menu, we saw that sundaes and other smaller possibilities were also available.  So, we presented ourselves for seating in one of the booths.\n\nNot long afterward, I saw that more substantial fare was also featured on the menu--besides half-pound burgers.  The hunger pangs became more incessant.  So, in addition to an Apple Cobbler ala mode to share, Diane ordered Popcorn Shrimp, and I a BLT with Fries.  Little did I know at the time that this would be the biggest BLT I had ever seen.  \n\nThe massive sandwich was buoyed by lightly toasted Sourdough Bread that was smeared with a thin layer of mayonnaise as I had requested; contained crisp lettuce, fresh tomato slices, and very good just slightly crisp bacon.  It was accompanied by slightly malleable Skin-on Fries and a Kosher Dill Pickle spear.  All were very tasty.  Somehow, within I-1/2 hours I succeeded in polishing off the whole BLT, plus Diane's tender Onion Straws.\n\nThen came the baked Apple Cobbler with a very large scoop of Vanilla Ice Cream.  Unfortunately, because the dessert had real Raspberry Sauce trails streaked all across the top, and Diane is allergic to berries, we had to send this dessert back.  But our server immediately offered to bake and bring forth a new one, which he rather quickly did--after making a diner at another table happy through receipt of a free Apple Cobbler covered with Raspberry Sauce.  So, service was very good, and all ended well with a delicious large, warm, and doughy homemade Apple Cobbler adorned only with Vanilla Ice Cream.\n\n4-1/2 stars overall on this particular big moon night!", "type": "review", "business_id": "83C1eqPfmQHTy_8MC4Ug6w"}

Being that they had closed at 9pm on a Monday night, I was hard pressed to find a comparable place until my Wisconsin Fitchburg friend recommended Michael's Frozen Yogurt versus Culver's since it was further away on the Beltway. The prices here were kind of high, but I rolled with the punches, as I was on vacation and made the most of it. Michael's Frozen Yogurt is located within a shopping mall, that's pretty much anchored by Great Dane Pub. I believe this shopping mall is called Hatchery Hill, since the main thoroughfare was  Fish Hatchery Road in Verona.\n\nWe were here at about 9:30pm and it was relatively empty. There was 2 high school dudes working the counter that night. They looked professional as they waited for us to order. My friend ordered a sundae, whereas her husband had ordered a chocolate malt. I looked at the board and compared a waffle cone versus a take home pint, where you can get more ice cream for the price. And so,  I did just that. I ended up eating the entire carton of chocolate ice cream about an hour later. It was pretty darn good, considering I was carb reloading from my marathon in Kentucky just days ago.\n\nI thought this place was as decent as Cold Stone Creamery, but its not real ice cream, just frozen yogurt posing as ice cream. Still just as good though. The store itself was small, like Baskin Robbins or a TCBY's, with 3 tables for customer seating. They accept cash and credit cards, so I ended up treating my friend and her husband since they got dinner for me at the Great Dane, so it all events out. :-) I would recommend this place to ice cream lovers and those who fantasize about it almost constantly. It's really good, but I wouldn't give up Cold Stone Creamery just yet. Still this place is a top 5 favorite. Plenty of parking here, as we arrived and left close to 10pm. Pretty cool that these shops close at 10pm, so we can have a quick bite before returning home. Overall, it was a good choice to spend my $$, since I was on vacation and needed something sweet. If I was local, I probably wouldn't come here for my ice cream needs.\n\nSupport local!\n\nB", "type": "review", "business_id": "kQwOqgf1GJ9rGoR63aODgg"}

It meant a lot to our family to have dinner together with 6 of us arriving from Madison, Baltimore, Chicago, and Colorado. We made a reservation for 4 three weeks ahead of time, but then we did apparently confuse the staff by adding two more people several days before the meal. That caused a hostile reception from the hostess, who seemed to feel we were somehow gaming her reservation system and we further aggravated her by arriving 17 minutes late (from 4 different cities), when she had warned us over the phone she would give away our table after 15 minutes. \nHowever, the host more than made up for it and he was truly wonderful to us. Now about the food and drink: hummus was great and the crunchy pita crackers were fine when we could get more of them. Wine choices were limited, but we liked the Romanian cabernet, offered at a reasonable $22/bottle. We had the Shish Feast for 6. The lamb chops were way overdone. Rice was good. Overall a somewhat distressing experience for me (the dad) because of our reservation issues, but the food was decent and the host went way out of his way to make the evening special, thus the 3 star rating despite my concerns noted above. In fairness, it was a Saturday night on a very busy graduation weekend in the city. Prices were more than fair, service was just ok. Host was wonderful and charming.

The really great thing is that you have a set of kitchen cabinets that can hopefully be configured to fit your kitchen. Some of the sets look better than others and on the day I stopped by ranged from 9 cabinets for $500 up to 21 cabinets for $2000. Yup, a full set of kitchen cabinets for $2000 - pretty awesome right? yeah there may be some chips or look a little outdated, but with just a little bit of stain or white paint and some new hardware it could be an awesome transformation for you kitchen.\n\nSo be creative, play a little, and benefit your community!\n\nP.S. - they have a deal if you buy one of their stardust t-shirts and wear it on a Thursday you get 15% off your purchase!", "type": "review", "business_id": "lCHGXLll1GV2_X8IVAz7KA"}

The waiting/ drink staff was friendly as well, though drinks were a little pricy. Parking is adequate: there's a garage nearby and I was able to get in/get out relatively quickly. Also, its walking distance to a bunch of restaurants/shops.\n\nThe setup for the concert was simple, just an open rectangle floor for people to gather in front of the stage and parts of the second level were open. The problem is the floor isn't sloped so if you are on the ground floor you can only see the artist perform if you are really up close (and you don't mind getting really close to some people). You can definitely try going on the second level but it fills up quick and for some weird reason they won't move the plants that take space up there. \n\nSound quality was subpar. I couldn't understand much of the opening act (Danny Brown) because the bass kept drowning out his raps. The sound was a little better for Gambino but not as clear as other rap concerts i've been to.

I had fond memories of the food, and especially the sopapillas. We arrived at noon, it wasn't terribly busy, so we sat outside on the patio. \n\nFirst off, we ordered margaritas and several others decided on the bloody mary bar. The margaritas were gross, salty and sour w/ limes that were long past their prime. The bloody mary drinkers were made to wait...and wait...and wait for their glasses to walk inside to make their drinks. \n\nWe ordered our entrees at about 12:30-12:45 and didn't get them until after 1:30. When I received my carne adovada burrito, it had been nuked beyond recognition, the rice was shriveled and was burnt onto the plate, as were the black beans. My first bite of the burrito was a hunk of fat...that pretty much ended it for me, also, the sopapilla I ordered for the dish came out 20 minutes later after I reminded him. The sopapilla was not at all like I remembered, and was more of a flattened piece of naan than anything else.  \n\nThe rest of my party had varying issues with their meals. To add insult to injury, my lunch cost $55 for one gross burrito, 2 drinks and a piece of bread pudding due to whatever gratuity they added. The waiter was surly...when he was present at all, which was rare. No water refill, completely unapologetic for the various issues with our experience, and never took away the offensive margaritas he served in the beginning. \n\nNeedless to say, we will not be returning.

The sauce was flavorful and tasty, however, the shrimp was overcooked. Also, both of us were not happy campers later in the evening and we believe it was because of this appetizer. However, everything else was terrific. For entr\u00e9es, I opted for the baked stuffed lobster with baked potato and vegi, and the hubby ordered some kind of sauteed scallop special with mushrooms, baked potato, and vegi. Everything tasted fabulous and we were stuffed. One additional note: I love that the waiter offers to crack the lobster crab for you. At the end of our meal when we thought we couldn't eat another bite, our waiter brought us a complimentary slice of snickers cheesecake because it was our anniversary. It was such a nice gesture and I will not lie, the cheesecake was amazing and really did taste like a snickers bar. So in all, this place was very good and a great option for a special occasion. My only complaints were the appetizer (I don't enjoy overcooked shrimp or being in the bathroom for an hour) and I wished the bread they served was warm (seemed like store bought cold bread). One other little side-note: If you hate seafood, this is probably not the place for you. I am not saying this because the menu has a majority of seafood, as you can still find steaks and other non seafood items, but because upon entering the restaurant, you are instantly greeted with the aroma of fish and other seafood. This could be a bit offputting for some. After a few minutes though, you get used to it if you don't mind the smell of seafood. Some people might not be able to get over it and it could be somewhat unpleasant. Additionally, they do sit you fairly close to other parties so if you don't like other people, you may not be happy with the seating arrangements. Lastly, make sure to make reservations as this place gets packed!", "type": "review", "business_id": "o1GIYYZJjM6nM03fQs_uEQ"}

I am sure their business model is to supply employees at Fulton Center with their coffee and to sell flavored lattes that mask the taste of their coffee to ASU students on the way to class. What they have going is that the \"baristas\" are quite friendly,  and the place is kept clean, although one stray cockroach came in once and was chilling on one of the chairs.

Rooms on the weekend- yes WEEKEND- are sometimes priced below $20- and that isn't for the Manor rooms, that's for a tower room.  Three weeks ago, I booked a flight from San Francisco to Vegas, PLUS four nights at Circus Circus for $170.  Compared to other strip hotels, Circus Circus is filthy.  Once the largest casino and hotel in Vegas, it's now ready to be torn down.  It makes sense to stay at Circus Circus- I mean, who really stays in their hotel room in Vegas.  If you have a \"west Tower\" room, the rooms are as nice as Bally's or Harrah's- almost as nice as MGM.  It's always my recommendation to get a cheap room here, and then spend your time on the South Strip.  Take all that money you saved and play some blackjack on Fremont Street (better odds and selection).  I think it's silly how people spend over $200/night for a room, when they're hardly there.  If you have children, go to Excalibur, not Circus Circus.  If you want to stay in you're room, and watch TV, and have no idea how to vacation, then spend $400/night at bellagio or the Venitian, not Circus Circus.  If you're looking just for a room that's clean and will sleep you well, and a casino that gives you a \"decent\" gaming experience without the large crowds and high limits, then Circus Circus is for you.", "type": "review", "business_id": "WT-v-DgQvW38DewVyTLdTA"}

I still didnt say anything because she figured it was from the assistant (to whom I will be descreet for her sake) of the man who booked us our room. So we arrived to our room and it was empty. So still no biggie I gave it a hour and snuck out for ice to find a house phone in which I was told that I would have to call back because they couldnt find my order. I firmly said I would not call back nor did I want anyone calling me because it was a suprise, and that I would just kill more time in the room untill it arived. The doorbell rang and it was a gift bag with the champaign (not chilled) and no strawberries or card. I sent it away and asked that it come back correct, and once again stalled. At this point were at 2 hours in our room. Then the phone rings and my friend answers. It is the conceirge asking her about the strawberries..... SUPRISE RUINED!!!!! I specifically stated MANY times ITS A SUPRISE!!! So the doorbell once again rings and its the strawberries with no chanpaign..... now im crying the suprise is ruined, and the Wynn did less than nothing to make all of this right.

GHETTO!\n\nI have never been to a grocery store where you have to go outside to get a cart and then push it through a gate and walk through a little turn-style type thing to get into the grocery store. Weird. I guess it is to prevent the homeless from stealing the carts, I don't know. \n\nAlso, what grocery store runs out of butter? My sister and I went here on a Monday night to get stuff for our hotel rooms. Their produce wasn't the best, in fact all of the cucumbers were very soft and on the verge of going bad. The lettuce was browning and the fruit looked like it was all on its last leg. Anyway, we needed to get some butter as my sister's husband likes bagels with butter in the morning. Well, I guess the section where the butter is kept broke down and they had to take all of it off the shelves. Like I said, ghetto! I guess they didn't have any in the back either. \n\nWhen we went to check out they had 1 lane open with a line about 10 people deep. The worst thing of it all is that the manager was just standing there fanning herself instead of opening up a register and helping the customers. It was a very frustrating experience. Next time I'll go to a different grocery store.", "type": "review", "business_id": "8D53RjbrEE3AUjnUpZ0TVg"}

I loved it. The guac seemed like a revelation, the margaritas had me at \"tequila\" and the service staff seemed happy to be working in such a cool funky place. \n\nMy, how times have changed. Its been a while since I was there..and I guess the shine has worn off. \n\nLike other Yelpers..I was less than impressed with the service. But our visit was on a Sunday and I figured, with a smaller crowd, the service would be better. Our server, alas, was epically..\"meh\". I don't think he ever said \"hello\" he said \"what will you be ordering?\", we simply asked for what we wanted, he shrugged and got it. I guess in its most elemental form, that is service. But it isn't ALL bad news.  I watched longingly as other diners had a server who practically glowed. He engaged, he laughed, he made recommendations..oh, and he is multi-talented as it was his artwork on display throughout the restaurant.  Bar service during our wait was no better - in fact, that guy seemed down right irritated that he had to take drink orders. We got our drinks, but only after he got the order wrong the first time (for two drinks?!).\n\nFor good food, I can put up with a lot. But know what? The food didn't hit any home runs either. I had a pablano chilie stuffed with shrimp (unpeeled for god's sake!) and scallops. The scallops were mushy and small and unpeeled shrimp is simply unforgivable at this price and the cheese was just a reheated mess. I ate it, but it wasn't worth raving over. We had the guac-and it was \"good\", but I just wasn't wowed anymore. I DID appreciate that they still make their own chips - that's cool, but not enough to warrant a \"weeeeee-oooooooh!\"\n\nI totally wish it had rocked. I really do. I get to PHX about 6X a year and I am ALWAYS craving good food like what they are SUPPOSED to serve at Barrio Cafe. Its funny, because later in the week I ate at La Parilla Suiza, and it was just so much more satisfying. I'll write a separate review, suffice to say, it doesn't get the press that Barrio gets and that's too bad.\n\nMaybe its a case of expectations-expect too much and you are sure to be disappointed. I was. \n\nHere's my one hint for those who still want to eat there. Sunday nights, 7PM, almost no wait. Service probably won't be any better, but at least you won't have to stand in small, cramped space to wait for your disappointing dinner.", "type": "review", "business_id": "1NZLxU5WvB5roPFzneAlLw"}

We are in Wisconsin so there are a lot of German restaurants here however, Essen Haus in the only one in Madison with this large of a German menu. Go outside of Madison and you can definitely find better. \n\nThe best reason to go to the Essen Haus is to enjoy the beer and polka. Great selection of seasonal beers and who doesn't like polka? It's the best thing there!  Also, their Maifest and Oktoberfest  events only get better each year! They put up tents in the parking log and have great out of town bands who play great German music. It's definitely a day of fun. We also appreciate the events being family friendly!", "type": "review", "business_id": "gTsg3Nj8pKvsmVz3dbLfiA"}

You are an idiot. Wisconsin is cold in the winter, get over it. It isn't the fault of the Union that the weather is too cold for you. Just because you live in California in the winter doesn't make you 'smarter' than those who don't.\n\nSecond, WHO ever said this was the number one restaurant in Madison? Pretty sure if you went to the website, you'd figure out pretty quickly that it's a college union/gathering place and not a restaurant. That's kind of on you. \n\nIt's not about the food, people. Did you notice that there are other types of listings on Yelp than restaurants? This is one of them. Do, however get you some Babcock Ice Cream in the front lobby off Langdon - good stuff but prepare for a line on summer weekends. \n\nThe Memorial Union is the boiled down essence of Madison summer. MU, State Street, and the Capitol Square Farmer's Market collectively IS Madison in the summertime - and it's wonderful. \n\nLong hours drinking beer on the terrace and watching the boats, listening to bands, just talking and enjoying the precious northern summer are what I remember about this magical place. In the winter, there are plays, shows, events, bands, etc and cozy little spots to study on a cold night. \n\nThis place is awesome.

I had read reviews here on Yelp claiming the Orleans was the best value for the money and I now agree! \nThe rooms a very nice and spacious, though TV channels limited (but if you spend your time watching TV in Vegas you have a bigger problem!) \nThe Casino is fairly large with a wide variety of slots, video games, and tables. The payout seemed to be very reasonable, and the drinks flow very freely, even at the nickle slots! \nThe food offerings are decent, nothing fancy, and there is also a large (and very modern) bowling alley, and cinema. \nMy only criticisms of the resort concern the shuttle to the strip and the pool area.  The pool, though large, was extremely crowded (though this could be attributed to it being Memorial Day weekend.) Also, the wait for the shuttle was often very long (20-30 min+) and some of the drivers were pretty rude. \nAll in all I highly recommend this place and would likely stay here again!", "type": "review", "business_id": "lddbHJKgFvnVWabK-M8TPA"}

Remember when Rain first opened and became the new \"it\" club in Vegas? I recall my boys rushing to stay at this place solely because of that club. They would brag about how they got suites upstairs so that in the wee hours of the night, they can stumble their way back up to their rooms while the rest of us have to cab it back to the strip. I'm pretty certain they're not staying here these days.\n\nThe Pauly D Project this season definitely promoted the Palms. Not to mention the notorious Paul Oakenfold was also once a resident at Rain for some time. Even with all that glitz and glam, I can see that the hotel has declined and aged quickly like a consistent crack addict. So many years later, I finally got to stay here because my friends had a special discount.\n\nChecking in was a breeze. They even upgraded one of our rooms to a one bedroom suite. The other room was a regular room which I will talk about later. We entered the suite which wasn't anything spectacular or mouth dropping. It was a living room with a single bedroom next door. The bathroom in the living room portion is just a toilet and a sink while the restroom in the bedroom is a full. The first thing that caught our attention was a poignant stench next to the far side of the bed. We may not watch CSI: Las Vegas but after years and extensive experience in the field, we knew that the odor was generated from the mixing of food, booze, and other unidentified materials. Plain and simple, someone must have yacked their a$$ off. The smell was fresh so it probably happened with the guests' right before us. At least we didn't see any chunks or residue. I only hope that the suspect's friends were able to snap some memorable photos. We called downstairs and they quickly sent us a guy who led us to another similar suite on a different floor.\n\nLuckily the next suite didn't have an odor that rivaled a frat house. However, one of the sinks clogged up pretty quickly after barely running the water. It's not a big issue and we dealt with it but my curious mind started going off on a tangent. More barf residue? Pubeys? Okay enough of that...\n\nThe other room that I stayed in was an average room. We originally asked for two beds but somehow they decided to give a single bed and said the two bedrooms were all booked. I wasn't about to share a single bed with couple so I had two options, the couch or the floor. I'm not a super tall dude, 5'9\"-5'10\". The couch was about 4\" long. Bite the bullet and ride it on the floor buddy. But the fun didn't stop there. Nothing major but when little stuff builds up; it starts to prey on you like the water board torture method. The water from the toilet in our restroom didn't stop running. The shower and sink pressure was weak, maybe because all the water was spewing through the toilet non stop? You can hear that crap all night. Speaking of noise, we also listened to bass throughout the night from the clubs and bars. \n\nThe only highlight of this stay was the Earl of Sandwich in the food court which just opened not too long. Actually the \"fast\" food court wasn't too shabby in general. Earl's, Panda's Express, Nathan's Famous Hot Dogs, a froyo joint, McDonald's, Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf, and a pizzeria. There's also a movie theatre next to the food court. Love the fact that Earl is open 24/7.\n\nPalms may look like a pleasurable and grand resort on the outside but I think they have slowly deteriorated internally. The once amazing and lively joint has lived out their prime. They are now in need of some dire work. Even a good amount of botox shots may not be able to bring their elite status back. I don't really see myself staying here again. It's off the strip, the rooms need fixing up, and I can always hit the original Earl of Sandwich at PH. Sorry Palms, you haven't aged well at all.", "type": "review", "business_id": "tbTc7094zwIYAtU-0NkU4w"}

I love this place as an off-the-strip option!  The rooms are spacious and modern.  I had stayed here once before about 9 years so I expected the rooms to be a little dumpy (maybe a lot dumpy)  but I was surprised at how maintained they were.  The beds were big and comfy.  The bathrooms were huge.\n\nBefore, the room that I stayed in didn't even have a mini bar and it seemed like the hotels were going that route due to their guests ganking all the liquor and re-filling the bottles with water.\n\nThe pool area is nice although I am not certain if I really like the fact that I can't bring a drink, that I bought IN the hotel, in there.  I do like that it is a 21 and over though.  The cocktail staff is plentiful so that you can stay liquored up by the pool.\n\nThere aren't a ton of eating options here but their sports book restaurant, Heraea, is fantastic.  They serve a great buffalo wing plate with the option of spicy chili sauce all over the wings instead of the usual Tabasco-based sauce.  The staff was super nice and informative about things to do and places to go.\n\nI wished that the shuttle to Caesar's ran a little bit later.  Someone who needs a little more action around the tables might not want to stay here.  It was pretty sparse compared to the casinos just a shuttle ride away.\n\nI'd stay here again as there are just way too many people to deal with in the hotels ON the strip.  I didn't seem like the hotel was at max capacity and maybe that is why my check-in and check out experiences were so easy.  There were 2 events going on at the hotel, Pole Expo and Shedonism, though.  Anyway, it's close enough to the strip and I'm sure I will be back for future debaucherous occasions.", "type": "review", "business_id": "tbTc7094zwIYAtU-0NkU4w"}

And when you've been drinking for 12 straight hours, there's no real desire to spend $30-75 on dinner.  Fast food will do, but you have to hump your ass all the way to Excalibur to find anything cheap.  And you better do it before 10:30, because that's when the tram quits running, and who needs that kind of exercise late at night?  \n\nOn the up side, EVERYONE I interacted with there was professional and friendly.  I wish I could remember the name of the guy who checked us in, because he deserved a pat on the back.  And although it took me about 3 days of slot playing to finally get a drink from a cocktail waitress, I must say that she was very nice and prompt, and circled back regularly once I finally popped up on her radar screen. \n\nWill I stay at Mandalay again?  Hell yeah.  It's a step below places like Aria and Venetian, but it's much nicer than many of the places I've been.", "type": "review", "business_id": "TWD8c5-P7w9v-2KX_GSNZQ"}

Being that I've never gone to a shooting range, I have nothing to compare it to.  \n\nThere was a wall of guns you can choose from.  They didn't have any small handguns free at the time we went in so I ended up with a Desert Eagle .44 Magnum. You can pick which one you want to use or you can also select from packages they have as well.  (They even have a \"shoot the wall\" package where you can shoot each and every one of the guns they have on their wall).  After you select the gun/package, you select your target sheet - pretty interesting selection from the basic to Bin-Laden to robbers to zombies.  If there's no line, you go right into the indoor range.  Theres about 10 sectioned off areas for people to shoot.  I don't know about other places, but I felt a little cramped (might have been because it was a Friday and there were many tourists/visitors).  If you're like me and have never touched a gun before, there's an \"instructor\" that goes with you to show you how to hold it and shoot it so that helped.  I was afraid of the noise/recoil but they have earmuffs (I don't know if there's another term for it) to reduce the noise of all the guns going off around you and plastic glasses to protect your eyes.  The \"instructor\" kind of stood behind me and held my shoulder to make sure the recoil wasn't bad and so I wouldn't fall back I guess.  My first two shots weren't great but at least I got it on the target sheet. After the first two, I got the hang of it a little.\n\nBut all in all, it was a fun experience there.  Pricing seemed reasonable and you can visit their website beforehand to see what all the costs are too. Nothing really bad to say about the place.

He then disappeared until after we had finished our dinner. \n\nOn their comment card I had written out what happened and asked the hostess to give the card to the manager on duty. I then saw her hand the comment card to the waiter who stuffed it in his back pocket. So far we haven't heard from Olives so I suspect he just trashed the comment card.\n\nWe are hopeful that the service on our last visit just means they have a bad apple on their wait staff.

And disappointment is always worse when your expectations fall short of the actual experience.\n\nMy sister and I had snuck away from a dinner party with my parent's friends to eat out. The restaurant was moderately busy which afforded a leisurely paced dinner. I have memories of this location when it used to be a decent mexican place called Pasqual's. LLX did a good job creating a cozy, warm interior, working hard to mute out the previously festive colors. I just wish they had saved a few of the festive flavors too.\n\nWe started with the best part of the meal, Kang Gai soup. It was savory and rich, with a lush coconut flavor and mild spice. The tofu in the soup was firm and complimented the soup. I kept wolfing it down as my sister told me about her recent trip to India. \n\nBut the rest of the meal wasn't so tasty. The appetizer combo was a bland combination of fried this and that. I could barely tell the taste of the fried shrimp from the spring roll. They should throw a chicken skewer or fresh veggie into the mix.\n\nFor our mains we mistakenly ordered the Moak Pa, catfish stuffed with dill and steamed in banana leaves. The bland but catfishy flavor was overwhelming and was served with bland broccoli and steamed veggies. Note to self, from now on, only order fried cat fish... but wait, didn't I already have some as an appetizer??\n\nThe other dish should have been an easy winner - curry squash. Again flavor was sorely absent and substituting tofu again for chicken didn't help the sauce.

It is one of my favs. Now to the review, don't waste your money or appetite at this buffet. At best it is mediocre, but realistically it just plain sucks. I have eaten here twice, the first time by choice, the second time I was talked into it. I tried to sample a bit of everything that looked appealing. I tried probably 25-30 very small portions of what they had to offer. This is how I like to work the buffets, and if there is anything I really like I go get more. Nothing was even so-so. Nothing tasted horrid, it was all just bland, boring and immediately forgettable. Also, some of the items resembled french food and even used their names like coq au vin, etc. But in reality, the food resembled French food about as much as the Hotel really resembles Paris. Feels more like Disneyland than France by a long shot. \n\nMy advice, go to the Bellagio, Wynn or even The Buffet at the M. They are all far superior and you will have a much happier ending to your meal. Au revoir!\n\nAfter writing the previous review, I was talked into going back by my wife for breakfast. it was pretty good, nothing terrilby exciting but i was content and full afterwards. Good eggs, meats, smoked salmon (YUM), etc. My wife ordered a crepe and it was way to sweet for my pallette.

If you're in the mood  for noodles but not wanting pho, I highly recommend coming here and ordering this dish.  \n\nNoodles were definitely fresh, the broth had a nice kick to it, and the chucks of beef with tendons still attached made my day.  Perfect for a hangover.  \n\nI wouldn't order the dim sum here though, our shrimp har gow tasted like it was sitting on a warmer/steamer for too long.", "type": "review", "business_id": "tcphcsPONrP82kUyvcELoA"}

Now granted there was an hour and a half for time to be in and out it wasn't like we were giving a short window for obligations to be met or hey I'd even say don't go. Just wanted to pre start with that. The time between ordering and receiving the food did seem a bit long and all of us ended up barely getting to where we needed to go. I only mark this off because my Dad is a very easy going guy and he looked pretty disturbed ON HIS BIRTHDAY that they over promised and under delivered on saying it wouldn't be a problem meeting the time window. \n\nOn the side of food I decided to have a gnocchi for the first time and it could possibly be the last time as well. To me it just felt like a doughy potato which maybe it should who knows, but without knowing much what I do know is it was far from the best tasting that it probably could've been. I will say that the pineapple upside down cake martini was the hit of the night for me, but again we requested an umbrella just to make it a bit more festive and were ignored. \n\nI will eat here again if my Dad requests it, but on my own Fiamma I say a sweet adieu to you!", "type": "review", "business_id": "5FLRsYrT6w2VSDvQDhphXg"}

A clean white robe, thick rubber flip flops in your size, and fresh towels wherever you go. Also there are ice cold peppermint cloths to place over your face, eyes, shoulders, wherever. The peppermint cloth doesn't sound like a big deal- but it is! I need to buy whatever they use to make that cloth smell like that, it's so relaxing.  I used mine when I went into the Sauna, and again over my shoulders in the jacuzzi. \n\nThey have different Jacuzzis of varying temperature depending on what you are in the mood for and heated rock beds. My only gripe was that some women felt the need to \"save\" their bed by throwing their stuff on it! Hey- if you're not using it take your stuff so that others can enjoy it! I wanted to lay next to my sister and enjoy the heated rock bed. Next time I go I might be ballsy enough to throw the stuff aside and lay on the rock bed if no one is there within 30-45 minutes or so that I see the bed beinig \"saved\". WTF I thought about docking a star for this because Qua could and SHOULD have a sign telling people that this chair holding-thing isn't allowed. \n\nSaunas (two of them):  a wet and a dry one. The first time I went the wet was too hot to stand, and the second time the wet was absolutely perfect. The perfect room to detox your skin.\n\nA snowing peppermint room! SO cool. A lady (another customer) informed me that the peppermint snow was infused with certain oils to make your skin super soft as she rubbed the discarded snow onto her arms and legs. I wanted to try that out but didn't want to deal with that much cold, just a personal thing, but I am sure it's lovely for most people.  I liked to sit in the snowing room anyway, both times I visited Qua, I spent maybe 20-30 minutes in there cumulative.\n\nTea room- The first time I came I had the detox tea (good, high quality tea), the second time I wanted to mix the teas myself and make my own concoction. The attendant was there to assist me and let me know how to steep it myself. She was super helpful. \n\nQua also has fresh fruit for you to eat and pretzels.  They have iced lemon water and a special iced tea that tastes a little like jasmine to me?  Very nice to have healthy choices for a little something to put in your belly whileyou're relaxing.\n\n$45 for a day pass (includes gym access). You can come and go if you want to have a break from the relaxing spa, have lunch, come back. It opens sometime ridiculously early in the morning 6AM? and closes at 8PM. It felt like I was there for an hour but I spent about four hours there. I'll be returning often, maybe on a Monday because they have deals on their treatments there (facials, massages, pedicures, or whatever else you could possibly want at a spa).  Both times I left this spa feeling so relaxed, so recharged, and SO happy!", "type": "review", "business_id": "-FCQ6tpsdpbeEJX8R_-tQQ"}

The octopus was far too salty and inedible.  The calamari was chewy and bland.  The main courses we had were the lamb and linguine with clams.  The rack of lamb was composed of about half fat.  My wife had the linguine and the noodles were hard and chewy.  When she asked about the chewiness of the noodles they took the plate back and said they would prepare a new one.

Even for a Monday it was pretty slow--the sour economy had definitely taken a toll on Las Vegas.  On the upside, if you were in town and had some money to gamble with, there were lots of open seats at the blackjack tables and plenty of elbow room at craps.\n\nHOTEL: I stayed in the Augustus Tower.  The room isn't super-extravagant by any means but it's spacious and includes a desk, a small table, a couch, and a flat-panel TV.  It also had a great view of the Bellagio fountains.  The bathroom is very nice--spacious with marble floors, a jacuzzi tub, a glass-doored shower, and a little room for the toilet.  Nothing remarkable about the other room amenities.  I've never been to the gym or spa, but I hear they are incredible--much better than Wynn and even better than the Bellagio.  On the downside, my bed mattress felt a little cheap and uneven, which was a disappointment as I've stayed in the Augustus Tower several times in the past and this was the first time I've had that problem.\n\nCASINO: This is why you come to Vegas, right?  Caesars has just about every game you could want.  (I don't think they have Casino War, but you shouldn't be playing that anyway.)  The gaming floor is pretty spacious and clean.  The Sports Book is huge and is a good place to watch a game even if you can't get a one of the nice seats.  One disappointment was that it looks like all the relatively more favorable payouts are gone: 9-6 Jacks or Better video poker is replaced with 8-5 or worse!  Also, I couldn't find a blackjack table with the dealer staying on soft 17 (though I didn't check the few tables in the baccarat room).  The Poker Room looks pretty good, and they even have a rather large set-off area for tournaments.  In terms of cash games, though, there never seems to be enough of a crowd.  For baccarat, the tables are well-spaced though almost all of the tables are lacking the new computer screens (which, of course, prevents those great \"Push the button!\" moments).  I thought that the dealers were quite friendly.  The little lounge for baccarat players is decent.  A couple of years ago, they had these addictive little gummy candies, but, alas, they are no more.  You'll have to head to your local Chinese grocer.\n\nRESTAURANTS, ETC.: A lot of the restaurants deserve their own review, but here's the overview.  Generally, I think Caesars offers a very nice selection of places to eat, and that's not even including what you find in the Forum Shops.  I wouldn't characterize any restaurant as mind-blowing, though.  True, the buffet (Cafe Lago) is less impressive than many other casinos on the strip, but the food is alright.  Augustus Cafe is pretty standard.  Beijing Noodle No. 9 was just opening when I visited, but, at least architecturally, it looks like an exciting place.  Hyakumi is pretty standard sushi fare.  I was a little disappointed with Mesa Grill given Bobby Flay's celebrity, and I suppose the same goes with Guy Savoy.  (Note, however, Guy Savoy has the most amazing bacon bread I've ever tasted.  This, indeed, was mind-blowing.)  Neros is pretty standard.  Rao's is pretty decent Italian fare, though I was shocked how empty the place was in December.  I've never been to Sea Harbour, but when that same space was Empress Court, I thought it was very good.  PURE deserves a special mention.  I haven't been there since October 2006, but the place is great, albeit expensive (in the range of $2,500 for a table for five, a bottle of Dom, a couple bottles of Grey Goose, and generous tips to our smoking hot server and a very helpful bouncer.)  If you're willing to spend a decent amount of money to get a table, I think it's worth it, if only not to stand in those ridiculously long lines.\n\nCOMPARABLES: Overall, Caesars is not quite as good as Wynn, but just better than Aladdin (which has been replaced with Planet Hollywood).", "type": "review", "business_id": "z3SyT8blMIhsZNvKJgKcRA"}

Also, when you are in the bathing area, make sure you wear slippers so you do not slip and crack open your skull like an egg (mmm...I love runny eggs...).

They were rude and were too busy talking amongst themselves to even notice we were standing there. I finally had to say hello to get noticed, I wasn't happy about this. They gave us a pager saying it would be around a 30 minute wait. There were TONS of people sitting around waiting for seats. We were called for our table about 30 minutes later. By this time, the front was getting crazy busy with people waiting for tables. \n\nAs we were seated, we noticed of course all the people at the front waiting for a table-then we noticed all the empty tables.....a serious WTF moment. :/ There were at least FIVE empty tables just in our section alone. So they were either purposely creating a wait OR were seriously understaffed.\n\nOur waiter was nice but he seemed to be in a constant rush.

He just sliced it into a bowl and stirred it a minute with a seasoning packet and served it. Again, I was NOT a happy camper. \n\nAll four of our dishes came with \"spanish rice\".

It adds a lot of character and is a huge improvement to the huge dry riverbed that once resided here. It's about 2 miles long and approximately 2 or 3 blocks wide and is open to both paddling and motorized boating. Be sure to check with the City of Tempe for regulations and fees related to boating on the lake. You can find the lake's administration office under the Mill Ave Bridge near Mill Ave and Washington.  I use to utilize this lake a lot several years ago when I would go kayaking. I absolutely loved that I had the opportunity to do that over my leisure time and not have to travel out of my way to take part in that activity. \n\nThe lake is also home to many other leisurely outdoor activities within the metropolitan area. That's another thing that makes this lake so great. It is a central area for biking, running, rollerblading, etc. along the perimenter of the lake. For the most part, you can travel full circle; well, almot full circle as the east end of the lake doesn't have a way across. Furthermore, you'll find sand volleyball courts located on the north side of the lake and the marina to station your boat permanently and to launch into the water. There are also warm up stations located at the marina, which basically are rowing machines like what you find in a gym; however, I'm not sure if those are open to the public or are meant for classes. The south side of lake includes a play area for the kids and is where non-boating public events are held.\n\nTempe Town Lake is also a central hub for many city-related activites such as concerts, athletic competitions, regattas, Octoberfest, and the city's 4th of July celebration. Be sure to check with Tempe's website for events occuring on the lake as it can effect plans you may have. I've subscribed to an email distribution list from the city that sends out updates of events that can interfere with my plans to go kayaking. Here's a caveat: even though the city says that the lake is clear for public use, parking can still be restricted for event use only.\n\nMoreover, the lake provides a central point for activity as well as provides the local community an opportunity to actually do something outside. It is also a great long term economic investment for the community as businesses and real estate open up surrounding the lake.", "type": "review", "business_id": "qkX9CmImtW97GHmt9NXKog"}

Fortunately, we are both gluttons and were able to pull ourselves together for round 2. I had the Eggs Benedict and roasted potatoes and my friend ordered the Wood-Oven Baked Eggs. Both were delicious. \nThe only thing I didn't like was that the tables were very close together. At times it felt like we were dining with our neighbors. Overall I would highly recommend St Francis' brunch and I am eager to return again.", "type": "review", "business_id": "uKSX1n1RoAzGq4bV8GPHVg"}

But that's about it.  The work is...not that of a 'MASTER TAILOR' as noted on her business cards.  The MOH dress was promised to be done a certain day, but when we arrived, we found out that the dress has not been worked on.  Dress and ribbon was still in its original form as when we first dropped it off.  Newt clearly didn't write down the details of what needed to be done during the consultation.  On top of that, I had prepaid for all the work that needs to be done!  So anyways, we came back a week later to pick it up.  Incompetency was revealed when we asked for a particular spot to be hemmed, she quickly said that she couldn't do it.\n\nNow onto my wedding dress.  The day came for me to come by to try it on.  Well, after I put it on, there was a 'pouch.'  We asked Newt if she can get rid of the 'pouch' since it was definitely not me having the pouch.  She said no she cannot.  Incompetency #2 was revealed then.\n\nAre you freakin' kidding me?  A week until my wedding and I am stuck with this unflattering dress and a so called Master Tailor can't do a damn thing about! \n\nMy MOH came to the rescue.  She called her tailor, referred me, I walked in, less than a week later, I had a custom fitted dress that doesn't have a pouch.  It was the same dress that Newt cannot altered, but Almasa at Europin was able to work her magic.  \n\nConclusion: Tailors should be certified before they can use \"Master Tailor.\"  In this case, I will never ever go back to Newts for anything.", "type": "review", "business_id": "sBR5OethVJ1_0Ed7c1pAGA"}

They don't have a casino so it's great for us nonsmokers who don't want to walk through a cloud of smoke to get to our rooms.\n\nThe rooms are very spacious and nicely decorated. The king size beds are very comfortable. I loved the double sinks in the bathroom and the jacuzzi tub. The bathrooms also have a separate shower and toilet.\n\nRoom service is polite and efficient. And to is guests services; having lost our room key several times, they were very nice about bringing one up or making us a new one.  \n\nMy one complaint about The Trump is that cell phone reception is nonexistent! There were 6 of us on 2 different floors and all different networks and no one had reception. I don't know how this is possible in 2014. That's the only reason we won't be returning to this hotel.", "type": "review", "business_id": "eP9T-2a94ChFAl1Rd2R0jg"}

The casino has a young hip vibe but not douchey, and of course, EARL OF SANDWICH. However, this is my first time staying here.\n\nUpon checking in, I like to do the '20 Dollar Trick' when I check into Vegas hotels. Sandwich a $20 between your ID and credit card and the front desk staff will upgrade you to a better room. Don't do this because it never works contrary to all the success stories I've read online. All you gotta do is ask politely. The lady hooked it up a strip view room since we originally booked a mountain view room. It was a great view of NYNY, City Center, and the Bellagio Fountains.\n\nThe room was pretty nice. We got the Dragnet room (movie starring Dan Aykroyd and Tom Hanks) so there was memorabilia everywhere in the room. We had some issues with the plumbing and there were nicks and stretches on the desks and closets, but that's nothing too big to cry about. \n\nWe got the room right off the elevator so you can hear the elevators through the walls, but if you're a deep sleeper it's not a problem. The pool is pretty okay. On weekends, they turn it into a Wet Republic/Rehab place, but on weekdays it's a regular ol pool.\n\nWith their location right in the middle of the strip, PH is definitely a place to consider when staying in Vegas.\n\nSincerely,\nThe Duke of Planet Hollywood Hotel and Casino", "type": "review", "business_id": "uJYw4p59AKh8c8h5yWMdOw"}

Eww! *scrunchy nose*\n\nDo shriveled potato skins, overcooked fried zucchini sticks, or soggy hot wings float your boat? Eww. *disdainful sneer*\n\nDoes the fact that they constantly change their specials and scheduled events without notice, luring you into this depressing hole under false pretenses sound dandy? Eww... *depressed sigh*\n\nI live dangerously close to this place, so more often than not I'll end up here when there's a dispute along the veins of: \"Whatta you wanna do tonight? I dunno. How bout you?\"\n\nMost frequently this is the end decision on a Friday night, when they hold live trivia with a host and the opportunity to win 20 to 30 bucks if you come in first or second place. But it's difficult to enjoy some live trivia when it's canceled every other week without any prior notice. That kind of business ethic doesn't instill any loyalty in your customer base. It's also kind of trashy how our winning credits are always hand written in near illegible chicken scratch on a piece of register tape, only redeemable for food, and only on a day other than trivia time. I get it. You want to lure us back on a weekday so we'll spend money in the bar. Klassy.\n\nI wouldn't have such a problem with the place if it the food was at least worth it. The nachos are huge and covered in lots of toppings but it's primarily cheap-o nacho cheese sauce or sour cream, which add little flavor and just make the whole thing a sloppy mess. The wings are soggy and generic (the hot isn't spicy in the least-- maybe they were referring to the temperature?), and there's an absolutely terrible Island Jerk flavor. The zucchini sticks are always overcooked and soggy. The cheese sticks are hard and chewy, not stringy mozzarella. The potato skins look like shriveled little potato abortions adorned by three bacon bits and some nacho sauce. The pizza is pretty decent and probably your best bet. I wouldn't recommend anything else on the menu. They use cheap, bargain basement product and it shows in the quality of the food.\n\nThat leaves the bar to make up for the abysmal food. Too bad that's pretty hit or miss, with an emphasis on the miss. For about a two month stretch Sneakers seemed to change their daily specials week by week if not day by day. One day it would be two dollar ladies mixed drinks all day, next week just 9pm to close. Then it would be two dollar drafts all day, changed to half priced wings during happy hour. I don't like the bait and switch. I understand that a new or struggling place needs to cut costs and redefine its specials but when it's changing that often (too quickly for even the signage on the tables or menus to keep up) there's a serious issue with management that needs to be addressed. \n\nIt seems like they've finally settled things to 75 cent domestic draft beers during happy hour (Coors and Bud) and half priced appetizers. Solid. Then from 9pm to close the daily drink specials start. Good. Keep it simple, stupid.\n\nThe service at least tries to make up for the crappy food and ever changing drink specials. They're always more than patient when it comes to explaining the changes and always apologetic when they get the brunt of our disappointment when we've been victims of the ole bait and switch. \n\nThe decor looks like a tacky college sports fan decorated it with all the tables sporting different teams and mascots, and paraphernalia splashed all over the walls willy nilly. There's also a weird identity problem going on, with some cheap wine prints on display in the bar and a gigantic statue of Uncle Lester from the Addams Family dressed in a referee suit. They offer Rock Band but I've never seen anyone playing it. They offer the Buzztime Trivia but hardly any televisions are ever tuned to it. There's a couple pool tables, darts, a basketball game, Buck Hunter and a couple other video games in the back. It just seems to be having an extreme identity crisis, trying to be something different to everyone, but half assing it so no one ends up satisfied.\n\nThey've taken to serving beer in plastic cups and giving out paper plates for food during happy hour which is a bit on the depressing side. The general vibe makes it seem like it's on the brink of closing any given week, which is too bad because they easily have one of the best patios in Tempe. \n\nIf you're going to go, sit on the patio and enjoy the greenery, cool water, friendly ducks and turtles sunning themselves. It will make you forget just how much of a downer it is inside the place.", "type": "review", "business_id": "3VHf0-N0er4fDZIMLt06gQ"}

The experience starts with driving up the the front of the Fairmont hotel grounds, which even at night is impressive. The restaurant interior was hip and tasteful with plenty of mood lighting. We sat in the bar area because the ambiance seemed nicer there, so I never actually sat in the main dining area, although I think we made a good choice. True to being a Michael Mina restaurant, the service and food were both impeccable. Enough with the restaurant description and on to the food!\n\nWe wanted to be able to stuff ourselves with meat, so we avoided getting appetizers, but we received a complimentary trio of fries with different seasonings (normal, garlic, and cajun) and dips, and fresh, hot buttery (or olive oily?) foccacia served in the cast iron pan it was baked it. So yummy! I got the special cut of beef of the day...I can't quite recall what it was, but I remember the server describing they kept the fat cap on it? I think it was some version of a NY strip. My husband got the filet mignon. Both were perfectly cooked to order,  incredibly flavorful and tender. We didn't get the kobe...but I can't imagine that t could be that much better for the price, but then what do I know. Along with the meat, we ordered several of the sides. I love mac & cheese...and when they have truffled mac & cheese, well that just makes a delicious treat so much better! You can really taste the truffle, which gave the mac & cheese an additional rich, earthy flavor. I want to go back just for the mac & cheese...well, and for everything else too, but especially the mac & cheese. We also got the soy marinated shitake mushrooms and the broccolini (in order to have that nutritionally balanced meal...) which were surprisingly tasty despite not having any meat or cheese involved. \n\nUnfortunately we were so full that we didn't order dessert, which I know is a crying shame. But that is another reason why we'll definitely be going back. Those beignets sound delicious! I've been to the Michael Mina restaurant in San Francisco, and although these are totally different restaurants and styles, the dedication to food and service are obvious in both of them. And compared to the SF restaurant, this place was a real bargain...heh heh, which I know isn't saying much. Definitely not your casual date restaurant, but not a bad 'convince your wife that she didn't make a mistake leaving the Bay Area for Phoenix to join her husband' restaurant.", "type": "review", "business_id": "8m08a9xJKmANwmeuR-0bPA"}

We purposely arrived early to have a drink at their bar.  There wasn't much of a selection on their happy hour drink menu so we just ordered our go-to drinks.  Champagne for her and a martini for me.  The hostess/waiter/waitress were very friendly and prompt.  When we were ready for dinner we were brought to the main dining area and our bar tab was transferred without trouble.\n\nI made a reservation a few weeks prior and made a notation that it was our anniversary.  Upon arrival at our table there was a card saying happy anniversary which was a nice touch.  The table was smack in the middle of the dining room so my wife asked if we could move to another table.  The host was very accommodating and gave us a better table.\n\nThe place is pretty sheik to the eye but uncomfortable.  The 2-top tables are small, too close to other people, and I don't want to sound like a 90 year old, but the chairs are ridiculously uncomfortable.  I don't know about you but I like to eat my too expensive meal in utter comfort.  The noise level is also above where it should be but they were playing some pretty solid tunes throughout the night.\n\nOur waitress was excellent and knowledgeable but was taking care of way too many tables which made her unable to come around as often as I would have liked.  I especially liked our sommelier who gave us an awesome wine recommendation.  Also, I'm not sure if this is all the time or not, but all bottles under $300 were 1/2 price so we splurged on a more expensive bottle than we would have normally purchased.\n\nThe Food:\n\n* Fries - they give these to you instead of bread.  They are excellent especially the truffle ones.  My only issue is that you could tell they were sitting out for a half hour before being served to us.  I would have liked them fresh but whatever.\n* Wedge Salad - just ok.  The blue cheese and bacon were great though.  It just wasn't the typical steak joint wedge I am used to and was looking forward to.\n* Burrata Cheese - this was very unique to me and pretty good\n* Truffled Mac n' Cheese - not the best I've ever had but still pretty good.  Not as thick and cheesy as I would have liked and they use weird noodles.\n* Wagyu Beef Trio - My wife and I shared this.  Perfect amount for the both of us to share.  Each 4oz piece of steak was perfectly cooked, juicy and delicious.  I still can't tell the difference between regular beef and wagyu though.  The sides were also very good.  We especially liked the mushrooms.  The mashed potatoes were too creamy and just eh.\n* Beignets - we shared these for desert and they are fluffy, sugary awesomeness.  The sauces are equally awesome.\n\nAll-in-all it was a fantastic meal and great experience.  Good food, good wine, good company.  I would come back any time to enjoy a steak or one of their burgers.", "type": "review", "business_id": "8m08a9xJKmANwmeuR-0bPA"}

I service was just OK but I had a bad feeling our waiter was trying to overly sell us from the beginning. I understand it's the wait staff's job to do their best to up the bill but our waiter was very persistent.\n\nWe were a party of four, my wife and two daughters and our waiter suggested 3-4 entrees per person at $17-$49 per entree. At least he was correct in indicating we needed to order that much food!\n\nWe decided to take it slow, starting out with one entree per person and then would take it from there. Everything came out one at a time, the first being the tuna pizza which was excellent. Next the Serrano yellow tail was also outstanding but I could have eaten it all in one bite by myself and the pop rock roll was kind of cool, sized kinda small but passable. \n\nI decided to order the most expensive roll, the Protein roll at $30 and could not have been more disappointed. My thinking was a $30 roll must be a decent roll. Right??? I've been to places like Nobu and spent $700 for dinner, but there you get what you pay for. Well,..The size of this $30 roll was seriously the diameter of a quarter. It was something I might expect to see at a all you can eat sushi or $1 per roll sushi house\n\nI do not clip coupons, wear bow ties, send anything back to the kitchen nor do I complain but leaving any restaurant $300 lighter and still hungry makes me give this restaurant two thumbs down. \n\nI can think of about 20 sushi restaurants off the top of my head where I've paid 1/3 the price, received the same quality, equal or better atmosphere and 3 times the portion size so my suggestion is to pick one of the other 100+ sushi houses in Las Vegas and leave this one alone.", "type": "review", "business_id": "JsDZZ9S3qntzCfo5N_Ci6A"}

If I could give 2.5 stars I would. I really wanted to rate this restaurant at a much higher rating. \n\nI took my boyfriend here to celebrate his birthday a few days early. We arrived at around 7:30 and the place was packed. I should have made a reservation because we walked in and the line of people waiting at the hostess table was almost out the door. We waited to be greeted by the hostess for about 5 minutes before we could give her our names. At first, both of the hostesses were polite and told us that a table for two had about a 10-15 minute wait, so we stood in the waiting area because there were no more seats available. About 20-25 minutes go by and we still hadn't been called up. We went back to the hostess station and asked the girls what was going on. Somehow, they ended up not taking our name down, so we were never added on their wait list. When we asked them how much longer from that point, they told us 35-40 minutes, despite the fact that we had already been waiting. Their excuse was that the kitchen was working at capacity. Yeah. I understand. But if the kitchen is working at capacity, then why did she offer for us to sit at the full-service bar? Sounded like a poorly-constructed excuse devised to cover up a mistake. We sucked it up, gave them our name and made sure they had it this time, and went back to standing. Other groups and couples kept walking in and were being seated immediately. I was so frustrated that I asked my boyfriend if he wanted to leave and go somewhere else, but he said no so we just walked around the Kierland area. \n\nAfter about 20 minutes, we got a text saying our table was ready. We walked back, and were seated outside. Our waitress came to take our drink order, and having had so much linger-time before we were seated, we already knew what we wanted to order, so we ordered the Pig pizza as an appetizer along with two Diet Cokes to drink. She came back immediately with two water glasses, but no Diet Coke. In the meantime, we asked for some bread and infamous sun-dried tomato butter to snack on. Five minutes had gone by and she stopped by our table with nothing, and simply told us that the bartender was backed up-- this seemed to be the excuse of the evening all night. I mean, how hard is it to really fill up a couple of soda glasses. Five minutes later, she came back with our drinks, but no bread. It took her about another 2 minutes for bread. \n\nRight after the bread came, our pizza came. It was absolutely delicious. The meats were so flavorful, the crust was the perfect consistency and thickness, and the sauce was amazing. Even though this place isn't technically a \"pizzeria,\" I think their pizza was better than LGO's Gladiator (similar pizza with two types of sausage).  In the meantime, we ordered our main courses. I got the spaghetti, and he got the short rib gnocchi. \n\nAbout 10 minutes after finishing the pizza the main courses came out. My spaghetti was really really good. The pasta, almost similar to a bucatini, was not like most traditional spaghettis. The noodles themselves were thick (larger diameter), and cooked to al-dente perfection. The pasta wasn't swimming in sauce, and similar to the pizza sauce, was very nicely flavored. My boyfriends gnocchi on the other hand was a complete disaster. I seriously cannot explain how unappetizing it was. The short ribs were apparently really good, but the sauce that it came in was SO bitter. I pretty much just dipped my fork in the sauce and didn't want to eat any more of it. After about 3 bites, we ended up having to send it back. We waited a bit, talked to the manager (I'm assuming), and eventually the other dish came out. It was actually pretty good. I can't remember what it was called but it had chicken, spinach, pine nuts and pasta all together. By this time (9:30 ish) the restaurant was starting to clear out. The waitress was nice enough to comp us an apple crumble dessert (that was truly delicious) because we were celebrating his birthday. We ate it, paid about $55 for the whole meal, and left 2 1/2 hours later. All together, the food was really good, but the service was really, really lackluster. \n\nIf the service was even just a little bit better, this place would have gotten four stars in my book. At this point, I'm not too sure if I'd be back or not. Maybe I'll venture out on a day that seems to be less crowded, where all the staff can keep up with demands.", "type": "review", "business_id": "LfKPiwth-lGmCKTxlDoV9g"}

They also have TVs for you to watch while eating there.\n\nIt seems that Culveers likes to open their locations at the more outskirt areas of town, such as Deer Valley, Cave creek Road near the Loop 101, and their east Mesa location.

The staff made us feel like cattle being prodded along the line so we really didn't sample any flavors prior to ordering. \n\nI decided to pig out and went with the Homemade Ice Cream Sandwich. It was two chocolate cookies with your choice of ice cream in the middle. I went with the Brownie Swirl and thought it was pretty tasty.  The cookies had a nice crunch to them and the ice cream was sweet but not overpowering. It was really messy though.\n\nMy wife ordered a single of the peanut butter flavor and she didn't finish it. My youngest ordered a single of the chocolate sorbet which was bitter if you're into that.  My oldest ordered a salted caramel shake that tasted like plain milk.  Absolute Disappointment! No flavor! \n\nOverall I was disappointed for the amount of money we paid for flavors that were mediocre.

I have bought 5 pairs of shoes there, one I have yet to wear cause the look so damn good, a really cool pair of 100% recycled Adidas Gazelles, another pair of Adidas Gazelles, a cool pair of Nike's and another pair of Adidas that I wear to Roller Derby bouts cause they are the only thing I have with Pink in them.\n\nAfter my last trip I had to tell my roommate not to let me go there on payday. Bad Bad Juju.\n\nGo to High Point, the store is great, the guys there are awesome, the clothes are great and the shoes even better.\n\nSo I close as I began...Hi, my name is Hotchy and I am a kicksaholic.", "type": "review", "business_id": "jF7R5nxyGiwPM5Q7xLfD5g"}

Since we had a heavy lunch, we opted to share appetizers and dinner entrees.  I loved the d\u00e9cor...red walls and muted lighting makes the restaurant appear elegant.  \n\nDishes my friends and I tried and their star ratings (with 5 stars being the best):\n\n* Fried Calamari (4 stars / $16) - The calamari was tender and the batter just right...not too crispy.  The crisp-fried slices of onion and parsley added to the texture...the spicy aioli sauce finishes off this appetizer perfectly.  \n    \n* Roasted Pork Chop with Sage and Garlic (4 stars / $34) - This thick and large porkchop is stuffed with fontina cheese and prosciutto.  I loved the stuffed cheese.  The Asian-inspired sauce was good, but a bit strong, so a side of mashed potatoes or rice would have gone well with it.  \n\n* Linguini with Clam Sauce (4 stars / $25) - This dish consisted of roasted clams with garlic, olive oil, white wine, and parsley tossed with linguini.  My friend said the sauce was light and flavorful, and the clams were cooked just right.    \n\n* Roasted Shrimp Penne (4 stars / $29) - This dish consisted of a puttanesca sauce with capers, olives, and spicy peppers tossed with penne pasta.  My friends thought the dish was good, but didn't think it warranted the $29 price tag.  \n\n* Margherita Wood-Fired Pizza (4 stars / $14) - This pizza consisted of Bel Paese\" cheese, tomato and basil.  \n\n* Bombolini (3 stars / $10) - Warm amoretti and ricotta beignets (mini donuts) filled with nutella.\n\nThe wine list had a lot of good options, but we stayed away from alcohol during dinner and stuck with mineral water and sodas as we were saving our drinking for Tryst.  \n\nOverall, Stratta has great ambiance, good food and great service.  Although none of the dishes wowed us, I would definitely dine here again if I'm staying at the Wynn.", "type": "review", "business_id": "M_b7P2IBKY6zyqDmXE1kJA"}

Indulge and spoil yourself for a treat you will never forget!\n\nI have been to this creamery twice now and each time I was overly surprised at how good it was.  It has the perfect balance of sweetness that is incredibly hard to find.  In fact, this is the first time I have found just that!  If you like a lot of sugar in your sweets, this may not be the place for you.  But, if you're like me and are in constant search for the best, then you need to experience it for yourself.\n\nNot only is the sweetness mastered, but the flavor infusions are wonderfully concocted as well.  Coconut, one of my favorites, made with real \"young\" coconuts (not from a bag), makes you feel like you are in Mexico--it tasted that fresh.  If you like your gelato plain or frivolous, it's all there.  Rocky Road, Pistachio, Chocolate, Roasted Banana, Cherries Jubilee, to only name a short few.  Both times I went the selection was a little different, so be courageous and discover new favorites!\n\nThe prices are reasonable, considering the quality you are getting.  However, if you are not used to reaching in your pocket every once in awhile for good gelato, then this place is not for you.  I would rather visit La Scala Creamery over The Gelato Spot any day.  If you were to compare the two, I would say the the former is much better and the prices about the same.\n\nYour furry friend will also find a little treat in this hidden treasure.  Already prepared in a little ounce cup to satisfy any companion!  But, I leave the taste testing of those up to them!\n\nIf you hang around a little, you should ask the owner about her fermented green tea.  It is a marvelous drink that will leave you wondering, \"what the heck is in that?\"  A little mix of ying and yang.  Alas, she would not give away all her secrets, but it is for sale here also.  If you can get over the extravagant $5 sticker price, it is a treat that makes you wish the bottle it was in was much larger.  \n\nThis is a must see for yourself for all foodies.

Ok here goes: First off I have nothing major-negative to say , ok that's done. I heard about this place and really wanted to try it so once I did I had high expectations. It was good food, I had the Moroccan mussels the big one, and it was tasty and very spicy which I liked. The broth was also good, not great but good. Over all it was a good meal , if not a little pricy for me. The menu is not to big not to small. Beer goes well with the mussel pot I think. You have the wine sauce they are cooked in, so another glass of wine kind of over does it. A beer compliments it very well I believe . So it's a good restaurant , kind service, fresh seafood. I give it a thumbs up, if your visiting or just love locally harvested mussels go here!", "type": "review", "business_id": "Lpy2yLyOu8oep28P3wmuKw"}

Returned with my brother and boyfriend while we were in town, and we wound up returning twice in two days.  (Granted, the second time was due to me leaving my gloves there the first time.  But coffee was consumed.)  \n\nThe menu is huge.  The breakfast was as satisfying as I remembered.  Nutella shake was bangin.  Coffee was solid.  Wifi was free.  The horde of Scottish hipsters at the pool table was adorable.  The restrooms were really cold.  The bill was very cheap.\n\nIt should be noted that after a few hours after our last meal there, my boyfriend felt a little lousy and my brother broke out in hives (very unusual for him).  They blamed the mayonaise left sitting on the tables, and since I skipped on the mayo for that meal, that could very well be the case - but the reactions could also have been to one of our beers after dinner as well.  At any rate, Americans keep mayo in the refrigerator, so City Cafe should consider staying authentic and doing the same.\n\nI'll be back next time I'm in town.", "type": "review", "business_id": "bYVw4AB5Y7plyqxAJgSi5w"}

The designer was really patient and helpful with me when it came to picking colors, fonts, shirts and cleaning up my design.

People to this day still wear the shirt. \n\nSince that first experience I have returned back to Brand X to create many more t-shirt designs. I've made shirts made for themed parties, gift items and even underwear. \n\nGenerally when I go I prefer to work with Phil because he was so helpful with my first shirt design but I have worked with other designers and they are just as helpful and patient. \n\nThe products are great and last a while. One shirt in particular I've worn on a regular basis and there is barely any fading and absolutely no cracking of the ink. They are quality products and really care about what the customer wants and work with you rather than against you. \n\nThis is one local business I highly recommend.", "type": "review", "business_id": "UDWLaPTclYXBdG7PYIe1Zw"}

One lamp was broken, one of the two sinks clogged, tv remote would not work from the bed...needed batteries?.  There was also a smell of smoke in the room. I am guessing the neighbors.\n\nThe bad: We booked a package with two free buffets.  When I checked in I asked about them and was told it was a buffet credit, not free buffets.  She said that meant we had a food credit of $65 and could get lunch the first day and use the rest toward breakfast the next. So that was the plan.  Long story short, I checked my balance and was told the buffet credit was a one time use only so the extra we saved by choosing lunch and skipping drinks went to waste.  I asked to speak with the manager but the young lady spoke with him and said there was nothing her could do.  She was nice, but didn't fix the problem.  I did not want to be \"that guy\" but I am guessing that being polite did not help me in this situation. \n\nWith so many hotel choices I would have thought this hotel would have wanted to fix the problem so we would recommend the hotel or return.

It was a good dish but nothing spectacular.\n\n- Cheese Quesadilla: large enough for sharing with a few people. Tasted good.\n\n- Crab cake sliders: decent bits of crab, with lemon aioli, not too much filler. They were a little dry but tasty. I still haven't had great crab cakes in this city.

As the name implies, these guys know their coffee but the cafe lacks the pretence or pomp might expect from such coffee-bean-brewers and java veterans.\n\nInstead, the regular baristas are friendly, chilled and match the vibe of the shop - slightly bohemian, home-made and comfy. There's a quirky wee room up the back that has an open-planned seated area. You can't take your own table and turn your back on your fellow java-drinkers. Instead, you share four coffee tables with whoever might be sitting next to you.\n\nWhen I wandered in, the barrister greeted me with a \"heeeeeyy, how's it going guys? What can I get you?\" We asked what he'd recommend after a big meal, and he suggested a Guatemalan if you wanted with milk, or a Himalayan for without. We went for one cafetiere of each, and took our seats in the coffee den up the back.\n\nThe coffee is just plain wonderful. They roast all the beans themselves, and are testing new blends all the time (I'm a fan on Facebook, they let us know what they're brewing up next). So, suffice to say, if you want good coffee this should be your number one pit stop, hands down.\n\nOn a previous visit, when I hadn't just eaten a 2-course meal, I also had one of their brownies with an iced tea. Ah-may-zing. I was told by the barrister they were delicious, and he was right. Home-made, fudgey, perfect with the coffee.\n\nThe seats aren't the comfiest, so for anyone with sore backs or wanting to curl up in a leather-arm chair and spend an hour or so reading a book, maybe go for take-away and head home. \n\nBut Artisan Roast isn't trying to imitate Starbucks or Beascene and doesn't need the comfy chairs (it isn't the Spanish Inquisition either). Good coffee, friendly and genuine staff, wonderfully quirky and bohemian decor (check out the upside down tea cup light shades, or the vintage  frame around the fuse box) keeps this place a steady stream of slightly jittery customers.\n\nWhilst it might have a bohemian, student vibe due to the decor and distinctly beardy barrister, in the time I was there a few business men came and went for an espresso. Even if it's not your \"scene\", if you're a true coffee drinker then hit this place up.", "type": "review", "business_id": "PkPcOZh1tQfQUV6bJRTrng"}

The peanut shells all over reminded me of Jimmy Mac's in my current hometown of Federal Way, WA. It's a fun touch, and something to do while you wait for your food, which wasn't actually very long at all. For both visits, we were seated right away even though the restaurant and bar appeared to be doing good business. It's a dimly lit tavern that's a cross between a sports bar and family restaurant with old west & southwest decor. The cowhides were certainly an interesting touch. \n\n My mother-in-law recommended the cheese curds as an appetizer and hubby and I thought they were fantastic. They come with a spicy jalapeno ranch dip, which I loved, but my husband and mother-in-law preferred them with regular ranch. On our second visit, she actually ordered the curds again as a shared appetizer and then ordered another one as her dinner. What can I say,  she's a Brit, and they love their cheese. As delicious as the cheese curds are, I was surprised that they were $6.99. Seemed a bit much for a bowl of deep fried cheese.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised to see edamame on their starters menu, so I ordered their garlic soy edamame. It was a very generous, savory serving and better priced at $4.99, but I could only eat the ones not soaking in the garlic soy sauce soup. \n\nI'm a big fan of chicken wings, and I've been craving some since our last visit to Buffalo Wild Wings in Vancouver, WA, earlier in November. I can tell you that Teakwoods has just as good, if not better wings. They don't have the variety of flavors of course, but their honey BBQ wings were delcious, and fairly good-sized. On our second visit, I had the wings again. I went with their special \"Mango Bango\" flavor of the day, and while still tasty, it wasn't as flavorful as described and compared to the honey BBQ, quite disappointing actually.\n\nHubby had the chili on his first visit ($3.95) and found it so filling, he couldn't finish his bowl. It probably didn't help that he had some of his mother's cheeseburger sliders ($8.99) as well. He offered me a bite and I would have made them an option if Teakwoods didn't also serve great wings.\n\nOn our second visit the hubby had their chicken fried chicken and again found the helping too large to finish. It was quite huge, pounded thin, breaded and fried, taking up most of his plate. He's a food separatist, though, and will go through his veggies first, so by the time he gets to the actual entree, he's full. I had a bite of the chicken and thought the breading was nicely crunchy, but nothing special.\n\nThe service wasn't bad. Like I said, we were seated promptly at both visits, our orders taken within a few minutes and the appetizers were out within the time it took me to go through about 10 or so peanuts. The soft drinks are huge, so we didn't need more than one refill, which was probably the idea.\n\nTeakwood offers everything you could want in a neighborhood bar: flat screen TVs to catch the MLB, NFL and college sports, a special menu every day on top of their regular fare and a full bar with  daily specials as well. I'm sure Teakwoods will be our go-to place whenever we visit again.", "type": "review", "business_id": "d06ZIF5TeK5j_Pii7_LmXA"}

BUT don't let that fool you, their picks are usually quite delicious. Monday's and Tuesday's are holidays on my calendar because it's $20 bottle of wine and board of bruschetta night!! This makes me a happy girl!! It's a relaxed atmosphere, music level is just right, all you hear is people enjoying themselves. Service is excellent, waiters/waitresses know what they are talking about, and help each other out even if it's not their table. If you come on a busy night ($20 dollar nights or the weekends) expect a long wait. However, there are plenty of spots to hang out... grab a menu because you can order your bottle of wine and have a glass while you wait for your table.. is that awesome or what? The combination of this being a small place and generally busy on most nights makes it difficult for them to accommodate a large group. Save Postino's for a more intimate place with a date or small group of friends. The food menu is also short, with a mix of a few appetizers, paninis, and salads. The bruschetta board is a whole other topic because it's the most popular thing on the menu... they always have the same list of 10-12 bruschetta to choose from with a seasonal option depending on the time of year. It's not listed on the menu but you have the option of getting the bread \"thin sliced\" which I recommend on $20 nights because I know you will want seconds :) Everyone I have brought to Postino's to experience their magic has loved it.

We ordered our food, I ordered a blackend chicken salad and my sister ordered a meatball sub.\n\nIt took a full half hour for our food to arrive. At one point our waitress came out joking that she ate the food so they had to make another one. I know that she was trying to make light of it taking so long but it was still a little frustrating. We were in no hurry but still this is way to long for a salad and a sandwich to come out. Once we got our food it was just okay. The blackened chicken in my salad was really tasty but the fat free ranch that they serve is horrible, I would recommend anything but this dressing.

I responded by saying that I had looked up the website to make reservations (I had read the fine print) but there was no place on the website to make reservations like most Food and Drink establishments.  The FAQs clearly stated that large parties or bottling parties needed a reservation however \"...if you would like to visit Studio Vino without a reservation and sample wines made on site, you are more than welcome to do so!\".\n\nApparently we were not welcome to do so.  She said that we should try to come back another time because she had sold too many Groupons and could not keep up with all of them.

I love the cornbread as long as it isn't too sweet. The cornbread was great, not sweet, and to my surprise, little chunks of jalapeno mixed in, friend and I got one each of these delightful starts to lunch. Nice, very nice start to my anticipation of better things to come.\n\nLunch friend and I started with an appetizer of wings. They came out in an attractive basket (8 of them $7.95) so they are $1.00 a piece. Crispy fried with a sweet BBQ sauce and your usual celery and carrot sticks with what looked like ranch dressing. Now here is the experience once I \"bit\" into them....sweet but no smoke or taste to the wings, just the initial sugar rush, fried skin and then no flavor to the wing. Disappointed. I cannot figure out what the magic white sauce that accompanied the celery sticks is? Something whiteish, just not ranch, not mayonaise...like light mayonaise without taste, whatever it was, it remained in the bowl not eaten. Uh Oh, I said under my breath.\n\nOK...so I said to myself \"If you want good dough...go to a bank, or go to a bakery\" If you want good wings...well go to the Native New Yorker and get all you want at around fifty cents and 31 flavors if you want.\n\nWell, let's judge them by the BBQ, that is why I came here. So the way to sample BBQ is... the Sample plate, three meats at lunch (not including ribs I might add). Had to have their ribs, so got a few on the side plus the one sidedish which I chose coleslaw. Pulled pork, brisket, and chicken, plus the side of baby back ribs that I had to have. $12.95 plus $3.00 for the side of ribs. A little (and I mean little silver cup of BBQ sauce reserved usually for a side of horseradish)\n\nPulled pork....2 stars. brisket 2 stars, chicken 2 stars, ribs 2 stars, coleslaw, 3 stars.\n\nSorry, Bad to the Bone no pun intended is just that.

People bumping into one another; servers bumping into people. \n\nNames are given with the hope of getting a table. Hostess could care less. Grumbles something about a wait.

It'll be another 10+ minutes before a \"server\" shows up. Our server on this particular night was a bearded gentleman with a chip on his shoulder that was bigger and more full than his Duck Dynasty wannabe scraggly beard could ever hope to be. \n\nHe literally slammed waters on the table and asked if we wanted anything else. I ordered a single hopalicious, while extending a smile and a sincere thank you. Nothing. Just a quick turn and departure.\n\nThat would be ok if he were on a mission to fill the requested beer. But it was another 10 minutes before he returned. He had the beer, and then asked what we wanted for food. We ordered two appetizers, which he struggled with - the notion of getting the \"pork AND shrimp spring roll\" apparently too much to handle... He wrapped up the order with a, \"so, just appetizers?\" and an eye roll upon our confirmation.\n\n20 minutes later, we had our appetizers and more attitude when we requested a refill on the beer. We never saw said server again, save for a fling of the check at us. \n\nSo... Crappy service, cramped interior, slow kitchen, and mediocre food... I will order takeout, but I'll be hard pressed to dine in again. It's just not worth the frustration.", "type": "review", "business_id": "th4uGmjyjPnQpN-ukf20PA"}

It is in Town Square which is ok but parking is a nightmare sometimes. The inside is nice and large. The wait staff is real nice.  They don't have fountain drinks? So you get a bottle at a time. That sucks. If I'm going to have to pay by the bottle then I'm going to drink beer. They only have a house salad or tomato and mozzarella, no ceasar. I'm a ceasar fan but I figured I'd enjoy the house if it's the only one it should be good right? Not really.  It was, maah ok at best and only ok because I got the Gorgonzola to top it with. The pizza toppings are about the same as Grimaldis as far as limitations but I don't mind as long as it's good. We got a meatball pizza, a white pizza, a tomato spinach pizza, and a pepperoni pizza. Yeah we tried a lot but it was a party.  The pizzas came out nice and hot but the crust is a bit more chewy and the mozz on the pizza didn't seem to be as fresh as I'd hoped for. So, I say if you're in Town square and want pizza (you must like thin crust) go to Anthonys over California Industrial Mass Produced Pizza Kitchen anytime but if you want great New York style coal fired thin crust check out Grimaldis.

I also tried the lobster roll.\n\nThis place must live on the novelty of being \"gluten free\", because that's the only reason I can see to eat there.  For those of us who can eat gluten, the batter is anything but flavourful.  I'd describe it as bland, with a \"mealy\" texture; and certainly not the nice crispy texture you'd want if you're craving fried seafood.  I understand that those with gluten allergies will love this place on principle, but this is definitely a case where everyone else suffers.  They DO have whole belly clams, so that is a plus.  However, you have to tolerate the gross batter in which they're fried.  Talk about taking a good thing and ruining it completely!!\n\nOn the flip side, the lobster roll had way too much seasoning, especially the SALT!!  It was literally like eating a salt lick on a dried out, toasted, New England style hot dog bun.  It had lots of fillers, too.  It was stuffed with lettuce and celery; not something anyone in New England would tolerate in a lobster roll.  Of course, that didn't matter, since you couldn't even remotely taste the lobster with the entire mixture tasting like it had been prepared on a big block of salt.\n\nWhen the gentleman behind the counter asked how everything tasted, I did bring the saltiness of the lobster salad to his attention.  I asked him if he made his lobster salad for the rolls in big batches, and he said yes.  I advised that he ought to taste it, as the salt levels were extremely unbearable.  He then proceeded to tell me that another customer had commented on the salt level, and that this particular batch they \"got in\" seemed \"saltier than usual.\"  Thus, it seems that they actually don't \"make\" their lobster salad in big batches, but rather \"get it in\" in big batches.\n\nHowever, the biggest faux pas wasn't the extreme saltiness of the mixture, but rather the complete lack of any effort to \"make it right\" with me, the customer.  All I got was a gruff, \"sorry,\" and that was that.\n\nI used to live in Boston.  I know what good \"East Coast\" seafood is supposed to be like.  This is NOT it!!\n\nP.S. I saw three high chairs in the restaurant.  ALL THREE OF THEM HAD BROKEN STRAPS.  If you have a little one who fidgets a lot, then note that you won't be able to properly strap them in at the table.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Oqb-MBYAmYUJLKwbwpQUEQ"}

The group I met for Happy Hour was rather large, so I decided to buy my drink at the bar.  It took them at least 10 minutes to take my order.

It wasn't a big bar to begin with and the bar area wasn't that busy.  \n\nOne crotchity old guy was talking to his friend and said something on the lines of \"Geez it's taking forever to get a beer.\" The lady at the cash register told him that she was closing the register and then had some pretty passive agressive statements to say to him.  The old guy was like, I wasn't even talking to you and then went on a rant.  Even though he was rude, he had a point.  \n\nI've been to bigger bars, that were busier with the same amount of people, and had my drink in a timely manner.

Unfortunately the first day fell on Christmas Day and major hotels on the Strip were bit too pricey, so I gambled and booked this Holiday Inn which was about a mile away from the Strip.  I've been to Vegas many times but never stayed at a hotel which is off the Strip and didn't know what to expect.  Luckily once you pass the Las Vegas Boulevard, it only takes about 2-3 minutes to the hotel.  There are many popular restaurants around there, including my new favorite, Firefly.  The garage had the gate which made me wonder if the area was not safe or I should be looking around when we unload our luggage but that was the only part that made me feel a tiny bit uneasy and everything else was great.  Unlike those Vegas hotels, there was no waiting line to check-in and the young guy at the front desk was very pleasant.  The room felt like it was still new and we thought it was a decent size.  Oh, but I kept hitting my feet to the bed frame.  Overall, everything was clean and new except the bed sheet.  When I opened my comforter, it had wrinkles like someone was sleeping on there already.  I checked the pillows and they looked clean and didn't smell anything and I was too tired to call the front desk and wait for someone to come and change it so I've decided to ignore it.  I went to sleep right away and heard nothing but my sister said many people came back to their rooms after midnight and got pretty loud.  She said she thought someone was in our room talking.  Next day, I was able to enjoy my favorite TV channel on a big flat TV while my sister was able to check her emails for free.  We knew we'd sleep in late until we had to check-out so didn't bother to ask if we get the free breakfast as some of those Vegas websites stated but I think I've read we could get complimentary coffee in the morning at their cafe.  We were going to shop whole day so we moved to a hotel on the Strip next day, but when I come to Vegas by myself, I often go to places off the Strip and don't need to stay at those pricey major hotels.  Especially, many hotels nowadays have been cutting down many amenities anyways (do you remember we used to get stuff like cotton swabs, shoe polish clothe or mending kit?) but adding ridiculous Resort Fees for nothing (this past year, I've stayed at Mirage, Treasure Island, Venetian and Planet Hollywood which recently stopped charging the Resort Fee).  I didn't feel like I downgraded and stayed at a cheap motel.  It was nice that there was no awful smell of smoke to go through when you come back  to the hotel or stupid Resort fee to pay but got a free internet access with many good dining places to choose from.  I'll definitely stay here again (but I will call the front desk if I see wrinkles on my bed sheet next time).", "type": "review", "business_id": "MjV_WoK4whfRH4apmkZ5rg"}

There are other hotdog joints, but none of them seem to offer an authentic Chicago dog experience. You will not find a single ingredient missing and it is all made fresh right before your eyes.\n\nHaving said that, there is far more to Lobby's than just the dogs. Their fries are amazing and extend into \"how-will-I-ever-eat-anything-else?\" territory with the addition of chili and cheese. They also offer a burger made for bragging rights: 3 lbs. of delicious cheeseburger. Finish it quick enough and you'll have your picture added to the hall of fame. Plus, the staff is always very friendly and the place is always immaculate.\n\nWhen my 3-year-old nephew dined with us here, he had a plain hotdog. He smashed the bun flat against the hotdog and told me it tasted better that way. That's not particularly important for the review, but I wanted to share that anyway. So, there you go.

It's disappointing (and overwhelming for some) to choose a wine, and when I'm not given the country/region of the wine this task seems more daunting.  That being said our waitress recommended a Pinot that was delicious, and even offered me a taste prior to purchasing the bottle.  \n\nI've eaten here twice, my first visit was on  Friday night a few months back with a group of girls.  I enjoyed my chicken satay, although the meat was a bit on the dry side.  The other girls all commented they enjoyed their meals, and overall the experience was great!  Our service was top notch (I believe the owner) and kept our glasses full and did not balk at our request for separate checks.  Because of this experience I was excited to return!\n\nLast night I returned with my boyfriend with high hopes and was utterly disappointed.  With the exception of the pinot mentioned above, nothing was all that great.  We started with a cheese plate, and concluded they should not be allowed to call what was served to us a cheese plate.  The manchego cheese was good, but the rest of the plate was a mess of crumbled feta with walnuts and dried fruit and some dry bread.  I love bread but couldn't eat it. Blech.  Not even close to being worth the charge.\n\nI ordered the curried beef kabobs with a side salad, and the boy got the steak panini.  My meal was dry and bland.  The meat was seasoned well, but had no dipping sauce and was sitting on dry rice.  The side of the kabobs was also on the smaller side.  Average at best.  The panini was a bit better in my opinion, but the boy wasn't too impressed.  Overall, the main meals:fail.  Big bummer, because like I said...I REALLY want to like this place!\n\nWill I return?

This place is like an abusive relationship (they never treat you right but you love them!).  The food is pretty good.  I really like their pancakes, very rich and fluffy.  The croque is good.

Their service is subpar and it is shocking because most times I go there are probably only three to four other people in the restaurant with three or four servers talking behind the counter.  They are not really accommodating with the menu.  I dare you to ask for a simple tweak without getting a huge sigh out of one of them.  I can't put my finger on it...maybe the owners or management are mean and that rolls down to the staff but they just seem really unhappy and put out about stuff.  The weekend mornings are hoppin' and it really rattles the poor boys and girls that work there (what?!?! People want breakfast?!?).  Don't get the girl who wears jean shorts and tennis shoes.

It is comparable to all the sushi places in the valley that offer all you can eat.  The fish was frozen like most places and being priced at 24.95 for all you can eat, it's the same as anywhere else. The staff is great but the sushi \"chefs\" are faking Japanese.  Being with a party of 9 I was concerned that some of the order was going to be messed up.  For the sushi they have sheets for ordering so there were no mistakes. However the sushi itself took a while to come out.  The appetizers were quick but there was a wait in between.\n\nA good part about this place was the selection of appetizers.  The appetizer menus ranged from Poke to fried octopus. I had the miso glazed black cod that was probably the most delicious thing on the menu. It was a great melt in your mouth texture to the fish. The poke served here was good but the fish was frozen cold.  Also I tried the hamachi kama which was pretty much burned on the outside but the inside was tender and juicy with the ponzu sauce on the side. Everything else was just about average. \n\nAs for the sushi I tired most of the nigiri choices off the menu since I don't really like rolls. None of the sushi was actually memorable. A few friends of mine were ordering all the rolls that they offered and it appeared that they were rather skinny compared to what you might find anywhere else which is great because it allows for variety.  It appeared that most of it was covered in a mayo sauce that it very common at American sushi bars.\n\nI would go again mostly for the appetizers, as for the sushi you can't expect much from an all  you can eat place. but i would recommend over any other all you can eat place in Vegas.", "type": "review", "business_id": "FC4q3hJyF8oo984xoo3RMg"}

Two of them were total disasters. Thank God for Canal Street as it saved the culinary portion of the trip. \n\nMy sister chose the restaurant and when I checked it out online I didn't have very high hopes. The reviews were good and all, but the pictures on their website looked very tacky and drab and it looked like some old 60's dining room without the kitsch appeal. Luckily the decor looks MUCH nicer in person and it's actually a very pleasant atmosphere. \n\nAs an appetizer I started with the shrimp cocktail. This was the only downside to the meal and the reason they are getting 4 stars instead of 5. It was $14 and you only get 3 shrimp. They are good sized shrimp, but not big enough to warrant the price. Additionally, they were over cooked and a little tough. The presentation was outstanding though. It was a very nicely put together plate. \n\nThe dinner salad with the house raspberry vinaigrette dressing was quite good and was included with the price of the entree. That's a nice change of pace considering most high end steakhouses don't include the salad and you have to pay extra if you want one. \n\nAs for my entree, I had the filet mignon and ordered it medium. It was absolutely awesome! Definitely one of the best steaks I have ever had. It was cooked perfectly, was very tender with absolutely no fat or gristle at all. They gave me a steak knife, but honestly I probably could have cut it with a butter knife. \n\nI also ordered a side of the lobster mac and cheese. It was not at all what I expected, but again, the presentation was fantastic and it was quite tasty even though I couldn't find any lobster anywhere in it. The side dishes are huge and we probably should have shared them rather than ordering our own. It did mean I had left overs though! \n\nThe service was quite impressive. From the waiter, to the busboy, to the hosts, everything about the service was impeccable! Our water glasses never got low and as soon as I finished my soda another one was sitting there in front of me. They definitely have their stuff together here. \n\nThe only negative thing that happened was at the end of the meal we weren't really offered any dessert. The waiter did ask if we wanted \"anything else\" but usually at a high end restaurant like this they will bring out a dessert cart or tray, or at least a dessert menu. I'm not sure we were have ordered anything, but we weren't in a hurry to leave and might have ordered dessert if something looked interesting. \n\nI would definitely agree with the reviews that mention the age of the clientele here. I think we were the youngest people there by at least 10 years and there was one woman there who was so old I think she was actually decomposing at the table. Also, some of the food takes a little longer to make (the mac and cheese takes at least 45 minutes) but honestly, if you are in a hurry you shouldn't be going to a fine dining restaurant anyway. This is definitely a sit down and take your time kinda of place. \n\nIt is a little pricey ($14 for a 3 shrimp-shrimp cocktail, $3.75 for a soda, etc) but it is very good and was hands down the best meal I had last weekend.", "type": "review", "business_id": "D-j9DMfwe7fqhI2yXNrgiQ"}

The restaurant is beautifully designed and if you can, try to sit in the \"pod\" where you get a view of the mall interior and everyone walking around.\n\nFood was excellent.  We shared the shrimp cocktail and the vanilla battered shrimp for appetizers, and to this day, I still remember that vanilla battered shrimp.  Probably one of the best appetizers I have had.  My main course was the chilean sea bass.  The serving size was enormous and it brought off into perfect flakes during consumption.\n\nFor the side dishes we had the asparagus and scalloped potatoes.

The waiting room had a TV playing a kid-friendly movie on repeat, and decent amount of seating, though I'm hoping they'll upgrade from small plastic chairs to ones with cushions.  I was pretty reluctant to sit on the couch, as the term \"fomite\" from another review rung in my head.  (Seriously, look that up, and tell me that doesn't make you think of every chair or couch in any waiting area).\n\nMy appointment time was at 5pm, and I had used ZocDoc to get all of my new patient paperwork in.  They'll still ask you questions when you get in as a new patient, but it didn't bother me; I'd rather be asked again and feel that they're genuinely concerned about my health.\n\nI was seen by Dr. Baoan Andy Le that day.  Excellent mannerism, seemed to really care that I wasn't feeling well, and actually pointed out something I hadn't even considered was a health problem.  Luckily, it was something that could also be tested for during a lab I needed to get.  The clinic is a little far from where I live, but I'd go far for a doctor that I felt comfortable being seen by.\n\nMy only complaint would be... the bathroom!

Determined to try the infared sauna, we randomly showed up during business hours.  The door was unlocked, but we couldn't find anyone.  We sat in the tiny waiting room for almost 30 minutes when someone finally appeared.  She asked if we were being helped?  Possibly by invisible elves, but not by anyone here.  We asked her about the infared sauna and possibly getting an appointment.  Although she was nice, she didn't know anything about the sauna, and said we had to call to get an appointment.  Once we explained our predicament to her, she called the owner herself to see if she could help us get an appointment.  Once again, no answer.  Not even for your employees?  Wow.  She took our names and phone numbers and assured us someone would call us for an appointment, which never happened.

Even with being on the cusp of Arizona's peak golfing season, I was able to snag an affordable twilight rate from GolfNow.  It also didn't hurt that I was playing on Super Bowl Sunday afternoon.  \n\nFrom the first tee, I could tell that I was going to appreciate and enjoy this course.  The tee boxes were cut cleanly, the fairways were impeccable, bunkers were well-maintained with collared tan bermuda  and, as with any Troon managed golf course, the rough was green and slightly penalizing - unlike other courses that don't seed their rough.  The greens, though, were a mixed lot.  All of them were slick and rolled true but a good majority of them were peppered with unfixed ball marks and golf shoe pocks.  I might be nitpicking here because the greens were by no means damaged and such.  \n\nThe course itself is very straightforward and flat.  There were only a few holes that got past an undulating 30 degree grade.  And while the course is called \"Copper Canyon\", other than the final hole, the views aren't awe-inspiring and Del Webb cookie cutter retirement homes do line most holes.  Copper Canyon is a bit of hike if you don't live in the northwest Valley but with it's reasonable rates and top-notch maintained 18, it's worth the drive.", "type": "review", "business_id": "oZmGpuygmViMCc27CerS7Q"}

Distinctive Insurance sent proof of insurance to my old auto insurance company (required in order to drop my old auto insurance policy) and also to the DMV. I would definitely recommend the company.", "type": "review", "business_id": "D2Pf-fR57KKYH6gWjKF9FQ"}

Thank you Yelpers for sharing this place.  Coming to Las Vegas every couple months, sushi is something I typically reserve for back home in Los Angeles as most strip places are overpriced and underwhelming.  This place allows you to order essentially everything off the menu - from katzu to udon to sushi for a measly $22!  The sushi is 4 star quality, but the amazing value catapults this place to 5 stars.  You will not be dissapointed and it's well worth the 9 mile off the strip drive.

Now we are in no way a regular customer but its very nice to know you are remembered.  Second I was glad to see the place busy, sadly sometimes when I go there its very quiet, last night it was about 90% full at 8:00 pm!!!\n\nOnto the food...Exceptional and tasty!  My wife had the beef panang while I had the Baked Seafood.  Both portion sizes were huge.  Hers had far more beef than filler, a huge plus.  Both curry sauces were just fabulous.\nMy baked seafood was full of mussels, calamari, shrimp and catfish.  Just really really good.  Loved it.\n\nSadly mango's are out of season so no sticky rice with mango, BUT, the owner told us of a new dessert he has which has black rice cooked in coconut milk and custard with a coconut sauce over top.  UMMMM can you say delicious...Very sweet though so I recommend splitting this!\n\nOverall for my money one of the best and most consistent places to eat in Chandler.

We got seats on a Saturday night with very little wait. The place is spacious and bustling. Restaurants in Vegas don't have the selection of beer I come to expect in my home town, but here, the selection is respectable. Lots of things on tap, both imports (Belgian, German, English, etc.) and American microbrews (and they even have a cask ale, which is hard to find) . \n\nHere's a summary of what we tried: \n\nRaw oysters - fresh and delicious, just like in California.\n\nDirty Chips - GET THIS! Unsure what sick mind came up with it, but it was delicious as an appetizer.\n\nDuck Confit from the carvery - Delicious. The maple soy sounded a bit suspect, but the savory/sweetness worked well with the duck. Use sparingly though, it's a bit concentrated. All you need is a dab. The other sauce that we ordered was the black truffle mayo. As other reviewers rave, it is awesome. Try dipping fries in it!\n\nSheperds Pie - meat and potatoes in a cast iron dish, how can you go wrong? Delicious.\n\nThe portions are plenty large, so bring an appetite. The prices are what you'd expect from a restaurant on the strip, but relatively speaking, it was worth the price.

In short: amazing food and extensive draft beer menu at a better value than anywhere in the Aria and I imagine elsewhere on the Strip. \n\nOur first meal was a Sunday brunch.  At 10am in late September, it was just cool enough to enjoy our meal outside, watching an NFL game on a big screen they had wheeled out.  After much deliberation and consultation with the server, I had a salad and the lobster rolls - best meal of my whole trip.  Just amazing.  Order them, several times if you can.  They were offering an impressive Bloody Mary menu... not our thing but I'm sure many others would love to add smoked gouda or bacon or beef broth to their Maries.  We instead ordered fancy $11 seasonal fest draft beers - a deceptively great deal considering the $8 Bud Lights everywhere else on the Strip.  \n\nSecond meal: dinner.  After demolishing the toasted pretzel appetizer, I couldn't finish the second half of my grilled cheese panini with brie and bacon.  I do consider myself a connoisseur of both soft pretzels and brie sandwiches - I can't emphasize enough how good these were. \n\nThird \"meal\": late afternoon happy hour.  TE PUB offers a decent Happy Hour for Vegas standards (somewhat decent for DC standards): 3-6pm and 10pm-??, half-price draft beer, $1 wings, $2 oysters, $3 sliders.  I hated the Woodchuck Pumpkin Reserve I ordered (who can drink that nonsense?), and my awesome waitress replaced it no charge.  Three of us shared some wings - perfectly tender and seasoned - but in retrospect I regret not getting the soft pretzels again. \n\nLaid-back ambiance, the kind of place I would love to frequent in DC, a nice break from the \"chic\" of the Aria and the general excess of Vegas.", "type": "review", "business_id": "vSf0pqvaLp5sVSjJPeOqqQ"}

So when I arrived in Edinburgh, which is a pretty popular tourist destination, I was shocked as to how tiny actually is. I mean, you can practically see one end to the other! \n\nThe staff were pleasant upon arrival, the Immigration Officer teased me a little since I'm a Californian visiting Scotland during a crappy snow storm (awesome timing on my part), and baggage claim was a breeze. Oh, and the arrivals terminal was super easy since there's only one door to come out of and everyone huddles right there eagerly awaiting whoever is arriving from the plane. \n\nMy gripe is that the place has very little to offer in terms of places to eat. What they DO have available are a lot of fried food things or little shacks that are outrageously expensive. Given, you're paying in GBP, but still! Gouging is gouging, people! Not a lot in terms of shopping options, which is a bummer if you have a lot of time to kill before your flight. OH. And their flight schedule system is beyond irritating. You can check in an hour and a half before your flight, but they won't list what counter you need to report to till an hour before take off. To me, that's very stressful! When I would inquire with an airport staff member, they'd talk to me like I was annoying and how I needed to just watch the sign for my info....sorry, but I'm used to SFO and LAX being strict about time frames for security.", "type": "review", "business_id": "NaKzzDKN79r9D-fMxfUZmA"}

We skipped out on Imperial Palace, Flamingo, and Paris.  What we did hit up:\n\nRio - 'Carnival World' - Been here before, just as good as I remember. Rio's got both quality and quantity so we had all 3 meals there.\nBreakfast includes most standard fare -- couple kinds of eggs and potatoes, ham, 1 kind of smoked salmon, fresh fruit.  \nLunch comes out around 11am, char siu bbq and roast chicken, misc carbs that I avoided like bagels and potatoes.\nFor dinner that starts around 4p-- TONS of cocktail shrimp and snow crab, a not so good prime rib, char siu bbq and roast duck for dinner, delicious gelato (cookies and cream not so much though, I tried 4 flavors). The sushi was TERRIBLE, like 2 day old grocery store sushi that's been sitting in the refrigerator.  I didn't even feel safe to eat it. \n\nCaesar's - \"Lago Buffet\" -- Breakfast had tons of cute cups of yogurt and telltale garnish...along with SNOW CRAB LEGS...FOR BREAKFAST?!  It was nonsensical, but fabulous!  See my review for Lago individually for more details.\n\nHarrah's - Flavor's - Suitable breakfast -- congee and those fried bread things were the most memorable.  Good egg/chorizo mix but SOMEONE has to help (all) of the Caesar's/Harrah's properties with their tortillas!!  Ice cream was not so great but there was cotton candy for breakfast!!\n\nPH - Totally not worth the time, stopped by and was definitely unimpressed by the lukewarm -EVERYTHING-\n\nWe didn't wait more than 3 minutes in line at ANY of these buffets by (a) going just before peak times, aka 10a, 4p, 8p, 730a, 930a and (b) visiting in late January which is apparently Vegas' only slow period", "type": "review", "business_id": "cRfn_vMQ9YExuKb378CwjQ"}

I wish they had specialties recommended or something, cause I was totally lost!\n\nI ordered:\n\nKimchi Fried Rice - It was ok.  I think I like ichiza's better because it actually comes with kimchi.  I think the rice was little too sticky, and a little too spicy.  The egg was refreshing though, but overall I thought it was OK.\n\nCorn with Mozerella Cheese - It was good.  I thought the sauce that was mixed with the cheese while being served on a hot pot was pretty genius.  I did wish the serving was little bigger since I was paying like $5.00 for it.  \n\nGarlic Squid - This dish was very good, although I got more garlic than I did squid.  I kind of felt jipped a little, and with that price I was expecting a little more than just garlic.\n\nGreen Mussel Soup - It was pretty good.  The portions were good, and the flavor of the soup was ok.  It was nothing to brag about.  They did add a lot of mussels and what not.  \n\nI thought this place was an OK spot.  The thought of Korean tapas is genius, but they were pretty greedy with their portions. (Maybe something they could improve?)  Even the veggies they serve as side items were small.  It looked like someone took one scoop and just served it.  I might return cause the service was good, but I don't know about the prices.  I paid almost $40 just for those dishes alone.

A friend of mine had suggested Dr. Galati but I wanted to speak with my dentist, Dr. Clark, to get his input.  He also suggested Dr. Galati for orthodontic needs, and shared that they work together often, allowing patients to schedule with them on the same days, making appointments, hygiene care and progress very efficient.  Dr. Galati and his team were very welcoming and informative when I went for the consultation.  Dr. Galati assessed my situation and clearly mapped out the options.  His involvement in professional organizations and continuing education put me at ease knowing he continues to stay at the forefront of orthodontics.  His team was also very detailed; advising what my insurance would cover, what my responsibility would be, and the payment plans they offered.   They also explained how they handled scheduling and how long the appointments would be.  There wasn't a detail missed!  Dr. Galati runs on time, and I was never delayed once in the eight months I wore my braces.  (Not many doctors offices can claim that!)

My experience was a combination of all the bad reviews below.  Starting with the fact that it cost $75 for two \"premium\" seat tickets and two drinks.  That in itself should stop you right here.  We were given a $75 gift card and on arrival paid for our tickets, went to the bar and ordered one drink and one beer, added $1 cash to the card and it was gone.\n\nQuite a while after being seated we ordered another drink and appetizers for our dinner.  (Interestingly, at 7:30 on a Saturday night they were out of their most popular and advertised item on the menu.)   Shortly our drinks were brought to us along with glasses of water.  These \"premium\" seats are like a big upholstered block, with a little tray that swings out in front of you.  My tray was sloped so, since our server never returned, and the condensation on the tray caused the glasses to slide across it, I spent the entire movie juggling glasses.  And because she never took our glasses away, we couldn't move our trays and therefore couldn't move around in the \"premium\" seats to get comfortable.   Also, good luck trying to recline one of these with the tray in front of you full of dirty dishes. \n\nWe watched all the people around us getting served by other waiters and pretty soon the lights went down and the movie started and people were still getting served but ours never returned.  More than halfway through the movie, she appeared and asked if we'd like anything else and I told her no, and I didn't want the food we never got charged to our credit card.  She was shocked (although it was HER job) and she wanted to put the order in then which was ridiculous.  Note too that this setup does not have buttons in the seats to call for service such as at the Esplanade.  When leaving, my husband was asked how everything was and he asked for a manager, who of course apologized and asked for my email address so he could send us two free tickets.  He even repeated what I wrote down so I know he got the correct address.  Well here it is a week and a half later and imagine, no free tickets in the mail.  \n\nToday I called and asked to speak to a manager, before writing this review, and after holding for 10 minutes, the girl came back and said no one was available to talk with me.  I think there is the problem with iPic; no one is ever available.  \n\nBottom line:  Save a lot of money and go to any Harkins Theater or  the Esplanade dinner theater.  I don't even remember what movie I saw here because I was so busy tending to what they were supposed to be doing.

On this occasion, he was content with just a bagel and one serving of gelato, which is fine with me, he will appreciate food when he gets older. \n\nThis one gives u the best value for ur money.  We went there at lunch time around 12 noon, kind of late, since they open at 8am.  It wasn't that busy, only one third of seats were utilized at that moment.  I think most ppl already went in for their brunch, well, we weren't the early birds, but we still got some decent grubs. \n\nI wish they have some Asian bakery items, and more Chinese options, then I'll be a die hard fan.\n\nThe things we loved: the yogurt parfait, the smoked salmon,  Italian sausages, the gua bao (tasty white steam bread dough, a winner on my book), the gelato (raspberry is the best) and the deserts (we didn't have the steel stomaches to try them all, but the few we tried were very good). \n\nI really like the decor of this place, the whole set up makes me feel very peaceful.  \n\nThe service was very good, the waitress came to check on us frequently.  I think this place is still relatively new on the strip compare with Wynn buffet, so they haven't got the attitude which the Wynn buffet is known for.  At Wynn,  they want u to leave after two plates.\n\nOverall, we had very good experience at Wicked Spoon.", "type": "review", "business_id": "zt1TpTuJ6y9n551sw9TaEg"}

They offer tapas style American comfort food using novel ingredients (i.e. cow liver shepherds pie). I'm torn on their dishes' lack of freshness as you can tell they've been sitting on the counter for a length of time, but you expect this for a buffet. However, they do have some great made to order stations (i.e. mac 'n cheese bar) and the novelty of the offerings (you can get bone marrow and ramen in the same meal?) makes me want to overlook this flaw. Overall, definitely worth a trip if you're looking for something different from the other Vegas buffets! \n\nService: Great! no hunting down servers for extra drinks/napkins etc.", "type": "review", "business_id": "zt1TpTuJ6y9n551sw9TaEg"}

So here goes.\n\nAsian: Don't be lured in by the ridiculously cute takeout boxes. The ddukboki, or Korean spicy rice cakes were horrendous. Any Korean who tried that probably swore shibal because they were absolutely horrible. I don't ever eat rice or Panda Express type dishes at buffets, that's just dumb. Sushi rolls looked unappealing. Nigiri had a lot of rice but the salmon was fresh. Kalbi short ribs were pretty decent, tender and marinated well maybe a little under seasoned. Star of the section was pork belly. I really had to stop myself from eating a whole block. Slather on the hoisin sauce, how did they know it would complement the fatty cuts so well?!\n\nItalian: Bleu cheese and short ribs pizza was a no go. The meat was tough, under seasoned, and dry. Mussels had no flavor even though they were swimming in sauce. Risotto was rich and creamy but I'm no connoisseur. Pasta cavatappe next to it was yummy. Meatballs were tender, nothing spectacular. Rice was bland. Brussels sprouts were not good. \n\nMeat station: Shepherds pie had a really funky taste that I didn't enjoy. They were really cute served in a mini skillet though. Candied yams are my weakness. I mean marshmallows and yams, hello. Prime rib was sooo delicious. Get two slices minimum. Bone marrow intrigued me but I didn't like the texture. It was just really fatty and oily in my mouth. Not pleasant at all. The huge ribs next to the prime rib were sad. Not tender, not seasoned, overcooked. The fingerlings in duck confit were not good. I didn't taste anything unique or duck-like. Fried chicken was ok. Not super crispy or spectacularly seasoned, once again. Man, I think the head chef might have been sick cause I'm now seeing a pattern. I'm Asian, we like our food well seasoned!!!\n\nSalads: Watermelon with balsamic dressing was a nice, juicy, and refreshing bite. Kale salad was worth trying. And the soup, which was unlabeled, was ok. Nothing else worth trying except maybe the ceviche. \n\nSeafood section: Get the Mac and cheese with prime rib. Those were like little nuggets of gold swimming in a cheesy pool. Tender and a little fatty and oh so delicious with the cheese sauce. Salmon was cooked perfectly with this tangy white sauce and buttery butternut squash bed. \n\nDessert: This was the absolute star of the show both in taste and presentation. See the picture of my plate to see how much I enjoyed myself here. Two words: pistachio gelato. Hands down, the best pistachio flavor I've ever tasted. Seriously like eating a mouthful of toasted pistachios in every spoonful. It was so nutty and creamy. This is how pistachio gelato should taste. Strawberry balsamic was unique but I didn't get that much of the balsamic flavor. Salted peanut caramel really fell short for me. The apple caramel puff is really deceiving to the eye because it looks like a toasted meringue sitting on a little tartlet. The puff is filled with this tangy and slightly sweet green apple custard on a thick, gooey caramel. It was a beautiful sensation of flavors and textures in your mouth. Skip the molten chocolate cake (and most of the chocolate desserts actually) and go for the warm apple crumble. That warm apple crumble was heavenly, I couldn't stop eating it! It was warm and cinnamony with the perfect crunchy topping, ugh, magical. The white chocolate mousse cone brought the child out in me. It's like the bottom part of the drumstick cone that's filled with the surprise chocolate nugget but instead with yummy white chocolate mousse. The carrot cake was perfect. Orange macaron was too crunchy and sugary.\n\nFinal verdict: Wicked Spoon did not wow me as I had hoped for. Maybe I had my expectations set too high but if I'm going to be paying $50+ for a buffet it better be damn good. I think I really expected for this buffet to be filled with unique and innovative dishes. There was mostly traditional dishes that they attempted to revamp but failed to execute well. I would not wait more than 30 min on a normal weekend and 1 hour on a holiday weekend. If it's going to take longer, go somewhere else. If you are looking for lots of variety and amazing seafood, this is not the buffet for you. However, this buffet is worth checking out if you love dessert and appreciate beautiful presentations of food. The ambiance is gorgeous and hip. The staff is friendly. But the food is just ok. This buffet is slightly overhyped. A cool scene to hang out in since it's in the new Cosmo hotel and all, but overhyped, definitely overhyped. My advice: Do the $18 express take out box deal if you're not willing to commit $40+ on the buffet. You get to sample as much as gourmet food you can fit in a Togo box (without overeating too much) for less than 20 bucks. I don't know if you get to forgo the line but it's a pretty sweet deal if you ask me!", "type": "review", "business_id": "zt1TpTuJ6y9n551sw9TaEg"}

How many other places can you get french toast and pancakes with green pea pasta carbonara and goat cheese panna cotta? \n\nEvery dish I had was excellent, but there were a few standouts in definite need of mentioning: don't miss the angry mac & cheese, or any of the pasta dishes for that matter. Double up on the ratatouille, go nuts with the shockingly good sushi, and save room for the full gelato bar with mini-sized scoops to ensure you can run through their stellar selection of desserts.

I haven't been here in awhile, but definitely still a great spot to party it up. I went to Hakkasan a few months back and I still like Marquee more. It's nice that there's a hip hop room and a main floor which plays house music. The night I went the hip hop room was definitely bumpin' and it wasn't \"ghetto\" music, but more along the lines of top 40. Another good thing about Marquee is they have multiple outside areas, which most other clubs lack. These areas are the pool area near the main floor and the side area next to the hip hop room, which are nice for those who need a breath of fresh air and let some of that sweat dry off.  Surprisingly it wasn't super crowded for a Friday night like most clubs on the strip. That is the worse experience when you're trying to enjoy dancing and you can't even move because of the crowdedness. Drink prices are a bit steep considering I paid $36 for 2 red bull and vodkas, worst part is the bartender didn't bother asking me what type of vodka to use therefore automatically giving me the pricer one. I know for a fact that he served me the more expensive one because my friend who is a female only paid $32 for the same thing. Another downer is one of my experiences with a promoter. This past summer I tried getting my group on the Marquee guest list and the promoter asked me to send a picture of each girl in my group, really...?! I was shocked that he texted me that and decided to go somewhere else. With those negative aspects aside, Marquee will still be seeing more of me in the future.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Ht8mXLuqJSTPrU9kvzosUA"}

As a result, we did a $50-per-person fixed price menu that featured a choice of one of two salads, one of four entrees, and a chef's selection on dessert.  As my friends will tell you, I eat out 6-8 times per week all over America and at nicer restaurants a couple of times a month...I've never seen one of these menus get you less food than I got last night.  (This had that \"Restaurant Week for dinner in DC\" feel to it; DC folks know what I'm talking about!)\n\nPart of that was tied to dessert.  I'm allergic to nuts.  Bottom line, the chef's selection featured three desserts that all featured some form of nuts.  (I don't think a nut allergy is particularly rare these days...do you?)  I asked our server--who was otherwise an excellent host for our large, somewhat unruly group--if I could just get something plain, a chocolate cake, or a cheesecake, or sorbet...anything.  The answer was a flat no.\n\nThat affected the rest of my thoughts on the meal, really.  I'm normally a cocktail guy but I opted for a glass of the pinot grigio, which was fine...but from reading some of these Yelp reviews, it looks like I should have gotten a cocktail.  The salad (field greens) was fine, a little overdressed but the greens were tasty.\n\nThe entree was, frankly, an injustice...for a fixed price menu that also featured a 7-to-8 oz. steak and the biggest piece of chicken I've seen not on top of a waffle in Chicago, the scallops were puny.  I mean, beyond puny.  THREE SCALLOPS?  I literally took a small bite a minute, just to stretch out the amount of food on the plate.  The greens served with it were chewy, almost tough to cut with a normal knife.\n\nSo, to summarize, $50 got me three scallops, about one measuring cup worth of salad greens, and no dessert.  I can't in good conscience recommend coming back, but again, I thought the service was great and the space was well lit and featured good-looking people (I am finding this is standard in Scottsdale, but still).  I did go out to eat later that evening, because I was so freakin' starved.\n\nAt least our bachelor left happy!", "type": "review", "business_id": "MuIXnv7Oq7X3-4aEsp9dDA"}

He also asked if we saw the specials on the board, of which there were about 6, and asked if we needed to hear them again. \n\nI really appreciated the wine list.  It was short, and very accessible, with nothing over $50, as I recall.  Most notably, they had Erath, an Oregon Pinot Noir, and my favorite.  I also believe that all the wines are available by the glass, as well as the bottle, which is nice.  One of my dinner partners ordered the house red, which was really delish, and a bargain!\n\nI ordered the 7 oz Gorgonzola crusted filet with mashed potato (which was on special), others ordered the stuffed sole, New York Strip, and the lobster mac and cheese.  I was really pleased by my dish.  I also enjoyed a bite of the stuffed sole, served with orzo.  I'm not one who would order fish, but I would consider ordering this dish next time.\n\nThe lobster mac and cheese was also very tasty.  Sometimes, I find Mac and Cheese to be too rich, or overpowering, or downright glopy and unappetizing, but this dish had the right balance, and you really got to enjoy the lobster as well.  My dish was perfect!  Cooked well, served beautifully, and portioned properly.\n\nThe service was excellent, and as mentioned in other reviews, a manager came over to see how we were doing.  I was very happy with the service.  It was attentive, friendly and informative, without being overkill.  (Sometimes, I feel that there can be too much service, and I feel like I am taking my SAT's / being stalked.)  I felt very welcome.\n\nOverall, I was really happy to find this local gem.  I guess as a final note of approval, I will take my mother here when she visits from out of state.   I agree with poster Jen H., that I will update Thirteen North tot 5 stars after I go there a few more times, which I plan to as soon as possible.", "type": "review", "business_id": "GYPHQGaB4Oeq9veH-p2nKA"}

That's sweets, you know it. Would you believe a diamond-studded 125-carat Couture Pop can be had from this sweet spanking-new hot spot in Vegas? Yes, it is a one-of-a-kind delectable piece of sweetness. That premiered at the Grand Opening. \nThe Grand Opening attended by celebrities on the 4th of March was sure not missed!\n\nThe Couture Pop have many flavors to choose from. The pop is wrapped in a pop-out plastic cover. The bling-ed handle screws right off the sweet flavored pop to be replaced by any other flavor pop or when it's all gone. A complete ensemble of the Couture Pop comes in a box filled with different flavors and colored \"bling\" beads at $25, or just the flavored pops without the bling-ed handles at $12.95. It's not just pops but many other items and souvenirs are ready to be had from this sweet factory. \n\nNot only that. Name another sweet item, like chocolates? Yes!! Crepes Yes!! Anything else to satisfy anyone's sweet craving. Just walk through the doors to the dining area called American Brasserie for more sweet cravings in an extensive menu which includes Black Angus steak, fries, omelets, chicken, waffles,and red velvet  buttermilk pancakes, signature sweet pizzas, fresh made savory and sweet crepes,chocolate fondues, and a favorite of mine is the frozen hot chocolate. Elegant atmosphere in classy modern decor. Waitstaff attentive.\n\nSugar Factory American Brasserie stay open 24 hours. To mention the best I had was the frozen hot chocolate and ahi tuna which was sweetimus that satisfied me with a blang! I say blang because the Couture Pop is likened to a bling enough and my hunger pang was satisfied max. Should I return? I'll be back.", "type": "review", "business_id": "nZgYNbl1XlZyyKlISMoG6w"}

My first visit was on 04/12/2013 and I was expecting a lot since I read all the raving reviews on Yelp and fortunately, it delivered. We tried their Chicken Pad Thai, 3 Color Curry, and (Minced) Pork Pad Kee Mow. \n\nThe Pad Thai was honestly not my favorite preparation of this classic dish, but it was still tasty. The 3 Color Curry was so much fun! It's \"Le Thai's special blend of red, yellow and green curry and all its vegetables\" which includes Bamboo shoot, bell pepper, Thai basil, potato, onion, and carrots in coconut milk. The flavor was obviously unique and well done. I don't care for potatoes in my curry, so next time, I'll stick with my favorite, red curry. Now, the Pad Kee Mow was out of this world. Top 10 favorite dish of all time (I don't have an official Top 10 list, but if I did, it would be on there somewhere). I mean, SOO DELICIOUS! I'm not even a big Pad Kee Mow fan and have never been, so this changed my life.\n\nOn my second visit (04/21/2013) with friends, we tried the Short Rib Fried Rice (Pulled beef from short rib stir-fried with waterfall sauce, egg, garlic, yellow and green onion, topped with cilantro) and of course, I ordered the Pork Pad Kee Mow again, Thai Salad (Grilled beef or chicken with red and green onion, tomato and cilantro mixed with lime juice and Thai chili), and Green Curry. This trip solidified my love for the place and its Pad Kee Mow. Perfection in a bowl. The salad was okay, not something for me in the flavor department.\n\nThe restaurant itself is cool, the outside/inside dining is cozy (but loud on weekend nights). Service is just okay. Nothing amazing, but not horrible. The wonderful food more than makes up for it. Honestly, I can't think about anything else but that delicious Pork Pad Kee Mow. Eat it. Oh, and spice levels aren't playing around. I wish I could remember what level I ordered because I definitely need to take it down a notch.

I walked into Le Thai pumped for Penang last night but I walked out of Le Thai-me Is Money shaking my head.\n\nAfter slinging back some cocktails at the Mob Bar with a few home fries, we trekked over to Le Thai for a pad thai party. We were sat right away on the covered patio outside, at which we proceeded to wait. And wait. And wait. What's a girl gotta do to get some agua around here when she's dehydrated from the drinking? Wait, I guess. Our server later came around to take drink orders, and while the same people who complained about the cold opted for ICED Thai tea, I asked for a glass of hot water. The teas came by, but lo and behold, no water - is this because we're having conservation issues? No matter - I waved down a busser who came by right away with the missing goods.\n\nOur roster consisted of Thai style wings, Thai beef noodle soup, Penang curry with brown rice, tom yum soup, and short rib fried rice. The food was actually really good, which was enhanced by the cold weather and my declining buzz. Plus, the soup was so perfect in the cold, until we realized that was it - we were sitting IN THE COLD, and only 1 of the 3 heat lamps were on. We asked a staff member if we could turn on the extra heat lamps, and we were shut down, being told that heat lamps actually weren't even really allowed, given the cover on the patio and all. As we watched the last of the heat lamps die out though, he refilled the lamp as if to do us a favor. \n\nThe curry came out with white rice which was frustrating if it hadn't been for another employee who pitched in yet again, but it wasn't anything compared to the irritation we harbored when we went to pay the check and were told they could only make four transactions total after we had calculated the payment for six people. One of us opted to pay with cash, and the change was rounded up because they did not carry change - I'm not sure if this was just the server, or the restaurant as a whole, but either way, it doesn't seem to make much business CENTS. \n\nI've never had much of an issue with the food here, but the service is just such a hit or miss ALL THE TIME, with it being more of a miss lately. I feel like I'm throwing the place under the bus, but I suppose this is the same disappointment my parents felt when I told them I wasn't going to be pre-med, and they've managed to move on.", "type": "review", "business_id": "ZHDf8TUICsB2peQ9AmXeFw"}

Students roam amok here throughout the day. \n\nHaving had Diddy's, I must say the difference is that it cost 50 cents more here and the cookies slightly tastier and chewier.  Wedge two cookies together with their Dryer brand ice creams and you will be quite content! Just $2 plus tax!  You get a decent choice of ice creams from Peanut Butter to Almond flavors.\n\nSo take a break from froyo and munch down on some chewy cookies and ice cream! It might get a little messy, but totally worth it! $2 or 8 quarters! + tax! ;-)\n\nA side note, they do not toss away their cookies, they will sell a small batch of 1 day old cookies for $1.

This is not a blind makeover show that you can just do whatever the hell you want.  I could feel him get more irritated.  But this is my hair, so I told him again, \"This is way too high, don't go any more higher.\" And what does he do, he completely shaves a little less than half of my hair off.  A part of me thinks that he already knew I wouldn't like it and would never come back, so he decided to just make it as bad as he could to piss me off.  I don't know.  I was so upset and he could tell.  And then he goes, \"Well you don't gotta give me nothing.\"  Damn, right, I ain't giving you jack.

We were walking in the lobby and and young African American male approached us and asked us if we wanted to be on the list. He said that the lady would drink free until 1am. I was also told by the concierge that I as a man, would be let in for free until Midnight. So we proceed to wait on line at 10:30. After waiting on 2 subsequent lines, I was charged twenty dollars even after presenting my room key. Then we were told to see a young lady about the free drinks. She then offered us 3 drink tickets and then 3 more if we \"liked\" 1oak on Facebook. I felt completely misled! My girlfriend is a heavy drinker and would have liked FREE drinks until 1am, not 3 drink tickets. This was a COMPLETE MISREPRESENTATION and I feel taken advantage of. Then to top if off, she was told at the topside bar that her tickets were no longer good after midnight. There were three other female patrons who were told the exact same thing and we all complained to the bartender as we were all told the same thing.

The menu here is expanded, and reservations are accepted.\n\nI arrived @ 7:00 with two companions and was seated immediately. The waiter was friendly, and had a good knowledge of the food and how it was prepared. We decided to order several entree's and share them so that everyone could taste.\n\nWe ordered the Papparadelle with Bolognese Sauce, Beef Braciole or Involtini if you are in Italy, and a Pizza Margherita.\n\nThe Papparadelle came with fluted edges, cooked reasonably al dente, with an excellent Bolognese sauce loaded with chunks of meat. I found it to be on par with any I have ever eaten, though on a personal note I prefer the pasta to be more rustic and hand cut or torn into uneven \"rags\".\n\nMy companions did not care for the Beef Braciole as much as I did, but allowing for different tastes as well as living in vastly different locations, I can accept that.  I found the meat to be beautifully cooked, nicely presented on a bed of cooked cauliflower, and served with some properly roasted onions.  Many people who make this dish tend to overpower it with lots of cheese and bread crumbs wrapped up in the beef.Unlike many variations on this recipe, this one was not overly salted or spiced, which I personally appreciated, as the flavor of the range fed beef came out nicely.\n\nMany reviewers have said that the pizza is the best in the United States. I would differ with that opinion. Certainly, the pizza is very good, but I've eaten many a pizza that I felt was as good. The crust has a good flavor, is nicely thin with a nice edge, but the one we were served had an undercooked center that flopped down when picked up. The cheese is handmade on the premises, and is a real treat, melting into a lacy puddle swimming in a pool of an excellent sauce. \n\nMy biggest criticism was with the basil. This pizza is supposed to represent the Italian flag - 3 colors - red (sauce), white (cheese) and green (basil). The pizza was cut into 6 pieces and 5 leaves of basil were put on it. One person would not get a real piece of pizza margherita. Worse still, to me is that you only get a leaf of basil. Which bite do you eat it with? In my mind, the best pizza margherita I have ever eaten had a chiffonade of basil sprinkled all over it, so that you got some basil with each bite. My understanding is that that is how the pizza was supposed to be made originally. You wouldn't serve the queen one leaf of basil, now would you?\n\nI must make mention of the bread that came with the meal. I don't know if it is made on the premises or not, but it was wonderfully crusty, with a chewy interior and a superior texture. It was served with a little extra virgin olive oil, and was really excellent.\n\nOverall, the premises were clean, though a little noisy at times. I'm hoping that Chris will put a whole lot more basil on his pizza's, as that is a basic part of the flavor of it.\n\n4 stars for excellent service, good food, and general cleanliness.", "type": "review", "business_id": "BPi1Q5wX0_o5VlO_XRyYuQ"}

Very friendly when we walked in to order take out around 6pm. Ordered Tom yum soup, chicken red curry, vegetable Thai noodles, and eggplant tofu. I've had many Thai resteraunts experiences over the years, and I have to say this food rocked, it's in a location difficult to see from the street  close to Ann and Simmons, which I hope people will take the time to find. Portions were large and generous, fresh fresh ingredients with an awesome balance of spice chemistry, which with Thai food is sometimes off. We had left overs for lunch and dinner the following day (two people). So for $38 dollars that's an awesome deal In a n economy of finding good quality at a good price, we will be going back , and they have lunch specials for 5.99. Give them a try , it may be a new hidden gem which will only survive once the word gets out.", "type": "review", "business_id": "KfCpor5zA-VKVnwbo2lR6Q"}

After driving into the parking lot and saw that the line was literally out the door and nearly half the length of the building outside, I was hoping that there would be a reason why all these people were standing in line to eat here. Maybe this place would be better than the cafeteria-type food I was expecting...\n\nWe had a party of 8 and only 7 had arrived, but the cashier was nice enough to let me pay for our 8th person so they wouldn't have to wait in line to join us inside. This place has very few tables for parties larger than 4, so we were seated at 2 adjoining 4-person tables. It was a Friday night and the place was CROWDED. Each of the various stations had quite a line, but I made it a point to try a sample of each place.\n\nThe salad bar and dessert bar were both pretty standard, with the dessert bar featuring novelties such as real ice cream (as opposed to a soft-serve machine) and cotton candy, as well as a chocolate fountain. The fresh breads section was fairly good. I enjoyed the garlic cheese biscuits and my friend said that the yeast rolls were great too. \n\nMost of the other food was rather normal or sub-par. Not very different from your run-of-the-mill Hometown Buffet in terms of quality, and with similar selections. The steak line was pretty long, but the cook would only serve \"rare\" or \"well done\" even when asked for medium rare or something else. The well done was overcooked and the rare was very rare. A lot of the fried food, such as the steak fries, fried shrimp, and fried chicken were good, but a lot of the other times, such as the mac and cheese, corn on the cob, and veggies lacked flavor and just screamed \"frozen food from Costco!\" Not cool. I'd skip most of the \"ethnic dishes\" as well unless you don't mind the lack of authenticity or good taste in general. \n\nSince the place was constantly busy, it was understandable that the restaurant was a MESS. Our table must've had lil kids eating on it before us, because the seats and underneath the table were covered in crumbs and leftover food. Not a big deal for me, but moreso for our resident clean-freak. \n\nSo overall...\nThe good: The service was great and friendly. Props to the cashier for seating us without our entire party being present. Service was great. Our server was friendly, quick, and courteous. One extra star thanks to Brittany for her great service. At $12 for dinner, you can have a ton of food on a relatively low budget. \nThe bad: Most of the food was very average, and some of the food was just not good at all. \nThe ugly: The place is very busy and always seems to be packed, so be prepared to wait if you coming during a busy lunch or dinner period. Messy and crowded. Has the ambience of a cafeteria.", "type": "review", "business_id": "nREHMbIzWdfWtOh4l1bT3g"}

Oh, by the way: plan to eat dessert.\n\nI worked at Mandalay while Chef Romano was at Aureole and had the privilege of enjoying her work multiple times, so I came in knowing what to expect. The cream in the little flaky pie shell was fantastic, light and rich at the same time. The caramel was unreal, a total standout. I paid $4. If you're wondering if that's good or bad, just know you could easily pay $10 for the same dessert if Chef Romano were making it inside a casino.\n\nYeah, I know $2-3 for a croissant or bun seems like a little extra.

For dinner, we figured that there would be a long line, so we went to line up at 4:30 on a monday evening.  The wait was not so bad because we were in line for less than 45 minutes compared to the two hour wait that we heard from other people.  FYI, you would have to pay extra for the 24 buffet of buffet in order to use it at Bacchanal.  Some people thought they could use the $49.99 deal at this buffet.  There is way too much food for people to try on their first visit and it is $49.99 a person or $44.99 a person if you have the Total Rewards card.  The seafood bar is overwhelming with cocktail shrimps, oysters, mussels, etc.  Then, there a little plates of hamburger sliders, mini-hotdog on a bun, onion rings in a mini-deep fryer basket.  The presentation is extremely amazing.  They even put the caesar salad in a tiny jar, so you won't waste a lot of food. We were disappointed that they discontinued the chinese ginseng with chicken. The chef behind the counter said the head chef indicated that it was too much work to make that dish, so they stopped making it.  The dessert bar is overwhelming with so much to choose.  They have mochi ice cream in different flavors.  For crepes, they just make the plain crepe and you add your own topping (I would think that they should make you a complete crepe if you're paying over $40 for a meal).  Watch you time wisely, at the bottom of the receipt that they prefer that you eat for only two hours.", "type": "review", "business_id": "sIyHTizqAiGu12XMLX3N3g"}

The sliders, cheese selection, tiny plated salads/vegetables, and tacos were stand out items at the buffet. The sushi was decent too as well as the meat station. There was a lot missing from the seafood section at lunch time so if you are a seafood fan do NOT go for lunch.\n\nThe desserts were nicely displayed, but it was a mixed bag in terms of flavor. The strawberry cheesecake pops were amazing and the green tea creme brulee was creative, but the red velvet whoopie pie was flavorless. \n\nAlthough I enjoyed the lack of a crowd during lunch time at Bacchanal, your money may be better spent at dinner, when I assume they put in more effort.", "type": "review", "business_id": "sIyHTizqAiGu12XMLX3N3g"}

I am very pleased with Zarkana as a clear return to the type of show I expect from CdS. Much like the original Mystere with significant modernizations and improvements, this show is all about the talented performers with the expected visually overpowering style of CdS. Not alot of story; not alot of famous people; not much stuff other than the basic CdS performances. Great staging! Great action! Visually stunning and alot of serious fun! I can highly recommend Zarkana and list it atop my favorite show list. Yes, I will see Zarkana again on my next visit to Aria Las Vegas.", "type": "review", "business_id": "008fyQR7HVmsaZHrrZWuLQ"}

This was our first outdoor meal this year and a very pleasant surprise.  We ate under a palapa (grass umbrella) next to realistic looking palm trees.  Not your stereotypical Mexican restaurant, this place is really about seafood.  I have always loved the fresh seafood when we are in Mexico and these people do a great job.  The staff was prompt and courteous, bringing complimentary whole fried corn tortillas (tostada), green chile salsa, and ceviche that was refreshingly different and quite good.  The menu is extensive and varies widely in price (fish tacos to a platter of raw oysters, scallops, shrimp, abalone, crab legs etc).  The waitress was very helpful and told us which items were also designed to serve a party of 4 or more people (fun idea for future outing with friends).  The menu is Spanish with English subtitle ingredient summaries and there are pictures of most dishes on the menus and also above the windows.  At least I could read it without my glasses, I guess if you want a completely English menu, stick to Taco Bell.  The portions were more than we could eat.  I had Pulpo Diablo (Octopus in devil sauce) that had a some tang but not hot for the sake of hot.  Seafood is often overpowered and this was complimentary and delicious.  The presentation was nice with a lettuce, cucumber tomato salad , an orange slice and really good bread (see photo).  I found french fries a bit out of place, but I didn't have room to eat them anyway.  All in all a great experience and I can't wait to return and try other menu items.  I hope we can keep this unique seafood restaurant in the Madison area.", "type": "review", "business_id": "KOr67KmoAwv7sm2pFNbFFA"}

Don't get me wrong, it's beautiful inside with chandeliers and a sexy, library vibe. There are quite a few bars like this in the Bay Area, nothing terribly unusual. What really turned me off is the amount of the Chad-like dudes walking in with deep V tees and girls with big boobs/two-toned hair/facial piercings. It's loud in there, too! Guess that's just how people roll in Las Vegas, huh?\n\nAnyhoo, we were lucky enough to bypass the riff raff altogether and get a sneak peek of The Laundry Room, a secret bar within. AKA, a speakeasy. Normally I would groan and roll my eyes, as speakeasies are *so* 2009. However, never doubt the pageantry of Vegas. This one is legit.\n\nFirst off, they don't crowd the room with just anyone. Reservations are required, so even if you lurk near the entrance, chances are you won't get in. When we were there at 11:30 on a Saturday night, there were only about 6-8 other lucky patrons inside. Intimate without being creepy, music that's not harming your eardrums and the same, chic ambiance as the rest of the joint. Plus, they have their own private restroom so no need to exit, then re-enter. Lovely!\n\nBartenders here know how to make a drink, no joke. The menu itself (with beautiful photography btw) is fairly lengthy so there should be something for anyone. And if you don't like the pre-selected cocktails, the 'tenders can whip up something special. My vote? Classic St Germain champagne cocktail, with elderflower liqueur, bubbly, a splash of club soda and lemon peel. Was slightly little nervous ordering from a bartender I didn't know, but she made it perfectly without any directions necessary. God Bless! She also threw together a Penicillin, a pretty obscure drink IMHO. We even had the chance to visit with our new favorite drink slinger and she was awesome! Could hold her own against any of the mixologists in SF any day... probably better!\n\nJust like any other swanky joint in Vegas, drinks here are a bit pricey.

Definitely a great recommendation Mike, both my friend and I really enjoyed it.  My friend had a beer, I have no idea what it's called, just came in a cool gray bottle (I don't drink beer, but it's there fav one so I'm glad they had it there)\n\nSo the food.. Uhh so good.\nFor the Starters or App we had the Pork and Duck Rillettes.  That was delicious.  I will say it was interesting as well b/c I've never had anything like it.\n\nFor the real deal we had the Fish and Chips and the Grilled Lamb Burger... OMG the burger was the kind that melts in your mouth... We took Mike's recommendation on ordering it medium... Yeah that was good.  I was a little nervous ordering fish and chips b/c I didn't think they could be any different, but once again Mike was right and the fish was amazing.  The breading melts in your mouth and doesn't fall off the fish.. Tartar sauce was good with it, and the peas were more for decoration for me, but they were actually seasoned well too.\n\nI know Ramsay and he would have expected nothing less than perfection at one of his restaurants.

It was a great value for $20.13 considering I got a burger, fries, and dessert. I went with the Euro burger. The bun was perfectly light and crispy, proportion of meat to bun to toppings was excellent as well. The patty was well seasoned and not too dense. The goat cheese wasn't overpowering and the roasted tomatoes gave it a touch of sweetness and acidity, with the arugula adding the right amount of bitterness to balance everything out.\n\nThe wife got the chantrelle burger protein-style (without the bun for those not familiar with the In-N-Out lingo). I was too busy chowing down on mine to try hers. She seemed happy with it.\n\nThe thick cut parmesan fries were a little limp and not as crispy as fries should be. On the plus side there was enough fries for 3 or 4 people to share. The onion rings were lightly battered and as good as any you'll find in town.\n\nThe push pop for dessert doesn't do Ramsay's sticky toffee pudding justice. It's not even close to being as amazing as the warm version found at Gordon Ramsay Steak. The cold temperature made it too firm and crumbly. The peanut ice cream didn't add much either with its mild flavor and lack of creaminess.\n\nOn the bright side, our server Tabitha was very good. Knowledgeable, attentive, and efficient, she made the dining experience great. Although, she did make a mistake with my friend's check, who was dining with us.", "type": "review", "business_id": "aGbjLWzcrnEx2ZmMCFm3EA"}

I'm also not somone who enjoys most raw fish.\n\n*Toro (Tuna belly) very simular to salmon belly but a stronger fish taste\n\n*karagi (fried chicken) thiers was the mpst unique as it had a spicy jalepenio sauce which really gave it that extra kick!\n\n*sauteed brussel sprouts-these were amazingly delicious and crispy,  with a lemon zesty sauce. I truly have never liked brussel sprouts until I tried thiers!\n\n*thier pork belly steam buns (thier version was spicy and perfectly steamed) \n\n*ribs (4 peices with tons of tender meat that falls right off the bone in a tangy orange bbw sauce.\n\n*fresh house made ginger ale. \n\n*greenies dessert (green tea brownie with a rasberry and green tea ice cream served with a small cup of strawberry white hot chocolate. I loved thier take on strawberry milk so much so that I specifically requested this each evening we came. Its completely made from scratch using real strawberries and a perfectly frothy milk. \n\nIf there is one place that will make me keep coming back to Vegas (since I dont smoke, drink or gamble) it would be this place! I highly recommend coming here, especially for happy hour and for those who want a little taste of the bay that thier missing from back home! The only (minor) thing I would say more as constructive criticism, is the time it takes between dishes to come out, even when there are only a few tables there.

What I loved most is that it came with miso soup, a salad, a bowl of sticky rice, and 3 different sauces for my meat. On my second visit, I had the same Filipino server.

My food was brought out to me, and not a word was said or even a look at me. It was almost as if se didn't want to be there and I was an annoyance. While eating, it took a superhuman effort to get the waitress' attention just to get a refill on the water. It wasn't very pleasant\nThe food, on the other hand was da B-O-M-B. I started off with the chicken wings and fish oil sauce, and needless to say it blew my socks off. The chicken was perfectly fried, and the sauce complemented it perfectly. In fact the only bad thing was that i burned my tongue because I'm too impatient to let it cool down. For my main appetizer, I decided not to get pho, but actually to try their broken rice because thats one of my favorite things. The pork was delicious and tender. I almost licked the plate clean is how good I loved it.\nbut in the end, as much as I loved the food, the service left a bad taste in my mouth. As someone who knows how restaurants work behind the  scenes, I tend to give a little more leeway for bad service because I know waiters get busy and they are generally doing what they can. This though, was a little too much. No check to make sure everything is fine with the food, not once did she ask me if i needed more water. I understand that she had other tables and large parties, but I am still a paying customer and I still would like to feel welcomed when I go out to eat. I'm very undecided on whether or not I'll return here", "type": "review", "business_id": "A6DFzxQT5yBkwBBJsURRWQ"}

This was a bad decision on my part.\n \nWhen I got there I told them I won the VIP thing and handed them my ID (because it's hard to hear and my full name is difficult), then they started yelling Happy Birthday and blowing a horn...my birthday is in March (apparently it was October birthday event as well as the VIP thing). We find a table and sit down, a waitress finally shows up and the fun begins.  She tells us the specials and we order. I have to ask for a menu in order for us to know what they have in way of beer and food because she didn't seem clear on a few things.\n \nWe order food and another round of drinks. The food (Mac and Cheese and Hummus sampler) comes out, they don't bring us utensils, they do not bring us plates. When we ask for utensils they bring our table of 5, 2 sets of silverware, I'm not sure if we were supposed to use them to battle each other until there were 2 victors and they were the ones who got to eat or were really bad at counting.\n \nNow to address the food, I didn't eat any of it, but I was told the Mac and Cheese was very good.  The hummus was commented as being too oily. The other thing with the hummus is it's called a hummus sampler but there was only 1 kind of hummus. There were a bunch of vegetables and 3 pieces of pita bread. So it's more like a veggie plate with hummus and some pita bread.\n \nAbout this time we go to order another round of drinks...however this time the specials are different and what was previously ordered we are told was not on special and will be full price and that only Bud Light Draft as the beer is on special. This wouldn't have been a big deal if we were told in the beginning, same things most likely would have been ordered but it leaves a bad taste in my mouth that we were told one thing in the beginning and then it change mid night. We were also told at this time that we no longer would get glasses and now plastic cups is what drinks would be served in. I also pull up a drink I want to try on my phone and ask if it's possible that I could get it (I was already told I couldn't have a lemon drop because it's a shot, which yes it is but it's also a drink). Instead of writing down the ingredients (vodka, grapefruit juice and apple juice) after looking at my phone, she asks if she can take my phone, so she can ask. When I'm a little hesistant (think $600 phone and me having no way to replace it or pay for the insurance immediately) she says \"I'm not going to steal it, I promise.\" So I let her take it, she does not go right to the bartender, she instead takes a little tour around the restaurant with my phone in tow. She comes back and informs me that they do no have the ingredients for that drink. So I order a different one that is pretty much packed with ice, as most of the alcoholic drinks have been all night, to the point that it became a joke at our table. The regular Coke however had very little ice.\n \nNow, time for the check, I had a $25 gift certificate for the food, so we gave the waitress that.  She came back like 5 minutes later and asked us if it was counterfeit. Yeah, so at this point, we are paying more money for drinks and have been accused of being thiefs, lovely. She brings the check out, it's wrong, it's explained to her how it's not accurate and she has a difficult time processing that information. She takes it back, she comes back again, she is asked to explain some things and she gets a bit snippy about it.  This whole process alone took 30 minutes and at this point we just want to leave, so we pay.\n \nI have no intentions of returning to this location, as it's a somewhat largish chain, so even though this is a new location this stuff should be figured out. The waitress was friendly until the check part I'll give her that. However, I'm not sure if she was not trained properly on the specials or what is available at the bar by management or why she was unsure about so many things.", "type": "review", "business_id": "nh2k5n9GB1nu5WOC4Cakhg"}

But Fat Dumpling is what started the addiction...\n\nWhat Fat Dumpling has going for them is that they don't try to be too much. Most of the menu is dominated by the standard style dumplings. You can tell by the taste that these are made in house, and I'm further convinced by how they treat their smoothies.\n\nThe first time we went, we were told that the tapioca pearls weren't ready yet (it was around 11 in the morning), and that it would be close to an hour. A little disappointing that they aren't made ahead of time, but considering that some pearls take almost two hours to make, it isn't too surprising. In fact, they do let you have yesterday's pearls if you want, or there's some yummy jelly options. But what convinced me to keep coming back here for their smoothies was that they use fresh fruits and not some substitute like powder or syrup. The prices are reasonable, and the mango smoothie is one of the best I've had and isn't overly sweet as well. Usually I get a large and it's gone by the time I get home :|\n\nThen there's the dumplings - I thought the flavor was good. No sauce is needed here, though you can always have some if you like. I've also tried their popcorn chicken which has a good flavor but might be a tad salty. On the very plus side, the chicken was very moist and had a good amount of meat. I also tried their steamed pork dumplings which had a good flavor in my opinion.\n\nOverall, I simply just enjoy the simplicity, price point, and flavors they offer here. It is probably my favorite local Chinese joint in Las Vegas.", "type": "review", "business_id": "1MRWXUsIvKNwt5SdLxqhZA"}

Had their pork belly sandwich on rye and it was fantastic. First, the bread was amazing.  Had a good rye flavor and was obviously made by an experienced baker.  It's not the standard rye you get at the supermarket.\nPork belly was nice and tender with a good balance between meat and fat.  Topped with some tasty greens.  It's definitely a gourmet sandwich at a very reasonable price.  In fact, many of their sandwiches cost what you'd pay for a Subway sandwich only everything is made from scratch, fresh, and delicious.  \nIt's nice to eat a sandwich made by a real chef.  Highly recommended.\nI ate it on the hood of my car but am told you can eat inside Dino's.  They'll even deliver it inside if you're in there having a brew or two or 8.\nOh yeah I forgot - I also had the house made pickles.  Fantastic and a nice side to go along with the richness of some of their sandwiches.", "type": "review", "business_id": "GH9msf27EzWgoNvH8c-1FQ"}

I would have preferred the lobster tail dough to be softer however the cream filling was delicious with a touch of liqueur. The cannoli was average and I expected the cup cakes a little more moist and soft. Cheese cake flavor did not stand out from others I've tried. I liked half moon and chocolate butter cookies. I also wanted chocolate covered strawberries, but there were none for sale. I feel you are definitely paying for celebrity and not flavor", "type": "review", "business_id": "PydUXalUeAQPRUtfH5Gl-w"}

COOKIE BUTTER FRENCH TOAST  is the way to go if you arent a pancake lover. Our server was consistent, I think her name was Nikki, she kept up with our coffee and even brought us 2% milk for my husband, hes a little picky about his coffee.
