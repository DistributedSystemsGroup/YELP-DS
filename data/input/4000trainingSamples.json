Then on a recent road trip someone mentioned about eating at the Pine Cone, I thought is there really more than one?  I looked out the window to see exactly where we were at and it wasn't near Johnson Creek -- when we arrived, and I saw the bakery....I knew I was home.\n\nIt was near dinner time so I ordered stuffed chicken breast.  The dinner roll alone is a meal.  I can't say enough about dinner.  Everything is homemade. They don't add alot of salt, if any.  You can tell its fresh.  Its plentiful.  Its cheap.  You literally can stuff yourself for next to nothing.\n\nYou can't possibly leave this place without indulging on some bakery goods to take home, IF they can make it home.  In our case, they were safely packed in the trunk for our safety and yours.

I have eaten at every single lunch food place surrounding this office at least once. My favorite is Ichi Ban.  I just can't afford it as often as I want.\n\nI have also eaten sushi at several valley locations and I return to Ichi Ban every time. Why? Becuase they make the rolls very tight. The rice is perfect and the flavor is fresh. I can't stand it when rolls are sloppy and the rice falls apart or the fish slides right off. The portions of fish per piece is just right and the flavors blend so nicely. The presentations look good, especially that Dec. 29th roll. I have never had the fish smell I've encountered in other joints. Even the octopus is fresh and the wasabi is hot. \n\nTheir tempura is perfect, the gyoza make it possible to bring my child who isn't as adventurous. I have never gotten sick there. I have frequently gotten full. I agree they are too attentive on the drink orders and seem to be in a hurry to take away your miso bowl, which is partly why they lose a star. Let a person eat!  The other reason was when I ordered my daughter some lemonade I got Endamame. I realize they may sound similar, but it was a drink order. They had good endamame though so I was ok. The third reason is that they close between late lunch and early dinner and it makes it less likely for me to go across the street to eat for dinner when I have to wait an hour.\n\nWhen I first visited the place was so dark and narrow, but I liked sitting up at the sushi bar and the owner remembers you. Well he always remembers me and even what we like and asks about my daughter when we don't bring her. I don't like their green tea ice cream, it tastes like what I expect Cyndi Lauper's lipstick might taste like. Maybe it's supposed to taste that way and I don't like anyone's green tea ice cream. I haven't tried others since that experience. I'd rather spend my money on another roll. I have tried to get my co-workers to come over, but no one I work with cares for sushi. I told them they could get a rice bowl with teriyaki chicken or something, but they pass. Maybe they don't want to go to lunch with me... hmm. \n\nMy partner told me that not all Ichi Ban's are created equal. I'm just lucky this one is so close.  I just wish I could afford more of it. I'd eat there every day.", "type": "review", "business_id": "oSKT5oZX1NWYaHwOWL5lag"}

The bread was nice a toasted with a garlic cheese butter and they add fresh cold chopped tomato with fresh cut basil with a little olive oil. The pizza is great sauce taste as it should and they don't use the generic cheeses and ingredients, plus they always have great specials online and on social media. The wings are also great big and tasty with lots of sauce which I find it comparable to long wongs med sauce. \nThe bad\nPretty common thing for me with parking but this is particularly a bad area to park and not the greatest of areas especially at night have seen some seedy people. \nOverall this place is a Phoenix staple and great for dates I would recommend it.", "type": "review", "business_id": "PEHJjxdw11TGFma9Zhz3ng"}

Fast food style BBQ- I ordered the 3 slider combo which is great so you can try all theme meats.  I liked the pulled pork the best although it's a little on the dry side.  The sauce is awesome and does a great job masking any noticeable dryness if you spread it out.  You also get a side (can't go wrong with Mac n cheese) that comes in a to go container which is great if you can't finish all your food.  I love the fact that the place is family owned and it's a great atmosphere in the establishment with several historically meaningful pictures of it.  The garbage system needs an update as the hole to actually dump garbage is tiny and causes sauce to spill all over the sides and for customers to actually put effort in aiming their disposal of goods.", "type": "review", "business_id": "xfk9eY8gmwn8qsbyd-W6lQ"}

The menu offers several different beer, wine, and liquor options, from several different regions of the world. Food options are a mix of American, Irish, and British pub type foods.\n\nWe started with the medium hot wing drumettes as an appetizer. They were the right amount of heat level- not too hot, not too mild. The sauce itself was very vinegary and the meat tasted a little on the dry side.\n\nAs for entrees, I decided on the fish and chips, and tried some of the shepherd's pie. The fish and chips came as 2 sizable pieces of battered fillets, with a heap of fries. Although I ordered it with peas, it came with an extra side of coleslaw. The batter was excellent on the fish: A beautiful golden brown, and very crisp. The fish though, tasted dry. The coleslaw was crisp, but had no flavor. \n\nService was somewhat lackluster. Although our server would take away plates, he did not bother to check on our table to refill drinks (Sodas). Even when asked if we could get a refill he forgot to go to our table until we were done with our meal, and by that time it didn't matter to us if we had refills. In addition, it took a long time to get our check.\n\nI wasn't too impressed with the fish and chips, but I did like the shepherd's pie better. The mashed potatoes, ground meat, and veggies meshed well together with the gravy. \n\nWhile I wasn't very impressed with the fish and chips, I'd like to give George and Dragon another shot.

The '5 and Diner' on 16th St and Colter left me with little to ask for.  Before coming here I had a preconceived notion that 5 & Diners were dirty and nasty. Not the case at all.\n\nWe walk in and let the waitress know we want to sit outside (since it's so nice and they had misters).  We get two different servers bringing us stuff (talk about service) and I ask the one waitress for recommendations.  I didn't listen to her, of course, and ordered the Southwestern Burger w/ coleslaw and started with a nice stack of rings.\n\nThe Onion Rings were perfectly cooked.  They looked like they were prepackaged, but they were very crispy and I could actually bite through the onion without pulling the entire thing out (don't you hate that?!!!)\n\nThe Southwestern Burger was order Medium Rare and was cooked accordingly.  Soft, juicy, and pink with a nice crispy browned outer layer that can only be achieved on a well used grill.  The creaminess of the chipotle mayo paired beautifully with the green chiles.  Unfortunately, because I ate too many onion rings, I couldn't finish my burger.  What a shame!\n\nThe Coleslaw was just how I like it.  It's hard to find a really good coleslaw.  I prefer mine to be slightly sweet, not sour.  Too much vinegar in slaw ruins it in my opinion.  This slaw had the perfect marriage of mayo, vinegar, and sugar. Not to mention carrots...\n\nMy experience here was great!  The servers were top notch and kept my water full the entire time and actually chatted with us for a few minutes.\n\nThere is an artist guy named Ross who has been there every day for 5393 days straight.

Perhaps I was having a moment of Hellenic pride.  Maybe I wanted to feel like I was on the island of Chios smelling the marina and humming along with all the traditional anthems.  Perhaps I was hoping to break a few plates after toasting a wonderful plate of desperately sought out seafood in the desert.  I am not sure what it was that night I simply had to have Greek food. I had a dream is more than an ABBA greek tribute.  But here is my reality...\n\nHaving recieved awesome directions not thanks to my Garmin which placed the restuarant to the right versus the left off 19th and Camelback, but from the owner's wife, I pulled into an empty Tuesday night parking lot about an hour and a half before closing.  Perhaps this was my very first mistake but with this economy, I realized that the place might have been hurting more than my yearning for horiatiki and tzatziki.  Still, the women's voice was alluring and authentic and promising.\n\nEnter stage left, a host.  Truly, I thought  that I was part of an elaborate prop set for what would be a Greek tragedy.  The place is certainly capable visually of transporting you to Ellada.  The place was also as barren as an off season tourist trap near Plakka.  The two other people there seemed to be regulars.\n\nI admit that I was VERY impressed with the menu.  Again promising.  I went ahead and ordered Ktopodi traditional and kalamarakia.  Homemade bread that was made the last time the restaurant was full appeared at the table with sweet butter that was also frozen at that same time.  A wine list featuring more Greek wines than anyplace else was also promising, but I knew I would have a long drive back and well, you know me and that speeding thing on Interstate 17...I digress...\n\nAfter waiting for almost 25 minutes, I got one tentacle of  what must have been the world's smallest octopus and that octopus was suffering from anorexia.  It was camoflauged in a sea of fava bean paste to give it a fuller appearance.  It was dry and not tasty.  To be more clear... imagine a child's finger being grilled and placed in front of you after being dehydrated.  Yea.  That is what it was like.\n\nThe salad was fair.Meek, but fair.  Nothing to really yelp about.  The kalamarakia were horrid.  I think they were anything but fresh as they were laden in overly fried onions and sopping in oil with the breading stripping away.  I must have been desperate for the fruit of Poseiden to be enticed in any way to put a forkfull of this stuff in my mouth.  It was the absolute worse that I have ever experienced.  Hands down.  \n\nI am certain from the many posted accolades all over the walls of the place, that the GreekFest was indeed great.  But its day has come and gone and its legendary service and cuisine is all but a page of mythology.  I was extremely disappointed.  I am only giving two stars because the server was ok and the setting and music was so authentic.  I can only beg the Marvrides to consider a return themselves to their heritage of excellence that seems now so far away.", "type": "review", "business_id": "KLaxBc83JnxyGf7GP7enYA"}

Last minute anniversary idea totally worked in our favor, as we were greeted with a \"Happy anniversary!\", and led to a seemingly huge booth decorated with rose petals & cheap plastic heart pieces, which was a nice touch. \n\nThe drink selection consisted of standards like martini's and a massive wine list. We went for the basic. Dry gin martini, 3 olives. They pulled it off wonderfully, and it was shaken/poured tableside, as it should be.\n\nWe started with the calamari. They fry them up in a bready, salty batter. Almost too salty. Then, they do something awesome, and toss in chopped cherry peppers. The result is this concoction of spicy bready perfectly fried calamari. The peppers add this crazy flavor to the overall dish, which is completely unexpected and delicious. Great ratio of head vs body too. I hate it when restaurants just give me heads. I'm not afraid of tentacles! \n\nI had the sliced filet migon with cippolini onions and wild mushrooms, finished with a 12 year balsamiq reduction. Perfect crust on the steak. The saltyness of the crust brought out the juices of the meat, when combined with the reduction, resulted in a fantastic melt-in-the mouth feel.  That being said, I wish it was a little more rare.\n\nShe had the special, which was a lamb roulade filled with an herb cream cheese and wrapped in bacon. While this proved to be a winning combination of flavors, the lamb was slightly overcooked from medium rare. \n\nWe got the lobster mac and cheese, which had huge chunks of lobster. The cheese was mascarpone, which resulted in a soupier mac, but it worked well with the lobster. We also got the french green beans with heirloom tomatoes, which while tasty, wasn't anything special. \n\nFor dessert, we were brought an espresso chocolate flourless cake, finished with raspberry sauce & fresh raspberries. Rich and delicious.\n\nIn the end, it was a fantastic meal. The Capital Grille is not the best steakhouse I've ever been to though, it is a very close second. I recommend in a heartbeat.\n\nAs a p.s: The service was top notch. I even got a phone call the next day, wanting to know how the experience was. I have never gotten that kind of attention from a restaurant before, and I doubt it will happen again.", "type": "review", "business_id": "QdbZyl-LWFS54u93Vjd5SA"}

There is also a little shop in the spa where I can find fun little gifts / trinkets.   There is also a place to get your nails done - which I love!  The challenging golf course is always in amazing shape.  The pool is fun for all ages.  There are cabanas, lounge areas, a huge swimming pool with a few lanes and a diving board, a kid pool, etc.  Sadly, there is no outdoor jacuzzi - but there are jacuzzi's (men's and women's) in the locker room area's, along with steam rooms and etc.  The tennis courts are nice, as well.  The restaurant is just gorgeous, and it is the perfect place for a wedding.

For the entree I had a wonderful Cabernet Sauvignon recommended by the Sommelier, to go with my New York Strip. I added a side of roasted brussel sprouts with duck confit which was outstanding!  My steak was cooked extremely well and delicious.  I did not have room for desert, but made room for a cup of coffee, which was very good as well. \n\nMy next visit to T.

The fresh squeezed OJ is good but VERY pulpy. OH - and the new 'side', mac 'n cheese (w/jalepeno), is AMAZING. OMG SO creamy and delicious.

Other friends joined us today and the majority of the table had a commuter sandwich.  It is the BEST breakfast sandwich on the planet.  It consists of an English muffin (made at LGO), eggs, tomato and mayo.  My meat of choice on the commuter is bacon.

I have been to LGO too many times to count but each time I leave, I 'm one happy camper!  Mike and I were waiting for our food, looking at the other items that were ready and thinking that everything looked scrumptious.

I would be amiss if I didn't mention their iced tea.  I always have the standard iced tea but I know people also greatly enjoy their iced green tea.  I started with the iced tea and as much as I love green tea, I can't move beyond the regular iced tea.

Each month, they allow a different local artist to show their work on the coffee shop walls. And while ordinarily they are not open past 6 p.m. on Saturday, an exception is made on the 2nd Saturday of each month when you can sit outside and listen to  live jazz and/or blues from 8 - 10 p.m.  And, by the way, Dennis, the owner, is a bad ass on the harmonica! \n\nWe really are so lucky to have such a great business, doing great things, in the community!", "type": "review", "business_id": "4eFIVmbeCvJGCrhzmd-VYA"}

This is a great spot located near the movies at the Scottsdale 101 shopping center.  The number one thing, in my opinion, about restaraunts is consistency.  I have never been let down here.  I usually get the same thing everytime i go so I cant really comment on the depth of the menu.  But if you like Summer spring rolls which are packed with noodles, shrimp, pork, chicken wrapped in rice paper you will love the ones at Tea Light.  I follow the summer rolls with a huge bowl of chicken soup.  This soup has a phenominal flavor with asian noodles and a genorous amount of tasty chicken.  There are sauces left out on the tables so you can make your soup as spicy hot as you want.  The very casual order counter and friendly service allows for an evironment that makes you feel like you are at the neighhborhood Cafe.  You will see the same people there everytime and they are as nice and appreciative of your business as they can be.

At least write it down. The down stairs bar was closed one evening due to an event. Brought food to lounge to have a dinner meeting with coworker. We were asked to leave because our meal was not catered by restaurant. Also charged for box storage. small fee not the issue,but the fact that I was not notified was irritating. Still waiting for response from property manager if this was Hilton policy or their location's policy.  The car service was silly. They could only take me one way. The mall is about a block away. But temperature was over 110, not worth walking back even that short distance . Internet service was poor. Staff response was, \"they are working on it\" ... fine but you were \"working\" on it 4 months ago.\n    \nToo restrictive on silly rules, Internet was poor, staff really didn't want to be there,  Good location for business travel.", "type": "review", "business_id": "iZqO52AeTq6lnn4kn6T-OQ"}

Usually it becomes sensitive and grows back into your cheek.  My protrusion was not all that sensitive, and I kept biting it.  It kept growing out and I needed it removed.  This requires minor dental surgery.  That was all I knew. **End aside.**  I didn't know the cost, what the surgery would entail, nada. The waiting room seems to be about an average size and includes a fish tank.  The rest of the office includes a vast array of rooms.  I had a quick preliminary examine by Dr. Fish.  By the way, I was expecting a woman, but obviously Leslie is also a male name.  He gave me the diagnosis and treatment plan.  Next, I was ushered into another room and was told the price and the surgery was scheduled.  The price varied by the anesthetic.  I opted for the cheapest option, local anesthetic only.  Adding laughing gas was an extra charge, which means you are still awake, but a little loopy.  The third option was to be entirely knocked out.  In addition, the protrusion that was cut out of my mouth was sent to a lab for analysis to determine whether it was benign or malignant.  This was an extra charge, and I still don't know what the cost will be.  I arrived for my appoint still a little unsure of what was going to happen.  I had scheduled it for 7 AM on a Monday morning.  There seem to be set times for surgeries and set times for examinations.  By the time I was shown to my room, there were ten to twelve other people in the waiting room.  I had a nurse?? take my vitals.  I was connected to a machine that takes your blood pressure every fifteen minutes or so.  I was given a topical anesthetic to get the numbness going.  Dr. Fish came by and used a pinching tool to inject the rest of the local anesthetic.  Then we waited for the numbness to take over my right cheek.  Dr. Fish came in later, asked for another nurse, and started the procedure.  I could feel some punching from tools I assumed were used to keep my cheek open for cutting.  I saw some bloody on tools, but didn't feel any cutting.  Apparently, there was a smaller protrusion starting to grow next to the main protrusion, and Dr. Fish cut that one out as well.  It took under ten minutes.  After the procedure was over, gauze was inserted into my mouth.  I bled for another three hours and had to change the gauze every half hour.  After the surgery, I was shown to the recovery area that had alcoves with beds.  One women was asleep.  I guess she took option number three.  I was given a goody bag with the extra gauze, a prescription for penicillin and a heavy duty pain killer (I think it was percocet), and a pillow case.  I was also given the talk for someone with stitches in their mouth.  No alcohol.  No mouthwash.  No solid foods for a few days, and then keep it soft, etc.  I was supposed to come back the following Monday, but was leaving for vacation on Saturday, so I came back on Friday instead.  In the end, although I didn't know what to expect, everything went very smoothly and professionally.  Despite the reviews I read on Yelp, the price was explained up front with several options.  I also had to pay for the penicillin, (I didn't need the pain killer, just used some Motrin) and the analysis of my mouth tissue.  But such things are to be expected.  I could have refused to have my mouth tissue analyzed and prayed that it wasn't malignant, but I like sleeping at night.  I wouldn't want to have oral surgery again, but if I did, I would go back to Dr. Fish.", "type": "review", "business_id": "bMzNhr8ikzwNZdpvRsZ-GQ"}

The Mexican food in New Mexico is simply the greatest. And Las Cruces has the best in NM. Unfortunately I have family in Arizona and the Mexican food that I have had there at several different restaurants has always been absolutely awful. The first sign that a meal is going to the dogs is when we ask if they have \"green chile\" and they look at me confused and say \"What?\". \"Uhm... nevermind you obviously don't\". Try asking any restaurant in the PHX area for red or green chile and they will stare at you with their mouth open... .\"excuse me...\". Our waitress at one of the most popular local PHX restaurants when asked responded, after the \"excuse me... huh...\" part with \"Do you mean chili beans, or do you mean salsa?... Is that what you mean.... salsa?\" \n\nSo, knowing that a Las Cruces restaurant, Si Senor, had opened a restaurant in Chandler, certainly we HAD to try it while we were there. And they did not disappoint. We usually order the #1 combo (Beef tamale, cheese enchilada, chile relleno, taco, chile con carne (red or green - your choice), beans, rice, four different salsas with chips, and sopapillas (NOT \"sopas\" which is \"soups\", a \"sopapilla\" is a puffed fry bread) for less than $13 or so. And I always get it \"green\". Their green chile sauce just tastes so good smothering everything on the plate. Thank you Si Senor soooo much for opening this restaurant ... anyone who is from NM MUST go there when in town for the ONLY edible (New) Mexican food in town!! This was our first visit to this location and it will not be the last. BTW, when we were there the place was packed!! (Probably full of New Mexicans missing some of that awesome food from home!!). My ONLY complaint was that the sopapillas were covered with cinnamon and sugar. Although tasty, I like to use my sopapillas as a \"plate cleaner\"... dipping it in the sauce on the plate (or salsa), and piling on rice and beans and other scraps for a tasty stuffed sopapilla treat. But, at least there were sopapillas which only a rare few in the PHX area have.\n\nFYI: Another reviewer on here states that this is no \"Los Cuates\". Obviously he is from the Northern part of the state where the \"traditional\" NM food is not as good as in the Southern part. \"Los Cuates\" is a terrible restaurant in Albuquerque that does not even come close to Southern NM cuisine. \"Los Cuates\" is, actually at the top of my personal list of the Worst restaurants in the state. I have lived in NM for over 30 years, and Si Senor is easily one of the top 10 \"casual\" (not gourmet) restaurants in NM. And is not a \"poor attempt at New Mexican food\", but is authentic \"New Mexican\" food. I do, however, recommend the green chile over the red chile. Most restaurants tend to specialize in one or the other. With Si Senor, their green is better than their red.\nOne, reviewer mentions red \"enchilada\" sauce. It is NOT \"enchilada sauce... it is \"chile\" sauce. That is the difference between \"New Mexican\" food and Arizona food. We smother our food with chile sauce... not enchilada sauce. The sauce is made from chile and is used to flavor other foods, not JUST enchiladas. When you order a bowl of \"chile\" you get a soupy chile sauce with chunks of meat and potatoes. This is different from Texas \"chili\" which is a thickened tomato sauce with cumin and other spices, meat and beans. sopa = soup, sopaipilla = fried puff pastry, chile = the fruit of a chile plant or the powder or the sauce made from the fruit, chili =  a thick stew made with tomato sauce - cumin, and or meat and beans - and red chile powder, enchilada sauce = sauce made with chile - and several spices and usually tomato sauce - used in enchiladas.\nSi Senor's has four salsas. Red, Green, a Green sour cream, and Chorizo and Bean. The Red is probably the hottest. It is served cold and has red chile, tomatoes, cilantro, onion, garlic, etc. The Green is not quite as hot as the red but can be quite hot. It is served warm and has green chile, and other ingredients (NOT pork!), the Green sour cream is served cold and is a refresher to cool your mouth off after having the hotter salsas! It has a bit of green chile and a few spices in it. The Chorizo (Spicy Mexican pork sausage) and bean dip, has red chile in the Chorizo, garlic and beans, etc. It is served warm and isn't really very hot tasting. My favorite is the Green salsa, then the \"white\" Green (sour cream salsa), the red, then the Chorizo. \nAlso, the reviewers who say that this is nothing like New Mexican food, seem to be from Northern New Mexico, which is only one step above Arizona Mexican food. Southern New Mexico food is light years above all that, LoL. Down here in the Southern Part of the state, we grow our Chile (chile capital of the World, thankyou), hot and we grow it well. Our food revolves around our chile. If you don't like chile, you won't like our food, period. Chile doesn't have to be hot. But usually, the hotter it is, the more flavor it has.", "type": "review", "business_id": "s8cHXeSlX_aPI2x49UkCCg"}

The lettuce wrap on HH comes with 3 individual leaves of lettuce with a miniature sample of the meaty sauce while the menu displays the lettuce wraps as 4-6 leaves surrounded  by multiple bowls of filling.

Even the chips that they give you have a thin layer of grease over them, which you notice more and more as they cool off. \n\nI definitely would come back here again.", "type": "review", "business_id": "paF7fjuCWbqg7pjwSWnMkA"}

This place is just WOW! The food looked amazing; the dessert looked way too good! And the taste did not disappoint either.\n\nMy friend and I went to lunch today at Liberty Market, I was at first surprised by the line to order, it was LONG! But the way they seat people is really ingenious; by the time you are done ordering you have a table waiting. Pretty cool!\n\nWe ordered the Picnic Sandwich, which was very flavorful. My favorite part was the crisp green apples, which added great texture. A little blue cheese, some turkey, it was really well put together.\n\nWe also ordered the White pizza, which was very tasty! The crust was nice and crispy and the pine nuts were an excellent addition. Oh and don't forget dessert, no I really mean it, DON'T forget dessert....well I guess you can if you are on a diet or something.

So i thoght I'd help you guys out. For most basic custard without a topping, so like a single vanilla will run you around $2.13. Not that bad, but if you were to get 4 for eexample that'd be around $8.50. If we were to serve perfectly each time, 4 single scoops would be a pint which we actually do sell for around $5.06. If you dont mind sharing a cup and just using 4 spoons. But if you want some topping and a decent amount of custard which im sure you do. You will want to order the not so much ordered BANANA SPLIT! For $4.99 plus tax you get 3 scoops of custard,your choice, a banana (of course), 2 toppings, and a nut. That beats any custard item on our menu besides our Concrete which is also very good.\nNow for the Grinders. There isn't really a way around the price besides getting a job here and getting an employee discount. but let me tell you THEY ARE WORTH IT!\nWith fresh cut deli meats, fresh bread made from a recipe passed through generations, and their DELICIOUS and often misinterpeted pepper relish. These sandwhiches AKA Grinders are the best I've ever had. Although everyone has their preferences my favorite which is mostly customized is \"The Finer Turkey Bacon Melt Thingy!\" (not on menu). which is a grinder with; turkey, bacon, avacado, cream cheese, swiss or provolgne cheese, Xtra Xtra pepper relish, and the other grinder things such as; lettuce, mayo, onion, tomato, and etc. If you were to order this it'd be pretty pricey but if you are prepared to have the most delicious sandwhich of your LIFE! Then you should try it. Ask Nick to make it, he knows how it's done!\n(additional notes: The Ownership was changed about 2 years ago and there has been some changes, There is no longer any soup. Sorry. Also i've been told that there was a menu with different combinations for custard, which we do not have, but we do have a large list of topping that you can choose from and virtually make any flavor your heart desires.)\nCome check us out our number is 480-981-6368 and we are on the South-west corner of Power and Baseline. I'd say we are a bit hard to find but don't give up we are just around the corner of GoodWill facing Baseline.", "type": "review", "business_id": "RgXWA8zXD83KnckFfWOqJw"}

We finally found what we wanted at the Shane Co. We ordered the ring and now we're waiting two months for it to be made. Since the ring was custom made we paid for it in advance. We then paid half of the cost of the diamond in advance to hold it for two months while they make the ring. We didn't realize that they considered our diamond to be on \"layaway\" until we received a letter saying they're going to put our diamond back in the store for sale (even though its half paid for). We spent considerable time on the phone arguing with different people that don't have a clue what they're doing. Its obvious that they don't care about the diamond ring. They can't answer any of our questions about the progress of the ring. They're just focused on getting a \"layaway\" payment for a ring that is mostly paid for. I finally got tired of arguing with them so I paid the rest of it off to avoid them harassing us again for another \"layaway\" payment or putting the diamond back up for sale. The young inexperienced kids they hire have ruined the jewelry buying experience for us. Since this ring purchase was for a wedding anniversary we expected it be a good positive experience. Instead it's been a very negative experience. We don't even know who our sales person was because they swapped us off to different people so many times during the buying process. Today we asked to talk to the manager and were told they don't have one working today. Instead of focusing on their jewelry and customer service they're focusing on harassing us for a little \"layaway\" payment. Someone should teach their staff that their supposed to be helping people celebrate life experiences with their fine jewelry. I hate dealing with the Shane Company kids.

We couldn't get a reservation until 9pm on a Saturday so by the time we sat down, we were all starving. And, since we were only a group of 4, we had to wait about 10 minutes until another party of 3 was seated with us. Next time, I will be sure to bring 8 so we can all sit with people we know.\n\nThe waitress was very attentive, getting our drinks and re-fills quickly. We were served a soup and salad before the chef came over to prepare our dinner entrees. In my opinion, I wasn't a fan of either the soup or salad. The soup flavor was bland to me and the salad dressing was sour tasting. The chef came over, introduced himself and began cooking our food. He was pretty quiet, which surprised me because I thought the chefs were supposed to put on more of a show. Oh well, he was nice enough.\n\nThen, when I went to excuse myself to the ladies room, I was appalled at how unclean they were! For such an expensive restaurant, you would think the bathrooms would be really nice and attended for...I literally walked in and two of the three stalls were backed up. And, on top of that, there was a mushroom floating in one of the toilets! EWW! If I didn't have to go so bad, I would have held it. Not okay!\n\nWhen I returned to my seat, the chef cooked our meals and a few \"appetizers\" including hibachi shrimp and cooked veggies of mushrooms, zucchini and onions. We also ordered chicken fried rice, which was to die for! I really enjoyed watching the chef prepare everything...in my opinion the real reason to go here. For our entree, we ordered filet and scallops. We asked for the filet to be cooked medium rare and it was way overcooked! I would say more well done if anything. I also found that the meat was really under seasoned...but they do provide a couple sauces to go with the meals. They do give a lot of food to you....and after dinner, we got green tea and ice cream. I'm glad I shared everything because it really was a lot of food! \n\nAll in all, this place was fun. There were a lot of birthdays going on and this would be a place I would return to have a celebration or just a fun night out with a lot of people. But, I wasn't as impressed as I wanted to be. Plus, the price is steep so not somewhere I can go often. So, I would return but it's not going on my top 10 favorite restaurants list.", "type": "review", "business_id": "ishjLG3Sc94ZOelXZZhaIw"}

We have seen our waiter when we've been there on previous visits - he's not new to a busy night.

This is clearly a management decision to not utilize part of the dining room as they do not want to fully staff even during the busiest lunch hour. Forcing the hostess to lie to customers is deplorable. Years ago I ran into this same thing at the neighboring Olive Garden.

Extremely friendly and attentive staff, knowledgable and enthusiastic sushi chefs, superior grade sashimi, an eclectic variety of specials, and a menu that offers everything from Soba noodles to Chicken Teriyaki.\n\nOn our visit, we sampled the following specials:\n\nJellyfish Sunomono (a jellyfish and cucumber salad.  Jellyfish has virtually the same texture and taste as a seaweed salad)\nAnkimo or Monkfish Pate: It is essentially a sea foie gras and comes from a fish whose flavor is likened to lobster.  On its own the flavor is lacking, but dipped in a citrus ponzu it is delectable!\nAgemono Ibodai or Fried Butterfish: Even though the fish is served whole, the tender meat from the belly is cut up, fried individually, and made easy for eating by hand.\n\nFor our main course, we asked the sushi chef to create a Sashimi plate for us.  It included:\n\nKazunoko, or Herring roe.  It was pinkish, firm, and with a rubbery texture and appearance.  It came in a single cohesive mass and so it looked like a piece of sushi, but was crunchy and overall strange.\nAbura Bouzu or Escolar.  This is not to be confused with white tuna, or pretty much any type of sushi you have ever had.  I have to say that it was the most delectable, soft, creamy, rich fish I have ever had.  Better than a cut of Bluefin Toro!  Bright white in color and quite fatty, this fish is not always easy to find - in fact you will rarely see it on sushi menus due to the high levels of fatty esters.  It is known to cause digestive issues with some individuals, and for that reason has been prohibited in Japan since the 1970s.  I myself had mild cramping later that evening, but I can honestly say it's worth it!\nWhitefish: Less fatty than salmon.  It certainly has a lighter, smoother flavor - but I prefer more fat and texture in my sushi.\nAhi Maguro or Yellowfin Tuna: Beautiful deep red color, soft, meaty texture and clean taste.  Wonderful fish!\n\nWith a large bottle of hot Osake Sake, our bill was about $100.  I believe the majority of the cost came from the chef's special sashimi platter, as the average cost of a special was about $8.\n\nThis is definitely a place for people who know and love good sushi, and would highly recommend it.

The food? In comparison with the other 3 places I've been to for sushi here in phoenix it was immaculate. It reminded me enough of Cali for the quality of fish I came back again the next day because I knew I would be leaving soon there after.\n\nThe flavor profiles for the food were good, the tempura whether as a side dish or within the rolls was crisp, the salmon was excellent, the quantity to quality ratio was good, aside from having to wait for a check each time for a considerable amount I was quite happy with the results.\n\nSo far I've had the negi toro, spicy ribbon, and I believe it was the phoenix or whatever the mixed fish roll was that had multiple types of fish in it that was deep fried. There was also one other roll but the name of it escapes me at this time.

To my excitement he was.  I wanted to make an appointment for the same week, and they were able to accommodate my request.  Before we hung up the call I was told that I would receive a call before my appointment to get all of my information entered into their system.  I loved this!  Someone from the office took all of our information over the phone so when we arrived at the office, we had no paperwork to fill out!  Three signatures (privacy policy, permission to treat, agreement to pay for services), all on the same sheet of paper, and we were free to enjoy the lobby entertainment until our name was called.  \n\nThe parking lot was large and not crowded.  The waiting area provided ample seating for adults, a bookshelf filled with children's books, a play table and a few small chairs or little ones.  One of the walls was an activity wall with interactive games for the kids while they waited.  \n\nAfter a few minutes, our name was called and we were led back to a room.  Just outside the room was a large toy box. The nursed encouraged us to grab some entertainment on our way in.  My initial thought was, \"I guess that means it will be a while.\"  Wrong!  The nurse took our measurements right away and said the doctor would be right with us.  \n\nWithin five minutes Dr. Sotelo entered the room.  He spoke to me like I was his equal and explained what he was doing as he did it.  My daughter appreciated this, as did I.  I had chosen to delay certain vaccines. Dr. Sotelo took the time to hear my reasoning behind the decision.  Instead of pushing me to move forward with them, he answered my questions and let me choose how to proceed. After the doctor left, the nurse returned and administered the injections we had decide to go forward with.  When she was done she led us to Dr. Sotelos office.  \n\nDr. Sotelo met us in his there, offered my daughter a sugar-free sucker (which she devoured in minutes), and we sat and discussed milestones, development, etc.  On the way out, a friendly staff member set up our next two (!) appointments, and we were on our way...well, almost on our way.  My daughter insisted on a few more minutes of play time in the lobby before we headed out.  Yes, that is right, she didn't want to leave.\n\nNever did I feel rushed or forgotten.

However, I love Ray's in spite of all those short comings. Adjust your expectations and you won't be disappointed. It's a fact that Ray's is a little bit more $$ than the crappy cardboard flavorless pizza slices from most non-NY competitors, the Greek staff can be temperamental, and the three or four topping varieties offered don't always cover *Every* possible way pizza can be topped. \nIf it's at it's best, it's by far the best slice in the valley.", "type": "review", "business_id": "h762dZ33uhSKtLZ-21u6Jg"}

These events have really soured my experience with this location. Normally when I go to Gameworks, I play a few games and everything is fine. However, on two occasions, the staff has been incredibly rude. One night, one of the staff yelled racial slurs at that group out of nowhere. We called upon his manager to get an apology, but the offender only claimed that it was an accident that he yelled out all those words. It was definitely no accident as he tailed our group to the outside of the building and shouted those words.\n\nOn a second occasion, after playing a few games with our group, my sister and I sat down and took a break at one of their tables for a few minutes. One of the employees came over and said they were watching us the entire time, and that if we did not play any games, they would ask us to leave the establishment. It is odd that they have been watching us, and it is odd because we HAD been playing games, albeit not as many as the others. I will note that we are Asian and post-college, but we dress and act like any other American women, so I have no idea why we were treated this way.\n\nDespite all this, Gameworks can be a place for a fun outing depending on who is on staff at the moment. Unfortunately, I don't think I will be returning to this location again.\n\nNOTE ADDED 5/15/13: \nBelow it seems like a representative of Gameworks offered a way to contact me in regards to my experience.

I do not use this word lightly, but I can safely say that I HATE Sonora Quest. I tried to use their online system to pay a bill for myself and one for my child. Their system somehow ran the charge though FIFTEEN times, maxing out our HSA card, and still not paying the bill. After countless phone conversations with them and our HSA card company, it was determined that our HSA company should send them a check, which they did. I called back to ensure that they received the check, and they told me they did. That was in December. Then yesterday (this is now May) I got a notice from a Debt Collection company for $3.53. I called Sonora Quest, and after digging through our account, turns out they failed to apply the $3.53 to my son's bill because my HSA company did not put two Accession numbers on the check! They refunded our card $3.53, then according to them sent us SIX notices for that amount, but we haven't received even one thing (I flat out called them liars), and sent it to Collections. The woman on the phone tried to blame me for not getting my HSA company to put two accession numbers on the check, blame the HSA company for not putting two accession numbers, ludicrous!!!

I love how the bagel box has a place to carry the schmear. Its cute and clever.\n\nI love their pumpkin bagel in the fall.

If this was such a big deal, the manager (who had greeted us and directed us where to sit) should have told me that I could not have the drink.

Don't forget to ask about the Junior Ranger activities.  There is a small indoor nature center and a variety of hiking trails around a lake and the river.  The trails are all very kid friendly.  Various signs point the way and name the flora.\n\nI find that the Junior Ranger activities help engage kids who look around and after ten minutes of hiking say, \"What's next?\".  We usually go through three phases of Junior Ranger activity engagement.  The first is antipathy.  In the beginning, it just seems to daunting.  The parents start doing it and having fun.  Then the second stage starts -- engagement achieved.  Everyone is involved.  Not only is the activity doable, but it is fun.  During this stage, the family gets to explore the environs.  After walking around the park, there is usually just a narrative left that stands in the way of the kid and the reward.  An insurmountable task during the first phase, during the third phase, get it done and get the reward, it is completed in short order.  Throughout, the parents insert pearls of wisdom during obvious teachable moments.  And at the end, everyone forgets the first stage, and agrees that they had fun the whole time.", "type": "review", "business_id": "lx__YjGOYxuIeK2VsTUfEg"}

When I arrived at the restaurant and glanced at the menu, it was nowhere to be found.  I was terror-stricken.  I asked them if it was still available and they assured me, yes, they now changed the name of it to orange chicken.  I thought to myself: oh great, not another orange chicken.  I didn't see anything else I thought I'd like on the menu, so I decided to order it anyway (orange chicken is the white man's safe choice, after all)...and I'm so glad I did.  Wow, I was not expecting that.  The chicken was perfect -- crispy and crunchy on the outside, soft and tender on the inside (I could cut it with a fork).  The sauce was delicious; not too overpowering, not too syrupy or sticky and with a decidedly unique flavoring.  The portions were huge (I have dinner packed for tonight) and the price was just right for the level and quality of food being served.  Holy crap, I can't recommend it any better than that.  Hands down the best \"orange\" chicken I've had since moving to Henderson.

What more can you ask for?\n\nI went here last night to celebrate a birthday for my girlfriend and was seated immediately since the rush hasn't started yet. The restaurant seemed like the perfect place for our date that evening.  Romantic and classy.  Exactly what I was looking for.\n\nOur waiters took our drinks and told us a long list of specials they for the night. That speech took at least 3 minutes.  I guess they were really trying to push the specials.\n\nBefore I get onto the food I want to comment on the service and overall experience.\n\nService:\n- Fantastic. We were checked up on my our waiter and his trainee many times throughout dinner. Usually restaurants check up on you 2-3 times throughout the dinner and we would have to flag them down the rest. But not here.  Another thing that caught my attention was the owner walked around mingling with the customers the entire night.  He looked content and caring.\n\n-  You have to wait for your food here. Each of our courses had at least 15-20 minutes in between (Including the time you eat that course); as it should be. We ordered around 6:40pm, received our antipasto at 6:50, then received our mussels at 7:20 and so on.  I'm not saying this is bad at all, but if you're in a hurry don't eat here. They make quality food here and if you're just going to rush through and scarf it down you mine as well just grab a burger from Wendy's down the street.\n\nExperience:\n- I really enjoyed that dinner. The food was fantastic and not too salty. I actually prefer this place over Maggiano at the Fashion Show Mall. It seems like \"real\" Italian food. Not the fancy dishes they serve you at the high quality Italian restaurants at MGM Casino or the Americanized Italian food at Maggiano or Buca di Beppo. This restaurant pulls quality and authentic Italian style cooking, stirs it up, and serves it onto a plate for you to indulge in.  Also, go to restaurant.com to get a coupon. My four course meal for two people was $121, but my coupon was for $50 off $100, so the bill was for $70 not including an automatic 18% gratuity for using the coupon.  So all together, $90 for a four course high quality meal? Not bad. Not bad at all.\n\nFood:\n\n- Appetizers:\n Carpaccio di manzo con argula e parxnigiano (Beef carpaccio and arugala with parmesan cheese shavings)  $15\n\nI actually really liked this carpaccio when comparing it to many of the other places in Las Vegas At Brio in Town Square they use an aioli which I'm not too fond of. I really like the taste of the beef and the extra aioli hides that flavor. However, the carpaccio is not as good as the one at FiAMMA at the MGM Casino (Their secret ingredient is truffles so they automatically have the upper hand).\n\n Insalatta della casa (House salad) $9\n\nA basic house salad with a nice sweet balsamic vinaigrette.\n\n- Hot Appetizers\n Brodetto (Clams and mussels in a white wine tomato broth) $15\n\nThis smelled and tasted great. However, the bread was supposed to be dipped into the broth and eaten but the broth was too salty to consume with the toast.  I don't think I'll order this one again.\n\nMain Course:\n\n Mezzelune di Vitello con porcini (A half moon type of ravioli filled with veal) $19\n\nThis tasted fantastic. It takes the cake from all other Italian restaurants I've been too. The cream sauce was not too salty, the filling was nice and smooth, and the extra peas and prosciutto added a nice flavor to every bite.\n\n Ossobucco alla Millanese (Braised veal shank on saffron risotto) $32\n\nThis was my first time I had ossobucco and to be honest I only got it because it was basically the most expensive item on the menu and I wanted to be able to use my $50 off $100 coupon.  I don't regret getting this dish at all. The veal fell apart when I dug into it with my fork; a good sign that it was braised for a while.  And the saffron risotto was nice and creamy.\n\nDessert:\n\n Tiramisu $?\n\nMy girlfriend and I weren't really a fan for this one. The tiramisu at Maggino seemed better.  The only upsetting part about this cake was the lady fingers.  Despite them being soaked with liquid it still felt kind of dry and rough when swallowed.  Maybe I'm just used to eating the one at Maggiano and I don't know what real Tiramisu should be like.\n\n Gaetano's specialty martini $9\n\nI didn't really like it. The texture was nice; bubbly and still had some floating crystals of ice.  But there was a similar remarkable scent from one of those discs that they put in the urinals so that it doesn't smell. I couldn't get past that. Also, it could have been sweeter.\n\nThat pretty much wraps it up.  I would definitely go here again as it's probably my top Italian restaurant now.", "type": "review", "business_id": "fjRBF1-0JlJoxH5_jDANgA"}

I can probably eat it every day....  shh.... don't tell my wife.\n\nSo when it comes to the food, it's the same no matter where you go.  I will say that it's a little less spicy than some.  But it's interesting.  Now as far as location, this place has absolutely sucky parking but you can see it from Eastern like a lighthouse in the rough seas.   I love the look from the outside, and the outdoor seating.\n\nThe inside is also pretty small, non-typical setup and the line area is completely different from most Chipotle's.  Most of the time, the seating is right up against the ordering area, whereas this one is off to the side.  The line area is pretty short too so I'm guessing they either 1) get customers through quickly or 2) don't get many customers.\n\nI'm going to go with the former since there's always people there it seems.   Nothing you can do about the parking, and the people who prepare the food and take your money seem pretty cheerful which is always a good sign.  Believe me.... nothing like a disgruntled food prep worker that will make you wonder what went into your burrito.\n\nAll in all, it's a good chain but they get a push in their ratings for picking a good outward facing location that really shines while driving towards Anthem.", "type": "review", "business_id": "JSURpnFu8jy4etZ_My4Erw"}

Carrabba's used to me and my husbands favorite places to eat. Last night we decided to go because I got a promotion at work. We noticed that the menu changed and were excited to try a few new things. \n\nWe ordered the caprese appetizer. It was sliced tomatoes with basil and balsamic and a huge chunk of cheese in the middle. Not sliced, just a big hunk of cheese. Still it tasted alright but not as much flavor as it used to.\n\nTheir house salad was similar but because I have eaten a lot in the past, I noticed some significant differences. Smaller and less olives and no pepperincini. It is the small things with that simple salad that made it great and clearly to cut costs, they cut the special stuff. Sad.\n\nMy husband ordered a fetticini dish which did not have a lot of flavor. He could not taste the cheese. It looked really dry, almost like they forgot the sauce. I ordered the Johnny. It was flavored well but the steak was beyond tough and way smaller than it used to be. \n\nClearly, Carrabba's is chosing to cut corners to save a few bucks. Too bad too.

Most other Pho restaurants are really junky and have those aluminum fold-able chairs and tables that you get at Big Lots. \"Pho Kim Long\" is completely different. This  place is very luxurious and features giant neon lighted fish tanks, marble floors, marble tables, and comfortable chairs. Even the chopsticks are all high quality. They got those really really long chopsticks that are made of porcelain.\n\nWhat surprised me the most was how good customer service is here. Other Pho places usually have rude service. As soon as you walk in, they don't say a word to you and can't give you any recommendations because they don't speak a word of English. But, as soon as you walk into the door at  \"Pho Kim Long\", they treat you like you just walked into the Ritz. They provide excellent customer service, and they all speak perfect English so they can give you great recommendations. The staff here are all Americans(Vietnamese-American) and 2nd generation so it's easier to communicate and ask for things.  But, most of the time you don't have to ask for things because the servers have a sharp eye. Whenever they see your drinks running low they rush over and refill it. You don't even have to ask. \n\nI came here with my best friend a few days ago, and I loved the taste of the Pho and the Spring Rolls. I had the rare steak Pho, and it was better than anything I have ever had anywhere else. The steak here is very high quality and they don't even cook it. They put the raw steak in the bowl and then just put the soup over it. It was the best Pho I have ever had. Unfortunately, my friend is from Europe and he didn't enjoy it on account of him being allergic to everything( Why are European people always allergic to everything? lol). Well, he couldn't eat the spring rolls because he is allergic to shrimp, he couldn't eat the sauce because it was peanut based(peanut allergies), and he couldn't eat the beef dish we ordered because he is allergic to chili seeds. So he had a crappy time, but sucks for him because I had a great time. \nBtw, service was so good that I left a monster tip.

This is definitely not the best bowl of pho I've ever encountered, but it sure is good to be able to have \"good\" pho when I want it and need it most (at 4, 5, or 6am). Take-out pho from Pho Kim Long is my favorite after-Vegas-club remedy. And even though almost anything and everything tastes good when you're drunk, Pho Kim Long is good even while sober and/or hungover!\n\nThe broth is flavorful, but thankfully without that overwhelming, aromatic star anise taste. And it isn't too sweet, either. I like the rare beef/steak pho, and the meat tastes pretty fresh. And perfectly reddish-pink in the middle.\n\nThere is no question as to where I will be having pho when I'm in Vegas!\n\nYou can Pho Kim Long all day and all night!!!!!!\n\nYelp 365 - #289/365", "type": "review", "business_id": "FV16IeXJp2W6pnghTz2FAw"}

We went in as a large group and I had a suspicion that I wasn't going to get enough to eat. I originally wanted to order 2 hamburger plates but my mom would not let me. She did not want me to order this in a seafood restaurant. I reluctantly agreed to get the sea bass after the waiter convinced me he was going to get me big portions and I wouldn't leave hungry. Well, he brought me back about a 2\"x5\" fishstick and a small scoop of rice. I was so pissed and I think he knew when he turned around and my food was gone within a minute. It wouldn't have been so bad, but for 30 bucks for a piece of small fish and a plop of rice I was angry. The food was average but my relatives for a little less money got steaks and a potato that was still too small but better than mine. My sister got a shrimp appetizer and 6 shrimp will cost you ten bucks. It's a good thing I had 10 pieces of garlic bread and 3 bowls of salad. The piece of key lime pie was good I guess, but for 45 bucks I really could have feasted somewhere like macaroni grill next door. They got a few orders wrong also. Anyway, I'm a big eater and I don't mind paying 30 or 40 bucks to eat but at least give a decent amount of food. I mean how much can rice cost. I like a dark restaurant but this place was actually a little too dark to where you couldn't se the menu well.

Decatur Blvd.  Pulling into the lot, I recall seeing this place on yelp and was anxious to get my turn at it.  It's pretty crowded for a late Friday night and people are starting to pile in.\n\nWe join the line and perused the menu above.  The BF convinces me to go for the Hawaiian Plate at $8.99.  It's Kalua Pig and Pork Lau Lau, so this way he gets to try some of the kalua pig too!  This comes with two scoops of rice and one scoop of mac salad.  The BF ops for the Kalbi Combo at $7.99.  This give us Kalbi, Katsu, and Chicken Teriyaki.  It also comes with the standard two scoops of white rice and one scoop of mac salad.  \n\nI should mention, I've been to my share of Hawaiian joints, but my sister takes the cake.  She definitely makes it a point to try out any new ones that she comes across.  She also always substitutes the two scoops of rice and one scoop of mac salad for an additional scoop of mac and one less rice.  This is usually never a problem, and if anything, they might charge a bit more for the mac salad.  Well, I asked if I could do this.  The cashier had to ask another woman, and she in turn had to ask another guy (the manager/owner) I assume.  He flat out said no.  Wow.  They tried explaining something about not charging me for the rice, so they can't do that.  Anyway, I think I was just put off with the whole \"No.\" answer.  They could have said yes and said they would charge me for the substitution, which I probably would have agreed to anyway.  \n\nWe got our number, helped ourselves to beverages and condiments and took a seat in a booth.  One of the servers soon headed our way with my order.  Just as she was about to place it on the table, all this liquid came spilling out onto the floor and table from the plate.  (Wtf?)  She apologized and went to retrieve a towel to clean up the mess.  I was fine with the spill and clean up, my concern was with where all the liquid came from?!  I guess my Pork Lau Lau must have come out a bath, because that was dripping wet.  I ended up  pouring all this additional liquid off my plate into another plate before my rice and mac salad got too soggy from all this 'juice' sitting on my dish.  I unraveled my lau lau in search of my pork and took my first bite.  For being soggy, the meat was rather tough and the whole dish had no taste.  I ended up pouring tons of shoyu all over the dish.  There was no fatty bits either to give it any flavor.  Very disappointing on the pork lau lau part.  The kalua pig faired a bit better, but not by much.  It started out well, but as I got deeper into it, there was a lot of tough pieces that I ended up spitting out.  Overall, my dish was pretty disappointing.  I wouldn't go back here for any pork lau lau at all.\n\nI was about halfway through my order before the BF's order finally arrived.  (This is never a good thing.)  His was better, in his opinion.  He had a decent experience with his order at least.  The Chicken Teriyaki had a sweeter sauce than what I'm used to, but that's probably why this dish does well here. \n\nThe mac salad was better than some of the other places I've been to, so that was a good thing.  \n\nThere's the Aloha Bar next door and there's karaoke on Friday nights.  You'll see the servers bringing orders in next door if you're dining in.  \n\nThey do offer delivery, it's a $10 minimum and if you get their flyer, you'll find a 15% coupon on there. I asked if they had any business cards, which they were out of.  When the cashier asked the manager/owner if he had any, he asked \"Why?\"  (Uh, 'cuz I'm going to yelp this place, that's why!)\n\nWhen it comes down to it, Aloha Kitchen will continue to do well.  They are open later than some of the other Hawaiian establishments around town (5 am on Fridays and Saturdays I believe!) and they have a surplus of young customers coming in to chow down.  They have two other locations, one on E. Charleston and the other on S. Maryland Parkway.  I just know that if I return, I won't be getting any pork lau lau, that's for sure.", "type": "review", "business_id": "RfR5yc4j9coIPBuxRsOW8Q"}

Having lived the first half of my life in San Francisco, I didn't realize that residents were so spoiled until I moved to a place where the asian population was significantly lower. This number has increased, over the years. Note: minimum debit/charge is around $5.00.No seating inside, but there is some seating sprinkled throughout the plaza.\n\nThere is a huge selection of freshly baked goodies like taro rolls (my fave-so good), coconut rolls, steamed chicken buns (sio pao), macaroons, red bean filled sesame balls, egg pie, breads, hot dog buns, and assorted cakes (slice). Everything is good. Cakes are made to order and pretty reasonable. The individually wrapped goodies located on the long tables against the wall range from $0.60 to about $1.50 each! The cake is located behind the counter. I always buy a bunch of pastries when I come here. My husband really likes the coconut cake-it's moist and has the right kind of icing- not the sugary- too-sweet icing that I end up scooping off. Very small, not much ambiance, but it is clean. Helpful staff. Perfect for a light snack, dessert, or for entertaining guests at home.", "type": "review", "business_id": "0qOf05JyHJopL0mE0qWMCg"}

Many more corral life and clams can be found in this store that looks clean and constantly cared for by its staff. The store staff are helpful if you have any questions or needing product or information. The scent of aquatic life in the air but not overpoweringly odoriferous.

I came here reluctantly because of the low rating, but my Aunt really wanted to eat some Szechuan cuisine while we were in Las Vegas. But maybe my low expectations were a good thing, because I was pleasantly surprised at how good the food was.\n\nHere's the breakdown!\n\n*Food:\n-Pork intestine in clay pot: SO yummy!! This was flavored with a sour and spicy sauce, it was really delicious and the intestine was cooked perfectly. It didn't taste too pungent and it had the right amount of softness. \n\n-Sizzling rice dish: Delicious. The sauce was sweet and savory, and I loved how it complimented the texture of the crispy rice. One of my favorites from what we ordered.\n\n-Eggplant with garlic sauce: Cooked to perfection! It had the right amount of spice and sweetness and the eggplant was soft with a bit of crisp on the skin.\n\n-Szechuan beef: This was okay. You get A LOT of beef, but it was just all spice and salt and lacked that extra pinch of flavor to take it to the next level.\n\n*Service: It was a little slow because there was only one waiter for the whole restaurant. He was pretty nice and accommodating when he was serving us, but we had to flag him down sometimes. \n\n*Price: Pretty cheap. Around $10-12 for each dish, which is not bad for dinner.\n\n*Ambiance: The restaurant is pretty spacious, however, some of my dishes weren't very clean prior to eating and I had to switch them out. But that's pretty typical of most Chinese restaurants, so it wasn't a big deal. \n\nSo this is one of the few times where I'm just going to have to disagree with the majority on Yelp. The food is great here and they know how to cook most Szechuan dishes just right. \n\n*They also offer free wifi inside!!! What Chinese restaurant does that?

Took the $400ish package which included the chapel, photos, garter, flowers for both, a DVD of the ceremony, a marriage licence holder and possibly other things I can't quite remember.\n\nAt the time slot we had, we were by far the most overdressed couple there which added to the comedy value (in that she had a full wedding dress and me a tux - one guy getting married had a Hawaiian shirt and cut off jeans, his bride was getting drunk outside on Bud Light in a garish mini-skirt). Pastor was cool ($40 tip given since they are not paid by the chapel). Photographs OK (it was rushed, we weren't expecting Anton Corbijn) but nothing that Photoshop can't cure.\n\nAs to cons, the video of the ceremony was awful - it looked like a webcam from the 1990s with quality to match. However, that was probably the only minus point. Note that they get pissed off if you take your own pictures in the chapel. The pastor let us since we were kept waiting a little and the photographer was a bit delayed but they have spy cameras watching what goes on in the building and a swift call from the owner put a stop to our snapping.\n\nOverall - 5 stars.

I was pleasantly surprised by the Orange Tofu.\n\nThe bill totaled $15 per person (with tax and tip). Compared to what I spent at LoS the last time, that's a steal!

However, my niece loves it and it was her birthday, so off we all went to Commercial Center, which is the place to go if you're looking for exotic dining or exotic adult activities. We were thinking about Lotus of Siam, but we had a couple of small kids with us, so we didn't want to jostle with the crowds and picked Komol instead. (The presence of said toddlers also quashed the prospect of sampling any of the other available entertainments, as did the unfortunate way we look naked).\nAnyway, Komol was pretty full when we arrived, but we were seated right away, and the ambience was both attractive and comfortable. Service was a little slow, but I'm not deducting any stars because they were friendly and working their butts off, and we got everything we ordered, which was a lot. We had: Indian chicken curry, pork chili mint, fried shrimp in wonton wrappers, Thai beef salad, beef pad zee euw (sp?), chicken satay, and Thai beef jerky. Everything was delicious; the peanut sauce for the satay and the dipping sauce for the shrimp (plum, maybe?) were outstanding. Wanted to lick all the plates. Maybe I did. Only questionable thing was the jerky, which tasted fine but I found the texture (dried, deep-fried strips of meat) a little off-putting. Maybe because I kept thinking of that movie where the plane crashes in the Andes and the survivors are starving so they figure out a way to make a tasty snack. You get the picture. We can't all be Andrew Zimmern. Anyway, we were stuffed but still ordered a dessert to share- fried bananas with homemade ice cream.  Funny how there's always room for a little something deep fried. The waiter explained that the ice cream was vegan, which immediately set off alarm bells. I don't even want my vegetables vegan - coat those bad boys in cheese sauce, please! But, it looked like a harmelss ball of pineapple sherbet, so I bravely plowed in, or tried to. It was frozen so hard it would have made a better weapon than dessert, but the kids hacked away happily and finished it all, and it kept them so busy they didn't notice their share of the fried bananas disappearing. All this plus drinks was less than $80 before tax & tip. Not bad. Conclusions: Authentic? Who knows? They looked Asian. Delicious? Absolutely!", "type": "review", "business_id": "KwLfgeylp9d8zY3KacREiw"}

Barely.\n\nSo I'll start with the good, as usual. The internet so far (it's only been 3 days) is a pretty good speed. Diablo III lags just a little, but other than that it is pretty good. Not sure about reliability yet because it's only been 3 days and we had an outage in our whole area today. So that remains to be seen...\n\nOne good thing is, I showed up to pick up our modem and got 2 free phones and a cool tote bag.\n\nThe bad. I have literally had to call Cox 8 times so far since beginning service. Count 'em 8! Each and every time I call, I am told something completely different. First the price was different from one day to the next. Then I was told service would be turned on one day, then the next, then it turned out to be the NEXT after that one. Finally, the last 4 calls involved me trying to set up my voicemail which I was told by 3 different people that my package included, then apparently it is not included unless I upgrade for another $20 a month. Completely ridiculous! I literally called once, was told we have voicemail, called again and was told we don't, called again and was told we do, asked for a supervisor and she said no we don't and attempted that upsell.\n\nI cannot describe in words how frustrated I am with \"Cox\" already. They are quickly putting themselves on My List and digging their own grave.\n\nAnd the ugly: I was told we have free local and long distance calls. We just moved here to Vegas a year ago, so our families are across the country. We had been calling them and when I spoke with the supervisor, she informed me it is 18 cents a minute for long distance!!! They did not tell me that!!! So, so, so frustrated. Frustrated isn't even the word. Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious is more like it. But we have no other choice, so we are stuck with \"Cox\" for 6 months.

I was determined not to buy a 1oz tube at that price, specifically because Bath & Body competitively sell 2 oz. hand creams for only $5. \n\nBut then a friend who's been in possession of a shea butter hand cream had me sample some of it and I was impressed with how soft it made my skin. This Christmas, I got mommy the rose hand cream to her delight. Every whiff takes you out into a garden full of blossomed roses. Feels like spring in every breath and I would buy one for myself one day too!\n\nCurrently, they have these wonderful honey scented hand creams in packs of 8 for only $48, 50% down from its original price. If you ask me, I'd say it makes a great gifts for girls and it'd be best to get some now before they run out. Unfortunately, the bundled tubes cannot be bought alone so you will have to stick to lavender, shea butter, rose etc. if you only want to buy one. \n\nWith Crabtree & Evelyn Outlet (L'occitane's London counterpart) quietly marking its territory with great sales not too far away, I would recommend this place by a mile.", "type": "review", "business_id": "tx-bIJoFms2XC8nAHJJ_qA"}

Basically, color me mine is a shop where you pick out pieces of pottery (salt shakers, figurines, plates, mugs, cups, etc..) and they provide you with brushes and the paint to create your own uniquely you piece of artwork. I had never done it before, and I love creative things. So on a 2nd date with someone I went here about a month and a half ago. We both picked out coffee cups and went at it, it was probably one of the funnest dates i'd been on in a long time. The people that work there are there to guide you, but it's really your own creative expression. I used sponges, different types of brushes, and came up with my quasi homey-version of a Monet (think water colored floral) coffee cup. My dates was filed with dinosaurs and toasters and god knows what else lol. After you're done, they seal them and you pick them up about 5 days or a week later. I never got to see my finished product, because the guy I was dating turned into a ska-douche. So I can't really tell you what it looks like all sealed and pretty. I would definitely recommend  it if you want a date night that's a little different. Probably not good for a first or 2nd date because you have to wait a week to get back your items, and i'm the example on why it's a bad idea lol Gee, I can only wonder what it looks like. Haha.

The server came by and gave us menus and seemed polite enough.  I would say the service was good but the server's lack of knowledge was very irritating.                                                                                                                                  First off when we asked the server about anything she had to run back and ask the sushi chef about a roll.  This happened 3 times !!!  I wasn't worried though because I heard they had good sushi...                                                                                                                                    So I ordered the kiss of fire (which is better at sushi loca) and dantes inferno.  The kiss of fire had a good texture and taste, it had the perfect amount of crunch and spice (this is where they get the 2 stars).  The dantes inferno was very blah though and the white fish tasted like it came out of the lake in desert shores.  My girlfriend ordered the chef's special roll, the server didnt know what it was (surprise surprise).  She didn't like it and ate hardly any, oh and it cost 14 dollars.                                                                                                                                     So by this time we were ready to get the hell outta there.  We didn't get a refill on our drinks the whole time and we wanted fountain drinks to go.  The server went to get our drinks but came back with only my girlfriend's iced tea.....sighhhh she claimed she only had one styrofoam cup.

We arrived right before noon and it was still a little quiet, especially for great day like Father's Day.  Dining for us was outside and even though we were in the middle of 100+ degree Vegas weather, we were kept cool with the shade and cool mist. The service was great, staff was attentive, and the ambiance was relaxing.  My GF had a view of the lake, which was the relaxing part. My opinion, I had the best view. \n\nAs for their food, lets start with their menu.  Their menu for brunch was simple and prices are what to expect from a French Restaurant.  Actually, their prices for what you get are pretty good. I got their Steak & Eggs, which is also served with some home fries. The steak was the highlight. I would guess about 6 oz of well seasoned, well prepared, and thinly sliced steak.  Normally steak & eggs come a little dry. Not here, their steak was juicy and delicious.  For my pre-steak meal, I got a cup of their French Onion Soup.  This was delicious as well. It wasn't overly salty and had enough of an onion kick to it. \n\nThis was my first time here and I was impressed with their service and quality of food.  I'm still curious what dinner is like here so I'm going to have to come back.

We call and ask what's on the menu since it changes every so often but we always get crispy pata. Their version is different from what you'll normally see in Filipino restaurants - appearance-wise. Theirs is super puffy. Crispy pata is one of my favorite Filipino dishes. Fried, crispy porky goodness...mmmm...  The dipping sauce is great (soy sauce + vinegar+ jalapeno + onions)...I just gave away the recipe! Great! I'm banned from this place now.\n\nCASH ONLY turo-turo (translation: turo = point). You point at the food you want and that's what they'll give you which is great if you're not super familiar with Filipino dishes. If you point with your lips, they'll love that! There are items such as crispy pata that's made to order.\n\nOther things that are good here are: halo-halo, turon and pork BBQ. They're pretty generous with the stuff they put in their halo-halo (leche flan, ube,  beans, etc). The turon (bananas and jackfruit wrapped in wonton-like wrapper, fried and drizzled with caramelized sugar) is sweet and crispy. Filipino BBQ is totally different from what Americans know as BBQ.  The Filipino BBQ is on a stick and is marinated in soy sauce, calamansi/lemon, sugar and sometimes ketchup.

According to a friend, this place was once so remote that the mob used to stop here for some steaks and drinks after doing, ehem, nefarious things to people in the desert.  Ah Vegas and your local lore!  \n\nEnough about that, on to the food.  We were seated at a four-top in the corner, away from the large windows that face the front yard unfortunately.  The ambiance wasn't as fancy as I expected, kind of more road-house than steak-house - which is A-OK by me. I love places with personality!  I ordered the Fettuccine with Scallops in Chardonnay Cream Sauce as an entree, which was huge and very well done. Overall, I felt the dish could have used a dusting of grated parmesan for some extra ooomph. Two of my dining companions got the Broiled Shrimp - which they both said was super flavorful, taking on the smokey flavors from the open mesquite grill.  The wine list was super reasonable, allowing us to enjoy a full bottle of wine for the table at very little cost.\n\nTake some time to peruse the artifacts that line the glass cases in the entrance and the bar - they have some pretty cool Las Vegas memorabilia.

That is by far the number one thing because that's what I'm eating. The chef washes their hands religiously between different orders and when coming back to the bar from the back- second most important thing.\n\nWhat made it uncomfortable is that I'm sitting at the bar and two inspectors are reaming the sushi chef about this and that. That's just not cool to do in front of customers even if it is a kitchen nightmare. \n\nI almost said something about some points being made. Like somehow they said you cant prepare sushi without gloves and that it is violation. What?! What sushi place, hell, what food kitchen wears gloves?! I don't want fucking glove particles in food and almost no respectable high end chef will agree with that being \"cleaner\". Apparently you have to have a contract with the city for it.....err, that just sounds like some sort of business racket that they probably charge money to obtain. You can \"feel\" the right cut of fish with gloves on.  They got on him about not having a 3 compartment sink. They had two separate small sinks..... etc, etc. \n\nI think the health inspection is a fabulous idea but they get really hung up on the details that are trivial. \n\nI had to leave and stuffed my food in my mouth fast.

We've been in this house for over 3 years now, and we love it.  \n\nI've worked with a lot of real estate managers over the years, from both the rental and from the investor side of the fence.  A lot of the complaints I am reading here honestly have less to do with the management company than the homeowner.  The best you can hope for with a management company is an agent who will return your calls, answer your questions, and ensure that both the renter and the homeowner are both upholding their ends of the agreement.  From my personal experience, Lisa has done just that, and has done it in a friendly and professional manner.  \n\nWhen we have issues, we leave a message for Lisa, and we have never waited more than 24 hours for a return call.  For the most part, any complaint or technical issue with the house is dealt with in an expedient manner, and we don't have to fight with them to get things handled.  \n\nThe only exception to that is with our pool.  There is some problem with the equipment or chemicals or something, and a few times per year, our pool just turns green for no reason.  The pool company can't seem to get it fixed, and blames it on us, we blame it on the pool company, and it goes round and round between them, us, Lisa, and the homeowner as to who is responsible.  \n\nI would highly recommend Southwest Management group and Lisa to anyone, though I would avoid renting any home with them that has a pool.  Their pool company is contracted across all of their properties, and if there is a problem with your equipment, you may be in for the same hassle we have faced multiple times in the years we have been here.", "type": "review", "business_id": "9fJBlslwQgIOGN6YF8vijw"}

It's not because of the service. There was only one time where we received lackluster service...and the place was nearly dead. The host seated my husband and I, and then we sat for 15-20 minutes, watching another couple be seated and have their drink order taken by an attentive server. We try not to be dicks. We're reasonable people. So we kept amused by betting each other if our server was smoking out back or shooting heroin out back. The host finally came by to take our drink order, and then a sheepish & stoned looking waif of a server wandered over to take our dinner order. Your guess is as good as mine whatever he was doing \"out back\".\n\nIf the margaritas weren't so strong, I'd be giving this 1 star. I used to live a ten minute drive from the Mexican border, so I understand the logic of lowering expectations so far north of the border. But I think they could try just a little harder. I like their complimentary chips & salsa, but Frida's guac tastes like it's pre-packaged. The food is ok as long as it's hot, but the flavors aren't memorable. The last time I ate here, I sat in a broken booth with springs poking my rear, which caused me to slouch over toward the wall with the huge mural on it. From this viewing advantage, I was able to notice that this place hasn't been dusted or thoroughly cleaned in ages. There are large cobwebs and a thick layer of fuzzy grime coating the fake plants and the side wall where the broken booths rest against. The mural of Frida has reflective drips where some clearish liquid spattered her face and was never wiped off. Being an artist, it is sad to see Frida Kahlo's face disrespected that way. And if the dining area is this neglected, I'm not too hopeful about the cleanliness of the kitchen. I'd like to add that I'm not one of those people who carries hand sanitizer everywhere or bleaches her kitchen and bathroom, so for me to say something's icky may put it in perspective. Maybe I didn't notice how dirty it was in the past because I was too busy sucking down their yummy margaritas.\n\nHere's the kicker: On my last visit, I was finishing the last of my margarita at the end of our meal when I saw a small roach scurry across the table. It practically fell into my lap, and brought back unpleasant memories of my infested apartment in college. I didn't do the \"girl thing\" and scream or jump out of the booth, but I might be done eating food here. However, I remain open-minded to having margaritas out on the sidewalk when the weather's nice. We'll see.", "type": "review", "business_id": "vOCmoA6cvhlA5bcATzUR0g"}

When we walked inside, we saw a large, bright (still daylight and lots of windows)  retro-lounge bar area.  We sat down and had graciously poured cocktails with our entertaining and very funny bartender (whose name I never got, darn it!).  \n\nAfter imbibing, we checked in with the restaurant host and were seated (5:15 PMish) in a three or four table, dimly lit nook area of the restaurant, separated from other similar areas of the restaurant.  It felt quaint, cozy and a bit romantic in there (see the picture).\n\nAppetizer:  Crab Cakes; two to the order ($12.00).  Though small, they were definitely house made and excellent.\n\nEntree:  TBone Steak ($37.00):  Good sized. Excellent.  Ordered medium rare, the steak came out with a wonderful crispy char and was outstanding in flavor and tenderness.  Our other order was Chicken Oscar ($28.00) which was also outstanding.  String beans instead of potato was good - possibly steamed and tossed in a light butter sauce.  \n\nDinner was preceded by salads that were fresh and crisp.  One of us had the raspberry vinaigrette that was obviously home-made (not bottled, at least).\n\nDinner service was provided by brother team Mike and Tom who provided us with good service.\n\nI definitely recommend this steak house.

It was not inexpensive. It did not refill soda drinks. It had no other customers.  The lady who met us at the front was expecting us to get take out. Why? There were plenty of tables and it was clean. \n\nWe stayed, we ordered Hot Thai Soup, House chicken, House seafood, lemonade, soda and Thai tea with cream. The rice was a very small portion, the seafood was inedible, because the garlic sauce was like mucus and tasted off, not worth $16 for sure!  The chicken was like it had sat on a buffet for hours and I'm not sure what they made the sauce out of, it wasn't to our liking. The soup tasted of mustard not lemongrass and chili or coconut or what you might expect from a Thai hot soup. Thai Rama, Malee's...others have better soup.\n\nI expected a lot better from the reviews. I understand why it's empty now and I'm surprised it's been here so long. It's only because they handled the order fine, service was fine and the place is clean that they got 2 stars. \n\nI would not try them again for food, unless i got really desperate and too lazy to drive farther than their location which is really close to home. I'll probably try the China Buffett down the street before I return to Prime. Very disappointing.", "type": "review", "business_id": "1vYaGPKQzMebBJXFCGTH2g"}

Even though they are closer to my house, I won't go there.   The Banfield on 19th avenue and Bethany: excellent. \nThe reason I say this: One week ago, my dog Bubba ripped a toenail off; it was just hanging by a thread. I called Banfield in PV and this is what i got: \"Is this an emergency? The doctor is really busy\".  I told her \"uhm, there's blood, it's a ripped nail, possibly a broken toe so to me that's an emergency\".  She put me on hold where I sat for more than two minutes before I hung up and we drove to the store on Bethany Home where we were promptly taken in. We were given a fully informed treatment plan suggestion and opportunity to make our own decision because it was going to be expensive.  They took care of Bubba's torn nail, cleaned it up and wrapped the foot.  Three days later we went back for a check and dressing change, same thing. Prompt, courteous treatment, staff is always professional, they got us in and out as quickly as they could.  On Saturday we went back to get the bandage removed. The treatment was the same; prompt, courteous, and getting us in and out as quickly as possible.\n\nFor those who complain about the wait; well, you wait at your doctor, right? It's no different at the vet; we all have stuff to do but an expectation of immediate in-and-out treatment is a pipe dream.\n\nThose folks who think they're getting nickel-and-dimed at the vet need to speak up - use your words and your voice. You aren't being forced to buy these add-ons or pay for this medicine. No one is forcing you to buy it. You are bringing your pet in for treatment because they hurt, they are your family and you love them. Would you complain about the cost of an RX for your child, your spouse, or yourself if it's not on your health care plan? Most of you would answer no because you need it. If you can stand to wait and trust the integrity of the drugs you buy online that are less expensive, then go for it. I trust what my vet gives me more than something that may LOOK like the same thing but may NOT be the same thing. Online pharmacies are a big business; a big phony scam business that robs hardworking people of their money every year and gives them counterfeit drugs made with fillers and often, none of the effective ingredient that makes them work. What you get at the vet is human-quality medicine that can be fully traced back to its source.", "type": "review", "business_id": "vveDGmKGEDPrOgp3ff4QPA"}

Their employees are all no pressure, not pushy or anything. They had a pretty decent selection of guns including tactical, hunting, and pistols of all types. They helped us make a good informed decision, and even let us take a rental of the same gun and shoot it at no charge so we could make sure it was the right gun for us.\n\nBottom line, if you are new to shooting and are not sure how to go about it, or if you are a seasoned veteran and you want a good range to go to, this is the right place to be.", "type": "review", "business_id": "2gjwXySlPkfM53NmWruzsA"}

Their staff is very friendly and it is always fun when they recognize me and welcome my girlfriend and I by name each time.\n\nThey usually have one or two servers, which can be rough during rushes, but its not too bad if you're not rushed or anal about service the way a corporate secret shopper would be at a chain restaurant.\n\nMy favorite dishes there are the Kalbi, Sam Kyup Sal, and Bulkogi.

Some people who aren't used to true asian cuisine with bone-in fish, strong spicy flavors, or bitter Kimchee might be taken off guard by some dishes here, but if you have an open mind and a strong stomach, you'll love it.  My girlfriend usually orders the Bibim Bop or Bulkogi and loves their rice and says its the best she's had at a restaurant that wasn't $100+ for the two of us.  Make sure you come with an appetite!\n\nTheir sushi is excellent.  The flavors are great and fresh and just as good as Ra Sushi without the price gouging.  They don't have as much Flashy presentation as them of course.  Our favorite sushi roll they have is called \"Dirt in Ocean\".  Make sure you try the orange sauce that it comes with.\n\nMy girlfriend loves their Green Tea, iced or hot and I always order a tall Asahi or Sapporo with our meal.

So, when I moved back to Arizona this is the first vet I decided to take my cat to see.\n\nMy cat has IBS and has for years and lately her symptoms have worsened and have been causing her severe pain. The new vet at Larkspur cat clinic saw my cat and he recommended two medications to ease her pain and inflammation.\n\nNow, when he gave me these medications he didn't mention any cautions or side effects. Didn't say to watch out for anything in particular- he just told me that they would help relax and ease the pain. So, I went home and I gave these medications to my cat. Within a couple hours she looked drugged up and out of it. She was acting quite strange and after 2 days she was very constipated and straining to the point that she was crying in pain. \n\nI decided to look up the medications prescribed and every single website I went to (and I went to a bunch) said that both medications are used in dogs- one of the dog medications was commonly administered to dogs in 17-23mg dosages- which my cat's dosage was 43mg (seems a bit high for a 6 pound feline), and the other medication had repeated warnings that it was controversial for cats and I read several times that is should NEVER be used on cats because it can cause constipation and blockages that can lead to disease and death, or something to that effect.\n\nAt this point I called the clinic and I explained my cats odd behavior and the constipation and straining. I also mentioned the medication and told them that I understand if there was a reason that the cat was given this type of medication, but was concerned because I read that there were side effects associated with this drug in cats and my cat was straining a lot and seemed out of it. \n\nThe woman told me the doctor was busy and couldn't take my call. So, I asked if he could please call me back before 4PM that day because I was very concerned about my cat (it was 9 AM when I called), . The woman literally... LITERALLY, snickered out loud, condescendingly, and snorted that the doctor was very busy and she'll 'see'... ~click~\n\nAnyhow, the vet NEVER called. Surprise!\n\nI have found a new vet- that so far has been very good to my cat. They follow up and check in and make sure my cat's symptoms aren't getting worse. I showed the new vet and the nurses the medication that I was given to administer to my cat. They were all shocked. First, one of the medications are these huge capsules- they are people sized. The first comment I heard was, \"I've never seen medication in that format... for a cat\". The other medication I was given were broken pills. Again- everyone was shocked by the format of the medication alone.\n\nThe new vet said she was unfamiliar with using the 2 medications on cats. I could tell she didn't want to say anything negative, so instead she told me to give  her a couple days to research the drugs and she'd let me know whether or not it was safe to give to my cat.\n\nA day and a half later I get a call from her. She says one of the meds is probably ok, but if the cat hasn't gotten better from it- don't give it to her. The other one- she said she didn't feel comfortable with me giving it to the cat and asked me not to. \n\nI will NEVER go back to Larkspur Cat Clinic. From giving me dangerous drugs (it seems like they buy what's on sale and give it out generically even if it's canine medication) that could kill my cat, no warning to the many possible side effects and complications to the dangerous dog medicine prescribed for my cat, then the horrific service- (Who condescendingly laughs at you when you are calling to say that your cat is having a bad reaction to the medication your doctor recently prescribed?) and then the fact that they NEVER called back- not to return my call, not to follow up, not to give further direction. I can't believe I paid $100 for this! They charged me almost $40 for the bad meds as well. \n\nI'm actually filing a complaint with the state board, and I told my family about what happened and we are all switching vets. I don't know what happened to this place, but it's not what it used to be.", "type": "review", "business_id": "htusuQG21aC1H_5wYeTNjg"}

Last night this location was just okay. Upon walking in there was an extremely loud country song playing (to the point of not being able to talk over each other) and it turns out the employees were doing a line dance in the middle of the restaurant. I do know that Texas Roadhouse employees do participate in various line dances throughout the night but this location is particularly \"enthusiastic\" about it. Maybe Saturday nights are country nights? Not sure? But quite obnoxious if you are not into that type of thing.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 and I were seated in a very small two person table in the back corner of the restaurant next to a party of at least twelve. Our waitress did come over right away and greet us and our drink orders were promptly served. We did find a mystery substance on one of the rolls we were served which was somewhat branch like, maybe a stem of some kind. We ate the other rolls in the basket which were still good and warm. Service was good despite being right next to a very large party. The noise level was quite ridiculous. I also a had a three to four year old child directly behind my seat who was in the most shrill way possible screaming in my ear throughout our dining experience. Yay great way to spend the evening. The Texas Roadhouse birthday announcement was done a total of four times while we there (lots of birthdays last night I guess). It is tolerable maybe once but NOT four times. It goes a little like this - ATTENTION TEXAS ROADHOUSE IT IS (insert name here) BIRTHDAY TONIGHT AND THEY ARE TURNING (insert age here) CAN I GET EVERYONE IN THE PLACE TO GIVE A BIG YEEEEEHAAAAAW!! The party next to us was particularly intoxicated and just about blew my ear drums out with every yeehaw given. After 4 of these I was going a little insane. I needed a shot of vodka stat.\n\nThe food was okay. Not bad. The steak that I had was good. Cooked just right and tender. My salad was meh and my fianc\u00e9's ribs were a little dry. I have had better Texas Roadhouse experiences in the past. This location is particularly lively.

It might not be as long as some others who have reviewed this restaurant but I think it is enough to say I have eaten here a few times before.\n\nThe first thing I started eating was very simple, pizza and wings.  It really is a great combo and I have never been disappointed.  Cheese to the works will surely satisfy.  My wife likes getting sausage and mushroom while I am just fine with a pepperoni topping.  I have to say whatever we get I really don't mind because it will be good.  The wings are just as good as the pizza.  They are well cooked, the sauces are graded just right between the desired flavor and heat and just like the pizza they have never disappointed.  Don't question if you should get them, just how many.\n\nAfter a few years of pizza and wings I looked up one day while at the counter and noticed they had a menu!  On that menu is everything you can think of in a pizzeria style restaurant.  Subs, salads, calzones, fried cheese sticks, and the list goes on.  I will only touch on a couple of items.  The next thing I really was addicted to was the steak and cheese.  I started eating them with mushrooms and peppers but over time I ended eating them with just the steak and cheese.  Hot, delicious steak, perfectly melted cheese all stuffed into wonderful bread which is then toasted at the end.  Just thinking about it makes my mouth water.  I also have been known to get a calzone from time to time.  I have had them all and each is about the size of a couch cushion.  I have never been able to finish one in a single sitting but the flavor really tempts you to try.  No bother; take it home and finish it when your appetite returns.  Reheating is a sin but not taking the rest home to finish it is a bigger sin.\n\nI would be remiss if I didn't talk about the family that runs the restaurant.  Having gone here for over 15 years I have grown with them almost.  I have literally seen their children grow up and now a few of them can be seen behind the counter giving you the same great service I have known all this time.  Those who go enough know that you get a little extra conversation when you walk through the doors.  I try and understand everything they say but I rarely get everything between the thick accents.\n\nOverall a great place to go get your meal.  Lunch or dinner, alone or with the family, you will get great food.  I have a warning though; you may not want to go to Pizza by Napoli if you live far away.  I moved away and now have to drive 20 miles to get my old favorite.  Small price to pay.", "type": "review", "business_id": "5ErKAS0rHOfU33CYjDh2Aw"}

So, I went to the front of the line and paid.  I told the register girl what I had ordered, and she wasn't sure what I was talking about, so I had to point to the menu to show her what I ordered.\n\nThe bagel itself was tasty, but was a bit heavy on the cream cheese.

Although the shopping after too many $2.50 Ladies Margarita's didn't, but that's a story for another day.\n\nI went to Happy Hour at Kona yesterday for the first time in awhile, and oddly enough, it was with some of my old college buddies.  We were excited for cheap food and drinks, because even though we aren't in college anymore, we still love cheap eats!\n\nIt was a bit cold and rainy yesterday, so we were able to easily find a table on the patio (HH is only available on the patio and bar....so getting a seat sometimes turns into a stakeout!). We were a bit disappointed to see that the HH menu was a bit different than before; instead of just all the sushi and apps and pizzas being half price, they were bunched into groups by price.  Some of the prices were still half off, but others, like the Edamame ($4.00 regularly and $3.00 during HH) were not that great of a deal.  Being that it we were quite hungry, we ordered some sushi, edamame, calamari, chicken tacos, avocado egg rolls and the potstickers.  All of the food was much like we remembered, with the calamari being our overwhelming favorite, so crispy with the spicy sauce, yum!  We were a bit disappointed to see that the tacos no longer came with the yummy fried rice like they used to, but it wasn't the end of the world.  The sushi was good, but not the best I have ever had, but fresh nonetheless.  The biggest bummer about the sushi was that most of the rolls that we wanted weren't on the HH menu, especially since they were only $6.00 to begin with the HH sushi rolls were all $3.00....didn't make sense to us.\n\nI know I will go back to Kona, but only during happy hour, I don't love it enough to pay full price!", "type": "review", "business_id": "fK7ujDbjhRFEe2D7eIwK4w"}

I have lived in Scottsdale 25 years now, and have been to the Sugar Bowl many times.  I love the nostalgia of an ol' fashioned ice cream parlor; it reminds me of my childhood and eating hot fudge sundaes at the dairy parlor in Wisconsin.  I love the Bil Keane Family Circus caricatures hanging on the walls.  BUT... my visit to the Sugar Bowl on Tuesday, May 26th, with WI relatives, may be my last.\n\nFirst of all, the prices on just about every food item are outrageous, considering this is not a fancy place by any means.  $10.95 for a lunch size chef salad?  $8 for a small egg salad sandwich on wonderbread?  Oh, the sandwich does come with stale potato chips, too.  \n\nSecond of all, the service was lousy.  Our waitress, who had \"1968\" displayed under her name on her name tag, certainly did not display the wealth of superior customer service one would expect from someone with 41 years of waitressing experience... just the contrary.   No warm welcome to the Sugar Bowl, no friendly smile, just a stern \"what do you want?\" to take our orders.  After waiting 20 minutes for our food, she came back to our table and announced \"Sorry, but the printer in the kitchen ran out of paper, so I need to retake your order\".  Okay, after repeating our orders, thinking that maybe our lunch would be \"on the house\" (or, at least, getting some sort of compensation), she just walked away without a word.  My lunch companions thought this was so odd (again, where's the awesome customer service one would expect from an establishment that should pride itself as being the highlight of the West's most western town???).  So, when she came back to our table to deliver a shake that my niece ordered, I piped up and asked \"So, do we get free ice cream sundaes for having to wait so long?\".  To our surprise, she said \"No.\".  After seeing our surprised looks, she suddenly changed her mind and said \"Well, you can get that shake free.\".\n\nOkay, so we got something free out of the deal, but we all were extremely disappointed and bewildered.  Why?  Because we had to ask.   Doesn't a waitress with 41 years experience have any clout with the management to be empowered to offer compensation to a customer in order to promote great customer service (and ensure that the customer comes back as a repeat customer)?\n\nThe Sugar Bowl used to be a fun, inviting place to have an inexpensive lunch and enjoy a sweet dessert.  Now, it seems to be going downhill... fast.  I noticed that other, recent reviews have noted the same thing, and not many \"stars\".", "type": "review", "business_id": "Snp5LyDO9NeQiuFPOlkavw"}

It's a moderately sizable place for a specialty bookstore, and though it carries a decent load of mainstream fiction, its walls are packed, for the most part, with the colorful spines of crime novels.\n\nThe selection is impressive, both well-curated and comprehensive.  The Poisoned Pen has a whole wall of shelves devoted to signed first editions.  As you might expect, older first editions go for more than cover price, but the new ones are not marked up, as far as I could tell.  It's a testament to the draw of the Poisoned Pen that so many authors come by and leave their traces behind.\n\nThe people behind the Poisoned Pen are very dedicated - there's even a Poisoned Pen Press, with a whole wall of the bookstore devoted to those releases.  The place is almost as much of an event space as it is a bookstore, with 250 readings a year.  Not all of the authors are big names, but many are.\n\nI don't live in Phoenix, but my fiance and I stopped by with our dog on our way home from Sedona.  It was a great stop.  I spent a long time scanning the titles, and left with novels by Denise Mina and Tana French.  While we were there, the bookstore was setting up for one of its many readings, and the author's books were prominently displayed for anyone interested.  I hadn't heard of the author, but a small group was already gathering in anticipation of the event quite a while before it started.\n\nThe staff was very pleasant.  They were friendly and welcoming, of both us and our dog.  I talked to Pat while I was checking out, and he seemed like a great guy and an enthusiastic mystery fan.\n\nI live in Los Angeles, so the Poisoned Pen isn't quite in my neighborhood.

It is out of this world!  Yes they sell the pieces in wedges!  You see now why I had to leave the store.\nI recall, in the past, asking them to get certain Dutch products (yes, they also carry a fine collection of cookies, drop (licorice)' candies, mints, beleg (stuff to put on your bread, like sprinkles) and, if I recall, they always were able to accommodate.  \nI am sure the Japanese, Vietnamese, Filipino, Chinese, Cambodian, etc experiences are similar to my Dutch & Indonesian ones......SIGH :)\nThey also have an online store, which I don't use, because I'm about 15 miles from the store.  \nThey have always been nice and polite to me, but they do not bother you if you are just browsing around.  If you need help or advice, you need to ask.\nThe only thing I can't figure out about this great secret of Scottsdale, AZ is why they are not on the search of the GPS.  They've been at this location forever so it's a mystery to me.\nLOVE this place!  Their prices are VERY fair, remember most things are imported!\n\nI would classify this store as an Asian Market/Grocery that also has Dutch items.\n\nENJOY!", "type": "review", "business_id": "P1CDEhEQZz5bK-sSqkRD0g"}

We arrived at the renowned steakhouse-come-baseball hall of fame just in time for the dinner dress code - a loosely-enforced business casual stipulation, with the small-print addition: \"No tank tops.\" Period. I garnered a low-grade stink-eye from the seemingly incessant gaggle of hostesses, dressed down in a sundress and sandals, but found pleasantly that I would not be asked to leave the premises, and also that we did not need pre-existing reservations on a Saturday night.\n\nOnce seated in the lounge, alongside an impressive, signature-laden wall of baseball greats (the likes of whom we'd never heard), we were deftly presented with two tall, dewy glasses of fresh water, and a light liver-and-onion pate with a delightful carrot-and-pickle garnish. Our waitress was an absolute angel, down to the very second we admitted we had come here to experience the pinnacle of Don and Charlie's burger selection. While we exchanged looks in secret that belied a clear distrust for any place that serves $11 hamburgers, we were duly shocked at the quality and portioning of Don and Charlie's legendary staple.\n\nThe burgers were thick and cooked to perfection, slightly charred at the edges for a full and smoky flavor, served up with a heap of crisp shoestring potato fries. Sandwich accoutrements are cleverly served on the side at Don and Charlie's, and are in no short supply - our already hulking plates were crowded to the rim with leaves of ripe green lettuce, thinly-sliced red onion, and mouthwatering tomato. At the waitress' recommendation, we split an order of Don and Charlie's famous macaroni and cheese, a baked pasta dish layered thick with sharp, grated cheese and a complimentary hint of celery salt.  \n\nEpic hamburgers are just one shining facet of Don and Charlie's fame; aside from boasting one of the largest collections of baseball memorabilia \"this side of the Mississippi,\" the steakhouse favorite also specializes in barbecued chicken and ribs - a divine accompaniment to any dinner plan. The BBQ Chicken Sandwich - like its burger counterpart - is a plump slab of savory smoked chicken barely contained by a cracked-wheat bun, and delivered with extra helpings of their tangy, signature barbecue sauce, which exponentially improves the already memorable flavor of most entrees and sides. All sandwiches are partnered with a mandatory bowl of coleslaw, a helping so large it may as well be its own serving of soup du jour. Soupy this side dish is not, however - served thick and chilled, this coleslaw's only drawback is that it may prove too onion-y for more sensitive palettes.\n\nIf you can get past the standoffish hostess corral without feeling too terribly self-conscious, you're in for a spectacular treat. Despite its reputation as a sports bar, there is nothing pub-ish about Don and Charlie's - even the lounge tables are draped with heavy white linens and accented with soft, muted lighting - and the service is efficient and likable. Our lovely server made us feel right at home by divulging, upon our request, her guilty pleasures from the menu. The wait-staff seemed intimately familiar with each dish, and answered all of our unvoiced questions earnestly. At no point were we neglected - even during the dinnertime rush, one can expect the utmost courtesy and attentiveness from the hard-working servers, who make presentation seem effortless. No greasy hangover food here - just quality barbecue and burgers, and an attentive staff.", "type": "review", "business_id": "bc-lE-wGVAsUrX-kJhtY-Q"}

This is a baller-on-a-budget nightmare!\n\nIf the taste even came close to matching the price, it would have been decent. But the pizza was lacking in all things flavor and texture. I ordered a personal White and Garlic with chicken. The crust was so thin, it was super crunchy for my liking. The cheese they use was really rubber, no stringy cheese. The chicken didn't really have any extra flavor, it did not seem processed, which was a nice added touch. The others made their own personal sized pizzas, but no one  was impressed.\n\nThe size of a personal is huge, if I remember correctly its about 6 huge slices...which most other places that would be a small pizza. So, for portion size they get a high five, but a huge pizza with uninspiring taste didn't bode well with us.\n\nFinally able to try a cannoli, I ordered one for the table. Since I was devirginizing myself to this delicacy, I can't really comment too much on this. The Ricotta filling was good, the little chocolate chips were an added treat...but the pastry part was so hard, I could barely eat it with my fork. Like I said, I have no idea how this is supposed to look like, but it was too crunchy for my bones. I'll try it somewhere else, but I'm still on the fence.\n\nThe only reason I can see going here EVER, is the possibility of a Giants sighting. While we were there Jeremy Afeldt came in for lunch with a group, not my choice of sighting, but a Giant nonetheless :)\n\nI heard B. Wilson goes to Oregano's (Pizza Bistro)...just sayin'...", "type": "review", "business_id": "dcd3C1gWv-vVdQ9XYV8Ubw"}

Elements just doesn't match up.\n\nI made a reservation to celebrate my partner's 50th birthday based on reviews I had read on Yelp.  At the time of the reservation I mentioned the birthday event and partner's name to see what Elements would do. . . the answer was zero... no problem, but just one of the many places Elements misses the mark.\n\nWe arrived early and enjoyed cocktails in the Jade bar (even OK that they delivered the wrong drink).  At our scheduled time we moved to the dining room to be told that they were running late and would get a table as soon as possible.  I know this happens occasionally.  When I made the reservation I realized that there were some Primo tables that everybody raves about and I am of the belief that it is either the luck of the draw or being pushy and assertive that determines seating (silly me I thought a 50th could influence).  While we would have been comfortable almost anywhere, we where shown to what has to be the worst table in the room.  The table is at the back of the dining room situated between the two doors that servers use for kitchen access.  In the 3 minutes we were at the table there was a constant parade of servers on both sides of our table.  The fact that this table exists speaks loudly about the priorities of this establishment.\n\nOur second table was Primo and we thought that we were on to a great dining experience.  The wait staff is cold and at times near rude.  There was nothing about any of the staff that was welcoming (including the bar, host, and servers).  After starters I went to use the toilet and when returned found my dinner on the table, not terrible but to me another faux pas that should not have happened.  We were each given 2 pieces of bread and when the plate was empty it was removed... it would have been nice to have been asked if we would have like more.\n\nThe food itself ranged from very good to OK.  Lobster red pepper bisque was good, though lukewarm; pork appetizer was the best dish.  My duck breast main was tough and did not have any noticeable flavor added, just duck.\n\nWe did enjoy the chocolate dessert.  When we requested the check it was dropped so quickly (no thank you for dining, I hope you enjoyed your evening!) and the waitress gone, that I did not get to hand her my in the ready credit card.\n\nI was all set to really enjoy Elements based on the reviews... but they seem to be quite busy, so I am sure that will not miss my lack of return visits.", "type": "review", "business_id": "2OY8xs4aqOt8eTnYokdrww"}

After hearing many good things about it, decided it was finally time to try it.  Sat at the sushi bar with Giro...who was awesome, friendly, and always willing to offer his suggestions on what was best that night.  I'm such a snob when it comes to sushi, if its not the freshest fish possible, I don't like it.  Toyama by far has some of the freshest and highest quality fish I've had in AZ.  I used to live in LA and got spoiled by the surplus of fresh fish.....Toyama reminded me of the fish I could only get in CA.\n\nWe had:\n-Sake (Salmon nigiri)\n-Tai (Red Snapper nigiri)\n-Albacore nigiri\n-Tobiko nigiri w/ Quail Egg\n-White Fish Carpaccio\n-Scallops Dynamite\n-Negihama Roll (Yellowtail w/ Scallions)\n-Crazy Unagi Roll\n\nWithout getting too detailed, I can just safely say every item we had was outstanding.  The nigiri melted in your mouth...the Tai was easily the best I've ever tasted, along with the Salmon.  Something as common as salmon, you would think ok...big deal, but no....it was amazing here.  Another semi-common dish, the Scallops Dynamite, was so incredible we ordered a second round after eating the first.  Huge chunks of fresh scallops, mixed in with mushrooms, baked in a Japanese mayo sauce (which they make in house).  The sauce that results after baking is so good I could drink it through a straw!  Another recommendation....get some chopped wasabi along with your sushi....its delicious bits of real Japanese wasabi that have been pickled.  So good I end up eating all of it by itself.\n\nAs far as pricing...in my opinion Toyama is a steal.  I've had more expensive meals at places like Sushi Brokers, with crappy fish to boot.  For the quality of fish and care taken in preparation...Toyama's prices really are reasonable and worth every penny.

Just went to get a small horchata and a large and the guy end up giving me 2 large which isn't a big deal but then before I took off I noticed one was purple so I went back literally seconds later pretty much went around the restaurant still in there parking lot and the guy was like \"what do you want\"(really man) and I said \"hey man I asked for 2 horchatas and he went on the offense and said \"NO YOU SAID 1 HORCHATA AND 1 JAMAICA LOOK AT YOUR RECEIPT\". then I went um no 1st I asked for 1 large and 1 small and you end giving me two large with no receipt which I dont mind but you didn't give two horchatas and then he went on by okay but I need to charge you and I said wth why i didn't ask for that order then he was like fine pull up and he end giving me my drink but with the craziest altitude. I was more shocked then mad like wtf man it was the easiest order ever and I didn't snap at him or get mad. Idk why he was so mad", "type": "review", "business_id": "h7hr0v3E1ulU2sXNItD5UQ"}

Nearly every 'wrench' I've met there since Day 1 has given me the personal experience I had been searching for since a friend closed his shop before I moved away. Admittedly, I'm one of those people fanatic enough about bikes that I would share my bed with one, and also currently have one of my most prized custom cruisers hanging on my wall as a mechanical piece of art (which I do pull down to ride frequently)...and while I'm a very passionate bike owner, I am a horrible mechanic - hence my need for Rage. So when your garage, shed, and living room are filled with bikes ranging from grocery-getter cruisers, custom built/painted top to bottom rigs, downhill mountain and high end top dollar \"all mountain\" bikes, AND you know from first hand experience that working on them yourself is the worst possible idea, you need a shop like Rage that is filled with guys that not only know their shit, but share that same passion. I would 100% lay it on the line to vouch for every single person who works there to give you the bike shop experience you need...even if you're buying your first ever bike.

Pumpkin Porter: we loved it so much, we purchased a growler so we could take some home! Note: there is an extra charge for filling up a growler with a seasonal brew. $4 for the growler itself, $10 for beer, and $5 seasonal charge. Normal refills of growlers are $10.\n\nI am a beer lover. I have spent time living in Munich and drinking some of the best beers in the world. You can't go wrong with Four Peaks brews.

For $32 per person, we got Eggs Benedict, whose English muffin couldn't be cut with a standard knife (trust me, I tried, and I worked at it so hard I almost knocked the table over), undercooked but okay prime rib (should have had an option for cuts that were cooked more and less fatty - looked like a quality starter cut to begin with).

The salmon enchiladas were the only saving grace on the buffet spread; even the turkey pot pie raised eyebrows since it didn't even have a pie crust?\n\nNot the worst breakfast I've ever had, but for $32? I could have gone to Caffe Boa or Golden Corral (seriously, that disappointed with Four Peaks) or somewhere with much better food for cheaper! Now, if there were the option to choose something other than the \"Mother's Day Brunch\" for 32 bucks a pop, then I could at least say this was my fault, but we were told that was the only option (though later, before 2pm when brunch was supposed to end, I saw \"regular\" food on other tables). \n\nThe mimosas were okay, but small and difficult to mess up anyway.\n\nThe highlight of breakfast was the baked goods - From Chompies.

Fast, friendly service and lots of good vibes in the air.

I got half with the peanut Thai sauce and the other with the hot buffalo sauce and blue cheese dressing. And since I hate celery, got a double helping of carrots. I was not a fan of the Thai sauce at first. But once I went back to it, I loved it. I especially loved rolling the carrots in the Thai sauce. Don't know why. I just did. And the blue cheese dressing had to be homemade. Lots of blue cheese in there and nice and rich. \n\nAnd it all went with the beer sooooo well. And man, that beer was perfectly chilled and so damn fresh I felt as if the beer meister (is that the word?) just got through brewing it up. \n\nOn the menu were about 10 or 12 types of beer but since it was hot and I wanted wings, I wanted a blonde ale. It went perfectly with the wings. \n\nOne more thing. I would prefer a little more sauce on those wings but I'm sure I could have asked for some.

After moving to Phoenix this summer, we went for a second time after an initial visit 3 years ago. It was better than I remembered: large, flavorful, juicy steaks, fresh, generous-sized salads, incredible onion rings for an appetizer, and your normal baked potatoes, plus soft drinks. \n\nHis top sirloin steak was 12 oz, mine was 8 oz, both ordered \"medium.\" Mine was perfect, his was just a tad on the rare side, but both were melt-in-your mouth and, in my opinion, better than what we usually get at Outback. I'm always critical of steak that you can't chew and swallow - the kind where you inevitably have to leave little unchewable pieces on your plate. Not so at Monti's. These steaks were memorably tender and yummy.\n\nTotal price with tax for a large plate of huge onion rings, two steaks with two sides, and two soft drinks was $51. Not a bargain, but very reasonable.\n\nAs for atmosphere, it's a large restaurant but very segmented into smaller rooms (it's a very old, historic residence from the 1800s), so we had a table in the back that was quite private, although we could see other diners. It felt intimate, which is what we wanted. Noise level was low - we could hear other diners too, along with the country music playing over the speakers, but we had no problem at all hearing each other, like it is in some places.\n\nService was excellent. Our waiter was absolutely great because he came to check on us but never interfered.\n\nThe only thing lacking was a candle on the table or any acknowledgment of our special occasion. We told them we were there to celebrate our anniversary, and how hard could it be to put a single flower or a candle on the table, or comp us a dessert? They never said a word except to say yes, we know it's your anniversary so we gave you a special table. Other than the semi-private location, there wasn't anything special about the table. A little something extra would certainly encourage us to return to Monti's for other special occasions.\n\nBut for a great steak dinner, in my opinion, Monti's was just right.", "type": "review", "business_id": "vAOTGsBMJp2ebRCJ6Ny7NQ"}

Awesome)\n-The staff is pretty cool\n-You almost never need a tee time, you can show up and they will usually fit you in no problem\n-No dress code (a huge plus while playing in the summer)\n-A pretty forgiving course, wider fairways\n-Cheap hotdogs in the snack area and they pump the AC pretty cold in the lounge\n-No doglegs on the course (I fucking hate those)\n-They don't seem to give a shit when you smuggle your own beer on the course\n-No punk kid cleaning your clubs 2 seconds after you are done playing so you feel obligated to give him a tip\n\nThe Con's:\n-A good portion of the grass is fucked up.  I've dinged the piss out of my clubs having to hit from the dirt on this course\n-The greens are in bad shape.

It always makes me feel better knowing Satan is watching how shitty I am playing\n-No bathroom on the course except for the port-o-shitter half way through the course.  It usually has so much urine on the floor and walls you are better off pissing in the bushes or out of the cart when you are driving it.  I was there one time where someone actually shit on the floor of the fiberglass shit house\n-There seem to be a lot of homeless people between holes 7 and 8 asking for change and/or beers set up by the dumpster next to the golf course \n-There are a bunch of cats that run out of the brush in the wash.  I almost hit one with a chip shot the last time I played there. \n\nAll things considered, this is a good course to play and have fun at.  Plus you can't beat the price.

I wanted to get my face waxed, and having moved into this neighborhood two weeks ago, I was in search for a decent, budget waxing place. When I went in, I was quite surprised to see a man doing manicure. I'm sure men do it in salons, just that I'd never seen a man do that before. He doubled as the receptionist, and asked me (without taking off the mask he had on his mouth) what I wanted done. I was a teeny bit embarrassed telling a man about my waxing needs. But I guess that's America for me :) He asked me to wait for 2 minutes. \nAfter exactly that much time, a lady came up to me and took me to a small room behind the main manicure/ pedicure area. The room had a narrow bed, and a tiny mirror, and looked very dilapidated. There was no place to keep my bags, so I just set them down on the floor. The waxing experience was good, though. The lady worked fast, and did a good job. Just that I was totally put off by her attitude. The first thing she asked me was how I found the place. Fine. The next question was if I have any kids??!! What on earth! And then she asked me how old I am. I was annoyed by the personal questions. And after that she didn't talk at all. I tried asking her if she knew of a good hair salon nearby, but she flatly (and a tad sourly) said no. As the name suggests, the place is more of a nail bar. But $20 for face waxing is not bad, and since it's so near my house, I think I will just suck it up and go back.", "type": "review", "business_id": "JXZiWJiiUM1J8GBUkEGp3g"}

After reading horrid reviews on their scorpion infestation, I still decided to move in. Luckily I have not had any sitings yet.\n\nBut my review is not about that:\nIt is absolutely disgusting how the pool grounds are cared for at the third pool. \nLast night I went to go grill down at the third pool as was greeted by tons of bird droppings along with the pigeons hiding in the rafters of the gazebo.  Not only was that the problem but there was no light on the grill so u can't see anything. I basically left there feeling things crawl all over me. \n\nI decided to go check out the second pool which oddly enough was much better although still dirty. Grilled there and that was that but my point is all the pool areas should be kept up the same. We all pay the same amount of money whether we live by the nice main pool or by the disgusting third pool. \n\nAlso, The fact I have to hangout with cockroaches if I want to use the Jacuzzi at night is disgusting!\n\nThis is a serious health issue with the bird droppings around place where people eat. \nPigeon problem needs to be handled, and grounds sprayed down of their droppings.\n\nUpdate: I've lived here a month and my car just just broken into! How about investing in some cameras and way more lights for the dark grounds. How can I feel safe here?!?! Is it really that much to put two cameras up in your three parking areas?!?! It's about the safety of your residents. I mean you have cameras in the  front office to protect your things, what about the people who are making you money?! I doubt the management company knows what's going on. And if they do, them shame on them!\n**********************************************************************************************\nWell, Its times to move out! Thank goodness! Overall, It wasn't that bad except for the scorpion issue! That was no fun! Talk about not feeling safe in your own house! Over the entire summer I found about 20 scorpions, they sprayed in the house and outside every week and we still had them in the bathroom and next to the fireplace. basically there's no solving this issue. Apparently it is hit or miss when it comes to apartments being infested with scorpions. So good luck!\n\nHowever, for this place to not be accepting section 8 was a surprise as the amount of low life people that live here is amazing. I've had to call the police about 5 times to complain about the people who live below us...not just right below us either. I'm talking the entire bottom floor! and not kids, grown ass adults yelling and screaming in the hallways at all hours of the night.\n\nThe office does nothing. I suppose there's nothing really they can do but come on!\n\nEverything I stated above is still accurate which is sad. you'd think they'd clean up the grounds. \nNow added to all this I had leaks in my ceiling that were never fixed correctly and I am pretty sure they don't plan to. All I got to say is someone needs to come look at the condition of the buildings at the end of the complex! I didn't even want to have a fire in my fireplace in fear that a fire might start since i'm not sure of the condition of the roof (seeing as how it's leaking). Maybe that's me being dumb but shoot, that's the last thing I want to happen. I'll update you all on the move out process...\n\nThe only thing good is Sara at the front desk! She's the best person and she should be the manager since the real one doesn't do her job very well.", "type": "review", "business_id": "_vUMcRUYV53PW4Ckd9MmAg"}

Long ago, I think Wong's was owned by, run by and the cooks were all Chinese.\n\nWe haven't been to Wong's in years and now I realize why.  The owner is still Chinese, but the servers/waiters and cooks are all Mexican.  The food didn't taste too bad, and was okay, but on the level of Panda Express.  We like Panda Express, but the food was pricey for being on the level of Panda Express.\n\nThe Mexicans that served us were nice.  Nothing wrong with their service and they did everything they could to accommodate us.  We went with my mom who generously treated us.  But, my mom is very discriminatory and you could see the sour look on her Chinese face as she really didn't want to eat Chinese food made by Mexicans.\n\nMy Colombian husband (I asked him) asked the waiter who was cooking the food in Spanish.  The guy said Mexicans.  That greatly displeased my mom and nothing could make her happy.  Throughout the time, she made all sorts of rude comments to no fault of the Mexican waiters/servers.  Even though they said they were taught how to properly cook the food, it still didn't taste authentic enough.  \n\nHowever, if you like more Americanized Chinese food, the food is perfectly fine.  I do think that $7.75 for 6 potstickers is a bit on the pricey side, though.  Most of the dishes were starting at $8 going up, which I think is a little pricey for not authentic Chinese.\n\nThe menu said Sea Bass is seasonal, but it is not a seasonal fish, so I'm not sure what that meant, other than we can charge you whatever we feel like.\n\nThe only part of service that wasn't too good was the Chinese owner.  He never smiled or acknowledged us until my mom went to pay.  He did say thank you to her, but he never looked at her in the eyes.\n\nMy mom commented that if you want authentic Chinese, it must be made my Chinese cooks.  If you want really good Mexican food, you want Mexicans who know what they're doing cooking your food.  I don't know, maybe that's old school and I don't know that I totally agree with that, but authentic Chinese doesn't taste like Panda Express.\n\nAnyway, my mom complained throughout dinner, nitpicking.  The food was alright.  Nothing great, nothing bad.  Service was good.  \n\nSo, if you have an old schooled Chinese mom or dad, you really don't want to take them to this place.  If you have some white friends who have not a clue authentic Chinese, this might be okay.  However, I think the owner should greet his customers instead of looking at them with disdane.\n\nSometimes Asians can be quite difficult to please.  My mom would probably give a 1 star, but I'm feeling generous tonight.", "type": "review", "business_id": "pSiR8m18iick2D7TFdmb-Q"}

Lastly, if both seem fine, then they suggested we have the lines cleared out because maybe there are debris causing the pump/cleaner to not suck enough water to move it about.\n\nDid what he said, checked everything, and everything seemed fine.

The tamale was an extremely thick coating of masa with very dry meat.  I had to use the salsa to moisten it.  My husband's chimichanga was the same overly dry meat.  The guacomale is not homemade, but the type you can purchase in quantity at Sam's or Costco.  It was a thick, ultra creamy blob.  \nIt's too bad that in Old Town Avondale where one should find really good Mexican food, you are getting this stuff.", "type": "review", "business_id": "HUR7B6X_f_V_50w4pfoyyQ"}

Well, this is my Grandma's hair salon and she has a weekly appointment here. If I am in town when she has her appointment, I take her. I think I have taken her here 3 times now (twice this year) and have seen her hair after an appointment more times than I can count. They do \"old lady hair\" and they do it just fine for a reasonable price. Her beautician is very nice and low key.\n\nThe real reason I wanted to write a review for this place is that in late July, the appointment my Grandma had here saved her life. How? Well, there were two retired nurses getting their hair done at the same time and they noticed a wound on my Grandmother's ankle. My Grandma had a biopsy taken earlier in the week on a possible skin cancer and sure enough, it turned out to become infected with MRSA and landed her in the hospital for a week and in a rehabilitation center for 3 more. \n\nOld lady hair do's or not, my Grandma is treated right here and at 88, here is where she will be every Saturday at 1pm.", "type": "review", "business_id": "9cJK2ZmiZ1rqqWROh-yQtw"}

Just to get our two side salads took 25 minutes from when we got there and we were the only ones waiting to order.

So, when we read on Las Vegas Weekly's site about the revamped menu, we decided to try it for Valentine's Day.  We were not disappointed.  Prior to going, I confirmed they were not having a special V Day menu that you HAD to order off of.  We've not had good experiences with that in the past.  So, although they had a special, you also had run of the whole menu.  I'm glad we did.\n\nTo start, I had crabcakes and the wife had shrimp cocktail.  Hers was a solid version of this classic dish.  Great horseradish flavor on the sauce, and the large shrimp were not overcooked.  My cakes were very good, 2 for $9.  Not as large as others, but a very good value.  The sauce was a little too citrusy for me, so I didn't have a lot of it.  They are served with shoestring potatoes on top, which was a nice touch I hadn't seen before.\n\nWith your entree, you get a soup or salad.  Crazy in this day where everyone is a la carte all the time.  I had the caesar, which was fine.  The wife had the dinner salad, with a good blue cheese dressing.  \n\nFor our meals, I had the garlic and cilantro marinated ribeye.  For $30, I don't know that you can find a better steak in town.  It was fantastic.  Better than some ribeyes I've paid twice  as much for at big time places on the strip.  Perfectly cooked, good char, and the flavors were fantastic.  I'm not a huge fan of cilantro, so I was skeptical, but it worked perfectly and didn't overpower the dish.  The wife had filet and lobster.  Good size lobster tail, moist and not dry (which can occur with overgrilling).  The filet was cooked to a textbook rare.  For sides, we had mac n cheese and creamed corn.  These are steals for only $3 each.  Both could have used more crisping time under the broiler.  The corn had peppers in it that enchanced the flavor.  Both were repeats.\n\nThe worst part of the meal was the bread pudding.  It was a miss for us, not hot enough and it felt like it wasn't heated all the way through.  The sauce was bland as well, the dish lacked a lot.  But, everything else was fantastic.  It's a definite repeat, and a great way to have a great steakhouse experience without the price tag you'll pay on the strip.\n\nService was excellent.  She was there exactly when we needed her, and did not bother us or try to upsell.  Corkage fee only $15, a very good price.", "type": "review", "business_id": "ErTR62P1wNPelAbHkr_9cw"}

Bright, cheery, easy on and off cab service, usually quick and efficient security lines, FREE wifi, quick tram to baggage area, and super easy to get to as it is right in the city. Yes, you can make a quick escape with your big winnings, or make a break for it with your last few dollars.\n\nAt least this airport has a sense of humor, as seen by the check in videos at security while waiting on line. Star Trek charactors, Impersonators, Magicians, and others try to get through security with all types of mishaps. It's one last shot of entertainment before getting on that long flight home.\n\nMcCarran Airport is a wonderfully strange and wacky travel hub that lives up to it's city's billing, and totally epitomizes what this town is all about. What happens in Vegas....takes off at this airport!", "type": "review", "business_id": "jf67Z1pnwElRSXllpQHiJg"}

It was great in the early 80's, and I am sure was quite modern. Now, it looks it's age and is in need of a major renovation. It would also be much better if it was more clear as to where you were going, and how you will get there. Unless you know that you need to take the tram to the main terminal you will not know that you need to do so to get your bags. If you have done it more than once, then no big deal. The baggage claim is very spacious and plenty of room, however it would be better if there was more information for you to know where to get your bags from rather than following all the same people from your flight and see where they go. I also wish the food shops were a little nicer as well, but again a major renovation will take care of a lot of that.", "type": "review", "business_id": "jf67Z1pnwElRSXllpQHiJg"}

You literally could be limping on a sprained ankle, carrying a purse and carry on bag and between you and your husband, have another 3 suitcases to maneuver, and still you should not expect anyone to be courteous enough to move for you.  What you can expect is to walk 100 miles to baggage claim, wait for 30 minutes or more for the 1st piece of luggage (which will not be yours) to drop onto the carousel, fight mean stares and rude people to get out to the Taxi line, just to round the corner and see you will be getting a taxi just about in time to catch your flight home, in three days.\n\nHere's a tip:  Either schedule a car service to meet you at the airport (yes, it will cost you $65 and YES, it is worth not having to wait in a taxi line) or look for a dude in a suit, pushing a luggage cart around, who you can tip $1 per bag and he will help you cut in line to get a taxi.

Fabulous! \n\nIf you can't find your costume and tired of the repetitive supply of costume kits at the seasonal costume stores or need one for an occasion (open year round), come here. Sure there are some much pricier costumes here, but quality is a notch above the usual Halloween stores. They carry some trashy lingerie costumes- I love them! Not that there aren't some good \"bargains\" in there- as I've seen some that good ones that aren't badly priced  and there's also some mix and match selections. Accessories are great- wall of wigs, wall of hats, jewelry, masks, prosthetics, shoes, props, etc. All very reasonable/competitive pricing to other costume stores, but better selections, and better quality. Dancewear/bodywear is also available. \n\nBuying isn't the only option since they have a catalog of rentals. They were fixing the store and their backroom was visible- Impressive, with rows of costumes to the roof. The plus is that obviously, you can walk-in and look. Other costume rental places like Show Off apparently is by appointment to try costumes. I saw that they can do custom made orders too. If you're creative- they have fabrics that are costumey and not what you normally can find at more conventional fabrics stores. \n\nDefinitely this is the spot for people who want to stand out and go all out! \n\nThe part of the store that made me swoon is the makeup. The makeup kits are better quality brands than the stuff you find at the usual Halloween stores. And then they went a step above and their professional makeup stock- this is the only place I've found Kryolan, Ben Nye, Mehron stuff! A extensive selection from color singles, wheels, palettes, lipsticks, makeup removers, mixing mediums and special effects, and brushes even. SO excited when I found this because I do wear some of their products for everyday looks. It's just top notch pigment and texture. \n\nThe place is nice organized with signs above to direct you. The staff though is very nice and eager to help so don't hesitate to ask for help. \n\nOnly thing some people might find weird is they have signs for limiting try on to 4 costumes per day. I think it's to put off those people who just like to \"play\". Go to Party City and overhear the convos and teen giggles,followed by flashes of photos and look at the rampage in the dressing rooms and unhappy staff to get why limitations might be good. When you're dealing in quality costumes it is reasonable to ask. I think if you're serious about locking down a costume and it's just not working out, it might be different. \n\nI looked around extensively, taking in everything. Lumping in ideas in the head and registering the makeup I must haves. Haha. \n\nI made off  this time only with a thin liner brush and a headband/wristband set which Yelparazzi Elnino and I grabbed for the next Yelp event.\n\nI will be back, probably several times.", "type": "review", "business_id": "CRowuM53GcsaFQrVMwMNfw"}

And I am not talking inexpensive, I am talking just downright spendthrift.  \nFirst let me be clear I stayed here for 5 nights, 2 of them free via a promotion.  FIrst thing I noticed in the room was that the temperature could not be set below 68 degrees.  Usually the thermostat sat at 72, which is not much of an issue, but it if you like coming to a cool room after a hot night out do not expect it here.\nBeyond the cheapness in not allowing you to change your thermostat, the room was full of signs reminding you to reuse sheets, towels and putting a sign out if you want maid service at all.  I am all for conserving resouces, but this did not come off as a green movement to me, especially when you consider this is a country western themed hotel.  \nIt just came off as Sams Town trying to guilt you into not taking advantage of services every hotel in the city offers.  Also the room had no coffee maker either.  What quality hotel in Vegas does not have a coffee maker in room?!\nIf you look past the cheapness of the management, the hotel was fine otherwise.  The room had an LCD TV, with a SD signal which seemed to defeat the purpose of having an LCD.  Also there were no premium channels offered at all.  The bed was comfy, but the room lacked a couch or any other nice features you would see at the other Coast properties.\nThe casino was ok, there was double deck BJ with standard rules and little penetration, and a single deck game that paid only 2:1 on BJ and shuffled after each hand.  Whats the point?  The floor bosses also were very cheap with giving out comps, so if you are looking for good action, with good rewards go elsewhere.\nThere was a total of 6 full pay video poker machines in the whole casino too, and considering Sams Town has the 2nd largest casino floor in Vegas, that is not nearly enough.  Also there was no video blackjack anywhere, and the drink service was slow.\nLastly, and best, the buffet here was excellent for the price.  I went once for lunch and once for dinner and was suprised each time by the quality.  For a very fair price, you get a quality buffet that had a good selection and nice seating.  \nSo all in all, you can find excellent prices to stay here, but if pay the extra $5 a night stay at the Orleans or Sun Coast which are much closer to the strip and much nicer.  The rooms are ok, but everywhere you go it feels like Sams Town just wants to nickel and dime you, and heaven forbid you want to set the room to a different temperature.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Ss7rZpNaKRWs4Wkq_tHuTA"}

Yay, they got rid of that faded old sign advertising Chang's.  Although I'm not particularly fond of their tacky new font, at least it's legible! \n\nLooks like prices have gone up too!\n\nGroup A - $2\nGroup B - $2.75\nGroup C - $3.95 \nGroup D - $5.95\nGroup E - $7.95\n\nFor our hungry party of three, we had five items from Group A, seven items from Group B, and one item from Group C.\n\nThey included:\n\n* Shrimp Dumplings\n* Pork Dumplings\n* Beef Ball\n* Tofu Skin Roll\n* Steamed Tripe\n* Beef Rice Noodle Roll\n* Chicken Feet in Black Bean Sauce \n* Deep Fried Ground Pork Dumpling\n* Deep Fried Taro and Ground Pork Dumpling\n* Shanghai Dumplings (Group C) - It's something they don't push around in the carts.  You have to put in a special order for it.  Our order was had four dumplings, but you can request eight.  It came out piping hot - just the way it's supposed to be.  Be careful with the soup inside because it burned my tongue! \n\nThe whole point of going out for dim sum is to \"yum cha\" which means to drink tea. Therefore, tea charges is as follows:\n\n* Tea is $.50/person\n* Chrysanthemum tea is $1/per person\n\nI wanted to end our lunch with something sweet and looked over the Egg Custard Tarts.  They appeared to be the same ones that were out when we first arrived, so I passed on that.  We also skipped on the Egg Custard Pineapple Bun this time around since we didn't see them come out fresh, and these buns needed to be eaten piping hot only!  They did offer the dessert tofu dish, but that's not my favorite.  Perhaps they need a better sweet selection or at least a higher turnover on it so things can still come out fresh! \n\nThe service was surprisingly attentive on a Monday and there was no wait.  Our water glasses and tea pot were constantly refilled without us asking, which we really appreciated.  A large bus group did arrive shortly after us and did take up some of the attention, but it was understandable.\n\nUnfortunately, they do not have hot chili oil anymore, just the regular hot chili sauce.  I'll continue to ask for it in case they bring it back!\n\n3.5 stars", "type": "review", "business_id": "5tYLVPc2PKnj6E62sY6QMg"}

When my family wants dim sum, this is the place to go. When my friends want dim sum, this is the place to go. However, after being away from Vegas for the past 3 years, things have drastically changed. I'm not sure if it's because of my taste buds or perhaps with other dim sum places popping up, such as KJ Kitchen at Rio....things have changed at Chang's.\n\nQuality certainly has gone downhill. The service, on the other hand, I have seen no changes. It's still just like any other Chinese place where it's hard to find anyone to help you when you need it. \n\nMy family and I came here for lunch this past Sunday and I must say, it was very disappointing. Half of the food that we wanted weren't readily available -- they were making it in the back. Some of them came out and some just were never ready. There used to be a lot more carts going around but now it's been reduced to about 3-4 different cards. It also used to be a whole lot more busy here so I assume because of the lack of business, they no longer have that many carts going around. \n\nThe food? Not memorable at all. AT ALL. Some of it was kind of gross .. even for me! The quality sure has changed!  \n\nOverall, I wouldn't suggest this place for dim sum. It's honestly only \"okay\" because this certainly isn't the worst place.", "type": "review", "business_id": "5tYLVPc2PKnj6E62sY6QMg"}

After being spoiled by eating at so many good dim sum places back home in Monterey park/Rowland area, Chang's felt subpar to me. For all my OC ppl visiting Vegas & thinkin about trying this place, I would say it's comparable to dragon phoenix in Bolsa. You have the ladies rollin the cart around, which I don't really prefer because the temperature of the items were barely warm\n\nSurprisingly though, the servers were on top of it here. I don't really expect much service from a chinese restaurant, but our water cups were never empty and the manager was a really friendly guy. We later found out they speak cantonese here, and once again I was used as the person to order everything for the table because I was the only one that spoke cantonese -__-\n\nThe place looked really clean for a chinese restaurant and the prices weren't bad.  They had all the dim sum basics such as shu mai, har gow, chinese broccoli, chicken feet, etc. The dim sum items such as shu mai and har gow were a bit small though. The good thing is I don't think they load up on MSG here and the food wasn't too salty. The congee was a rip off though because there was barely any shredded dry pork in it and the fried donuts weren't like the ones back at home.The fried donuts to dip in the congee were too crispy and there was a lot of oil on the plate.\n\nNot too bad of a place to grab dim sum in Vegas. My friend said it's a lot better than Ping Pong Pang's", "type": "review", "business_id": "5tYLVPc2PKnj6E62sY6QMg"}

I walked in the door and some old Phyllis Diller doppleganger behind me screeched, \"Thanks for nothing!\" I exclaimed, \"Pardon me your highness, what have I done to offend thee?\" She screeched back, \"Didn't you see me when you opened the door?\"  Well obviously not or I would have held it open but she was a typical east coast parasite who thinks the world revolves around her. She had the stench of a crazy cat lady and the demeanor of a freshly released mental patient and her scent of Windsong and Vicks Vapor Rub stayed on my mind. She regaled the nonplussed nursing staff about her near death experience of seeing angels and her various health ailments and surgeries like your garden variety septuagenarian  then commenced her job of bitching about the government. This was just a tad too close to Mommie Dearest for yours truly so I had to ease on down to the other end of the waiting room to regain my composure. \n\nBizarro World Phyllis Diller and I were the only ones there so to me the wait was excessive for the less than 2 minutes the doctor spent talking to me. Dr. Lee stopped listening about 30 seconds into my describing my ailments and said we need your money then sent in a woman to collect my money despite the fact that I was going to pay AFTER the visit as is customary in most first world countries. She kept my card over half an hour which left me wondering how long it would take me to fix my credit after her online spending spree. Taking a credit or debit card out of my sight in Vegas is totally unacceptable and they know it. \n\nStaff was apathetic at best and the doctor didn't even attempt any critical thinking. Good thing I already knew what was wrong with me. The doctor forgot to give me a work excuse and I checked my paperwork in the car before leaving then called to tell them they forgot it  and I was sending my teenager in to retrieve it.  The nurse argued with me about whether I had asked for a work excuse and as my miniature adult was standing before her in all his glory, she bitched about me not coming back to get it myself. I polite explained that I would snap if having to go back in myself as I am in extreme pain from bronchitis and a chipped tooth. \n\nShe had me describe my child then grilled him about my identity as I listened and she spit out some of her first language expletives which I understand and hung up on me. Typical Vegas BS. \n\nI only go there to avoid going to the hospital in an emergency. This is my least favorite of the clinics I've been to in town. I knew it was a bad sign when I had to spell out the medications I'm allergic to for the nurse and she still got them wrong. The receptionist told me health care in Vegas is the worst and a scam. She told me she had 2 dental plans and still got a bill for $150 from her dentist.", "type": "review", "business_id": "P4DFt08-0d9uvsjh6oDh8w"}

Prices for lunch and dinner vary depending on the day of the week (Mon-Thurs:  $15.95 lunch/$24.95 dinner; Fri, Sat, Sun, Holidays:  $16.95 lunch/$25.95 dinner).  The buffet line offers a wide variety of nigiri and rolls; however, it also has a tempting array of salads, hot dishes like tempura shrimp and vegetables, miso soup and udon, and desserts.  Makino does have its flaws.  The sushi rice is not nearly prepared to the exacting standards of better/higher end sushi restaurants.  Construction of its nigiri and rolls is impacted by a seeming lack of the appropriate amount of moisture and stickiness of the rice, which has a tendency to be a bit crumbly.  Also, hot foods, depending on turnover, get overcooked, tough, or soggy, in the case of the tempura-fried vegetables, due to spending too much time in steam trays on the hot line.  However, these shortcomings are more than offset by the Makino's sushi variety and its generous cuts of better than average quality fresh fish and other seafood.  Really, who eats sushi for the rice?   \n\nI love sushi.  While I wouldn't want to eat it every day, I definitely enjoy getting my feed on for the stuff...almost to the point of discomfort.  That said, I don't just eat any sushi.  I do have some standards for quality and selection.  Therefore, Makino on Decatur has been my go-to stop for decent quality sushi at a very fair price.  For your best bang for your buck, I recommend doing them for lunch.", "type": "review", "business_id": "V3ruBXjLGWniPNPQOzRhiw"}

I wanted to get this review in quick before I forgot about all the little nuances and why it is getting a 3-star rating , instead of the 4 or 5 it should have gotten.\n\nFirst, I want to point out that I am a huge fan of Firefly. It is one of my favorite spots in Las Vegas and honestly if I'm going to have tapas I am going to go to Firefly. Personally my favorite Firefly was the one in The Plaza downtown, but since I cannot review that one since it is now closed *sad face*, I will be satisfied with the location on Paradise.\n\nFirst off, this location's parking situation has always irritated me. And  often when they do valet I just can't believe it. It's a ridiculous situation. But that is the least of my complaints for tonight. First let me begin with the service - it was \"okay\". The food came out quickly, none of our meals were forgotten, but when it came to delivering our check, the waiter dropped the ball - BIG TIME. He came and asked us if we wanted dessert and we said no, he asked if we wanted more drinks, we said no. This is a clear indication that we wanted OUR CHECK. Our check never came. We sat for a little over 30 minutes and we were forced to wave down a girl, who was not even our server so we could get our check. *sigh*\n\nThis was a bad experience, I must admit, because all of my other experiences at Firefly have been superb! Both at the Paradise AND Downtown location.\n\nWhat about the food? Well, I strayed from my favorites this time ( I LOVE the shrimp ceviche, it is SO delicious). This time I had the artichoke toasts. These were good and the aioli on them made them delectable! However, I also had the empanada (probably the worst empanada I've ever had in my entire life). And the mushroom tart. Here's what I have to say about the mushroom tart: it's too big for a tapa, unless you're sharing, it's too rich for a tapa, and I really wish I had known that.\n\nOn this occasion I did not have sangria, but I do highly recommend it based on my previous experiences, especially if you are in a large group - spring for the pitchers! \n\nLastly - the banana Nutella dessert IS absolutely delicious and although I did not have it on this visit I highly recommend it. \n\nI will absolutely go back to Firefly, but I think I'm going to stick to my favorites from now on: ceviche, the fries, and the artichoke toasts. I really wish I could have given a better review, but just based off the tapas I ordered and the poor service, only a 3-star rating it shall be until I make a return trip.", "type": "review", "business_id": "8buIr1zBCO7OEcAQSZko7w"}

But there were bachelorette parties and a lot of college kids (not too far from UNLV) making the place really...REALLY...loud. I guess I wasn't expecting this place in a nice little strip mall (next too a few other upscale places like Ruth Chris' Steak House) to be so much like a bar.\n\nThere was also almost too many servers for the relatively small restaurant. We had a few different people come to our table, and had a hard time remembering who was our actual waiter, and who was just a busser. \n\nIt's not too too expensive either, so that's nice.\n\nWe may go back eventually, but maybe during a less busy time.", "type": "review", "business_id": "8buIr1zBCO7OEcAQSZko7w"}

We weren't in the \"patio\" (along the canal), but were beneath a graceful arch and close enough to see the gondolas drifting by - actually they were maneuvering quite a bit because it's near the embarkation point.  In fact, the only thing separating us was a small group celebrating a wedding - I thought it a very suitable venue for a Vegas reception....more of a choice to forego the big church wedding and Italian honeymoon instead of a we-can't-afford-it substitute.  Well, that's the vibe I got since they had obviously put in a lot of attention to detail with the nicest spot, table set up, cake table, etc.  Well, it lent some romance to our dinner since we weren't a menage a trois, but there with our teenage son.  The menu was very tempting - there were a few things we couldn't decide between.  Looking over at the next table, I recommended that my son order a dish full of shell fish, chicken skewers, and delicious looking bread; it turned out not to be quite enough for him.  The ceviche appetizer was sufficient as an entree for me though - the tuna was good, the shrimp and olive too salty, and the third not memorable.  Oh, another diner came over and asked me what I thought of it, so the dishes match the menu description very accurately!  My husband had the succulent pork, and we shared a carafe of strong (I felt) sangria.  It would have been nice if chips and salsa were included instead of being offered separately on the menu (duh, restaurateurs, I probably could have handled more sangria then).  I'm recommending it for kids also because watching the boats is pretty entertaining, it's noisy anyway, and I imagine the railings are close enough that they can't slip through.  I think this place was mentioned in one of the in-room magazines, but in this case, it wasn't all hype.

For less than $8, he got a platter of tasty pork (seasoned with citrus and achiote) with the traditional picked onions, along with rice, beans, and tortillas.

So Heli USA had discounts for locals, so I decided to go with them. Arriving to the place, was a bit confusing, cause its a small office right next to other airline businesses. But usually, if you are a tourist, they probably will pick you up at your hotel, or at least MGM. Which would probably suck, if your coming from other casinos and MGM is the only hotel they'll pick you up. But,  I'm not 100% sure, how they pick up tourist. \n\nAt first, we checked in, had champagne and do a little briefing on what is expected of you as a passenger and understanding on how to get in and out of the helicopter. Last thing you probably want to do, is get hit by the blades, so it was cool that they show us safety procedures on entering and exiting the helicopter. That itself, plus waiting for the shuttle, took about 20-30 minutes, before we went onto the platform where the helicopter was. When we arrived, we were picked individually, not unless you went with family, by weight. They want to make sure that the helicopter was able to lift properly. Unfortunately, those who way 150 or more, will end up sitting in the back. So it was kind of a bummer that I got stuck in the back. Its also sucks when they stick you with other heavier people in back. I realize how small the helicopter was, especially trying to fit 4 people that probably way over 200 lbs, in the back. Its like trying to fit 4 people in the back seat of a Volkswagen Beetle. \n\nAfter loading, we made sure we got our headsets, and ready for lift off. I was a bit unhappy with the fact of being squished by the window and a big person, that I couldn't really video tape, due to limited movement. But having the window seat, isn't all that bad, when your main focus is to look at the Vegas Strip from a different view. Its about 10-12 minutes to be squished against the window and try to enjoy the view. So I guess it wasn't that bad, it probably could of been worse. \n\nBut the view was nice, and get to see Vegas from a whole different view. I did like getting close to the stratosphere to actually see people walking around, and flying over the Fremont Experience, which gives a good birds eye view of the place. Seeing Bellagio Water show, was kind of amazing.  Also City Center is very nice from the helicopter.  Its better then looking it up on Google earth. \n\nOverall, I would say it was okay. I would recommend it, if you want to see Vegas from a birds eye view. If you way more then 150, your chances our very slim, that you'll be sitting in front. With that in mind, expect to be sitting with other people that weigh more then 150. It is a tight squeeze, so don't expect much movement. But if you go, maybe bring 5 of your friends, cause I think one helicopter fits a total of 7 people, including the pilot. 3 in front (pilot and 2 passengers) and 4 in back. You might have a bit of an advantage being with 5 other friends. As for the champagne, don't expect much with that.", "type": "review", "business_id": "SbzySmed11a7sBvVQy7o6Q"}

The whole hotel was dark and dreary and had a very distinct odour. The check in process took over an hour despite the front desk having multiple people sitting there on computers doing nothing. I check in at about 1130 and didn't need to check in as such, just see if my room was available yet, otherwise I would just leave my bag.

Bit of creme fresh and caviar.  Nice size portion. Then comes one large sauteed scallop wrapped in proscuitto.  Bit of sauce.  Perfect.  Then a small portion of a homemade tube pasta with a meat ragu sauce.  This was one of the best I have ever had. Perfectly cooked pasta, so fresh it was still evolving.

Perfectly cooked, fantastic sauce and some awesome scalloped potatoes.  Way to much food. But then... you get a choice of deserts.  full size portion no less and each person can order which one they want .  Delicious finish. \n\n And the wine parings.

I hate Vegas, but I love Battista's.  Gordy serenades you with his accordion stylings, not as late as he used to, but then again, he's about 90 now.  Anyone complaining about the wine on here can always buy a bottle of what they want, but when a place gives you free table wine, I put away my wine snob nose and drink it, and it's not bad at all.  I've paid decent money for wines I've liked less.  The vibe is old Vegas, pictures of celebrities from the Rat Pack days and beyond.  The food is good, very good.  Not Food Channel Celebrity Chef Italian, which most pretentious Vegas posers desire, but good italian food.  You do not leave here hungry.  The garlic bread, soup, salad, all the free sides are good, once again, if you are going to criticize the comps, don't eat them, get something else.  It used to be perfectly priced but the prices have gone up or they would get 5 stars.

I grew up on Italian, home-cooked food, I've spent a month in Italy and literally ate my way through the country, and have an eleven-letter Italian last name that people constantly butcher when they try to pronounce it.  It is that experience that prompted me to sign up for Yelp and give Battista's its deserved one star. It was dismal. \n\nThe main reason I am writing this is to dispel myths circling around (from LOCALS no less) that this place is fun and has good Italian food. Neither is true. Though our wait staff was attentive and prompt, the good service we got just didn't outweigh the bad food. \n\nThe decor is kitschy - crap all over the place. The food pricing is way too expensive for iceberg salad, adequate garlic bread and mediocre wine. I ordered a chicken dish and had minestrone. They were both way too salty (a trick used by restaurants to hide poor quality or good-tasting food). And yes, the accordion player was awkward to say the least. \n\nOver-priced, overrated and a tourist trap with a miraculously good reputation. My advice? Go to Maggiano's for GREAT Italian food. Or Olive Garden. Or Buca di Beppo's even.  Just please, don't go here. Don't perpetuate the Battista's myth.", "type": "review", "business_id": "1bJjWGYip-V2PGj4VIwbiQ"}

I admit, I had been drinking, and when I'm drinking everything tastes amazing, but daaaaaaamn, those were some good ribs!  They were perfectly sauced and cooked just right.  Their regular beer prices are super reasonable, and their beer is brewed right there on-site.  I'm from Portland, aka Microbrew Capital of the World, so their beers didn't rock my world, but they were still pretty good.  I tried their hard lemonade though, and I had to put it down - icky.  \n\nThe casino is smaller and definitely more dive-y, but they've got some of the newer slots and low-limit table games. I had a great time while I was here and I'll definitely be back.", "type": "review", "business_id": "tqu42L0qXzkvYKSruOz0IA"}

Dinner was so so, but it was a meet and greet with an important vendor and we got toasted beforehand making the bad food slide down more easily.  \n\nAfterwards, we wanted to gamble on the cheap so we decided to head downstairs thinking it would be easier to find a $10 table here than back at the Mirage.  We were kind of right.  All of the tables in this part of the Sahara were not $10....they were a buck.  $1 blackjack & roulette....... and penny slots.  The funny thing about penny slots here was that they only take bills, not coins.  OK, so I thought it was funny.\n\nAnyway, we are not big gamblers....my partner especially.  In fact, I had to give him some quick pointers when he put $2 on black and $2 on red on the same roulette spin.  Classic.  You can't make this stuff up.\n\n(Hey Mickey, what about the Nascar Cafe!!!!).  OK, OK....While playing, we see a huge sign about the 3 Pound Burrito at the Nascar Cafe just a few feet away.  \"Eat it all and it's free!!\"  (See the photo....No, that is not me.)  They make you sit in the middle of the room, under a spotlight, with a velvet rope around the table.  It's actually $19.95 if you don't finish.  I would actually pay $19.95 to see a good buddy attempt the feat, but I would not drive him home.

We were greeted by a typical male Las Vegas nightclub host; seeing that we were dining at a venue that promotes itself as an authentic Moroccan restaurant, I found him to be quite out of place. Upon entering Marrakech we found ourselves submerged into a relaxing, and tantalizing ambiance. If you select the basic option you are given three courses, including a dessert. I had a glass of Amazir red, a Moroccan wine, that paired nicely with my meal. This is definitely a delightful place for couples and groups. They had really gorgeous belly dancers who were very \"skilled\" at their profession, Lol. But make sure that if you are brave enough to shake it with these ladies that you have \"CASH AT HAND\" and tip accordingly :o)\n\nBefore you are served your hands are cleaned in a cute sort of ritualistic manner. Eating with your hands enhances the overall experience. If you are an average size lady, the portions may be a little big for you. However, I found myself falling in love more and more with every bite. The dessert was too much, but the overall meal kept my taste buds very excited. The servers weren't the most talkative, but I'm not sure if that was a cultural thing and that's just how Moroccan food is presented? Its also very easy to lose track of time, which makes this a great mini escape from Vegas without leaving Vegas.\n\n\nAlex: 4 stars. I've never had authentic Moroccan food, so I'm unqualified to compare. All I can say is that I was thoroughly impressed with the taste. Very flavorful and well-prepared. We ordered the three-dish meal for $25 each (a solid deal) which came with cooked veggies and dip, chicken with couscous, and dessert. I had no complaints whatsoever about the food. The dancers were great, and made sure to keep the entire restaurant engaged; bring cash for tips to show your appreciation for their talent. The atmosphere is extremely laid back. Dance with the dancers, laugh, drink, be merry. I guess what keeps it from being a true 5-star for me is two things: First, though I love the belly-dancing music, between shows it slips into cheesy Vegas techno and kills the beautiful atmosphere they've created with the interior design and lighting. Second is the Welcome-Factor of the waiters. There is none. It's kind of a \"done yet?\" feeling.\n\nTake friends, take in the atmosphere, and enjoy the delicious food...you don't wanna miss this place!", "type": "review", "business_id": "8Z3jgKCdfp57PvT1AFOWtg"}

It was always a special event, usually while on a weekend trip in from Southern California. Back then, Michael's was located at the Barbary Coast Hotel, which closed back in early 2007. The old Barbary Coast is now the obnoxious Bill's Gamblin Hall and Saloon. So when Bill's came in, Michael's left. They then relocated to the South Point Hotel and Casino, further south on the Strip. (The old owner of the Barbary owned the South Point too). In truth,  I was anxious to hear that they were moving to a new location at the South Point. I was happy it was still going to be around, but secretly worried that they would not be able to maintain or recreate the old school Vegas feeling and ambiance they had when it was located inside the Barbary. \n\nI was proven wrong. If you read reviews on here that bash the way that Michael's looks, stuff like...\"It hasn't been updated since the 1970s,\" blah blah....um, excuse me...it's like that on PURPOSE.  When it was moved from the old location, pretty much everything, and I mean, EVERYTHING was carefully placed to mimic the way it looked for all those decades at the old Barbary Coast. Right down to the beautiful glass dome in the middle of the restaurant and the front door. The whole idea of Michael's is to transform you back to a time when dining out in Vegas was an event. Here, the Ladies do not receive a menu with prices on it. Only the Gentlemen do. This is the type of meal where there are so many rich, savory taste experiences, you have a champagne sherbet in between courses to cleanse your palette. And don't forget the fruit bowl, chocolate, and fruit petit fours that come after the meal, along with multicolored sugar crystals for your after dinner coffee or tea. Excited yet?\n\n Michaels has all that and more. The best, largest, juiciest filet you will ever eat. If you love seafood, the Florida stone crab is flown in daily and NOT to be missed. The claws are gigantic.  The Sea Bass is perfection. I also love the spinach salad they prepare for you table side, complete with hot bacon and vinaigrette dressing. And please don't forget dessert. My mom and I swoon over the Cherries Jubilee every time. But if cherries are not your thing, you can pick something like Bananas Foster or one of 10 or so fresh mouthwatering desserts from the pastry cart. \nThe service is top notch. Your captain and Maitre d will wait on you hand and foot,  (without being pushy or overbearing) and make you feel like family. And that's exactly how my family feels about Russell and Jose, who work there.They are family. So much so, that my husband and I celebrated our small wedding night dinner here with my parents last December. \nExpect to be there for at least three hours. And as some other reviewers unfortunately found out after it was too late, it is semi dressy/dressier. So yes, guys, put on a jacket, ok? It's one night, so suck it up. Like I said, it is not dinner, it is an event. And one definitely not to be missed. \nIt is pricey. Know that going in. But you could spend the same or even more on the Strip and not even come close to this experience. You can go to a five star, elegant steak house at the Palms, or the Palazzo, or Mandalay, or even the Wynn. But I can guarantee that these trendier places won't pamper you the way that Michael's does. Those places are into kissing the asses of say, celebs,  and other bigwigs. At Michael's, you don't technically have to be a bigshot to be made to feel like one.\nPerfection.", "type": "review", "business_id": "4uuQIYWBqOGOAmU_E6R2bQ"}

This might be because we'd really built up our expectations, but the end feeling we were both left with was, \"Huh - well that was good, but really nothing special.\"\n\nWe were seated promptly upon arrival and greeted by a very friendly and helpful waitress. She introduced us to the menu, talked about their different cuts, and took drink orders. While sipping on our manhattans, we placed our meal orders, both ordering the same thing - clam chowder, their signature NY strip, and the garlic mashed potatoes.\n\nThe clam chowder was spectacular. Thick, creamy, chunky. The mashed potatoes were good, but a bit too whipped for my liking. The steak - the signature wet and dry aged steak - was, well, tough and not all that flavorful. The waitress did recommend the ribeye (saying it was her favorite), and hindsight being what it is I'm thinking we should have listened to her.\n\nThere are many better places in Vegas than this one, including one of my favorites (Mon Ami Gabi). The place is decent, but for the price you can do much better elsewhere.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Ensu96ecI0OReupNS2x7ig"}

I'm a SoCal native and Vegas is ALWAYS a weekend option especially since it's only a few hour drive away. Minus all the obvious reasons one of the big attractions for me has always been food. Whether it's finding the next best buffet, a unique cuisine or just some top notch high end restaurants all concentrated into a small area. One thing I try to always do when getting into Vegas is to find a new steakhouse. Well this time around I was recommended to Gallagher's. \n\nFirst off it's a welcome change to enter a steakhouse not feeling out of place with everyone dressed up as if they were going ballroom dancing. We were seated for a table of eight. It was quite early and we had a 8PM dinner reservation. We are all meat eaters so our table had center cut filets, new york sirloin, queen cut prime rib and for myself the cowboy ribeye steak. Minutes later they came back to tell us they ran out of prime rib. I mean it's barely a quarter past 8pm. Whatever they proceeded to change their order to a steak instead. \n\nBut back to my steak. I like it \"Black and Blue.\" Now there are some places that I will make sure they know what I'm talking about but these type of high end restaurants with this high of a rating I would imagine they would know. Also my server took my preference without skipping a beat. Normally if the case I will be asked for an explanation if they don't know. When brought out of course it was clearly not black and blue but it was rare. I told the server that this was not \"Black and Blue\" and that it was rare. She proceeded to tell me \"That is how OUR black and blue is.\" What the hell does that mean? Now I can eat my steak medium rare (normally cheaper or skinnier steaks) and I can eat it rare also but it's my least choice. The funny thing was that she didn't even offer to send it back to have it redone, she instead stared at me with a long pause as though to say, just eat the damn thing. I hate sending food back, possibly fear from the movie \"Waiting\" and stories from friends. So I just kept it. It tasted like wet beef. It's almost as if they kept it in a bucket of water overnight threw on the grill and slapped it on my plate. For my side I had creamed spinach which was more cream then there was spinach. This is a first also, I did not finish my steak. Blasphemy!!! It was simply that bad. You might be thinking hey you got it rare, well shoot I've had it rare many places and have loved it. \n\nThe highlight of the night was simply the spirits menu which was a lit up menu that at first I thought it was a touch screen but it wasn't. The wine was excellent that was chosen by the server but do not remember the name, simply because I was so upset about my meal. Everyone else had similar opinions being average but nothing spectacular. \n\nWhen it comes down to it the food was not even ok. I'm surprised this place is still here with so many steakhouses popping up in Vegas now you can easily walk down the street and find another prime steakhouse. The two stars is almost out of sympathy since the only reason the second star is there is my wine and scotch. Either way it's hard to want to give this place a second chance again since there are so many other options available. Maybe once I've exhausted all other places and I make my rounds again I might give this place a try if I'm stuck at NYNY or have won a few black chips while at the table.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Ensu96ecI0OReupNS2x7ig"}

This is by far the highlight of my meal there. The service was impeccable. WE had a really kind genuine waitress who was consistent in checking on us and spoke to us with purpose and interest. There was a separate guy who filled up waters/drinks, who was seriously on his game that night! He was like a ninja! I'll take a swig of my drink and look over into conversation with my party and look back to notice that my glass was refilled.... *cue eary music* *looks around but not a prospect in sight* haha! But that was awesome, some of the best service I have ever had. Extremely accommodating.\n\nAmbience was nice. The place has their lights low and you look around to a pretty restaurant. It feels like a classy night out, given your cutlery, the service, and the uniform the staff is wearing. But the customers are still casual so that sort of brings things back down to earth, which is fine by me.\n\nOk here we go, Food! I ordered the Cowboy Ribeye Steak, recommended by the waitress, with a side of macaroni and cheese. Now the steak was really good! (Next time I'll probably go Medium). I really enjoyed the steak but when it came down to complimenting it with a side, there were problems. The macaroni and cheese was bland. They attempted it with different noodles and a creamier white cheese but it lacked flavor and even after adding seasoning it just tasted generic. I tried my friend's french fries and I didn't care for those either, to my surprise! It seems like it would be hard to mess those up. They didn't mess it up but they tried a garlic seasoning or something but it ended up tasting bland. In the end I felt secluded to just the steak which was good but I wanted something else with it. For the money I paid for dinner I feel like my whole dinner should have been amazing. It's pretty pricey here guys so your wallet needs to match your hunger here\n\nIf you're just trying to find a great steak and nothing else then this wouldn't be a bad place to try.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Ensu96ecI0OReupNS2x7ig"}

Service was slightly flawed - Kokomo's uses a two server/one busser system which usually results in impeccable service.  Unfortunately I think our second server, an older gentleman whose name we didn't catch, was new.  He brought our first course, chilled crab claws, oysters and prawns, before the amuse and when we asked him about it he argued with us that the sorbet comes after the appetizer.  He then brought the sorbet, a micro scoop of lime floating in a cordial glass of ginger ale, which was in fact meant to come just prior to the main course, while we were still eating the first course.  Our busser saved the day by bringing the amuse after he cleared the appetizer dishes.  It was well worth the struggle as the truffled cauliflower cream topped with caviar was sublime.  Really, I'm not exaggerating.  Sublime.  Our primary server, Sam, then brought out our main course, a large, perfectly cooked New York Strip served with green peppercorn sauce, grilled asparagus and a potato waffle (think potato pancake cooked in a belgian waffle maker).  The older waiter presented my plate backwards and Sam swooped in behind him to correct the error.  They stepped away from the table and moments later the older gent came back to ask if everything was okay service-wise. I thought that was kind of sweet.  After I finished what I could of my perfect meal and donated the remainder to my willing husband the dessert was served.  I don't recall who brought it but it would have been nice to have someone explain what exactly was on the tasting plate.  Regardless, most of the 5 selections were delicious (the exception being the overly sweet red velvet cake pops - yuck).  The layered strawberry thingy (we don't know what it was??!!!) was the shining star, though.  \n\nThis place has delivered a wonderful, five star experience for us both times we've been there.

When I first looked at the menu, the high $$$ threw me off a bit but in the end, I recognized the value. Finally, a steakhouse where I can ask for medium rare and they actually bring out medium rare! One of my biggest pet peeves (aside from people who order medium well to well-cooked steaks) is when someone overcooks my steak, especially when the quality of steak is that good. \n\nIf you enjoy lamb, I highly recommend the lamb chops. I ordered them medium rare and they came out extremely tender and flavorful. I can easily say they were the best lamb chops I've had in a long time. The prime rib is also excellent and based on opinions of others, the new york strip is their best (I just couldn't handle a piece of steak that ginormous!) The potato on the side was definitely a good choice. They bring out butter, sour cream, bacon bits, etc. in caddies so that you can create your own baked potato to your liking. The rice pilaf is also a fantastic choice if you prefer a lighter, more diet-friendly side dish. \n\nThe servers are fantastic and attentive. \n\nI had a cosmopolitan with my meal and it was a bit strong, but delicious. It definitely complimented the heavy dinner that put me in near comatose.

Prices can get a little steep when considering a small order of taquitos can run one as much as $9.\n\nIn the end, when considering the alternative fast food joints that exist in virtually all major airports, this place is not a bad place to settle for the mid-afternoon meal.

My friend went in to get her nose pierced (which they did a very good job on) and of course I had to talk to the artist and see his portfolio.  It was a last minute decision to get a tattoo there but I'm happy I did it.  Twister hooked me up!!!  I told him what I wanted and how much I was willing to spend and he worked everything out for me.  I went in and his apprentice drew it up.  Twister didn't like what he drew so he took it upon himself to draw what turned out to be beautiful.  Not only is the shop clean but it's a relaxed setting, the guys there like to have fun and it made my tattooing experience there that much more memorable.  After a long 3 and a half hours it was finished, I love it.  I get stopped at least a few times a week from complete strangers complementing me on it.  \n\nThis place might sound like a little hole in the wall joint, especially with all of the competition they have out in Vegas but it's more affordable and Twister is amazing.

I didn't try a bite. \n\nFor dessert I saw they had sticky toffee pudding- they were in the mini bites so we ordered two. Seriously, the one good dessert they have is like a small offering.  Grandma never eats dessert but she ate a whole one herself and the BF and I shared one. Its good as far as sticky toffee goes. \n\nService was friendly, but the service wasn't too quick and then the kitchen was very slow.

A short 20 min drive away from Vegas strip in 110+ degree weather in an unassuming strip mall lies the mythical restaurant. Doesn't look like much, but there is plentiful parking right in front.\n\nWe arrived a few mins early for our 6:30 reservation and the restaurant was already full w/ a bunch of people waiting. We decided to bide our time at the bar and have a drink. The bar seemed extremely well stocked with multiple wine refrigerators and a plethora of various drinks. Patrons around the bar were chowing on some dinner plates and swigging booze having a grand ol' time in the wild west of vegas. So what do you order for a drink in vegas? A Mojito of course! Great drink, lots of lime and mint leaves just the way I like it. \n\nThe host accidentally got us confused w/ a large group (16 ppl) of Asian people. But no problem, only 7 mins lost, a quick fix and we were seated promptly. The nice thing, the hostess pulled out the seats for each of us and even gave us napkins color coordinated to our outfits. \n\nA bus boy comes out at this point and introduces himself. He lets us know who our waiter will be for the evening, nice touch, very professional. He then brings out the dinner rolls which were delicious especially the white chocolate pecan roll.\n\nAt this point, our waiter arrives and really has good energy and a good vibe about him, no attitude at all and really willing to genuinely help us w/ our orders. He helps us order both our drinks, appetizers, and main courses in one fell swoop. For the drinks, he quickly consults the sommelier who's always lurking in the background making sure everyone is getting the best possible drinks.  We also notice two busboys walk in and then strategically serving the amouse bouch to the both of us in perfect synchronicity!\n\nBBQ shrimp w/ Maytag blue cheese slaw. This is one to die for! From the first bite of the slaw, I was immediately hooked. Slaw this rich and flavorful w/ perfect crisp contrasting against the tangy shrimp w/ bbq sauce just works perfectly. \n\nSalmon Tartar, watercress, saffron sauce and caraway crackers. This one was excellent as well. A bit salty from the capers, but something about the various textures of the dish worked.\n\nBoth main entree dishes were once again brought out in perfect synchronicty by two different waitstaff. When the dishes arrive, it's an event! We even saw a table w/ 8 people and 8 different waitstaff who all rushed in w/ plates in hand, stood next to their customers, and when the tension built up a tad, and upon a slight non-verbal que by the lead waitstaff, presented the dishes in perfect synchronicity!\n\nFor the Roasted Rack of Lamb, this has got to be one of the best racks of lamb I've ever had! You know those racks where you're nibbling on every last remaining piece of lamb stuck to the bone even after you're finished... well, this was one of them. Almost put me in a hypnotic state... yes, this was one of them. Almost put me in a hypnotic state... yes, it was that good!\n\nPan Seared Mahi Mahi was an excellent dish. Fish was cooked perfectly w/ just enough citrus bite to cut through the fat of the fish while the cous cous was flavorful and the apricots were an excellent surprise.  \n\nRustic Apple Tart with caramel sauce, candied walnuts and cinnamon ice cream. The cinnamon ice cream was heaven. The apple tart wasn't too sweet, but just a tad dry... could be that Vegas humidity, or lack of. \n\nCreme Brulee was excellent. Smooth, creamy, and rich contrasting with that familiar crunch of the caramelized sugar on top. The mint leaves and cookie were a nice touch.\n\nChocolate Nut Truffles, Peanut Butter Balls, Lemon Bars. These were gratis, but by this time in the meal, we were about to pop so we took them to go. \n\nOK, all in all, one of the best restaurant experiences I have ever had! Food, Service, and Ambience were A++. I remember at one point going to use the restroom and upon returning, I find one of the busboys with my chair pulled out waiting for me to be seated. As I sit, he slides the chair in perfectly and hands me my color coordinatd napkin that is perfectly folded. That just about sums up the service. Not at any point in time did I ever feel that I had to do the \"hey, pass me the ball\" wave to get the waitstaff's attention. I always felt that I was being taken care of and never needed anything since they always seemed to be one step ahead. It really did seem like everything was in perfect rhythm... wait, how many \"perfects\" was that? Nonetheless, We left the restaurant into that clear Vegas night with that warm buzzing feeling from our meal... We'll be back!", "type": "review", "business_id": "5FE1Y9cZ-YOQA943nTi7cA"}

Unfortunately, the pickin's were slim in my youth  - not like today. \n\nWhen I go home I try to steer clear of the strip and go in search for the city's soul -- so when I read about Rosemary's I was intrigued. A peek at the menu and I realized this would be a splurge but not so much that I would break the bank. \n\nI took my parents, who still live in LV, and it was unanimous -- hidden behind a draped doorway, in just another innocuous strip mall, beats a culinary heart and a giving soul. Having long given up on the search for a good restaurant nearby, Mom and Dad were surprised to find a local restaurant so close to home. And, so good! \n\nFrom the bufala appetizer to the delicious desert cookies -- we were in heaven. The wine list offered selections that paired well with the food but didn't inspire me to explore something new -- although that's not a deal breaker -- this may be disappointing to a true vinophile. And, if it is, Rosemary's is worthy of your coveted bottle beginning with the word 'Chateau'. Bring it with you to celebrate the season of love or just to celebrate discovering an excellent new restaurant without the continuous soundtrack of mega bucks in the background.\n\nI held back from 5 stars due to the slow service. Slow and steady is fine especially when savoring flavors -- but it bordered on inattentive at times. I have a feeling Rosemary's will continue to improve their service and impress with their food  -- so I'm looking forward to returning and adding to this star.", "type": "review", "business_id": "5FE1Y9cZ-YOQA943nTi7cA"}

From the quizzical looks I get when I wear my Cesc Fabregas Arsenal jersey in public, to the \"huh?\" I get from bartenders at other bars when I ask if they can put a soccer match on, being a soccer fan is sometimes like being the red-headed stepchild.\n\nWhich is why I love this place so much.  Simply put, this is the best British Pub I have ever been to.  It isn't a big bar by most standards, but it's very homely and it just feels warm to be inside.  They have pool, darts and foosball for those interested in bar games.  They do have video poker like in most bars these days, but this is a bar better for socializing or watching a match than playing poker.  \n\nI just got back today from watching Arsenal play Barcelona in a UEFA Champions League match, and while the place was pretty empty when I got there 20 minutes before match time, practically all the seats were taken by kickoff.  The British Burger I ordered was absolutely delicious, and next time I must try the fish and chips.  Even though it was noonish, the people watching the match were rowdy and fun, and despite the intensity of a hugely important match were for the most part friendly.  While the fans are passionate and intense, you probably don't have to worry about brawls breaking out.\n\nThe only bad thing I can say about this place is that the parking lot of quite small and cramped.  If you're going here to watch a match, be sure to get there early, as it fills pretty fast, particularly if it's a popular club or country playing (I.E. Manchester United, Chelsea, Liverpool, Arsenal or England's National Team).  Besides, the smaller lot probably encourages designated driving, so you can experience those many beers and get home safely :)\n\nPROS:\n-Authentic British pub decor\n-Wide selection of beers \n-Plenty of bar games\n-Great Food!\n-Soccer, er, Football fans!\n\nCONS:\nSmall, cramped parking lot.", "type": "review", "business_id": "r70nuDpkR5-g1oShW2ANvA"}

I mainly buy clothes here so I wouldn't know much about trading or selling so I'm just going off as a customer purchasing an item. Today is THE day! And Buffalo Exchange made my day! I was so busy and stressing out to find a super awesome dress that yells HOLLYWOOD GLAMOUR. \n\nNow, my style is so mediocre so I was completely lost in trying to figure out what's Hollywood and glamorous at the same time. My eye captured this cute dress. Now I'm not one to do a double take on anything or a man, but baby I did a double take on this dress like it was Ryan Reynolds on a hot summer day in July! So I was hoping to find someone of good fashion sense to convince me that I needed to buy this dress. \n\nI checked into the dressing room to try this dress on hoping that putting it on and seeing how it looks will further convince me that I needed to buy it. It was awesome, but I told myself \"how the fudge am I going to spice this dress up so it looks glamourous?\" I ran out the dressing room looking lost, and asked the nice attendant, Arielle, how could I put this together. BAM!!! Low and behold that Arielle was like some sort of fashion stylist guru! She said, \"Some high heeled pumps. A little glitter. Hair up with a nice bob and a smokey eye would look good.\" That wonderful wonderful woman sold me!!! If you need some advice or a few fashion tips for direction I swear you need to hunt her down. (Robby she needs a raise for her expertise!)\n\nBut thats not all. It gets better. Oh...yes. I go up to the register. Robby the new manager rang me up. Tried to convince him to give Arielle a raise...while I did that, BAM! I saw that my dress rang up to $11 when the price tag said $20. On sale?  I tried to swindle Robby with my charisma to give me that $11 price. But, because Robby is just awesome by nature he gave it to me for $11. No charisma required. Or swindling. Robby you sold me AND the dress! \n\nI opt to pass on the bag to put my dress in, and took a 5 cent token which I can use to donate to any three organizations. I chose Shade Tree. There's my 5 cent good deed of the day. \n\nI walked away a happy camper and with a star dress at hand.

I'm NOT old, but I feel like I've progressed beyond overpriced Forever 21 and American Eagle castoffs.  Some of the clothes are pilled and torn, but still command a high price tag.  Why?  Why IS this?  Also, I'm sorry, but some of the things they resell are FUGLY.  My rule of thumb for clothes-shopping is that if I can't figure out which part of my body the garment is supposed to cover, it shouldn't be worn.  I'm too smart to have to ask the salesperson, \"what IS this, exactly?\"  \n\nI bet you could find some deals here if you hit it just right.  I don't doubt it.  However, I've been here probably a good ten times and I think I bought a purse once.  That's about it.

A quick scan of the lineup reveals a disappointing no. So right off the bat, this puts them at a disadvantage against Namaste.\n\nThen I found the Goat Curry. At an Indian buffet, I really only need one go-to item and luckily, the Goat Curry was off the hook! It's not quite the Naan heaven that is Butter Chicken, but paired with rice, I enjoyed every morsel.\n\nAs for the Naan, I like how they bring it out to order. This can lead to moments of Naan-less agony, but at least you know it's always warm and fresh when it comes to your table.  The Garlic Naan has an overpowering aroma and is the only way to fly.\n\nI haven't tried any of their Lassis, but that will definitely change today at the CMYE. I love me some Mango Lassi, but the other flavors are intriguing.\n\nOverall, I'm definitely a fan of this place. Quite honestly, I'd pick Namaste over Mint for one simple reason (which should be easy to deduce by now). Still, Mint is a solid lunch buffet choice.\n\nEDIT: I've since been back and I'm not sure why I thought the buffet area is small. There are quite a few dishes from which to choose.

It is not some thin breaded, greasy chicken piece of crap like most places will serve you. It is a juicy chicken thigh breaded to perfection and sliced up. This is definitely my favorite dish. Also, the BBQ chicken is quite tasty. They always grill it fresh which is awesome, but it can take awhile to get to you. It takes about 20 minutes to make, but it is worth the wait. Can't forget the student special; for under 5 bucks you get a teriyaki chicken bowl and a drink. It is enough to fill you up on the cheap.\n\nOn the other hand, I have been there a couple times and the food was not fresh and it tasted like straight shat.

I've never given anything two stars (you can check my record), and it's hard for me to even write this, but honestly I can't understand the positive reviews.  The only thing this place has going for it is a vintage ambience, but the food was exorbitantly priced for such mediocrity.  My boyfriend and I started with the fried calamari, which had no seasoning and no calamari.  Then he got the chicken special and I got ravioli.  For what little chicken was on his plate over linquine completely drowned in congealed cream sauce, it was remarkably average and needed to be doctored up.  My ravioli, while large, was the same.  We both were looking for someone to come around and shave some fresh parmesan over our meals, but all they offer is the shake can on the table.  None of this would be horrible if our plates were $10 or $12 dollars a piece, but his was TWENTY-EIGHT dollars (always ask how much the specials are first) and mine was $20--shocking (shocking!), to quote Joan Cusack.  For three small plates (the fried calamari, the chicken, and my ravioli), and just two small glasses of wine, the bill was $100.  Worst $100 ever spent on food.  In every other city, we can get two very well-put together and flavorful meals for the price of one forgettable piece of chicken at Casa Di Amore.

Eine gigantische Kette ist entstanden, Walgreens gibt es \u00fcberall. Allein in Las Vegas mindestens ein Dutzend mal, auch auf dem Strip habe ich zwei L\u00e4den gez\u00e4hlt. Wer in den USA mit dem Wagen unterwegs ist und in den Dunstkreis einer Stadt oder eines St\u00e4dchens kommt, braucht nur die Augen offen zu halten und wird in K\u00fcrze das bekannte Walgreens-Logo entdecken.\n (Siehe Foto unten) \n24 Stunden ge\u00f6ffnet, an jedem Tag des Jahres. Und diese extremen \u00d6ffnungszeiten werden in diesem Land von den K\u00e4ufern auch genutzt. Dadurch habe ich nie ein w\u00fchliges Walgreens erlebt. Einkaufen ist hier kein Stress, es ist kundenfreundlich und entspannt angenehm.\nUrspr\u00fcnglich eine kleine Drogeriekette mit angeschlossenen Pharmacys ist heute das Produktangebot von Walgreens weit gef\u00e4chert. Noch immer dominieren die Drogerieartikel wie Kosmetika, Produkte der Nahrungsmittelerg\u00e4nzung und all das, was wir auch hier in Deutschland kennen. Alles allerdings in viel gr\u00f6\u00dferer Produktvariation. Daneben hat Walgreens immer eine Pharmacy angeschlossen, in der man Medikamente erstehen kann. Hier werden auch die von \u00c4rzten verschriebenen Mittel ausgegeben. Wer also ein Wehwehchen hat und in den USA unterwegs ist  erste Anlaufstelle: Walgreens.\nAber auch wer einen Regenschirm sucht (in Vegas eher unwahrscheinlich), eine Taucherbrille, Sonnenbrille, Campingstuhl, Kaugummi, Holzkohle f\u00fcr den Grill, B\u00fcrsten, K\u00e4mme, Klebe, Schere, Papier etc. wird f\u00fcndig. Achten sollte man auf Angebote. Immer ist irgendetwas besonders g\u00fcnstig zu erwerben und sei es, dass man f\u00fcr den Preis von einem zwei Artikel der Sorte bekommt. Eine beliebte Variante.\nFeststellen musste ich, dass die Preisgestaltung offensichtlich in der Hand jedes einzelnen Walgreens-Marktes liegt. Ich kaufe mir bei meinen Reisen meist ein bestimmtes Walgreens-Produkt und vergleiche, um den besten mir m\u00f6glichen Walgreens-Preis zu bekommen.\nFazit: Walgreens  eine Institution in den USA. Ein Besuch ist immer empfehlenswert, besonders die gro\u00dfen Walgreens lassen einen nur staunen. Aber auch die kleineren Walgreens stehen f\u00fcr die Marke und entt\u00e4uschen nicht.

It doesn't deserve one star!\n\nI guess if you've only ever lived here, you don't know any better. Anyone who is a transplant from elsewhere, don't even bother. If you grew up skating at a rink where people cared about anything at all, this place will just bruise your soul. Here are ten reasons that this place SUCKS;\n\n1. The actual skating floor is in desperate need of professional restoration, and that is the best thing this place has going for it. \n\n2. The music is ridiculously loud. My teenagers complained, so it wasn't just me. \n\n3. The music is completely inappropriate for families. If I had been in there scheduling a birthday party for a child, I would have been horrified! They actually announced a child's birthday, and then played a song about having \"birthday sex\"!!!!!! Unbelievable! If you go on a Friday or Saturday night, you can watch teenagers just about having sex in the seating areas off to the side of the rink.\n\n4. They played a slower song and halfway through, started complaining over the intercom that people were supposed to be skating in couples or backwards. They never made the announcement at the beginning, and don't clear the floor before the change, so how was anyone supposed to know?\n\n5. They arbitrarily shut off most of the lights on the skating floor (I think they think it looks cool), and in addition to little kids falling all over the place, you can't see them, so then you run them over!\n\n6. They do very little in the way of games or interaction, and when they do, they do it in the laziest fashion possible. They announced that little Suzy's birthday group should come to the table for pizza, and just as those kids made it off the floor, they started the Limbo. Then they started it off with the pole lowered half way right from the first round. If you'd like any of those kids to come back, maybe start the pole at the top so everyone gets to go under at least once, dummies!\n\n7. You can spot the regular customers immediately - they're the one who knew to bring an IPod! Every song on every skating session we've ever been to has been the same, and played in the same order. The last time we were there, they played an entire disc twice, so you heard the same list of songs in the same order twice in the same day! When they finally finished the second round and put in a new CD, one song skipped so badly, it took almost 10 minutes to get all the way to the end. The girl that was working the booth was out in the lobby talking to people and never noticed.\n\n8. It is a safety nightmare. There were constantly people hopping the wall, skating in the wrong direction, people in shoes walking their kids around the rink, or worse, carrying small kids around while skating. Then they cut off all the lights on the floor, too! The last time we were there, kids were throwing one of those little rubber super-balls across the floor to each other, and letting it get loose all over the floor. Occasionally they do have floor guards out on the floor, but they are only interested in skating around taking to their friends, so the ball went unnoticed, even after we complained twice. I'd hate to be your insurance carrier.\n\n9. The music is horrible. Even when it is not horribly inappropriate, its just bad, and played altogether too loud. There is no mix of different tempos, different types of music, or anything. Its the same crap, in the same order every single time. It is a great place for uninterested, absentee parents to drop off their unattended children. It's a lousy place to attempt to enjoy any family time together. \n\n10. The rental skates are poorly maintained. My son went back up to the window with his because the wheels were visibly loose on one skate. Instead of fixing it or at least setting it aside to look at later, they put it back on the rack. We saw a wheel fall OFF someones rental skate while they were skating!\n\nAll they need to do is care just a little to improve this place. When you look across the floor, nobody is having fun! Nobody is laughing, no shuffle skating with friends, no enjoyment at all. Wanna make a fortune? Open a skating rink. If this place had ANY competition at all, they would've gone out of business years ago.", "type": "review", "business_id": "1boX71Ni6XGwMvzOLiekQg"}

It took forever to get our order in, to get plates, to get our check, to pay for the bill, etc.  Service was just lacking altogether.  By the time we did get our plates (which we had requested early on), our food was not hot.  Reminders about more chips, beans, and salsa were forgotten.\n\nFood was still good though!  Chips with warm refried beans and cheese and hot salsa are always a joy to munch on here.  Our party of three ordered a few dishes to share.\n\n* Carnitas de Puerco con guacamole, arroz, frijoles y pico de gallo ($8.99) - Generous amount of shredded pork.  More than enough for one person.  And it was moist and tasty, not dry at all.\n\n* 3 Enchiladas de Pollo con arroz y frijoles ($9.99) - It was good, not my favorite of the bunch. I spent more time eating everything else.  We chose the chicken for all three, although you can get beef or cheese as well.\n\n* Carne Asada (estilo Casa Don Juan) con arroz, frijoles y guacamole ($10.99) - A decent size piece of steak covered with onions.  It took forever to cut with the butter knife they give.  They either have to cut it in strips or give you a steak knife so you can cut into it better.\n\nWe also ordered three micheladas.  But the waiter said it's called something else when there's hot sauce in it.  I forgot.  Oh well.  But it was pretty good nonetheless.\n\nThere was a slight discrepancy with the bill where they charged us for another beer.  It's always a pain to find things added on your bill and having to get them to fix it.  So double check your bill when dining here.\n\nOverall, it's still a great place for Mexican food with great atmosphere.

I said, \"I love your guys' food!\" the second time I visited and they got that shy smile and said, \"Thanks, we really appreciate that.\"\n\nNot only is the food spectacular and well-priced, it's right around the corner from my house.

The service was great, with someone taking our drink orders right away and the waitress following up soon thereafter. The menu covers the basics -- omelets, scrambles, skillets and griddle items -- with everything customizable to your liking.\n\nOur drinks came out promptly, and so did the coffee cake that came with my girlfriend's scramble. You'll read about this coffee cake in other Yelpers' reviews, and with good reason: It's warm, soft, slightly gooey, and positively designed to make you crave coffee, as good coffee cake should.\n\nThe rest of our food was made perfectly to order, and while not the greatest food ever, definitely solid. The seasoned potatoes could have been a bit more seasoned, but then again, I compare all to the Egg & I's potatoes, so ... sorry, Cracked Egg. ;) Our water and coffee were kept filled and our check came promptly.\n\nBecause I live on the opposite side of the valley from the Cracked Egg, I probably wouldn't seek it out again (as other comparable venues such as Eggworks are closer), but if I was in the neighborhood one morning?

I saw a section of vintage National Geographic magazines, which I have become a collector of, but I didn't catch the prices they were selling them for --but I'll have to definitely come back to check them out. \nI just came in for a slight browse, but, instead was sucked into buying a meditation book that kept me in the store for 10 minutes, just breezing through the first chapter.

They also have an area where they teach Spanish lessons (located in the back) and areas to sit if you want to skim through some books.

Sometimes I wish he would care more about his Family than some random girl that he barely even knows. Makes me really sad that he treats us like this.. sorry guys.. I know this is a review.\n\nSo I took my parents to Hikari for AYCE. They LOVE Sashimi... I love fried food.. I know it's bad, but I like it so.. Here's what I ordered:\n\nSeaweed Salad (2x) - the first one was light, tasty, and fresh.. second time around it was way too salty and overly sauced.\n\nCucumber Salad - half moon size cuts, crisp juicy crunch... it was... ok.\n\nSalmon Skin Salad - Drowned in real tangy, vinegar dressing... made my tongue numb! There were bits of salmon meat Not skin that were hard as a rock, almost like bones... be careful in eating this... you can chip off your tooth if you're not watching your bite. However, there were pieces of Salmon Skin that were a light bite like potato chips... that was only a few.\n\nFresh Oysters - My Mother loved this and ate about 8 of them!!! And even had one more for dessert! Yikes! I had one but that sucker was huge and I had to really break it down to swallow it. I prefer those thin slimy kinds you just slide in your mouth and swallow... this was like WTHeck thick. My Parents loved it... me on the other hand passed on ordering more.\n\nTempura Combo - I had the whole thing.... the shrimp was ok... carrot, zucchini, onion, mushroom.. were nothing spectacular. The crunchy coating didn't have any flavor to it... disappointed.\n\nBaked Green Mussel - they cut the mussel in half, so you don't eat the whole piece... it was watery, mayonnaise was so sour, and it just tasted off.\n\nDynamite - Again mayonnaise was too tangy and too much. I couldn't taste anything, but the sourness. The bites of seafood were hard to chew like leather... not edible and had to take it out of my mouth a few times. Don't order it.\n\nKama - My Father ate the whole thing... said it was tender and flavorful.\n\nFried Rice (Shrimp) - I finished the whole dish. It was very delicious and almost ordered a second round, but wanted to try other dishes. Good choice if you like fried rice.\n\nHamachi (Yellow Tail) - My Mother enjoyed this very much and ordered it again.\n\nHotate (Scallop) - Very fresh and a beautiful white coloring... gleaming with perfection. It was satisfying and good!!! Probably the only thing I liked besides the fried rice at this place.\n\nAma Ebi ( Shrimp) - we all ate a few... it was cute and yummy.\n\nTuna Roll - Had no flavor, looked bad.. almost like a grayish color. My Mother only had one and said it was terrible. Shoot, it looked terrible. Had to hide the other five under another dish. Don't order it... you'll thank me.\n\nCaterpillar Roll - Nice presentation, but didn't really \"taste\" the roll. Didn't work for me.\n\nMiso Soup - it was soothing and steamy hot. Good start to this meal.\n\nEnded with Green Tea and Red Bean Mochi for dessert ($2), which isn't included in the AYCE deal ($27) The dessert was good... I liked the green tea more since it tasted fresh versus the red bean that tasted and looked kinda old.\n\nThe iced green tea was refreshing and the servers were very attentive in clearing our plates when we were done. The Sushi Chefs were all busy with requests and orders, but asked us from time to time if we were okay or wanted anything else. One chef with glasses seem to have a real cocky attitude, but maybe coz my face was all scabbed up and he didn't want to be nice to me... whatever. Other than that, I would say it's a \"decent\" place for AYCE but it will be one of those this dish was good and that dish was bad. It's not really consistent in having all their food being delicious and well cooked. Would I go here again?!?! Only if I have to.", "type": "review", "business_id": "bB1bVvOMkfvWFVbNmRl_VA"}

They have pool tables for fun, a second bar that opens up on more crowded nights, and a deck/loft area that has seating for intimate gatherings. \n\nMy friends and I personally love to go to the second floor and hang out. Here, you won't bother the more gung-ho concert goers, and you can also share some beers. On the other hand, if you want to get up-close and personal with an artist, the front row is beckoning, and the artists normally stay around afterwards to converse with their fans.\n\nHappy hour is a great deal, BOGO for select beers, and the selection isn't too shabby. The music trivia is also a blast.\n\nI am constantly keeping tabs on which artists go through the Saloon. They bring a nice assortment of local and non-local acts, and their acoustics are perfect for singer-songwriters trying to get intimate with the crowd. The cover/ticket prices are very reasonable, and a lot of talent definitely comes through their establishment.", "type": "review", "business_id": "t7B85p8vXnDVqewsJJuxfw"}

In this room, they generally play top 40'ish type stuff... things to keep you up and bouncing.\n\nYou can move into the second room which is a really cool dance floor. The way the mirrors are set up is cool... (gotta check the 'do you know.)  The music in this room is different than the last room, moving to dance music or dance mixes of the top 40.\n\nThen you can go out the doors in this room outside and lounge around on the sidewalk, watching traffic, drunk pedestrians (which is always entertaining) or the light rail.\n\nFrom the first room, there is an exit to an outside bar where the smokers go. This one plays cool music too with tvs and has more of a bar-ish feel, but is great with lots of plants and a tropical look to it.\n\nThe only thing that doesn't give this place 5 stars is the price and the women's bathroom is WAY too small and it's hot in there.

If you're on a date or entertaining an out-of-town couple, it's pretty hard to beat.  But if you're looking to feed a softball team or a sizable collection of drinking buddies, don't even think about it.\r\n\r\nGetting seated at Bianco reminds me of doing the same at Zachary's ( http://www.yelp.com/biz/JsqK99Ka8gIgu1ZtzDupRg ) in Oakland, Ca.  You walk in, a receptionist takes your name, and they give you a projected wait time that can be as long as an hour.  Right around this time I'm thinking it'd be nice if we could wait in a bar, chat over a beer, and somehow be summoned back  when our table was ready. To my utter delight, our waitress informed us that LO AND BEHOLD!!! SUCH A SETUP EXISTED!!!  We were quickly shooshed over to a rather pleasant bar next door where the lengthy wait passed by painlessly as we sipped drinks and chatted up the locals.  The bar was crowded too....and I had my doubts about the restaurant staff's claim of a Saint Bernard-like ability to find us in the crush of humanity....but find us they did, and minutes later we were seated and perusing the bill of fare.\r\n\r\nFirst off, a glimpse at the menu told me I was in for something completely out of the ordinary.  Pizza's only came in thin crust, and were served in only one size.  There was no build-your-own list of toppings, and the pre-defined combinations didn't look anything like standard pizza parlor fair.  On the other hand, the sizable wood-fired pizza oven in the corner looked fascinating, and Bianco himself was running the kitchen with a focus and dedication that bordered on religious fanaticism.\r\n\r\nTires hit pavement when the pizzas showed up.  I've gotta say it was dang tasty, and I didn't regret the wait or the expense one bit.  Still, if you're craving a more Chicago-style pizza, this just doesn't cut it.  The ingredients are fantastic, the preparation is perfect, and the ambiance isn't lacking in the slightest......but halfway through my first pie I found myself yearning for something thicker, and wound up fighting the urge to grab two pieces at once or fold one over to simulate a thicker slice.  If, like myself, you hail from San Francisco, it's similar to Pauline's Pizza ( http://www.yelp.com/biz/tIzKxpADKMMmzDr5n07lQg ) on Valencia between 14th and Duboce.\r\n\r\nAll in all, Pizzeria Bianco was great, but nothing to set the world on fire.  It was tasty, and it was without doubt a high-quality pizza.  East Coasters with their love for a thinner, more spartan pie will probably see it's virtues....But as for myself, I see it in the same way I do Pauline's Pizza in San Francisco...memorable and worth the visit, but it  never comes to mind when the pizza craving rears it's ugly head...", "type": "review", "business_id": "VVeogjZya58oiTxK7qUjAQ"}

I have found some amazing people within the states most notably in the Bay Area, Southern California and Chicago, but was simply blown away by the perfection that is Pizzeria Bianco.\n\nI came here on a Friday afternoon and there was no wait for a table of five. We sat down and were super excited to sample some of the best pizza in America.\n\nI started off with a salad consisting of fresh mozzarella, basil, olive oil and tomatoes. It is probably impossible to make that list of ingredients taste bad and this salad did not disappoint. Everything worked perfectly together. The salad was light, so fresh and so damn good.\n\nI had to order the margherita pizza because that's the best way to judge a place I feel. The pizza came out piping hot and it was absolutely beautiful. The crust was for sure a clear highlight. It had a beautiful char and a great chew to it. The combination of sauce, fresh mozzarella and basil made this easily one of the best pizzas I have ever had. So amazing.\n\nI also tried a few slices of the Rosa pizza and that thing blew me away. The combination of onions, paremesan reggiano and arizona pistachios was a flavor I had never experienced. The pizza was rich and so ridiculously flavorful. It was one of the best specialty pizzas I have ever had.\n\nI came into Pizzeria Bianco with insanely high expectations and I believe the restaurant exceeded them. The ingredients are what really set this place apart from everyone else and the pizza is simply amazing. Bianco sets the standard for Neapolitan pizza in the United States and I am not sure there is another place that could beat it....", "type": "review", "business_id": "VVeogjZya58oiTxK7qUjAQ"}

However, I left a believer in this tiny re-purposed building serving up Napoli-style pies, and have been back since. Each time, I was with a large group, so there was a bit of a wait. No sweat, as Bar Bianco (the accompanying small building twenty yard away from the pizzeria) is a cozy \"bar\" that feels more like someone's house (as it probably was when built in the early 1900's). The service at BB has been dynamite on both visits. After getting seated in PB's one room that houses the dining area, small bar, and brick oven, the service was prompt and friendly. Between my two visits, I have tried each pie, and the Rosa gets my vote as the premier pizza on the menu. Be brave and order it sans sauce (as the chef intended). It will not disappoint. Other favorites include the Biancoverde and Wiseguy.

I had avoided it, however, because I heard that the food was overpriced and only average quality.  That assessment turned out to be spot on.  Bamboo Club is a restaurant that appears to be fully committed to emulating P.F. Changs, while charging a higher price per plate.  My girlfriend had the honey sesame tofu and liked it.  I had the Hawaiian Macadamia Nut tofu and thought it was mediocre at best.  It lacked any real flavor, which could admittedly be in part caused by the tofu substitute for chicken.  However, I regularly substitute tofu for meat in Asian restaurants with a much more flavorful success.  The incorporation of the macadamia nut into the dish was interesting and proved to be the most flavorful part of the meal.  The brown rice was bad though.  I am not sure how a Asian Bistro messes up rice, but they did.  Plates at Bamboo Club typically price over $15, which makes for a dining experience whose cost far exceeds satisfaction.

This seemed like a good deal. I figured we wouldn't be in the hotel much so it wouldn't matter. Well.....it did. It was awful. \nWhere do I begin. The shuttle from the airport forgot we were there so he dropped us off last but at least we got a tour I guess. After a long, hot ride we figured paying for early check in was worth it. We booked a non-smoking room on a non-smoking floor...the room reeked of cigs. Went to the front desk to ask for a diff room. The \"manager\" didn't even look up at me while i was talking or apologize for it. He handed me a different key and walked away. Really??? I was livid when I got upstairs and the key didn't work. Room service was nice enough to let us in since we had a baby with us. As we were settling in a woman walked in with a key that worked. They gave her the same room. OMG. It was just a mess! \nBy that time we were starving but still had to get a room with a key that worked. We waited for a long time at the front desk and finally they let us stay in the room we were already in. Had to ask them to refund the early check in fee. They did not offer us any compensation for our troubles. Horrible customer service. Actually everyone that worked there was rude and unwelcoming. \nAfter that whole mix up we went to eat in the hotel because we were too hungry to go anywhere else and Roxy's diner was pretty bad.....we waited a long time to order and the food was bland...fries were old...service was dead. We were ready to leave Vegas at that point. Our trip got a little better later but this hotel is horrible. Our bathroom light went out twice and they took really long to address it. It was 11pm they finally showed up. The casino is really smokey. The only good thing was starbucks in the hotel.

Compared to the other restaurant I went to, this is, in fact, not the best Thai food in the United States, nor even in Las Vegas.  Going by taste alone, I enjoyed my dinner, but having ordered the exact same thing elsewhere, it did not match up.  It should not matter what menu I order from, if something is served on the menu from a restaurant touted as the best in the United States, I shouldn't have to limit myself to a particular item or set of items to taste this quality.\n\nThe location, as others have mentioned, is absolutely horrible.  Off the strip on Sahara, it's hidden away in an area that makes me feel uncomfortable every time I go there.  The interior was nothing special and did not stand out to me...seemed quite unauthentic, way to strip-mallish, but alas I've never been to Thailand, I would not know what is truly authentic.  We happened to sit nearby a group who met with the owners, who both seemed nice but Bill was quite dressed down for whatever he was doing that evening (sweatshirt and sweatpants...not quite what I was expecting).  Like I've mentioned in other reviews, appearance and first impressions mean a lot when you eat out...much of the reason why many never come back.\n\nTo have to put so much into going here (reservations a week in advance or waiting a few hours if you come unannounced, I was expecting more.  The reviews here were for the most part spot on, but to each their own I suppose.

Me, my spouse, my toddler, and my infant. We had a gift card for $50, and decided to use $40-ish and apply the rest as tip. You have the choice of sitting at the sushi bar, the teppanyaki grill/tables, or a regular table. We opted for the regular table since we had the kids. \n\nThey do have high chairs, which is nice! The grill-folk do high-fire tricks and a lot of spatula clanging, so if you have a skiddish toddler... probably not the right place to go unless you enjoy eating with a two year old sitting on your head. The seating in the regular table area was a bit awkward. Giant chairs on wheels that you sink into. The waitress chooses that moment as I am weirdly scooting back in while trying not to sink through to the floor to come up and greet us.\n\nShe was nice enough, bubbly and friendly. That, however, is the only positive comment to be had about the service. Snail paced is the best phrase to use in regards to food preparation and delivery. \n-15 minutes till we got to order and got our drinks.\n-15 minutes for the appetizer (chicken katsu, which was pretty good. crunchy and well seasoned). \n-30 minutes for dinner (2 chicken teriyaki bento boxes. chicken was good. came with a huge portion of tempura shrimp and veggies. very reasonable for $15 or so). \n-30 minutes for the check (I asked if I could use the remaining $9 and change as tip and was told that I could not and would have to take the remainder as a new gift card).\n-15 minutes for a piece of banana cheese cake in a box (ordered this because I didn't want a $9 giftcard sitting around. when they finally brought it to me, it was a mushy pile that had been thrown in a box. picture added here to show the cafeteria style glop that was $8).\n20 minutes for change (because I could not leave the tip, I had to break a $100 bill. I asked for a $10, a $5, and five $1 somewhere in the mix of that change. I received a $50, a $10, and some $20. So I had to wait an additional 5 minutes while I flagged someone down to get the appropriate change. All this for a tip that in the end I probably should have not even bothered to give! Maybe I should have left my banana glop as a tip). \n\nOver 2 hours for 3 and 1/2 star food and a box of banana cheesecake baby food mash is a bit much for me and my family. Thank goodness we didn't order anything complicated, we would probably still be sitting there waiting!!! \n\nI have tried to call 3 times on different days at different times to talk to a manager about the appalling service, have left my name and number each time. Have not spoken to her yet. I was told \"if she doesn't call you, just keep trying\". I find that exceptionally odd. I am trying to let you know about crappy service, and you are not calling me back. Gee, I wonder where your staff get their laid back barely working attitude from.

I've only been here once, and it's been a year since I've last went there, but I do remember how much I enjoyed the Kobe Burger I had (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Cni2l-VKG_pdospJ6xliXQ?userid=F_5_UNX-wrAFCXuAkBZRDw).  Since it was my first ever taste of Kobe style beef, I ordered it plain and simple, just to be able taste the beef and figure out why the hell do people rave about it so much.  To be honest, I didn't notice a huge difference, but it was probably because I haven't had regular burger for weeks before that.  Needless to say, it was very good.  I was very curious about their Rossini Burger, but I couldn't come to myself to pony up $60 for a burger.  I've been hearing good things about it though, and also their Veggie Burger that I saw Hubert Keller make from scratch on his TV show.  \n\nI don't know what to say about their Chocolate Burger (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Cni2l-VKG_pdospJ6xliXQ?select=4TM4IUNQlmkPap-kkwGIPw) as it really took me by surprise because they really did a good job making it look like a real burger.  I wasn't even sure how to go about eating it whether to knife n fork it, or eat it using my hands like a real burger.  I decided on the latter and that probably wasn't such a good idea as the strawberries and mint leaves kept falling out.  It was very good though and was a fitting way to finish your meal at a burger joint.\n\nI'm actually happy to say that I was overwhelmed by the pure customization you can have with your burger over there.

However, my Kobe beef burger, despite only being cooked to medium and still nice and pink inside, was really dry and flavorless. There was just not enough fat in my burger. No juiciness. And since the burger was very basic other than the cheese, there was nothing else to mask the forgettable patty. Perhaps I should have added some truffle and foie gras to liven it up, but then I'd just be enjoying those things, rather than the burger itself.\n\nIf you're going to come here, spend a bit more and get their specialty burgers, I guess.

Mr. Flay's west coast version was a dream realized only 5 years ago and being situated in a place like Caesars Palace seems ideal.  After all, being the predominant cuisine is Southwest, what better location (aside from Arizona / New Mexico) than Las Vegas?\n\nWhat is strange to me is that the prices are significantly higher in Las Vegas than the New York location.  A slab of fish of any type could be had for $2-3 less and this includes most of the other appetizers / entrees.  I have no problem paying more for better food, but this does not trump anything that could be had in New York.\n\nThe restaurant itself is gorgeous.  A great mix of vibrant colors surround the dining area, with a contemporary feel with an elegant twist.  The funky shapes accompanied by the eclectic decor, which really pounces on the New American theme, while retaining a Southwest element in the food.  I'd give the nod to Las Vegas over New York for ambiance and the overall interior look, however, I expect this since this location is significantly newer.\n\nService is fantastic.  Our waiters were extremely knowledgeable in the food and were able to make excellent recommendations that were enough to impress our guests.  The menus change often and often times it is completely different than anything offered in New York or the Bahamas.\n\nOn a whole Mesa Grill is a real decent place to catch a great meal for business and pleasure.  Most of my business meetings have been during their lunch hour, which I prefer over dinner.  It's not the best in the Bobby Flay restaurant family, but certainly not the worst.", "type": "review", "business_id": "DO3Gk17RyJVW7zYMCtYPnw"}

We chose appetizers based on previous reviews and these were delicious as were most of our desserts. Our entrees however when finally delivered were a huge disappointment - my chili relleno was awful - it practically oozed with so much cheese I couldn't find the chili in there and the chicken was basically no better than business class airplane food.

My love for Anthony Bourdain turned me into an Flay-hater for no reason. Everyone has seen that episode of No Reservations--yes? Well, sorry for all the mean words Bobby. I'm the newest fan of Mesa Grill!\n\nFIRST: The Tiger Shrimp & Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale is a signature Bobby Flay dish. I think my server saw me drool a little. I tried to be casual as I scraped every last bit of sweet masa from the corn husk and scooped up every last bit of that buttery sauce. This is the tamale of my dreams.\n\nSECOND: This is the way a Green Chile burger is supposed to taste: juicy and flavorful. The burger was cooked exactly to my specifications and had the most wonderful flavor. It was huge and a little difficult to eat. But I made it work. Little to no heat, but more sweet and savory which was definitely up my alley.\n\nDESSERT: If you've ever eaten a spoon full of shaving cream, you'll know how the key lime sorbet tasted. Not that I regularly eat shaving cream, but every time I took the spoon to my mouth that's all I could think about. The fruit compote spiked with chili was not my cup of tea. I'll be direct and say it was awful. I would've traded this for another tamale.\n\nI downed a few of those White Peach Bellinis, but I stopped at 3 to avoid looking like a drunk at 11:30am on a Sunday. Adds up at $12 a glass, but quite refreshing. My server was polite, formal, and attentive. CELEBRITY DOPPELGANGER: he looked just like Robert Irvine from Dinner: Impossible!\n\nThe savory dishes were a positive slap in the face.

What's up with that, Yelp? My opinion is just as valide as anyone else's!!! I'll repost as often as I need to get the word out.\n\nOnce a Madison nightlife gem, Opus seems to have lost its soul and has degenerated into one part unwelcoming private bar, one part overflow of the louder, more obnoxious bars in the area. How could a place that seemed almost too refined for a college town lose so much of its shine, you ask?\n\nFour words: New Ownership, Poor Management.\n\nFrom the minds that brought you Madison's Chili's restaurant experience (East *and* West), the new owners/bar-tenders have managed to retain the Opus namesake but little else. \n\nOnce one of the few mainstream nightspots that had an exotic, out-of-the-norm, queer-friendly atmosphere, the Opus experience was as much about the friendly, quirky, but always classy wait staff as it was about the drink and food menu. Attentive but never bothersome, the waiters/bartenders would not hesitate to offer samples of new martinis, offer shots with the staff if one happened to sit at the bar, and genuinely entertaining conversation and banter. They took pride in the presentation of the (sometimes off-the-menu and custom-made) drinks they served and took aims to make sure their customers enjoyed themselves.\n\nWhen an establishment asks its customers to pay between $7 and $12 per drink, customers are paying for more than alcohol. In its better days, Opus offered a relaxed, upscale, romantic and intimate spot ideal for both dates and smaller gatherings of friends. The music was a swanky eclectic mix and played at just the right volume for conversation. Even when it was full (as it often was on the weekends), the place retained its lounge atmosphere, and patrons respected this image by dressing-up/dressing well (though the unwashed hipster look was also welcomed).\n\nThat is what Opus was before the new ownership. After taking over, one of the owners installed herself as bartender and let go of the other bartenders and wait staff in rapid succession, paring down the staff to just two servers, one of whom works with a perpetual scowl and seems bothered to take one's order.\n\nThe quality of the martinis has declined noticeably in terms of taste and even more so in terms of presentation and variety. The owner has reduced the number of specialty martinis, exotic liqueurs, and off-the-menu options. The music has changed to something more befitting of a dance floor, often too loud to hear your date or friends speak. Monday nights are now \"game nights\"-- patrons can now play Monopoly and checkers in a dimly-lit martini bar. The owner's new target audience is essentially the overflow from the loud, frat-boy friendly Madison's across the street. The new Opus business strategy is quantity over quality, in line with their previous fast-food restaurateur work experience.\n\nWhen it's not packed with loud crowds complaining about the martini prices, the owner invites her friends to the bar and devotes all her attention to serving them for free. While this in itself is not necessarily a bother to the average patron, it just so happens that some of her friends happen to be obnoxiously rude and act as if they are at their friend's basement bar, and you're intruding. I have witnessed them on several occasions leering at and bothering other patrons, causing trouble with patrons minding their own, and threatening them with physical violence. At one point there was a physical altercation between the owner's friends and two seemingly self-contained patrons; in the end, the owner sided with her friends and the bar quickly emptied, though it was apparent that even the wait staff thought poorly of the owner and her friends. One's only option is to pay the tab, leave, and spend money elsewhere.\n\nWhen a bar changes hands, it's expected that the new owners will bring their own ideas and methods to the establishment. However, it was clear to anyone who had frequented the bar in the past that Opus had its unique place on King St, an unpretentious but sophisticated upscale lounge, where one could easily spend a hundred dollars and feel like they got their money's worth. I was a patron of the bar for a few years before and about six months after the ownership change, and though I wasn't particularly close to the previous owners and staff, I did feel that a lot had changed, and for the worse. I posted my thoughts on Craig's List and found that many others had a similar impression.\n\nTo recap, there is a marked loss of the intimate, refined feel of the place, the owner's friends are present and obnoxious enough to be considered a noteworthy nuisance, the warmth of the staff is noticeably lacking, and the atmosphere has changed considerably.\n\nFor whatever reason, my review, as well as as those from a few others, have been removed. We will repost as often as we need to!", "type": "review", "business_id": "vGCetjJwnPU5bqoNxFM3sw"}

As a former server I know that there are often many variables out of your control when it comes to food availability, kitchen promptness, and staffing issues. None of these seemed to be the reason behind our miserable experience at Nick's today. Our server just seemed straight up incompetent. \n\nAfter we sat with our drinks for 20-25 minutes after we'd ordered (and it was not busy) it became obvious that our server had taken my boyfriend's meal to the wrong table. By the time she realized her error, my plate had sat in the window for ten minutes. She brought me the soggy veggie melt with a vague apology about the wait we could anticipate for his plate to arrive. When it did, fiveminutes later, she dropped it off without a word and proceeded to avoid us for the rest of our meal. My theory is she was anticipating a complaint so she drew less anxiety from simply standing behind the bar and chatting with her colleagues. My boyfriend had to walk up to her to ask for drink refills after she attended to the table next to us, but walked right past our empty glasses.\n\nBesides the food being soggy and bland, the service was ultimately the biggest disappointment. The place seemed really disorganized and every time an order would be up, the servers all seemed really confused about was on the plates and where they should go. \n\nRarely do I stiff a waitress by leaving less than 20 percent.

The pizza in my mind is a little weak - I don't like how they cute them in squares and the flavors are too overpowering, like they need to take of one ingredient on each menu item.

I was happy with their selection of hard to find horror, indie, and foreign movies.

I went in the next day with my receipt and a completely unwrapped to trade up for the blu-ray. The blu ray was more expensive than a competitor and really the reason I bought the DVD in the first place is I thought it was a good deal for the blu, and I'm trying to be a savvy shopper. They refused to give me my credit back or cash even after speaking with the manager, stating that its their policy only to issue store credit. But I paid cash/debit for it yesterday and barely touched it. This is an injustice and I told them they had lost a long-time customer and that I would never be back. It's just bad service to hold someone's money ransom, which is exactly what is taking place when the company has their perfect product back on the shelf but you are forced to spend that same money at the store or loose it. I checked their website FAQs and the owner states \"Like most stores, we don't give cash or credit card refunds...\" really, most stores? I think I can name a few: target, best buy, wal-mart, costco, grocery stores, frys electronics and so on and so on\n\nMy fellow consumer's, don't give money or time to a company that takes advantage of their customer's.

When we first pulled up, I was amazed at the festiveness of the front of the casino section, decorated to look like the famous, colorful Bourbon Street in New Orleans. Walking in, everything has a New Orleans festivity about it, colorful and sparkling. A perfect welcome to Vegas.\n\nThe rooms were clean and bigger than I expected. We got a higher up room so that we had a lovely view overlooking the city, especially at sunset. The resort fee comes with a safe, but no refrigerator. But really, it had everything we needed.\n\nThere were only a couple of minor issues - one of the room keys didn't work at first, so we had to get that fixed, and still after that, the room key cards often took a few tries to work. Also, they didn't leave a \"Do Not Disturb\" sign to prevent our room from being cleaned during our stay (we like our privacy), so we had to flag down a housekeeper, but eventually they found one. So neither thing was a big deal.\n\nThere are probably a dozen different restaurants on the first floor of the hotel, so we ate right there often either before we left in the morning or then at night. And we liked the casino; the boyfriend spent a lot of extra time on the slot machines while I was sleeping, and we could just come back up and take naps.\n\nThe pool looked fantastic, too. I didn't actually have time to get in and swim around, but I stuck my feet in and hung out for a while a couple times just to chill. It's a big, clean pool, with a smaller wading pool and a hot tub and plenty of lounge chairs.\n\nI also enjoyed the mini arcade right outside the bowling alley, with DDR, which didn't seem to be very busy when I was there. The bowling alley looked fun, but we didn't get a chance to try it out. Same with the movie theatre!\n\nReally, I think The Orleans is a better value than any of the hotels on the Strip. Especially if you get a cheap rental car, like we did, it's just a few minutes' drive to the Strip, or you can find plenty of things to do without even leaving!", "type": "review", "business_id": "lddbHJKgFvnVWabK-M8TPA"}

In addition they have some Greek items, a nice selection of well seasoned Chinese dishes and fried shrimp. Their desserts are above average and the salad station offers chilled grilled veggies along with an array of nice salad toppings.\n\nThe servers are always friendly and attentive.

She is always easy to work with and maintains a high-level of professionalism without being stand-offish or cold in any way.\n\nLiz is amazing and I can't wait to see her for more body jewelry!\n\n-------------\n\nAs for the shop in general?

For the average person looking to blow all there money in Vegas the Bellagio may just have some of the regular suites available at about $200 a night. The hotel keeps with the more recent trend of super giant hotels and is absolutely one of the nicest hotels in Vegas. \n\nThe restaurants downstairs are wonderful, (and about $50 per person average)  and offer just about anything you might want. the beds and rooms are very adequately sized even for a regular suite. I do believe all of them have a safe in the side of the entertainment center and a mini bar capable of costing you more than you might expect, (even once you know how much your room is). Eventually after about three days the impressive facade begins to be more noticeably just that and then you begin to think if there might have been somewhere else you could have spent all that money. The bottom line is, you go to the Bellagio to say that you stayed there and you tell everyone how grate it was there, but in the end it's really just a nicer hotel that costs a little more. There is a lot of hype and this place will live up to most of it. It's up to you whether or not you want to see how the experience stacks up to your expectations.

The external to the room facilities in the casino/resort are quite alright. The room, maybe it was the rate that we paid, it wasn't the best. It looked like one of those regular extended stay hotel rates. It was nothing worth writing home about, no wow factor, just another hotel room. We wanted a king bed, but got 2 queen beds, so one bed ended up being our clothes pile! The bathroom was so very normal and under lit. The shower area barely had any light falling on it. The toilet paper used was amongst the lowest quality, not what you would expect to find in a 4 star resort. I sort of started to think that we should have paid that 200$ extra for 3 nights for a Cosmopolitan or Aria.

I know I am not a high roller but I had reserved three rooms  for two nights each so i expected some respect. Instead the girl at check in was rude and short. She acted like I was an idiot when I asked questions about hotel policies (early check out,room charges, leaving a credit card on file) Not only that, check in was painfully slow. I had reserved two basic as cheap as it gets rooms and \"west wing king\". The \"west wing king\" I already had paid a more expensive deposit for and I was looking forward to enjoying. A member in my party had mentioned we wished to be close together and she downgraded our room!!! Luckily i caught her on it and was able to fix it.\nI asked room service to bring us another box of tissues and two pillows and they told me no problem, 20 mins later a hotel employee came to our room with the pillows but no tissues and just told us to go to the gift shop?\n\n\noverall i think the mgm is a good deal but I want to get spoiled and feel like a king, try elsewhere.", "type": "review", "business_id": "eWPFXL1Bmu1ImtIa2Rqliw"}

Kein Hotel in Las Vegas bietet so eine sch\u00f6ne Pool-Landschaft. Au\u00dferdem wird hier alles geboten, was man will: gutes teures Essen oder eher billigeres, Gambling, Shows, etc. Schade ist aber, dass im Gegensatz zum letzten Besuch der Arcade-Bereich deutlich verkleinert wurde zugunsten der CSI Attraktion.\nLeider war auch ein Pool die gesamte Zeit geschlossen, was nicht begr\u00fcndet wurde. Daf\u00fcr war der Rest der Pool-Landschaft wie immer super. Und trotz Sommersaison waren gen\u00fcgend Liegen frei f\u00fcr uns. Ab 17 Uhr werden aber fast alle Poolbereiche geschlossen, was sehr \u00e4rgerlich ist.\nDas Zimmer (Bungalow Suite) war riesig und hatte drei Fernseher: einen alten vor dem Bett, dann einen riesigen Flachbild-Schirm-Fernseher f\u00fcr den Wohnbereich und dann noch ein TV-Ger\u00e4t, dass im Spiegel im Bad integriert war.\nDas Bett war sehr bequem, genauso waren genug Schr\u00e4nke vorhanden. Das Bad hatte eine riesige Massage-Dusche mit zus\u00e4tzlicher Regendusche, dazu zwei Waschbecken.\nLeider gibt es keine K\u00fchlschr\u00e4nke oder Wasserkocher auf dem Zimmer.\nAu\u00dferdem hatten wir extreme Probleme mit dem Housekeeping. Zwei mal wurde unser Zimmer gar nicht gemacht. Produkte wie Duschgel, etc. wurden h\u00e4ufiger vergessen. Einmal kam Housekeeping nachts um 1, nachdem wir uns beschwert hatten. Allerdings dauerte es lange, bis das Housekeeping auch an unserem Zimmer ankam. Anstatt 20 Minuten dauerte die Reinigung dann auch 45 Minuten. Als wir fragten, weshalb das so lange dauerte, wurden wir bezichtigt, dass unser Zimmer scheinbar extrem dreckig sein m\u00fcsste, wenn das Personal so lang braucht.\nUns wurde au\u00dferdem ein Turndown-Service f\u00fcr die n\u00e4chsten Tage versprochen, der aber nie kam.\nDa wir in einer Woche viel gespielt haben im Casino, hat uns der Player's Club au\u00dferdem zugesichert, zwei N\u00e4chte gratis zu bekommen. Beim Check-Out war davon dann keine Rede mehr und die Mitarbeiter konnten uns nicht weiterhelfen.\nBei einem weiteren Problem bez\u00fcglich von \u00d6ffnungszeiten einer Mall, nahmen wir den Concierge Service zur Hilfe. Auch da konnte uns zun\u00e4chst nicht weitergeholfen werden, was mich \u00fcberrascht hat. Normalerweise sollten Concierge gut informiert sein \u00fcber ihre Stadt. Die Wartezeit beim Concierge war teilweise auch sehr lang (\u00fcber 20 Min.)\nAuch die Wartezeit beim Valet-Parking dauerte manchmal l\u00e4nger als 20 Minuten. Immerhin ist das Valet Parking gratis, genauso wie der Internet-Zugang.\nM\u00e4nner sollten sp\u00e4t abends nicht mehr allein im Casino unterwegs sein, da sie andauern von scheinbaren Hostessen angesprochen/angeflirtet werden. Das kann sehr nervig werden, wenn die Freundin oben im Zimmer ist und man nur was zu trinken holen wollte. Komisch, dass sowas offensichtlich immer noch tolleriert wird vom MGM.\n\nAlles in allem w\u00fcrde ich immer wieder kommen in dieses Hotel. Allerdings schafft es das MGM Grand nicht, meinen Aufenthalt zu einem v\u00f6llig perfekten Erlebnis zu machen. Vielleicht kommt das noch. Und vielleicht macht auch endlich wieder der gesamte Poolbereich irgendwann auf.", "type": "review", "business_id": "eWPFXL1Bmu1ImtIa2Rqliw"}

If you want to go cheap, you can get the bowls or eat here for lunch specials.  I have never bothered with their sushi or tempura.  I don't recommend you do so unless you aren't very picky.\n\nAnyhoo, at least they ask whether or not you want your miso soup before the meal or with it.  In case such things are important for you to know, miso soup is supposed to be served with the meal.  Personally, I don't care one way or the other, but it is a good check point for if you are an authenticity nut.\n\nThis place is exactly on par with the old Sushi King at the Stardust.

Love suite... this should be interesting..\n\nOkay so our room ends up having a hot tub andddddd mirrors above our king size bed...we are definitely in the love suite, HAHA! But hey, we'll take it! I slept so comfortably that night I didn't even know my two other friends were next to me--until I looked up at the mirror and saw them..\n\nTurns out the latest checkout time we could request is 11am, but for an extra $30 we could get a late late checkout at 4pm. As 4pm came around, the housekeeping lady knocked on our door and told us we could stay til 6! Thanks Imperial Palace!", "type": "review", "business_id": "CrlViaCIcMeQuZc63tbdQA"}

It was a bit far from the center of the strip ~10 minutes walking. The decorum of the restaurant was very cute and resembles a modern cafe in France. Casual and delicious! \n\nService was OK in that there seemed to be no designated waiter per table so you had to flag one down to ask for the check. However, they did refill our glasses multiple times, so I can't complain. Bottled or sparkling water are complimentary. \n\nI recommend coming for brunch, which is only offered on weekends. Their lunch menu is very limiting but it is still possible to pick out some interesting and tasty dishes. If you have never had escargot, I would recommend trying it at Mon Ami Gabi because it is not as slimy (which may seem revolting).\n\nI came here on weekday afternoon. We started with the Escargots de Bourgogne which is oven roasted snails cooked in garlic herb butter. I believe this is true, butter makes EVERYTHING tastes good. ;) I like escargot and this dish made me like it more. If I had a larger group and a bigger appetite, I would have tried more dishes from their Hors D'Oeuvres because it truly gives you a taste of authentic french cuisine. I would recommend Country Style P\u00e2t\u00e9, Chicken Liver Mousse, Sea Scallops Gratin\u00e9es  and Oysters Du Jour if you're feeling adventurous.\n\nFor lunch, their offerings are predominantly, sandwiches, crepes, salads and steak frites (which is essentially steak with thinly cut fries).\nFor brunch, I have heard good things about their french toast, pancakes, crepes and eggs benedicts. \n\nThe two of us ordered the Croque Madame and Seafood Crepe for entrees. Croque Madame was fine but the seafood crepe was show-stopper. First of all, the crepe was buttery and thin, strewn over with a b\u00e9chamel cream sauce. The shrimps and scallops were fresh, tender and sweet. And the combination of textures and flavors satiated my palate. Definitely recommended!\n\nOverall, I enjoyed Mon Ami Gabi and will come back next time for their brunch. Our check came out for ~$17 pp, which was reasonable compared to how much we ate. Also, they provide complimentary, fresh-baked french baguettes. Love!", "type": "review", "business_id": "4bEjOyTaDG24SY5TxsaUNQ"}

As I mentioned in my last review, we came back here for my friend's bachelorette.  I made the reservation a week in advance.  \n\nWhen I got there, I had to change it because a girl dropped out. If you use Yelp to get phone numbers, this one is incorrect.  It takes you to Effiel Tower Restaurant.  I did eventually get through and told her I needed to \"change tomorrow's reservation.\" (The reason I changed it for one person is because if your entire party isn't seated, you can't be considered for deck seating.) She told me she couldn't find me anywhere and I was put on hold for a long time, several times.  Finally she said \"I found your reservation under tomorrow.  There must have been an error.\" Me: \"Nope. I wanted it for tomorrow.\" Gah.  So that was figured out.\n\nThen the day of, the girls are running late and ask me to push it back.  I tell the hostess, \"can you push the reservation for Ninette for 11 back 30 minutes?\" She said, \"ok Clark (or something equally ridiculous) for 5!\" What now? Eh, maybe it was loud.\n\nWe did make it there and were seated inside (outside was a 2 hour wait).  My friend and I ordered the escargot for appetizer to share and the seafood platter for our entree.  The seafood platter came with 4 oysters, shrimp cocktail, tuna cervice, seaweed salad, several sauces and an entire lobster.  I also just checked and there were supposed to be crackers. Huh. Never saw that. Either way, it looked pretty impressive, not going to lie.  The escargot were good.  They came in a pesto-ish sauce.  The seafood platter was all good except for the main event: the lobster.  The lobster was chewy and overcooked.  We thought we would need steak knives.  I don't know what kind of lobster it was called but it had the spongy legs/claws that I didn't really like either.\n\nI still think this place is pretty reasonably priced and a good balance between casual and fancy for Vegas.  The bad lobster and confusion put me off a bit more than the first time, but for mostly-good food and prices, I'll keep my 3.5 stars under 4.", "type": "review", "business_id": "4bEjOyTaDG24SY5TxsaUNQ"}

I forgot the name, but it was the creamier, easier to spread patte.  It tasted great.  The bread is also straight from the oven (I don't know if it's entirely fresh, but it's good nonetheless).

By balancing tasty eats, a show or two, some cocktails, shopping and slots, I feel I walk away having a complete and lovely experience. It's about exploring, while keeping splurges in check and minding some sort of budget. I'm always on the lookout for new culinary delights.\n\nThat said, 5 years ago during my first trip to Vegas, my family set out to multiple steakhouses to find the perfectly aged, and scrumptious steak. We went everywhere. My pops spent some silly money, but wasn't blown away yet. On a lark, near the end, we tried Mon Ami Gabi. The filet mignon and escargot...and I kid you not...we were still telling people about it 5 years later! So, naturally, I was a bit nervous to return as I had relived the ecstasy in that meal over and over in my head and was fearful a second return trip would not deliver in the same fashion.\n\nThankfully, it did!\n\nThe filet mignon once again, melted in my mouth. The meat had a wonderful sear on the outside and was cooked perfectly to my preferred medium to medium rare temp. We had made reservations, so our seat for two at the windows was picturesque. It was sunset and following a renewal of our vows. Watching the fountains and the sky change colors was incredibly romantic. I could tell my hubby was a little envious of my filet mignon, he opted to save $10 and go with a cheaper cut (what a sweetie) so I made sure to give him plenty of bites. The mashed potatoes were the perfect compliment to my meat. My hubby went for the sweet potato mash which wasn't the best combo with his blue cheese topping, but it wasn't a disaster in any sense. He still really enjoyed his steak and the flavors (just didn't do much of his sweet mash with it). \n\nOur service was good and her assistant (who cleared and refilled) was very attentive and kind. Our server also brought us a mini dessert free of charge in honor of our wedding renewal. It was divinely sweet (and we definitely tipped her more for the gesture).\n\nWe'll definitely be returning in the future. Yum.\n\nPROS\nViews!\nFilet Mignon (If memory serves, I may have licked the plate when no one was looking)\nLocation - Central on strip\nPrice - Very reasonable when compared to other \"steak\" orientated establishments.

I was personally contacted by phone, by the manager of Mon Abi Gami, Constantin Alexander, who was sincerely apologetic and made a nice offer to make it right which we will accept.\n\nHe was able to find my number through my online reservation.\n\nHats off to Constantin at Mon Ami Gabi for caring about customer service ! I'll adjust the rating accordingly.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMy original review ....Visited 7PM Monday November 19, 2012\n\nLike everyone these days, we are short on funds and time. So, when we went to Vegas for a short 2 day vacation (our first in five years) we spent a lot of time researching where we were going to dine.\n\nReviews looked good for Mon Ami Gabi - so we decided to treat ourselves.\n\nWe made a reservation, arrived early and asked to be placed on the patio waiting list. We did have a wonderful view of the Bellagio fountains. \n\nFor appetizer, I had the French Onion soup. It was good, but nothing special. We make better at home. I was surprised at how fast it came out. I thought that would be great. but....\n\nOur salads came out almost immediately too, it was average too, and our entree only a few short minutes after the salads arrived. Way too fast, like they were trying to turn tables which is strange because there was no wait for walk ins when we left.\n\nPart of the way into the steak, which was also OK but not worth the price - think Outback grade steak - they turned on the overhead heaters built into the building. We were very comfortable outside before but these were so hot, my forehead felt like it was burning and my wife became ill.\n\nWhen I called them manager over, I told him we'd like to stay , have desert and relax but it was so hot we were going to have to leave. He just said \"We turn those on to suit the needs of the entire patio, and someone always complains about them being hot.\"\n\nWhat he didn't do was invite us to come back inside and have desert, maybe at a slight discount even, at one of the many empty tables, or apologize in the least. Hmmm... he obviously didn't know or care how long I'd waited and saved to have a nice dinner and getaway with my wife.\n\nThe good parts - the frittes (french fries) - were really good as was the free bread... all else very average. The responsiveness to the customer, way below average. It was also quite pricy. For that price we were expecting exceptional, not everage.\n\nJust FYI - the night before we dined off the strip at  the Brio Tuscan Grill just south of the Strip in Town Square. It far exceeded expectations. Each item we had was wonderful, perfectly timed. We spent $40 less there and had TWICE as good an experience.\n\nWe did decide we'll get to Vegas more, maybe a couple of times a year, guess where we will be having dinner....? We'll go to Brio and then watch the Bellagio fountains from the sidewalk. I am sure it will be a much better experience all the way around.\n\nBesides my repeat business, they also lost the business of a $100 gift card we were going to buy for our Son for when he and his girlfriend come to Vegas in February.\n\nMy guess would be, like so many businesses these days, they don't really care. I'll send them a copy of this and bet that I never hear back....\n\nJust FYI.. I TRIED to email them, but their contact system does not work properly.. oh well, I guess snail mail will have to do", "type": "review", "business_id": "4bEjOyTaDG24SY5TxsaUNQ"}

It also helped that the morning was glorious -- 70F, a gentle breeze, and perfect for leisurely meal on Mon Ami Gabi's sprawling patio, right on the Strip and across from Lake Bellagio.  (Sadly, the fountain show isn't running at 7am, but there's always abundant people-watching.)\n\nI'm not a caffeine person, but mornings in Vegas require it.  A pot of black tea for me and endless refills of black coffee for my guest were just what the doctor ordered.\n\nThe portions at Mon Ami Gabi are behemoth, so we knew that one small plate and one regular plate would be more than enough food.  We started with the fruit salad with brown sugar and yogurt, which was simple but fresh and tasty.  We also shared the turkey and egg white omelet, which is served with toast (+ butter and jam), hash brown, cherry tomatoes, and avocado.  The omelet was certainly pretty to look at, but a bit bland.  It needed pepper, or hot sauce, or something to give it a little kick.\n\nThe real winner, surprisingly, was the hash brown.  I don't think I've ever had one so crispy and flavorful.  I say this as someone who normally shies away from heavy, carb-laden breakfasts.\n\nService at Mon Ami Gabi is....typical Vegas.  Stiff and not especially friendly.

With the amenities it has (pool, spa, food court, restaurants, garden area) it really is a good value for the money.  Yes, it's old and the renovation didn't seem to take care of the hallway carpet or the bathroom cabinets, but if you're looking for new then you've come to the wrong hotel.\n\nI had a FAB room with two beds that looked out on the strip and it was perfectly acceptable and cleaned each day.  The walls are thin and the large window area does let in some noises from the strip so bring ear plugs if you're a light sleeper.\n\nWith check-in/out, I had a diamond card as one of the convention directors so the VIP check-in was quick and easy.  If you don't have a diamond card and do not need any kind of consideration with your room, try the automated check-in/out that is to the side of the hotel check in desk.  I used that last year and it was much better than standing in the long line.\n\nAs already noted, as they work on the Linq construction the parking garage and valet is only for the hotel guests and convention attendees.

Upon checking out I realized I left my wallet in my room, I immediately went back and it was gone! The last person in my room was the bell hop. After two hours of putting up a fuss about my belongings being taken because I couldn't get home due to the fact that my money and ID were in my wallet, the bell hop finally gave it back. How could you steal from a guest?! This hotel has been BY FAR the worst hotel ive stayed at in Vegas! They didnt even try to compensate me for either incident. I will NEVER stay here again!

In a city with so many great options I would not generally be the sort to 'forgive and forget,' but returning with my two friends - both who love steak - and remembering how good the food was I made contact with the restaurant through the MGM website.  While Mr. Bartucci (and our server) had apparently since been dismissed from the restaurant, my e-mail was answered by the new General Manager, Sebastien Vallet, who invited the three of us back for the chef's tasting with wine pairings on the house. \n\nTaking our seats we were almost instantly met by Mr. Vallet, a gregarious and friendly man in a great looking grey suit (vastly differing from the black/white clad servers,) who promised us a fantastic meal and confirmed that I did not eat beef while my friends most certainly did.  \n\nWithin moments our waters were filled - bottled water without even requesting, and our server and his assistant came to our table to once again confirm likes, dislikes, and anything we may need.  In order to not belabor service issues too much I will note a couple of issues here that, despite their obviously being overly attentive to our table, were less than impressive.  First, while Sebastien stopped by multiple times, our server spent vastly more time at a table of well clad businessmen while the assistant served as our primary server throughout.  While not \"unfriendly\" our assistant's grasp of the English language was poor at best, wines were not described as presented, and this was officially the only restaurant on my trip to Vegas where I had to fill my own water.  Another service issue presented itself later, but otherwise I have to say the team clearly \"went out of their way\" to please us - yet despite that fact, the service at Mastro's, CUT, Carnevino, and myriad other fine dining establishments vastly outpaced Craftsteak - their \"average\" being better than Craftsteak's \"best.\"\n\nBrowsing around the restaurant I was amazed at how many hockey jerseys were present - clearly not the \"business casual\" Craftsteak desires.  Arriving from our assistant server without any description (approximately 1 minute later our main server showed up to tell us what the dishes were) our mains and sides were served with a red wine of which I'm unfamiliar and neither myself nor JT enjoyed - Brad thought it was decent.  Featuring mains of a 16oz Ribeye, a 12oz Skirt, and Divers Scallops with Fennel and sides of Yukon Gold Potatoes, Sweet Corn, and Wood Roasted Asparagus this is where the other service issue came up.  As previously noted, I don't eat steak - that doesn't mean my buddies do not eat scallops.  Featuring only five scallops (we received three of the exact same dish as an appetizer last visit) and my friends each deserving to try at least one I explained to our server that this wasn't acceptable and, surprisingly, met some resistance - apparently my thin frame made him think I can't eat.  Asking if any other fishes were available I was told only tuna - again the same prep I'd had last year (there was lobster, I saw it on another table, but clearly they weren't giving this away) and inquiring about birds or pork I was told only chicken (I know they had duck and pork loin, I saw the nightly menu) so I requested the chicken.  Consenting, begrudgingly, the server asked if we wanted anything else and I emphatically stated some mushrooms would be nice.  While it took about 15 minutes to prepare, the dishes were indeed brought by yet another server - someone who actually smiled (aside from Sebastien.)\n\nMyself - I was pleased with the food again, but still less than sold on the service given the fact that they were clearly \"doing their best\" and still seemed a little less than in-step with other restaurants of their caliber.  When it was all said and done Mr. Vallet stopped by to see how everything had been and I told him it was good - because it was.  It simply wasn't \"great.\"  Leaving a nice tip for our service team (perhaps had they known we'd be leaving a good tip the primary server would've been more available) we made our way out of Craftsteak for the last time.  Impressed enough that I plan to check out Craft the next time I'm in Los Angeles or NYC, Vegas has plenty of other options in the meats market and if I were attending repeats I'd head to CUT or Carnevino first.", "type": "review", "business_id": "HbUQ_3dlm3uCacmhTEMnuA"}

Well this is it....I've been saving up to go to craftsteak...not an easy feat on a yoga teacher's salary.\n\nWhat is the result? I have two words for you: Monkey Bread.\n\nOh yeah, that's right.  You thought the two words were going to be steak related? Maybe \"Skirt steak\"? Or \"short rib\"? Or \"Rib eye\"?  Ok, that last one is really only one word, but I couldn't think of an amusing third.\n\nNO. You're WRONG.  Where is it at here? Dessert and sides.\n\nDon't get me wrong.....the steak is amazing.  And perfectly cooked.  I had the filet as part of surf and turf, and chose scallops as my surf item.  But really, we've all had an amazing steak and an amazing steak is what you would expect from a place with \"steak\" in the name.\n\nThe great dessert, however, was a complete shocker.   I believe I even offered to have babies for the pastry chef, which I hoped would get me an introduction, but instead only got me a \"you're a creepy customer\" giggle.  Oh well.\n\nThe ambiance here is pretty good EXCEPT the chairs are horrible.  Really REALLY horrible.  Luckily we were not seated at a center table and instead had at least one side of the table that was up against a bench because my poor baby bro who just had back surgery would have never made it through the night in that chair.  The music was also a little off for me....slightly loud country-ish stuff.  I like country; it just seemed a little out of place here.\n\nService was beyond great, and all of the servers very quickly realized that we were the \"nice\" kind of customers and were chatting with us and showing us adorable baby pictures.  We actually had two people waiting on us plus another two bus boys filling up water, and my water glass was never empty.  That alone is quite a feat because I drink water like it is going out of style.\n\nIn a place like this I always ask the opinion of the waitstaff and they were very happy to guide us toward some amazing choices.  The yukon gold mashed potatoes were so tasty; not too salty, very creamy and buttery and flavorful.  We also had the mixed mushrooms which, when stacked with a small piece of steak, piece of onion, and a dollop of potato made for one of the most perfect bites I have ever eaten.\n\nThe scallops were also amazing but the lobster was a real surprise.  The best lobster I've had has not been in steakhouses....it usually seems to be on the beach after being freshly caught and after I am freshly inebriated.  But this lobster was off-the-charts good. So of course the lobster bisque was great as well.\n\nThe breakdown:\nService: 5 stars\nChairs: 0 stars\nMusic: 2 stars\nYukon Mashed Potatoes: 5 stars\nMushrooms: 5 stars\nLobster Bisque: 4.5 stars\nRoasted Red Pepper Salad: 4 stars\nLobster: 4.5 stars\nScallops: 4.5 stars\nFilet: 4 stars\nMonkey Bread: 10 billion stars. \n\nComplicated computer calculation outcome: 4.483 stars\n\nI will likely never be able to afford to come here again after dropping more than 300 bucks for all of the above plus a half a bottle of wine...but that is ok.  I still have the memories.  And for at least another 12 hours, the leftovers in the fridge.", "type": "review", "business_id": "HbUQ_3dlm3uCacmhTEMnuA"}

It was hard but the inside was soft and tasted fresh. The butter was kinda hard too, the jam was pretty good and the ketchup I guess was for the fries to come? Who eats bread with ketchup?\n\nCheese Danish - Looked like a croissant shaped like a muffin, with a dab of some cream cheese butter on top. This was So Flaky/Soft and the cream cheese butter lightly spread throughout was perfectly balanced.. This wasn't your ordinary cheese danish (pre-packaged grocery store bought), this thing was Superb!\n\nCroque Madame: Toasted ham & cheese on brioche with a fried egg & mornay sauce. Served with pommes frites.. Sounded quite fancy for a breakfast dish - In Layman's Terms = Ham & Cheese Sandwich with Egg and Fries! Toast tasted like a really buttered croissant with an airy texture. Ham & Cheese wasn't the oscar mayer ham nor Kraft cheese I use for h&c sandwiches back at home, it was much more gourmealicous! Plus, with the fried egg, more like a sunny side up egg and their white creamy/frothy sauce, makes an Incredible Sandwich! Fries were served as a generous amount and were plain good. \n\nCorned Beef Hash with eggs and toast: Corned Beef hash came in shallow bowl with a blanket of overeasy eggs practically covering the hash. I scooted over the eggs to try just the flavor of the corned beef. They were little cubed chunks sitting on top of some pretty tasty juice/sauce. The cubes tasted and had the texture of ham. The juice/sauce gave it a great beef flavor but not the usual Real and typical corned beef I'm used to having. Nevertheless, it was Good. The toast were thick and had a buttery flavor and reminded me of a Crouton.

Having said that I liked the place and the service.  All good so far.  I ordered the daily special Rack of Lamb and wife ordered a steak.  Although I am not normally a big Lamb eater, but few good place where I lamb (mostly in UK) it was fantastic, so I was expecting a similar experience.  Once it was served, the gamey smell was so strong I actually didn't even feel like putting my folk into it.  The taste was much more gamey than the smell.  They took it back and cooked it more, but not much help.    I gave three stars because my wife's steak was fantastic and all other items were good.  May go back there again, but NEVER will i try the Lamb there again.", "type": "review", "business_id": "tFU2Js_nbIZOrnKfYJYBBg"}

Excellent pasta , great customer service, and a prime view of the famous Bellagio water show.\n\nEnjoyed with my family were the following:\n\n- Onion Foccacia (complimentary in your bread basket): perfect tenderness and flavor pact.\n\n- Gnocchi ($32): Did I mention best ever? No? Because I'm not kidding. I've had some good gnocchi in San Francisco and even Florence, Italy - but this plate in particular hit all the right notes in regards to texture and flavor composition. Delicate pillow-y soft gnocchi layered in a beautiful light tomato coulis with pulled chicken, goat cheese, kalamata olives, and toasted pistachios...this is the kind of dish that I'd love to enjoy again and again and again.\n\n- Fettucini Carbonara ($37): ordered this dish bc I've adored a similarly constructed dish at Haven in Oakland. Crab, pancetta, and egg yolks emulsfied in a cream sauce - all the good guilty things in life - how can you go wrong? As a result, the dish was indeed flavorful and the pasta tenderly al-dente, but just a bit too salty for my palate. Overall, very enjoyable, but Chef Kim Alter's version (Smoked Pasta) still remains my #1.\n\n- Prosciutto & Fig Flatbread ($19). Good, but slightly dissapointed. Prosciutto and figs are such a natural flavor combo that you wonder how on earth can you screw this one up? For some sad reason the figs were so overcooked they tasted like prunes. Or, did someone make a horrible decision to use dried figs...and not fresh figs? Regardless, this was the only dish which we had leftovers of.\n\n- Pomegranite Souffle ($14): Though light and custardy as any good souffle and presented elegantly, the pomegranite flavor is no where to be found. It might've been covered up by the creme anglaise and pistachio ice cream.\n\nAll in all, though the prices are a bit on the heftier side for the cuisine, you pay for the view - and the delicious pastas!", "type": "review", "business_id": "KjymOs12Mpy0Kd54b7T9MA"}

My wife and I have been here before and enjoyed it but it had been quite some time ago, so we remedied that by going here on Sunday. Lucky for us on Sundays they have \"all day happy hour\" so how could we not indulge ourselves. \n\nWe both love calamari and have enjoyed it here before so that was a must. Their calamari is more of a \"stick\" style but it has great flavor. My only complaint, and it's a small one, is I wish they would have drizzled some of their cilantro lime jus (I think that's what it was, the sweet sauce from the Thai chicken skewers) over the calamari to give a sweetness to match their subtle spicy flavor. Speaking of the Thai-chicken skewers, I enjoyed them, but probably due more to their included sauces than the actual skewer itself. \n\nWe finished with a Thai chicken pizza which was really good. I personally would have liked a little more peanut flavor as it seemed to get lost and resulted in more of a chicken pizza with jalape\u00f1o slaw and lettuce, but again I enjoyed what I had and would order it again. The drinks we ordered were well mixed and nicely sized for an enjoyable evening for two. \n\nIf you are looking for a great place to enjoy a tapas style dinner this is a great place.

When we lined up around 10:30 as the promoter had told us to, the bouncer at the door checked our IDs almost right away, and he informed us that they were just letting in a few tables right at the moment and that they would be letting in guest list in just a few minutes.

I came here for a new year's day party hosted by Puff Daddy. First off, I totally understand it's Vegas on probably the 2nd busiest night of the year. My friends and I decided to get a VIP cabana on the roof. Big mistake. If a rapper is going to host a party, there will be specific types of people who will be attending. The ones who idolize the wrong people and willing to live the lifestyles that the rappers vaunt so much. The poor who try to ball on a budget. The VIP area was completely dead because no one could afford it. I would say it's a good and bad thing. The dance floor was packed so badly that there was no room to dance at all, not even on the walkways because the dancefloor was so full it would spill onto it. If you were on one end of the club and wanted to go to the bathroom, and go back to your same spot, it probably would take you an hour. Next, the VIP area, the bouncers were complete dicks. I brought some women with me, and he made a big deal about how I was trying to sneak friends up so they can bypass the VIP charge per person (which was not the case at all you buffoon, who I tipped $50 anyways). Part of the VIP comes with a bottle of liquor, I was well aware of the price markup on a busy day. I ended up buying another $500 bottle anyways because we ran out, but I did not know that they charge you gratuity no matter what, so I decided to tip 20% on top of the final price of the bottle + 20%, and all she did was bring me a bottle.

I simply cannot get this deelish memory out of my head -- and it's been weeks since I've eaten there. My restaurant habits tend to be that of repetition and fear of trying somewhere new. Having been a vegetarian for over a decade, new menus were more an exercise in fear than a potential find.\n\nSo a few weeks ago when I was feeling adventurous, I loaded the kid and the boy in the car and asked who wanted where and what to eat. The regular short list of restaurants offered nothing in the way of interest for any of us, and, desperate, I pulled out the Sidekick 3 to get some ideas. Ryan said he wanted a burger, so I searched for \"best burger near [my zip code]\" and a reference to Delux Burger popped up. It was relatively close to home, so off we went.\n\nArriving, the outside of the restaurant is a little deceptive. It's in a Safeway shopping center and if you're not looking for Delux, you're likely to miss it altogether. It's a tiny little place with a tiny little patio but (by virtue of being nestled in a shopping center) there's plenty of parking.\nMoms & Dads: I was a little nervous that an exclusive little diner like this would be the type to be unfriendly to kids, but that's definitely not an issue. Space is scant, but we sat on the patio and it was comfortable.\n\nThe menus were skinny and long and consisted mostly of the beer, wine, and liquor selection, which might have been their original focus from the start (but I don't know that for sure). Their hours are 11am-2am, so I think they're really hoping to serve a post-club-but-not-done-partying segment in the wee-er hours. I perused to find something other than beef or chicken (I don't eat either) and was thrilled to find a grown-up grilled cheese (3 cheese, oven-roasted tomatoes, baby arugula on a demi-baguette).\n\nShortly thereafter, I saw it. The delux Fresh Fish sandwich. The idea of a grilled cheese was interesting given the ingredients, but I wanted something less rich and more flavorful, and here it was, offered up to me in a single menu entry like a hand-picked wildflower from a wide-grinned, grateful, not-expecting-anything-in-return toddler...\n\nFrom the menu:\n\n    Grilled Mahi Mahi marinated in sake and orange juice with wild herbs, served on a toasted, handcrafted brioche bun with redleaf lettuce, all-natural beefsteak tomatoes and red onions accompanied by sides of creme tartar and cucumber-pear medley.\n\nOne word describes this sandwich: Divine. It was hot and perfectly cooked. The fish was light and the flavors were magical. The bread wasn't overpowering and the lettuce was proportioned -just enough- to give you a taste and a different texture, but not take the spotlight from what the real star was. I couldn't get enough of this sandwich. Sadly, though, it came to an end much quicker than I'd desired and yet I was still craving more. How often does something so good and good for you leave you so breathless and wanting more?\n\nWe had also ordered a \"shopping cart\" of sweet potato and regular french fries (the kid loved that, though toddlers + things on wheels atop on high surfaces are surely a recipe for eventual disaster), and I snacked on those to curb any further temptation to order another sandwich. At $10 a pop, I didn't need to scarf these things like snacks.\n\nThe kid had a kids-friendly grilled cheese which was a panini-based creation (very simple) on a bed of french fries, though she didn't want anything to do with those fries when the shopping cart fries were also available and, by virtue of their container, much more tasty! Ryan had a burger and he liked it, too, but I honestly remember very little of our outing as I was too busy flying high on my mahi mahi experience.\n\nTime kinda stood still for a little while and for that I must recommend Delux Burger to anyone who likes to eat stuff that tastes really good.", "type": "review", "business_id": "OFBJtqWGSx6n6CchtVmoRw"}

I don't stop breathing air just cos everyone else has already done it.  Some things are necessary.\n\nDelux is like your all-time favorite song.  Sure, you've had it over and over again, you know its intricacies, you've interpreted, and digested its offerings.  And then something happens that shocks you.  You get sick of it.\n\nSo, you stash it away, lose it on your memory's playback, and banish it from your favorite playlist.\n\nSometime later, it comes up again, and you think ... \"Oh yeahhhh!\"\n\nThis is Delux.  \n\nSo you go back, get your usual pint of Anchor Steam, your maytag burger, and the halfer of sweet potato/boring potato fries.\n\nThen you wonder why you ever shunned it.  \n\nThis shit is great.

The serving size is a little ridiculous because it really is made for two people but it comes in one giant serving bowl. Despite the size, it really is delicious. It has the right amount of tang from the dressing and savoriness from the chicken that makes this carnivore skip the burgers and order the salad.\n\nThe one drawback about this place is that it's really small.

You couldn't see any avocado pieces, maybe I just like it a bit chunky. \nI personally really liked the Mac & cheese- so cheesey!!!!!! And the jalepeno cornbread!

The cupcakes tasted like they had been out for a while, not hard but not as soft as I thought they would be. The crepes: I thought they would make them fresh but they were premade.

The door opened at 9, but there was no need to get there early.  I heard this venue was tiny, but was definitely surprised how small it is in person.  There really isn't a \"bad\" seat in the house.  We were seated in section 201 row BB.  We didn't have the most centralized view, but that was fine.  Sections 202, 203, and 204 have better views if you're into \"best\" seat in the house.  \n\nNow onto the storyline...or was there one? I couldn't figure it out either way.  The whole baby character is a bit too bizarre for me though.  And without giving the show away, I thought some of the other characters such as the \"French man\" was a little distracting.  His main purpose was to provide some sort of comical relief to the audience, but I didn't find him to be funny.  \n\nThe acrobats and trapeze were outstanding of course.  They sure take the free show over at Circus Circus to the next level and above.  They're the ones we paid to see, and they did the show justice.  \n\nOverall, I liked the show, but I wish I enjoyed it a little more.  Then again, I was fighting the urge of falling asleep after a day out in the scorching sun AND a dinner buffet.  But at least I did better than the guy sitting next to us, who was asleep the entire time.  His gf stormed out of the venue as soon as it ended...and what happens to him after that is a myst\u00e8re.", "type": "review", "business_id": "DqY2VlbRuQ3Mu2mlxd4xUQ"}

For starters, my experience here was bad enough it got me to create a Yelp account to share it with any unsuspecting potential ticket buyers.\n\nMy fiance and I wanted to go somewhere fun for New Year's, so we bought two $220 \"VIP Access Hosted Bar at Ghostbar\" tickets because we wanted a good view of the fireworks for my birthday, which happens to be NYE. The \"VIP Access\" was supposed to guarantee us access to Ghostbar, per  the ticket agreement and receipt. The Palms was also selling \"All Access\" tickets which gave people access to all three clubs in the Palms. \n\nWe arrived to pick up our tickets at 9:30pm, and got our \"Hosted Bar\" wrist bands at 10:30pm (a long line, but makes sense for NYE in Vegas...I think). Then we moved on to the Ghostbar line. Yes, another line. Again, Vegas on NYE -- probably makes sense there are a few lines. Then, wam! We were hit with the news... They apparently overbooked Ghostbar. Birthday fun over. I suspect they over-sold \"All Access\" tickets and, of course, anyone with \"All Access\" ticket headed straight for the bar/club with the view, rather than the ground level club. We paid quadruple the price to be in the club with the view because we were not in the mood for an interior crowded pit.\n\nThey tried to make up for it by granting us access to Rain on the ground floor. If you haven't been to Rain, it is your average big walled in black box club with booming music, crowds, and zero view. We were not impressed, and feel totally ripped off. \n\nMaybe if they refunded our ticket cost, put us in the black box club, and treated us like royalty the rest of the night, we could have possibly had a good time. They didn't. \n\nI hear the fireworks were great. Think twice before you give these guys your money and expect something in return.

The big difference between this one and the rest is basically the big body of water as the \"stage\" for the acrobats to jump and dive into. \n\nThe show seemed shorter than the others just because there is no intermission with this one so they go straight through the 1.5 hours.

Top to bottom from service to food to setting, this place whimpers mediocrity with a screaming price tag.

That was a wrong decision.\n\nFirst it's not without a good dish...the Jumbo Crab Cake was splendid...flavorful and meaty but that was the end of it and we just got started.  \n\nThis is probably when they say in the kitchen \" hey it's \"sea\" food...so guess what...there's only one flavor in the sea kids! \" Because it seems they masked all possible flavor with saltiness.   It's like they put salt on top of the salt crystal that they use for the Chowder and to mix with the rub on the Wild Cobia. Where do you get your salt Rick Moonen?  and our wisecracking waiter seems to be a smart guy who has no clue how each of the fish on the menu is prepared.  It was painful.  \n\nI am willing to pay top dollars for a deserving high quality food...but it's such a sore disappointment to pay for such lameness.\n\nThe good: The jumbo crab cake...there's no deny here that it was good tasty crab meat...how I wish the entire meal was like this. And the dude who kept our water constantly filled, he was extremely nice and courteous...how I wish he was our waiter.\n\nThe Bad: Salt is the star of the show. They should change the name to Rick Moonen's RM Saltyfood.\n\nThe Conclusion:This was a kink in our otherwise splendid Vegas trip. I see this place got a lot of decent reviews.

From my experience, there's very little to justify even a single Michelin star for Picasso.  Then again, Vegas has that effect on people, distorting reality so much as to convince the Michelin tasters in 2009 and current diners that this Julian Serrano restaurant actually deserved two Michelin stars.\n\nFirst of all, I don't count myself amongst the fine-dining elite, having only recently sampled about a handful of one-Michelin star restaurants, mostly in the Bay Area, one in Chicago and one in LA.  To me, restaurants of this caliber offer similarly refined foods, mostly differentiating themselves by service and ambiance.  \n\nWe went to Picasso for our anniversary, which was apparently a major source of patronage besides the obligatory hot date in Vegas.  We arrived for our reservation at 8pm on a Wednesday night, and the hostess, without even looking up, instructed us to wait.  Briefly stunned, I settled into the lounge with two other couples in similar straits.  A Wednesday night besides, I've never had to wait at any Michelin-rated restaurant, especially when I've made a reservation.  \n\nAfter 20 awkward minutes, we were taken to our seat on the far wall.  Along the way, I noticed plenty of empty tables, so our wait was even more disquieting.  Almost immediately, we sensed our dinner would proceed at a languorous pace; we marked time with the Bellagio water spectacle outside the windows that started every 15 minutes.  The first three shows were welcomed delights, but soon they became distractions.  \n\nAs the other couples from the lounge sat down next to us, we noticed a distinct lack of privacy.  We were barely two feet apart and in that quiet space, it was way too easy to participate in each other's private conversation.  We all ended up eating in uncomfortable silence.  \n\nThe tasting menu was misleading.  I've seen other tasting menus encompass a broad range of taste experiences, numbering up to 10 or more.  At Picasso, there are just two pricy options: Prix Fixe for $113 and Degustation for $123.  Both are more properly described as dinner settings since they came with soup or salad as appetizer, a second sampler plate, a main course, and a dessert.  \n\nMy wife ordered a cocktail to pass the time, while I got a tea service to soothe my dry throat.  Apparently, Picasso is not the place to order cocktails as my wife's cocktail came out so unpleasantly bitter that she actually had to return it after a second confirming sip.  It was the very first time she's ever had to do that.  At $14 per cocktail, it's perfectly understandable, since I expected nothing less than amazing.  The replacement was passable.  \n\nAs each well-presented but tiny portion of food came, I accompanied them all with the much needed but unsatisfactory bread.  The entrees were all uniformly moist and juicy, but I found them to be quite bland and uninspired.  The antelope I had was the juiciest piece of game meat I've ever had.  Yet, it was as forgettable as the rest of the meal, except for perhaps the slab of cold foie gras that was dressed up as an entree, a singularly disagreeable and unsettling experience.\n\nTo celebrate our anniversary, our desserts were decorated with chocolate script.  While we always appreciate the thought, the piping work looked rushed and crude, with the letters barely recognizable.  By contrast, the chocolate script we had at the one-starred Plumed Horse was a beautiful work of a real artisan.\n\nService was as polished as expected at other fine-dining establishments in the Bay Area.  But, towards the end of the meal, we felt neglected as we saw neither our waiter nor any bus boys for over 30 minutes.  We ran out of water and sat dejected.  \n\nAbout the only element in Picasso's favor is its selection of original Picasso paintings decorating the walls of the restaurant.  I studied the two in front of me for a solid hour and started to grasp something of Picasso's artistic vision.  If I were a true aficionado or student of Picasso's works, I might find the rare opportunity to be worth the price of admission.\n\nAfter three hours and a numbing procession of the Bellagio water spectacle, we tabbed out at $305 for two, including tip.  This was the first time I felt like I wasted money for a fine dining experience.  At most, the experience at Picasso was worth $150 for two, including drinks and tip.  A Michelin-rated experience, it certainly was not.  \n\nAs we left, the hostess once again told us good night without looking up.  Maybe I'm part of the invisible ethnicity in America, but that really made me feel non-existent.  Then, as if noticing a slight, the manager got the hostess to give us something of a parting gift.  Emblazoned with the Picasso logo, we found inside two small, greasy palmiers, instead of some sweets.  It was one last mis-fire that captured the whole Picasso experience.", "type": "review", "business_id": "-5RN56jH78MV2oquLV_G8g"}

The line up was already stacked and it seemed like it could not get any better with bands like Impaled Nazarene, Inquisition, Doom, Cathedral, Cianide, Repugnant, and Goatsnake. I have to admit Goatsnake was a huge reason I decide to go again. Due to some issues they were unable to make the fest and I was bummed. Then the fest organizers announced that they would have a replacement band within a couple days. To every ones amazement they added Ghost. \n\nThis made perfect sense seeing that the Death/Thrash Metal band Repugnant was preforming as well. A little side note, Ghost is Repugnant. If you doubt this, check out the Swedish Indie Rock band Subvision, also the same vocalist. With Repugnant playing during Sunday afternoon, it was only right for Ghost to close out MDF 9. They took the stage early Monday morning right after midnight absolutely killed it. \n\nFast forward 13 months they added a Las Vegas date to their second U.S. tour since May last year. \n\nTraffic on the way to Mandalay Bay was crazy. After downing a few beers and some green in the parking garage we literally got their just in time for the show which started at 6:30 PM. The place was already packed and 24oz cans of beer were $12. Ghost's performance was amazing. They definitely put on a show with the whole band dressed in black cloaks and good ole Papa Emeritus in his satanic pope outfit. The set was only about 35 mins but they covered most songs from their debut album. It was pretty clear that everyone come out for the Ghost. The other two bands didn't receive the same reaction from the audience and were quite boring in my opinion. \n\nI hope they return with a headlining tour because 35 mins was just not enough.

So then she comes back about 5 minutes later and asks us if we were ready to order and we say yes, then we got out half of our order and she runs off right in the middle of us asking her a question about something on the menu.  My husband was in mid sentence when she ran off, literally.  So finally we were able to recite our whole order to her.  We got two entrees and an order of shrimp fried rice and our total came to $42 dollars.  They were seafood entrees, but wow!  But I decided, if the food was good, then whatever.  We took the food home, it was barely seasoned and the shrimp fried rice was very greasy.  Needless to say, I was extremely disappointed with the service and the food.", "type": "review", "business_id": "jbKVbSz51F8IcewsiRQu4A"}

All of the girls had gotten some free passes to the club, and I managed to talk to the bouncer, slipped him $50 for us to skip the line, and also to pay for my boyfriends entrance.  We walk up to the line, where the other bouncer is standing, and the bouncer blocks my boyfriend, and asks for MORE money.  At this point we argue, but end up giving him an additional $20 (stupid I know!) and finally get to the point where we pay.  The cashier asks for AN ADDITIONAL $20 for my boyfriend.  He was PISSED.  We explain the situation, the bouncers deny any money was given to anyone, and my boyfriend decides he is going to gamble, that we should go in, and try and enjoy ourselves.  I had already spent $70 just to get into this place, so I was curious.  Nothing special.  The crowd was YOUNG (mainly 20's) and mainly GUYS.  They looked like they were on their daddy's dime, and i wasn't impressed with the bartenders as well.

Judging depth for each footfall is essential -- and  many of the young descenders are able to skip down steep slopes where you have to figure out if each step is a stretch --or perhaps a small jump.  Meanwhile you have to watch balance because there are nearly sheer drop-offs from side to side.  It is no doubt much easier to let gravity pull you down, but if you are anything like me you probably have to be alert to avoid aggravating plantar fasciitis or tweaking an untrained tendon with a twist or turn.\n\nThat said, 90% of the Camelback hike is a cakewalk.  With patience and the willingness to be a bit undignified as you scoot down the steepest slipperiest parts, perhaps on your butt, the remaining 10% is not so bad.  Try not to think of snakes in the crevices you grip on the way down.\n\nI think an experienced hiker would have no problems at all -- but even he or she would have to scramble in places.\n\nThe view is worth it!  \n\nBoth the Echo Canyon and Cholla trails (on the nose and tail ends, respectively) require the scrambling I mention, but the nose requires a good deal more.", "type": "review", "business_id": "6rijZ1qIjiq1Dgdy35iqxw"}

We all have different tastes and preferences,  so when it comes to choosing the best pizza, we try to stick with originality in flavor and  the consistency of its dough..  and while trying them all, I have found exquisite flavors and combinations, different dough textures created by each unique oven, and one particular pie that distinguishes itself from all of the others  because of its simplicity and originality.\nAnd in my eternal quest to find the most original pizza, that is the one that most closely resembles the true pizza........the one that originated in the 1830s in Napoli, baked in an oven built with lava rocks from mount Vesubio,  I have to mention two contenders; CIBO and Pizzeria Bianco.\nFor 15 years, Pizzeria Bianco located at 623 E Adams  street in downtown Phoenix, has been a favorite amongst pizza aficionados for making pizzas that truly resemble  a pizzeria Napolitana.\nOwner, Chris Bianco , decided that the only way to create an authentic pizza, was to travel to the place of its origin, Napoli, and learn the art of pizza making.  His internship paid well and today when one eats at his pizzeria, there is no doubt that his pizzas are a very close duplicate of what one would get in Napoli.\nNot even a mile apart, one finds another jewel in the pizza arena; CIBO Pizzeria.  Cibo translate simply into\" the food\". If you are a true pizza aficionado, you must try this pizzeria in order to truly understand the art in the making of truly artisan pizza.\nKaren and Tony Martingiglio are the owners of this small and charming old house located at 603 5th ave in downtown Phoenix. It resembles a true Italian osteria.( an Italian eatery where local wines are flavored and where people come to have a great time with friends and eat home made dishes) Friendly, charming, and warm, Cibo  makes you feel at home eating with your mamma.\nPizzas here are crafted by a true transplanted pizza maker from Napoli; artisan Guido Saccone.\n\nPizza Margherita is probably an exact copy of what one would expect to eat in Napoli.  From the chewy lightly burned dough relieved with bubbling volcanoes,  to the simple earthy  tomato sauce and fresh basil, this pizza is heavenly.\nAnd if I was placed in the predicament of choosing my favorite, I  would undoubtedly pick Cibo; after all there is an authentic  artisan from Napoli crafting these wonderful pies.", "type": "review", "business_id": "V1nEpIRmEa1768oj_tuxeQ"}

You've even been, but the wait was too long for you at the time. The reviews are off the wall and all your friends love it...but then...you go and are disappointed???\n\nTHIS IS SO NOT THE CASE. Cibo was a start for our fabulous evening downtown on my farewelll Phoenix tour (LOL!). We had dinner here before the Madonna concert and it was Fanfreakintastic! \n\nThe place was humming with regulars and plenty of Madonna fans. Weather was perfect for al fresco dining. We sat comfortably at a table in back with impeccable service by a new server named Kim. She rocked our meats and cheeses. \n\nLiterally. We ordered the appetizer of meat, cheeses, nuts and fruit. For $19 it was really a steal and fed us four Madonna fans well. The homemade mozzeralla was TDF...the proscuitto, bread, olives, goat cheese, grilled veggies...MOUTHGASM!\n\nOf course we had to have a pizza and the Margherita pizza sang to us!!! Crust was perfection, pillowy and crunchy with the soft cheese, tangy sauce and fresh basil. \n\nWe were indeed doing the happy food dance. Which was a great excercise as we danced our tails off several hours later. So the food was much needed fuel. \n\nAmbience was as charming as everyone has mentioned. \n\nCibo. First date.

Maybe it was the night, or maybe it was my attire (shorts and baseball cap after the NCAA games), I definitively got that, \"You're ain't from around these parts are you boy\" service.  Had the service been better, I would have ordered a second Wild Pear Martini, which was yummy.  I have to admit, I was savoring the martini nearly as much as the Bruin win on this particular night.\n\nFor eatz, at the suggestion of the waitress, I ordered the Shrimp Kisias.

It was due to the fact that we wanted to go somewhere centrally located for all of us and I wasn't in the mood to make any decisions. I had never been there before and wasn't sure what to expect. I walked out extremely impressed. \n\nThe interior design is pretty damn cute. It's brightly colored and dimly lit which made me happy. Orange table top? Yes please. \n\nMy friends had already ordered a phylo dough appetizer by the time I got there that had grilled chicken, spinach and some other amazing thing in it with red pepper aoli. I could've eaten this all night. It was so soft and even though I knew what was in it, it was a delightful taste that was better than I expected. \n\nThe pomegranate fusion I had to drink was pretty delish. A juicy orange was prettily sitting atop of it too. It caught me off guard as being a little strong, but in a good way. Not in a, I really feel like I'm drinking rubbing alcohol kind of way. \n\nWhile the special of the day sounded o tempting and is usually what I like to try at an establishment, I knew I wouldn't be able to eat it. Instead I ordered a chicken sandwich (cannot believe I forget the name) that had grilled chicken, greens, pears, dried cherries, and a pomegranate vinaigrette with a side of sweet potato fries. As it was I could only stomach about half of it even though my taste buds wanted me to finish every last bit of that sandwich. I think I could eat that every day. The sweet potato fries were good, but I have to admit I think I like delux's better. \n\nWhile the staff was attentive, we were one of two tables there due to it being almost closing so I can't validate how the staff is on a typical day. \n\nSo much of the menu looked fantastic, and I will definitely be back.", "type": "review", "business_id": "EWMwV5V9BxNs_U6nNVMeqw"}

Rather tasteless. The crust was ok, the sausage really had very little flavor. We had Barros pizza a few nights before this and we both agreed we much preferred there's over Grimaldis.

When we had our event there last year, I was extremely impressed with the quality of service & the amenities in the hotel along with the rooms being large in size & well appointed. \n\nOur convention was excited to return to the Fremont area this year. We even expanded it to be 6 full nights instead of 3. \n\nWhat a disappointment. Upon arrival, after 3pm, I was told the suite I'd reserved wasn't available and that all I could get was a double bedded room. I'd also requested that I have a room closer to the elevator because the halls are long and i'm a bit on the hippy side. My room was the next to the end of the hall. 1 door closer. \n\nThe bellman dropped one of our bags when taking it out of the cab and splitting it open. Not even an apology. \n\nUpon checking in, the front desk staff was rude to the point of obnoxious. I heard later if you slipped them a 20 they would fulfill the accommodations. I guess they didn't know bribery was against the law and that would explain where my suite went. Poof. \n\nArriving at the room, the bed were made but housekeeping had failed to remove several used bottles of beer, 3 filthy wash cloths behind the bathroom door & we had no toilet paper. I called housekeeping and was informed a manager would have to call me back. 10 minutes later the manager called, apologized and assured me they would send someone right up. An hour later I called back. They sent someone but he refused to remove the dirty wash cloths until I went Big City Woman on him. \n\nthe one bright spot on my arrival was going to Oscars. I arrived just before happy hour was over, had a great waitress & the food was as excellent as ever. \n\nThe rest of the week went down hill. It was as if they didn't want us there at all. There was no security guard at the tower entrance so 4 out of 6 nights we found people sleeping or passed out in the vending machine area on my floor (9th). Unacceptable.\nWhen making my reservations, I specifically asked if they had finally gotten in room movies, and was assured they had. This was a lie. and the \"front desk manager\" (I say that with quotes because Im pretty sure she wasn't) was over the top rude when asked about it. There were no channels on the TV so you had to guess what channel you were watching. and yes I know that most folks don't come to Vegas to watch TV but you can't gamble 24x7x6days. Do I look like Melinda Gates? \nLet's move to Friday when I needed a bellman to move some luggage for me to another room. With an additional of our 375 rooms checking in, there was a 200 room wedding also checking in. The bell desk had 1 - yes I said it - 1 bellman on duty. who puts 1 bellman on duty on a weekend? I had to call the front desk they said they would tell him. 30 minutes later nothing. called for the hotel GM - and was told there wasn't one on duty. LIE. No hotel, no matter how big or how small doesnt have management. \n\nToday, upon checkout, I started at 7am calling the bell desk no answer. Finally I called the operator who again informed me there was no GM on duty. On a Sunday at 8am with 750 rooms checking out? LIE. I sent my son down stairs only to find out that the button that is marked \"Bell Desk\" on the telephone, doesn't ring to the actual bell desk. It just goes no where. \n\nIts a IF they don't want anyone staying there. \n\nAs much as I love to go to Oscar's, I will never ever go to the Plaza again. I don't care if I do miss out on those lovely Carolyn cocktails. I'll get over it. I don't need to spend my $$ and I did spend too much to be treated as if I was some homeless motherless child.

I kept on laughing the first time I played, cuz it kept on talking south park smack.  \"Damn woman, I just gave you sweet loving 15 min. ago\"  If I had to buy a pinball game, this would be the one.  The other pinball machines ate my money too fast.  The new ones our front were all .75, so I stayed away.  I guess I still like getting value for my money even though I can afford it now.  haha.

Sushi is expensive.  $2 or 3 per piece is a bit spendy IMO, but hey, that's pretty much average cost for nigiri.  And I am a hungry boy.  I am there to taste the fish, so I generally don't order rolls, much less dip my fish bits in soy sauce.  That said, I usually do all you can eat ($28-30 dinner, 1 hour), and for that price I think the quality of the fish is quite good.  \n\nFor starters, I usually get about ten pieces yellowtail (which is my fave and always good here) and 6-8 pieces garlic tuna (also snacktastic!)  That alone pays for the AYCE.   Other faves are tamago, the grilled eel (unagi), and salmon.  \n\nThey also have a nice variety of sides included on the menu, and I usually get at least  three or four things including shrimp tempura, gyoza, miso soup and sometimes a seaweed salad or ahi poki.  \n\nTo satisfy my sweet tooth, I get a green tea ice cream and a lychee sherbet, because honestly, why make tough decisions when I can have it both ways!  Sometimes a mochi too.\n\nWhen I finally put the sticks down I've generally put away about $80 worth of food.  Cuz that's how I roll.  (Get it, ha!)  Not bad for $30...\n\nI always sit at the bar and the chefs are attentive and speedy.  The waitresses, even though they are focused on waiting tables, are usually pretty good about getting your drinks, side orders, and clearing empty dishes.  \n\nThe place is kinda small, little decor and you may wait a bit on the weekends\n\nIf you are looking for the BEST sushi in town, this probably isn't the place for you.

But this location just off thecasino floor at Aria  also has more tables at which to sit in the space and seemingly more savory food choices and a much bigger pre-packaged retail sweets area.  And a nod to Yelp friend Richard S for the heads up that this is a universally accessible location. \n\nCrepes are not usually one of my favorite things, something about the texture,  but  I relied on other Yeeps' reviews to underscore that they were a good breakfast choice at Jean Philippe.  I thought fond thoughts about those Yeeps as we ate because the warm mixed berry crepe was really yummy and plenty for two smaller breakfast eaters to share.\n\nOn another day I might come back here to try gelato from the extensive selection in the sparkling case. Although perhaps not the quiche or other savories as the women sitting on each side of us left quiche and sandwich uneaten, saying each was a little soggy and that they wished they'd picked the crepe instead.  \n\nThe drawback at this location is that while the process of where to stand to order what is crystal clear at the Bellagio store, it seemed a little unclear here on the first visit to the busy Aria location.  Next time we'll know that a) the entry on the right is for seating or exit from seating, b) the middle entry is for ordering food from the glass enclosed food and pastries counter or for making a right turn to walk to seating and c) the entry on the left is for the gelato, crepe and coffee bar as well as the packaged goodies retail display. (Footnote:  If the crepe counter is closed, order crepes at the coffee counter and go back to the crepe counter to pick them up.  At least that was the drill on the day of our visit.)\n\nNow you know if you go.  And we recommend you go.  Almost anything is luscious, but we suggest the crepes of any kind.\n\n.", "type": "review", "business_id": "szw8OGJlsqaA3i2oe7dn9A"}

You're entering some strange Miyazaki buffet wonderland styled by Gourmet Magazine.  You are still surrounded by tourists, but you are all equally awed by the presentation & effort put forth at the buffet tables.  \n\nI spent a lot of time looking around for discounts, and figured that that any discounts came with a lot of effort, so just suck it up and pay full price for it.  I recommend coming for lunch, which will make it $25 ish per person.  Yowsa, right?  But then again, this is high end food, in a high end casino, in high end Las Vegas.  You are going to hand your wallet over to the nice cashier & smile pretty when she thanks you.\n\nEverything I tried was at the very least quite tasty, if not amazing.  And I give kudos for the dessert area.  Most buffets I ignore everything but soft serve.  Crappy ice cream, but there is a something about it....I digress, I am a food snob when it comes to dessert.  I from the SF Bay Area, we know ALL about dessert.  A little pretty presentation will not disguise ineptitude.  But I got none of that here, all the desserts tried were tasty!\n\nBig plus, Steve Wynn, a recently converted vegan, went on campaign to veganize all his properties.  As a result, every food place has a lot more vegan options (if not an entire separate vegan menu that you can request).  At every buffet station there were posted discrete notices reminding you that you are always free to ask the staff to accommodate any food change requests (although presumably in moderation).  I removed 1 star only because the omelet staff person convinced my vegan that egg beaters were vegan.  So, you vegans out there be sure to double check your food if you don't want to be bummed!

Our server Devin was so patient with our table and he made sure everyone's order came out correctly. \n\nI feel like we ate so much food.. from the wings... sliders... bone in filet... adult mac n cheese... scallops... and about every dessert they had! My favorite are their wings, a little spicey and so amazing!! Every steak I have ever had here has always been cooked to perfection... but the bone in is my favorite!! If you don't order the mac n cheese you are missing out... they fry it like a fishstick and serve it with a truffled cheese dipping sauce! OMG and the warm doughnuts are insane!! \n\nThe vibe of this place is FUN, ENERGETIC, and TRENDY! I just love coming here before heading over to the Bank nightclub right next door! Makes life easy with a larger party! If you want a little more relaxed environment come earlier in the night around 5:00 when there are less people. \n\nAs for price its worth every dime! The apps are not overpowering and thats why they are apps, not meals, and the steaks and sides are nice and oversized! Don't come here with a tight wallet, because you want to be able to fully enjoy the menu! Plus its in the Bellagio....so you know how that goes.. :)\n\nThis place is just one of my favorites, and make sure to make a reservation because this place is always booked :)", "type": "review", "business_id": "1nO6ffHEwZYFBzEsyw1w7w"}

If they would like to box up the uneaten portion of their dinner, box it all up instead of half.  Ask them if they'd like dessert or anything else before you drop the check on their table.

This was the an incredible dish. I am usually not the biggest lobster fan, but the way it was prepared, I am a fan now. You get a big lobster tail piece in the pie with vegetables and in cream broth. I was full after this meal. \n\nKobi beef - it was a good, but I think I was just full by time this came..=P It was medium rare, but may have been too rare for me. \n\nDessert - If you love dessert, this was the BOMB! It was a tasting menu of dessert - blood orange bon bon, old fashion root beer float with 2 chocolate chip cookie, brownie with ice cream, and I think 2 other ones that I can't remember. \n\nI was overly stuff by the end of the meal!

I really did. I heard so much good about this place, from people whose taste I trust. The experience itself was enjoyable. A very nice atmosphere. It was all so promising.\n\nSo following my normal habits, my friend and I sat at the sushi bar and asked the sushi chef to simply feed me what he would like, \"omakase\" style. He seemed happy enough about this... and made some fairly tasty rolls, albeit nothing extravagant and all pretty basic items from the menu. Given that I told him the only thing I wouldn't eat was octopus, I somewhat expected him to be a little more creative. Generally that is what's to be expected from omakase. But, this was my first time there, so it was excusable. He didn't know my taste.\n\nWe ended up having 4 rolls in all, and then when I was about ready to ask for some sashimi to finish up, he hands us some nigiri; 2 pieces each of salmon and ahi tuna. Okay, cool, that works just as well. This is his choice, after all. Unfortunately this is where the low rating comes from. I entrusted him to showcase his selection.... and this fish he gave me was not fresh. It was slimy. It had hardly any flavor at all; the predominant flavors came from the rice and the tiny dab of wasabi binding the fish to it. I had to wash both pieces of nigiri down with water and tea.\n\nTo me, the true measure of a sushi restaurant is in its sashimi and/or nigiri. And this is unfortunately where Sushi Eye fell flat on its face in my experience. Perhaps I've been spoiled at other restaurants, but I can't see myself returning here to try again. I'll go where I know the fish is fresh and flavorful.", "type": "review", "business_id": "lVHtVCyFJOqAH0ltn7pLuw"}

I asked a couple of people that were working the front what they thought of the automated system, and they all hated it because it slows everything down and makes the customers happy. I guess if the Rio doesn't have to pay a few people minimum wage to move the lines, it's worth it to them.\n\nEnough of my rant. The buffet itself is the biggest, most fresh, and best buffet in the vicinity of the strip. Everything is there. I mean it. Everything.

If there was such a thing as crab comma myself or my friends would have definitely slipped into one but thankfully there is no crab comma. \nThe chief said they fly the crab in everyday from Canada, I believe. Yes the chief comes around and talks to the Diamond members. \nThis is a World buffet so you can finds all kinds of food. I love the BBQ pork and Chinese vegetables.

To make it even worse, the clowns doing magic in between the acts are extremely awkward. It doesn't fit in the show in the first place and the story isn't funny at all. Meh, please show us something else when you need your performers change their outfit. For those of you who maybe reading this inside the theatre, just don't leave yet, the ending scene is probably the only thing that worth your money.

From the outside, I saw a bunch of little men with Troll-esque hair to compensate for their short stature. They were embarking in the \"fist pumping\" movement. Blech. No doubt, they thought they were the chosen people. I ignored the unsettling feeling in my stomach, and due to my friends that desired to go here, I held my breath and walked in.\n\nBefore I go on, I will add that I have been here before. During the summer, I would stumble in here on the later half of my Monday nights. My friends preferred Fat Tuesday's for their dollar drinks and laid back crowd, but I always wanted to go to Zuma to look at the \"pretty people\" with their meticulous hair cuts, and their blemish free faces. I suppose I am slightly masochistic. \n\nAnyway, I guess I have had it. I am boycotting this place, no matter how tempting it looks. The bartenders spend more time gazing upon their reflection in the mirror and catering to their narcissistic tendencies than serving their clientele. The bouncers act like they have had Botox on their faces and can not muster a smile, unless their \"douche\" friends swat them in their arms and that's when their face cracks. I mean, there are one or two that are tolerable. Birds of a feather flock together. May I add that this is the watering hole for men and women that think they are levels above everyone in this place. This is Tempe. This isn't a glamorous red-carpet event.\n\nI'm sorry, but when I go out, I want to be surrounded by people that don't look down on me. I found something even more amusing. The people that were acting the most arrogant were inches shorter than I was. Napoleon Complex, anyone? Oh, and yes...as far as the drinks go. They are mediocre.

The second night I had a rash all over my arms and legs. it was horrible. I ended up sleeping on towels. I called room service at 6 am and told them and he asked if I needed new sheets. I was leaving that morning. I told him I needed new towels and he said housekeeping came in at 7:30. I was like I need them asap. He found the grounds keeper to bring towels. When we checked out we told the manager about the sheets and she told me thank you for telling her she would notify corp. maybe they can change the detergent they are using. I thought at least they would give us a discount or something. We just spent 280.00 for two nights. The suite was nice the kitchen and bathrooms had granite counter tops. It was very nice.", "type": "review", "business_id": "q_bkzBZW08NRSYpiania_A"}

Pretty freakin' suh-weet.  The special comes with a nice sized steak, hash browns, 2 eggs and toast. I ordered my steak rare... since I figured at a place like this it would come to me perfectly medium rare and it was soooo good. Yes, it's not the best steak you'll ever have in your entire life BUT for that price... and at 3 am in the morning when all you want to do is curb the drunchies... it is the best thing you can get on the strip! Well some guys might argue with me but I think it's the best thing you can get at 3 am on the strip at that price haha. \n\nKeep in mind that the wait can get long around 12-3 am. You can always put your name down though and go play a few games in the casino which is literally right there. I don't recommend waiting around near the restaurant with the other drunks... Last time I was there my group of girls were in the middle of a fight between 4 drunk guys and it was scary. I'm not saying we were to blame but it really came across as a buck fight. Boys can be stupid. Hello, it's a casino. There are security personal everywhere AND cameras!\n\nEvery time I've gone since my 21st, the quality has been the same. I like consistency. My steak always comes straight from the grill piping hot and dripping with fatty goodness. I always get my eggs over easy since I like eating it on top of my toast and having the creamy yolk spill everywhere. The eggs are decent as are the hash browns. I love that they are crispy on top.

It was well seasoned though, with an asian fusion flavor. \n\n** L'asperge : Green asparagus kebab with quail egg \"mirror\", shimeji and Iberico ham: This is like the ham and egg combo, the mini egg sitting perfectly sunny side up on top of the asparagus. Cute little dish, with many interesting flavors. \n\n***Main dishes: Lamb shoulder confit with eggplant compote and mashed potatoes: The lamb was delectable, moist and perfectly seasoned\n        \n and also the Foie-gras stuffed free-range quail with mashed potatoes: I've never been a big fan of quail, but this quail, however small pieces, were really tasty and the foie gras complemented the quail taste very well.\n\nDessert: My hubby and I asked for one big main dessert instead of the two little ones that were on the menu.

After putting hot sauce over the whole thing, the sauce would melt the red ball to expose the creamy ice  cream inside.

We decided on trying the Carnegie Deli, a restaurant I must of passed by a thousand times.\n\n  Carnegie Deli has the distinction of being one of those restaurants where a nice overpowering deli smell leads guests to the establishment. As soon as I walk in the Mirage I could smell the deli smell beyond BLT, Starbucks,  and the Sugar Factory. The issue is that everytime that I looked at their menu, the prices were overpowering. Today we'd give it a try.\n\n  There are two cues for Carnegie Deli. One is for take out and the other is for dining in.\n\n   The dining room is spacious.  The restrooms are outside in the casino. Throughout the restaurant are pictures showing the history of Carnegie Deli.\n\n   Carnegie Deli has a long history. It was established in 1937 at the intersection of 7th Avenue at 55th Street in Midtown Manhattan.Throughout the years they have received accolades. In 1979, NY Times critic Mimi Sheraton named Carnegie Deli the #1 pastromi in New York City. Years later, in 2009 Dr. Phil gave a shout out that Carnegie Deli makes the best sandwiches later. On March, 26 2013 I am giving a shout out that Carnegie Deli made the thickest pastrami sandwich that I ever ate.\n\n   The Carnegie Deli website claims that all of their sandwiches are stuffed with at least one pound of meat. Finishing the pastrami on rye bread was one of the biggest dining challenges that I faced in awhile. Part of the problem is that I am not crazy over pastrami. Especially the $17 price. Carnegie offers other sandwiches that include Corn beef ($17.99), beef or brisket ($17.99), chop liver ($17.99), roast beef ($17.99), turkey ($17.99), bologne or salami ($14.99), shrimp salad ($12.99), and egg salad ($10.99). If I return I will most likely order the shrimp salad sandwich. If they are serving me a pound of that stuff I will up my rating to 4 stars. With the sandwiches are pickles. All three of us shared a bowl of french fries-a grand portion indeed. For a beverage there is fountain Coke or bottles of Dr. Brown's soda.\n\n  Carnegie Deli's motto is that if you can finish your meal we've done something wrong. My motto is that when a sandwich costs $17, I am going to finish my meal. Unfortunately I was so stuffed that I passed over trying their renoun cheesecake.  That could be for another time.\n\nThe Yelp 100. Review 49.", "type": "review", "business_id": "J4qLz0nGzCTMf6-kf_SiQg"}

I had the $39.99 prix fixe tasting menu about which the Mirage has been sending me emails for a few months.  \n\nAll the food I had was excellent.  I had lobster tacos, the prime skirt steak, and the jelly donut munchkin holes for dessert.  These get high marks in my review.  The tacos were luscious--the guacamole served with them was excellent!  The skirt steak was served with two sauces that were also very well done.  The munchkin jelly donut holes were really tasty with or without the vanilla sauce that came with them.\n\nNow for the minuses.  I had no bread service.  Evidently, if you order from the prix fixe menu, there is no bread service.  I didn't notice this until I was almost finished with my steak, so I didn't bother to ask then.  The steak came with two thin waffle potato chips.  That's it--no side of any kind, not a carrot slice, one broccoli floret, nothing!  I found it amazing when the server suggested I might want to order a side so I had enough to eat.  I did order a side of mashed potatoes at $8.  That sort of negates the prix fixe of early dining.\n\nWhen I first arrived the waitress brought me a \"new\" prix fixe menu at $59.99 that I should consider as it would entail more food.  This is not on the Mirage website.  I did notice there was more food served including sides.  It seems to be a bait and switch scheme, but maybe no.\n\nI considered giving Stack a 2 rating but the food was all so good, I just couldn't.  I do know I won't be returning here.\n\nEdit:  You know, I have to give it a 2 star rating.  This just doesn't deserve 3 stars.

Obviously, if you compare it to Disneyland, Six Flags, Knott's Berry Farm, Bush Gardens or a number of any other big name parks Adventuredome pales in comparison. It is small and they only have about 25 rides and attractions. But if you live in Vegas or just visiting this will probably be one of your kid's favorite stops.\n\nWe stopped by on a Sunday afternoon and it wasn't very crowded at all. Lines for rides were short and the longest wait was about 5 minutes. There are a few rides that are decent, like the Canyon Blaster roller coaster, Disk'O, Slingshot, and Chaos but don't expect to be blown away with excitement. The scariest thing about the rides is knowing that they're old and don't look like they're in the best shape. Combine that with the disinterest and \"I wish I was anywhere but here\" mentality of the teen employees operating the rides and the fear factor will increase.\n\nThey do have a few rides for really young kids, which my two year old loved. He just barely cleared the 36\" minimum required to ride and was thrilled to try things out. He looked a little unsure and scared on a couple rides at first, but when they started up he was laughing and smiling. He was so excited about the Frog Hopper (kids sit in a seat and bounce up and down), Miner Mike (roller coaster), and Road Runner (spins around and up and down) that he ran back to the line to ride them over and over again.\n\nThis park is probably best for younger kids, as older kids and adults will lose interest after a couple hours. But, it's still a fun place to go for the afternoon since there are no other amusement parks around. All day passes are $24.95. $14.95 for anyone under 48\" tall.", "type": "review", "business_id": "XZc403LVGPuIHCTQiZHlRA"}

When we arrived 10 minutes before our reservation we were told to check in close to our time... which was weird because we were about 8 minutes early.  Long story short, they were very busy and by 20 minutes AFTER our reservation I was a bit worried (remember this was an important b-day celebration).  I talked with the hostess and after begging, she sat us.  From the point forward, we were treated like royalty by our waiter and the bus boy, who were both amazing.  \n\nThe food was outstanding.  My Grandma and Husband both LOVED their steaks.  I had fish, which was undercooked at first, but I sent it back and it came back better than before.  We had the chipotle mac and cheese, which was even better than it sounds.  To top it off, we had the lava cake (my personal favorite), which was a treat from Flemings for my Grandma's B-day.  At the end of the meal the waiter gave my Grandma a box of chocolates, which I found to be so nice and it made her day.\n\nI will go back to Flemings for sure, I loved the food... I will just try to go on a less busy day, who would have thought a Sunday night would be so crazy!", "type": "review", "business_id": "uVbt9dOe6qJgBBI4_XsXRA"}

I was really excited to try it and after much anticipation went there tonight. I arrived at 8 pm with some friends and thought it was weird that all of the chairs were flipped up on the tables except for a few vacant tables and it was still an hour til closing time. \n\nI ordered my food and got it quickly (there were only a few other people there) and noticed my beans were cold and somehow burnt at the same time. The rest of my food was okay but definitely fell short of expectations. \n\nHowever none of that compared to what happened next. At around 8:15, two of the young employees started mopping the whole place starting right at the drink machine. I had never in my life seen such obvious disregard for customers. Once again, there was still 45 minutes left until closing time.  When one customer tried to get to the drink machine they did not move or even apologize for mopping. \n\nI also noticed that there was no wet surface sign. So not only was the mopping incredibly rude but also incredibly unsafe. When I asked one of the employees mopping if she had a wet surface sign to put out, she apologized and thanked me for reminding her while saying someone else usually does it. After I explained why the situation was unsafe and our conversation ended I assumed she would get a sign but instead went right back to mopping and later stood around talking to other employees. \n\nI certainly can't blame a couple of 16 year olds who are probably working their first job, but I can blame management which were no where to be found. I would normally not post a negative review but this was single handedly the worst restaurant experience of my life. I will not be returning.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Lnohr9bpCbHNsomazXDg-w"}

These states are dictated by your table by a round peg with different colors on it.\n\nBeing with 9 dudes we all decided that we were there to eat meat and more meat so we immediately turned the peg to green (for meat). This must have thrown off the staff because we all sat there for 10minutes twiddling our thumbs waiting for the meat skewers to come out.\n\nI think they wanted us to go get salad... because filling up on salad and a little meat is FAR less expensive than eating 5 pounds of meat per dude.\n\nFinally they caught on and started bringing meat out. We kept them busy but still they were slow. I am generally a slow eater and I could pretty much gobble up my meat before they even got around the table. Then... you'd have to wait 2-3 minutse for the next skewer to come out. So everyone spent a lot of time staring at an empty plate.\n\nThis isn't bad if you want to chat, which we did, but at the same time we were there to eat. As time goes on, food settles and you get full... so again, we were there for business and wanted more before it settled.\n\nWith that said, most of us went home stuffed. One guy could have stayed for another 4 hours, especially at the pace they were going at.\n\nThis was the first time I went to a Brazilian Steakhouse so I can't compare. A few of the other guys had gone elsewhere before and I believe they said that other places were better. I thought the food was decent but nothing I was absolutey dying for nor writing home about.

We told them we wanted it to go because we were tired and didnt want to sit there to eat (rather go back up and eat in bed), so they sent us to the bar and we ordered there. The service was decent but still a bit slow, the bartender came and asked us what we wanted but we didnt know yet, so he left and didnt come back for a while.  The food took about 10-15 minutes. The prices are a bit ridiculous though(not the food but the add ons)... my boyfriend ordered a Bacon BBQ burger and wanted jalapenos... which cost an extra $2. He also wanted Parmesan on the cheese, which was an extra $3, and they just sprinkled a bit on it.... The to go soda was $4.50, we should have just got the soda from the Bellagio vending machines which were only $3 AND it fills up that to go cup Twice. But the food was really good. I got the buffalo wings and they really really good, it had a lot of flavor to it and the chicken was cooked perfectly. The fries were good too, if only they put more cheese on it. My boyfriend loved the burger and loved the jalapenos because it was really really spicy. \n\nThe second time we came here was the next day around noon. We got seated pretty fast even though there was a line. But after our waitress took down what we wanted to drink, it went downhill... our waitress completely disappeared and another waitress had to come and ask us what drinks we ordered. After we got our ice tea, no one came to our table for a good 15-20 minutes. So I asked another waitress that we are ready to order and she just went back to setting up another table. After 5 more minutes, one of the hostess/server (don't know what she was, but she was not in waitress outfit) came and apologized and took our order (this was after I said \"the food here is good but the service sucks\" out loud, and the hostess/server probably heard because the computer that they enter stuff into was right next to us)\n\nWe finally got to order and we got some really delicious dinner rolls with butter. And we had a good time for the rest of the meal. My boyfriend had the Spaghetti Bolognese and I had the Bellagio Penne. Didnt really like my penne because the tomatoes made it a bit sour and I didnt want that so early in the morning, but my boyfriend liked it so he traded me. The spaghetti bolognese was very yummy... too bad I was stuffed with bread... I couldnt finish it...\n\nI guess the waitress/server knew they messed up because they gave us our ice tea for free at the end.\n\nThe food here is really good, the pricing for the food is reasonable but not the add ons. the service slow, so if you are in a hurry then dont come here. Normally I would give a three star for service like this, but the food was really delicious and the cafe was just beautiful.", "type": "review", "business_id": "UpMR63WZgIn8VDKnYpDwXA"}

In SF and Emeryville Trader Vic's is known for being a classy cool spot to go get good food and even better drinks in a funky environment. I have always loved Trader Vics and it has been one of my fav spots in the Bay for a while. Which leads me to the Scottsdale Trader Vic's which is basically at the Valley-Ho. Having just moved to Scottsdale I thought this would be a fun place to take a date, now wishing I would have chosen somewhere else. \n\nThis is a nontraditional Trader Vic's, typically known for their dark lighting and borderline tacky decor, this Trader Vic's looks like it belongs in a shopping mall. Really open and not very much decoration and on a Saturday night you could shot a cannon through the place. I ordered their famous Mai Tai which is usually awesome, but sucked, hardly any booze, wayyy too heavy on the lime. OK scratch the fun drinks, I get a bottle of wine with some disappointment as my dates drink also sucked. \n\nService was OK, not great... couple slip ups here and there, like pouring regular tap water into my glass of 1/2 full of bubbly water that was 8 bucks, then pouring me another one and trying to sneak a 2nd bottle onto my tab, busted. They redeemed themselves quite a bit by taking off one of our entrees (the duck, which was disgusting, dry, and tasteless) from the tab after she had said it was terrible. \n\nThe food in general was disappointing. In SF, Trader Vics has a poignant menu and a variety of different types of beef/seafood/chicken/wok. Not really the case at this one. I don't eat seafood so I was expecting to see my favorite Peppercorn NY Strip on the menu, not there. Basically if you don't eat seafood you have to pick from the duck (which was terrible), the beef tenderloin (what I ordered, was reasonable but wickedly overpriced at like $34) or another grilled chicken dish. The mashed potatoes were cold, the spare rib appetizer looked like it could have been served at Chili's (not a compliment) and in general the whole culinary experience was a disaster... as if that weren't enough then I got my tab... holy shit, i thought cost of living was cheaper down here, guess not at Trader Vics.... \n\nIn general 2 thumbs down for SCOTTSDALE Trader Vic's, although I will maintain patronage to the SF ones as long as they don't head down this path....", "type": "review", "business_id": "uI4YqMarUpchI4I3ZWgOGA"}

The chef didn't even remember to make the porridge until I asked the waitress three times after 30 minutes - and she finally asked the chef - which was just standing around - to make it. It took him less than 5 minutes to make it but I waited 45 minutes for it. Then after that I asked her for an extra spoon and she didn't even want to give it.

It is never really your first choice but when you are in a pinch you just have to go. It is our last resort after we go through the plethora of options of where to eat and none of us can decide what exactly we want so finally someone lets out a large sigh and says.... Okay, lets just go hit the Southpoint buffet. \n\nThere are a few things that I can definitely say are a positive for the buffet here. \n1.) The Prime Rib is always perfect and they cut it for a cowboy not for a princess. \nIE. I went to the buffet at Mandalay and it was the thinnest slice of meat I have ever been handed that was not over a deli counter. \n\n2.) The wait staff is usually very friendly aside from one experience I had there we always receive great service. \n\nNow for the \"meh\" details\n1.) The selection really never changes\n2.) The salad bar is lack luster \n3.) Does anybody really eat those crusty craw fish at the end of the buffet? \n4.) It closes at like 9PM. I know that is mostly due to it being a locals casino.... well that is what they say but I know damn well we do not have 398 Cowboys that all gather at the Southpoint every weekend that are all Locals. I know before going to a late movie There are times we would love to go grab some prime rib and veggies without having to go to the prime rib specific restaurant in the South point. \n\nWith all of that said, this is still probably going to be out go to spot to defuse those Hangry arguments we get into so regardless if they have tiny tidbits of salad toppings or Gigantic cuts of Prime rib it really doesn't matter because like I mentioned earlier it may not be your first choice but when your in a pinch you just have to go.", "type": "review", "business_id": "o7wCVuIalf_WbMJ1oX6Dnw"}

Several locations in several states.  That said, the food isn't bad.  Perhaps not as good as what you would get in Hawaii, but still pretty good.\n\nToday we ordered a family meal.  Chicken katsu, BBQ beef, chicken curry.\n\nThe curry could have used more sauce.  Would have made the flavor stronger.  But it was fine.\n\nThe BBQ beef was pretty good.  Not salty, nice flavor.\n\nThe chicken katsu is like \"chicken fingers\" you'd get in many restaurants.  The katsu sauce makes the difference.\n\nThe meals come with scoops of rice, and scoops of a macaroni salad.  I'm not fond of mayonnaise-based salads (macaroni or potato).  This one isn't horrible.  I can't say it's good, but remember that I don't like mayo.  That I can eat any at all says it probably isn't bad.  If you like mayo you will probably love that macaroni salad.\n\nOverall, pretty tasty.  And what was really cool was that the cashier took our coupon, even though their location was not listed as accepting them!  That is good customer service, in my opinion.  I would rate the food at 2.5 stars, but that kind of concern for the customer earns them a solid 3 star rating in my book.", "type": "review", "business_id": "-PA_1J9JzxLcluTOw2gZjw"}

We were getting back from a show and we walked pass the Cosmo and we ran into a guy advising us there was free limo rides and 2 free drinks.

We meet a family in town for a wedding who were really cool and they ended up inviting us to the wedding the next day. \n\nThe ride was nice, and the company was cool. I think it would be a little weird if there was not a party going on in a limo on the way to a strip club. So, we got in and my wife talked to a manager mentioning it was by Bday and he escorted us up to the top floor. This was a Friday night and it was packed. There were no seats available, but the person my wife spoke to was able to get us a nice seat that over looked the down stairs area too and it was right in front of the bar. I really don't remember how much the drinks were or how long we were there, but it was an amazing time. \n\nThere was a steady stream of girls coming over and asking if we wanted a dance, then it turned into my wife interviewing the girls to see if they were any good at couples dance. I ave to say, it is good to have a wife that not only would come to a strip club with you, but filter through the \"weeds\" as well. I would say after about 5-7 girls we decided on one and we went to the back room. There was a 2 drink min., but since there was 2 of us...it was not too shabby. We did have to buy a drink for the entertainer, but it was well worth it. It ended up being 3 songs for a bill. I had a good time and even better my wife had a great time. She could not stop talking about it the rest of the trip and that was just our first night in town. \n\nWe were getting ready to leave and we ran into the same people we were in the limo with on the way there. Funny how things work out. So we got the free ride back as well and everyone got dropped of at Cosmo. I mean that is where they picked us up at so it seemed fitting. Everyone in the limo tipped the driver so I think he ended up with well over $150.00. I am sure he had a good time listening to everyone's conversation on the way there and back.

That was tasty and the broiled (?) bananas were the perfect addition. \nWould I go again for that price? Probably not.

My daughter and I went there one Sunday evening around 5:30pm and the place was hoppin!  There was a long line but it moved quickly. The smell of pecan wood filled the air and all around us families sat at tables devouring pulled pork, ribs, and brisket.  It looked yummy.  It's a bit like a cafeteria in that you stand in line, get your tray, silverware and drink and then approach the food to tell the person behind the counter what you would like.  I have a half rack of ribs with a baked potato the size of both my fists!!!  It was HUGE but it was probably the best baked potato I have had in years.  And the ribs were delicious.  The sauce was sweet and gave a nice accent to the meat.  The meat fell off the bone.  My daughter had a pulled pork sandwich and I took a bite......it was yummy too.  Everything is fresh and tasty!!  One of my favorite things about Joe's is their home made root beer.  I don't know of any other place that serves home made root beer.  This was the bomb!!!  I could have drank a gallon of it!!  \n\nJoe's is the real deal.  It's a great family friendly place.  The night I was there it was packed with families chowing down on some good BBQ.

In fact, the only thing I ever get at Joe's is their chicken breast sandwich, but I'm hooked for life. The mac & cheese is amazing and I've been known to get two portions of it because it is so good. I recently discovered their cornbread, and it is also a winner. The root beer cake was intriguing but not as good as I was hoping for, but the lemon cake is great. Oh and the chocolate chip cookies are the best I've ever had.\n\nMy only little complaint, and it's not even something that can be fixed because of the restaurant setup, is how it is difficult to get drink refills when there is a long line.

The same goes for potatoes.  That's the primary reason our breakfast was very good, but not exceptional.

I should have let them take it! \n\nThe service at the spa was inconsistent: my mother was with me, and her massage and facial were nothing like mine! She said she would have given them 2/5 stars. Everything she described in the facial was different - not just the products used, but all the techniques, equipment, etc. Very strange.\n\nOur casita was spacious and comfortable, with a fantastic view and cozy, comfy bed - but it was dated. Old tube television with bad reception and a tired looking shower.\n\nThat said - I can't wait to go back!", "type": "review", "business_id": "WFDxa8r0sT2ZnehYTyT1LQ"}

We stay here twice a year for 8-11 days. And that for the past few years. So, I dare to say we're regular guests. That means that we also see the changes over the years. And those are not always for the better......\n\nIn this review I only commend the general amenities like the pool, the reception, the overall premises and the valet. We almost alway book the room through Luxury Suites International so you'll find the review of the room and the roomservice there.\n\nHaving said that. Let's review The Signature. In the past we've stayed in Tower 2 and 3, but the last years we always request Tower 1. It's nearer to the MGM (and believe, it's quit a walk) and the pool has better sun hours. Almost all day long you can have a spot in the sun. So you wish......\n\nBut, I don't alway want to sit in the sun. I prefer a parasol because my skin is definitely not used to over 100F. And that seems to be a problem in the last few years. Every year there are less parasols. I regret that deeply. For me it should be obliged by law to provide (free) parasols I've you offer pool amenities. This is Vegas, this is the dessert! We even had one year (about 3-4 years ago) that you had to pay $30 for a parasol. Luckily that stopped with that ridiculous policy.\n\nSo the pool is the only thing I deduct a star for. Mostly because of the parasol issue and besides that because of the paid chairs and cabanas ($75-$200). Maybe because I'm European that I dislike that, but maybe also because I seldom see anybody use them. Like I said, we're here twice a year. Late may/june and late september/october, during the weeks, the weekends and sometimes a holiday and in all those years last may was the first time I saw a party using a cabana. Loose those things and use the parasols and space for other guests. That would be a really nice gesture.\n\nAnd in the past (like everything) the pool service was better. More, free parasols, free bottles of water and thicker towels.\n\nValet service is excellent. I really like the friendly staff. Fitness facilities are nice. Wifi service depends a little bit on the place you are. But it seems to be better than in the past. And it's a good thing they don't provide free newspapers anymore to all rooms. I believe you can pick up a copy at the front desk. Probably saves a lot of money and trees. All together we would definitely recommend this hotel and I hope to be back in 2014.\n\n(Note: I'm no native speaker so please forgive any spelling and grammar mistakes.)", "type": "review", "business_id": "KpZLxHrp2PIP8tLBsPLiww"}

YES!!! 10mins later the manager walks up and says \"hi I guess there was a problem??? I say, no we got it worked out.

Living in Las Vegas, it's been pretty tough to find good Malaysian food especially being a vegetarian. We finally decided to go to Satay late one night with a bunch of friends. (Yes...this place is open super late and so it's a perfect chill hang out after a show...)The ambience was suprisingly very modern and the restaurant had couches for us to sit on that seemed so urban and chic. It's hard to find a vibe like this at an Asian place outside the strip. Their drinks menu looked very interesting with Singapore Slings, Mai Tais and other exotic Asian inspired cocktails on it. I had a Mai Tai which was pretty good (rather strong but I'm not complaining)....We ordered the roti canai (Asian pancakes that is served with a curry dipping sauce) to start with. That was pretty alright...the pancake itself seemed like it may have been frozen and then reheated so definitely it wasn't the top of the \"fresh\" list. We also ordered crispy samosas. Omigosh...this was AMAZING! The potato and peas curry filling was so moist and oozing out of the fresh crisp samosa wrapper. It was a little party in my mouth! We then ordered the char kuay teow - flat rice noodles in a black sauce with tofu. This is my favorite South East Asian dish and was hoping that thi Char Kay Teow would be passable. It was really good! They put the right ingredients and even made it vegetarian for us. The service here was friendly. the food came fast, they were very accommodating to our requests and the price was very reasonable. All in all, a great option to hang out at.

Located in a neighborhood that seems simultaneously sleepy and buzzing with energy, this bar is a perfect reflection of the direction that the downtown area is moving in, flaws and all.  \nBuilt in an old historic home in the Roosevelt district, the aptly named bar oozes charm in more ways than one can count.  There are 4 or 5 separate rooms inside that create a cozy atmosphere and a great sense of privacy.  Decorated with fancy wall papers, flowers on each table and a nice collection of candles, the Roosevelt would serve as an excellent place for a casual first date, but works just as well for a fun night of beer sampling and cheese-eating snobbery.\nWhile the bar offers a nice selection of wine, the Beer menu is the real star at the Roosevelt, so if your idea of a nice drink doesn't involve hops and yeast you may want to go somewhere else to imbibe.  With an impressive selection of top-shelf craft brews and imports, the Roosevelt is well worth checking out.  In fact, its the only place I have been to in my entire life that serves the Konig Ludwig Weiss, which I highly recommend trying if you make the trip out to the Roos'.\nIn spite of its many charms, the Roosevelt isn't without its flaws.  Service and seating can be hit and miss depending on when you decide to go.  Also, the lack of outdoor seating means that smokers will have to leave their drinks inside and walk out front if they want to light up.  I've been told that the ownership is working on this issue, but for the time being, if you want to smoke, you're doing it on the street.  Finally, the bar keeps odd ours which might freak out some folks in the drinking set.  I've heard rumors that they're closed on Mondays and know for a fact that on week nights they don't stay open much past midnight.  If this is an issue for you I would suggest calling ahead before planning a visit.  \nAll in all, the Roosevelt is a great place to go enjoy a few beers, relax and enjoy some conversation.  However, if you're looking for a booze fueled barn burner, you should probably look elsewhere because the Roosevelt is way too classy for that.", "type": "review", "business_id": "7cP7WFmWiTVh-raIL3N_Vw"}

WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO THIS PLACE?\n\nFor one, I have been going here and enjoying the grilled cheese/tomato soup plate for quite a while. The last few times (over the course of about 6 months or so) the soup has tasted bland and almost inedible. It's not the creamy flavorful soup I remember from my first few visits. The grilled cheese is still pretty good, but I don't go there for the soup or grilled cheese alone. It's the combination of the two I really liked. \nI almost refuse to buy soup and a grilled cheese anywhere else because I feel like I could make the same thing at home for a fraction of what I pay for it at a restaurant. But I didn't used to feel that way about the plate at The Roosevelt. It was something special. But not anymore. Maybe if I didn't know how wonderful it used to be I wouldn't mind it. But as a soup (tomato mainly) aficionado I have left the last few times feeling unsatisfied.\n\nAlso, I dunno what's going on but the service here has really gone downhill. My last waitress (who I have heard complaints about before from friends) was super rude to me. On my last visit I met up with some friends who had already been there for about 30 or so mins. I walked in and searched for them (this place is almost too dark to see anyone) and sat down. I waited a good 15 mins before the waitress came over and at first I didn't even know she was there because she didn't make her presence known. She just stood to the side of me with her arms folded staring at me like she wanted to me to hurry up and order. No hello or what can I get you. Nothing. When my food (The tomato soup/grilled cheese plate) came about 10 mins later I was not very happy with it, like I said before It's not as great as it used to be, and so I wanted to send it back. I really hate doing that but I really didn't even want to eat it. Well what seemed like forever went by and no waitress. Our waters were empty, my friends wanted more beer and I wanted something else to eat. By the time she came back (I would guess about 20 or so mins) I just didn't even feel like bothering. AND the only reason she came back was to drop off the check. She didn't even ask if we needed anything and completely ignored the empty glasses on our table. \nI mean, I don't want my waitress coming over to check on me every 30 seconds or anything but I feel like every time I go in here I just get ignored. \n\nThe one and only reason they got two stars from me is because it's close to my house and they have happy hour specials (both food and drink) all day on sunday. I'll wait for my crappy service as long as my wine is half off.", "type": "review", "business_id": "7cP7WFmWiTVh-raIL3N_Vw"}

My girlfriend paid, so I didn't see the cost til it was too late.  That put a bit of a damper on things, because I was ticked from the get-go.  I don't even want to say what we paid, because it's embarrassing.  We really should have walked out and gone to STK or something, it wouldn't have been much more.\n\nSo, let's start with the \"good\": Our server was VERY nice!  She was a doll and should really be serving somewhere better.  The pot-stickers and shrimp/pork dumplings were edible.  In fact, with a little Sriracha, they were pretty good.  The chilled shrimp and crab legs, on this day, were perfect.  The legs weren't huge but they were nicely split and easy to access the meat, so it made them easy to eat.  I really should have just stopped there.  OH, actually, the prime rib was decent.  Actually, when we got some fresh out of the over, it was really tasty.  Cooked just right, amazingly enough.  There, I should have stopped there.\n\nThe \"bad\": The chinese food was crap.  Worst garlic beef, ever.  Chewy, nasty pieces of meat and the sauce was like gelatin.  The breakfast options must have been sitting out for hours.  The eggs had a crust on them 1/2\" thick.  I couldn't even force myself to get any.  The bacon had been sitting for a while too and had gotten soggy.  HOW does bacon get soggy???  And the desserts?  If it wasn't for some OK gelato, I would have gone all Hulk on this place for the crap desserts.  The chocolate cheesecake actually made me physically sad.  And then the \"key lime pie\" made me really mad.  Bah, I don't want to talk about this anymore, it's just depressing me.\n\nMy recommendation, avoid the buffets.

It's a kitschy, small bar with a serious lean toward hipster.   \n\nI got a vodka tonic ($5) and a vodka rockstar ($6).  These prices didn't seem outrageous to me at all, and the bartenders were very friendly.  You know, for hipsters.\n\nWe were there for roller derby night (Valentines), and it was hilarious!  It was basically a bunch of semi-coked out dirty hipsters in booty shorts and sweatbands, skating around all willy nilly.  I had a blast, and will absolutely go next time they have roller skating.  \n\nThe only drawback was the $5 cover at the door.  For a place that's so small and really wasn't crowded, that seemed a bit ridiculous.  On the other hand, it was only $5, not $15 or $20, like I've been quoted at Downtown (the bar on Las Vegas and Fremont, right around the corner).\n\nThe music was perfect for rollerskating, and included a bunch of 70's, 80's and 90's hits (like No Diggity, Jesse's Girl, and Jackson 5 songs).  \n\nLike I said, if you're a big fan of, say, Tabu...you'll hate this place.

I had been here once with my sister for dinner shortly after they opened and found the prices to be higher than the quality of food and service warranted and so promptly forgot about it and never came back (and apparently never even wrote a review).\n\nFlash forward to last Friday night when I am out with a bunch of ladies celebrating not one but two birthdays. We were in a party mood and so opted to sit in the bar area.  Boy, we did not know what we were in for.  Crazy loud music with a total meat market atmosphere. Unfortunately the band that night was a funk/r&b band which is not at all our style. After watching the cougars stalk their prey and the odd couples on the dance floor gyrate to Prince and Parliament songs for a couple hours, I was ready to get out of there. I think with a different band I may have enjoyed it a little more but I generally prefer a more laid back atmosphere and to be able to talk to my friends at the table without having to shout.\n\nOn the plus side, the food was very good.  My favorite Italian place in this part of town is Vincitorio's (on Elliott and McClintock) but I don't really care for their linguine with clams dish so I took advantage and ordered it here at Va Bene and it did not disappoint one bit.  I mean, it was so good I ate the whole thing and then mopped up the sauce with the rest of the bread in the basket.  Yum!  I also sampled some of my neighbors Gnocchi and that was fantastic as well.  Everyone at the table of 8 girls seemed to love their food and we all ordered different wines by the glass and no one was disappointed in that, either.\n\nSo, if you are in Ahwatukee looking for good Italian food and good wine and you don't mind spending a few extra bucks then this is a good option (Caffe Boa just up the road is a more affordable with same ambiance) but don't come on a Friday or Saturday night unless you are looking to party, hook-up, or shake your booty... or maybe all three!", "type": "review", "business_id": "e3izESeW0BUx0s96FdSLag"}

Unfortunately nothing about it is Grand.\n\n  The Grand Cafe of today trails behind the Grand Cafe of a few years past in value. With the exception of their daily special, the prices are inflated. Gone are the entrees that include a cup of soup. My dinner: fettuccine, bread, cream of mushroom soup, cola, and tip came to $17. For that price, I would prefer Olive Garden or Red Lobster. \n\n  There were a couple issues that caused me to lower the review by half a star. Far too much of the fettuccine was taken up by bread. Attention to beverage refills was slow.\n\n  My impression of the Grand Cafe is it is a convenient 24 hour restaurant to grab a bite in Santa Fe Station. And, if I am not mistaken, Grand Cafe is the go-to place for desserts in Santa Fe Station.\n\n These are my recommendations for the Grand Cafe management to improve their restaurant. Offer more items, lower the pricing, include soup with all entrees, and provide better refill service on beverages.", "type": "review", "business_id": "PiDKW4Tqn98_D8WUcBQZow"}

I know Vegas has dozens of great restaurants and it is so tempting to try them all, but I have no issue foregoing a new place next time to return to STRIPSTEAK. I was recently in LV staying at THEhotel and visited STRIPSTEAK on consecutive days. \n\nWe actually stopped in for the Happy Hour which turned out to be a great deal. From 4-7pm all the apps were 1/2 off and beers were $3. \n\nOver the two days I ordered, split, and/or tried the following: Duck Fat Fries, Skirt Steak, Crab Cakes, Kobe Sliders, and Lobster Fritters. \n\nFirst off, none of them disappointed and some of them (crab cakes, and fries) I had the first night and went with again on the second. The DFF's were great. Each fry matched it's sauce perfectly. The skirt steak I will save for last. The crab cakes were the most unique I've ever had. Usually you think of a handcrafted pan sauteed cake. I have no clue how they got this crab cake so perfectly shaped (probably a mold) and so crispy but it was amazing. Not short on crab and had the right amount of of kick, great dish. Next were the Kobe Sliders. For those of you who claim you can't taste the difference between regular beef and Kobe or grass fed beef, there is a McDonald's right across the street from Mandalay. The sliders were seasoned well and the whole burger was delicious. The lobster fritters were, you guessed it, great. So very light and fluffy and a light creme fraiche to accompany it. Last and very much the best was the skirt steak. I actually didn't believe it was skirt steak because of the tenderness. I was lead to believe skirt was a very tough cut and expected it to be very chewy. Quite the contrary, this steak melted in your mouth. That, along with tasting out of this world in terms of seasoning, made this my favorite dish. \n\nThe last thing of note was the service. A+. We had the same two bartenders serve us both nights and there were awesome. Two of the most easy going friendly dudes ever. They were right on top of things but weren't over bearing, it was almost like they could read our minds. They featured a homemade blended drink serve with one massive ice cube (apparently from a 20k ice maker) that was a blend of two different types of liquor (i asked but now forget which two) and is mixed with some fruit and other ingredients over a lengthy process and then put out in a colander sitting on a bed of ice. It runs for $14 a glass and the guys had no problem letting us try it. It tasted excellent, almost like an Orange flavor reminding me of Grand Marnier. Overall, it was enjoyable and worth the small priced compared to what it costs to get a mixed drink at every other bar, restaurant, and club in Las Vegas.", "type": "review", "business_id": "XDYnLQC8ViZejuCDp4eCwg"}

Nice decor and the lady manning the cashier was very helpful and nice (I'm guessing that's Yupha?). I ordered the Pad Sew Ew lunch special, one of my favorite Thai noodle dishes. I took it to go though, so when I finally got him after about 30 mintues, the fried spring roll was not crisp anymore. I can't complain though and I was more interested in the noodles themselves.\n\nWhat can I say? It was good, very good in fact. The right mix of soy and spicyness. Other thai restaurants get the spicyness wrong for me. I like my dishes with heat, but I can't take too much of it. And too little makes it bland. This was the correct amount of heat for me. Also, the chicken was cooked properly. Other places sometimes overcook it, making it tough and rubbery. This was still quite moist and tender.\n\nIt's a thumbs up for me, but I'll have to come back with a group to order more dishes.", "type": "review", "business_id": "90AXjqb4O-wrTHDKDoDUzg"}

Tonight was the fourth time we have been to AMC Ahwatukee and the 2nd time of which where the volume in the theater was excessive. As a professional audio engineer, I am well aware of what the volume in the theater should be, how the sound systems should be calibrated, how the movies are electronically delivered to the theaters and much more.  As a professional audio engineer, I also am fortunate to always have hearing protection with me.  Due to high volume, I ended up wearing my professional earplugs to protect my hearing.  However, most customers do not carry earplugs with them, so they must endure and possible suffer hearing damage from the excessive volume.  As previously mentioned, this is the 2nd occurrence at this specific theater where the volume was excessive and clearly out of specification.  I have written to AMC (via their website), with hopes that AMC takes this issue seriously as well as takes initiatives to resolve the issue.  Until that time, I simply will indicate that as a customer, to be aware that the volume at this theater may be loud enough to  cause either temporary or permanent hearing, a health concern.

So, Why the background information? Simply put I'm cynical and spoiled and didn't expect the desert to have such BOMBay (ha-ha) Indian restaurants... But we do!\nOkay, If Indian cuisine was bad Karaoke (metaphorically speaking.) and there was a contest like...American Idol; and I was on a panel with Simon, Paula, and Randy I know we would unanimously vote Mantra Masala-Healthy Cuisine from India, to be the next American Idol.\n There's never a wait and the prices are fair. (Dinner price-appetizer, variety of Nan, main course and drink 20-30$ per plate.) The service is prompt and extremely friendly. Tonight we brought a newbie to Indian cuisine and the owner (I think she was the owner?) She was nice enough to explain what's what to our friend. \n Tonight I had the Chicken Vindaloo and I'm still thinking about how awesome it was. The Nan & Onion Culcha is made on site, piping hot and oh so good. The Samosa mixed appetizer is one you can't go wrong with. I gauge my restaurant on the Chicken Tikka Masla and Mantra Masala passes with flying colors. The Tikka & Tandoori is spiced perfectly and always juicy. The Mango Lassi and their Taj Beer are excellent (probably not together.) This place is extremely Vegetarian friendly.\n I'm psyched they are getting ready to start a lunch buffet next week.

I tried to find a less expensive version of a sweater there I wanted once, couldn't find it anywhere, so I wound up coming back  and chalked up the $$ for it. If you wait a couple weeks you can catch some really good stuff in their clearance section.  It's in a small section at the very back corner of the store past the open doorway. It's usually where I head to first if I dont get distracted with looking at all the knick knacks along the way.\n\nYou cant go wrong with buying something here for someone. The home decor, bath products and fragrances are pretty affordable and make great gifts. Especially those candles that entice you to spend money there.

Today, I came in to order my usual the Soy African Sunrise Tea Latte. However, I was informed by the manager (much to my dismay) that the corporate office has discontinued the African Sunrise tea. That is a huge bummer. The manager then recommended a decaf Chai tea that was amazing. \nI didn't get a pastry today, but I am a fan of the donuts and scones.

We were gonna have some drinks after the wedding at 10p in our room with some of the guests since we got the Tower Suite with has a full kitchen and lots of sitting room and such. Well before we even got to our room we got a complaint, says the report the next day, I don't know how that can happen when no one is in the room. Hmm, oh maybe it was the bachelor party that was going on down the hallway that was in no connection with us. So when security made it up to the room the \"2nd\" time we had one more chance or the cops we getting called.  So we get everyone but 2 people down stairs, those 2 people were sleeping, so there was no noise, and here comes security again saying we are being loud. That is when we got super pissed. Everyone is downstairs but two people sleeping, how is this loud. Words were exchanged and we all went downstairs. \n\nMy boyfriend then tries to talk to hotel management about the situation and they don't wanna hear it. There is a \"no party\" clause that we were told about?!?  First off, we didn't know about that & secondly when did the Ho become a place you can't part at? \n\nAt the end of the day, save you money and don't give the Ho. Just Uber home and sleep in your own bed...\n\nJesse... We were at no point during our stay told about the no partying clause until after security came. At check in all there was was the passing off of the keys to the room and that's it. We understand that you are a hotel. But let it be known that a place that offers vodka sodas by the pitcher and is known as the \"party\" hotel by all AZ natives, maybe you should reassess your image.  \n\nSecondly, you should give second thoughts to whom you have in place as your wedding planner.

If you are new to the valley, this is the best way to gauge the options you will find when stopping in for the first time. It is and will always be my my # 1 store to hit for necessary recipe items. The store carries a wide range of spices that are pourable from a spout. Generally they are priced by the ounce, or whichever measuring medium used on the spice's label. It's amazingly easy when making a recipe, just go to Sprouts! On top of that, they also carry a large inventory of barreled scoop-and-pay items. Everything from Split Peas to gummy bears, then more. It's a specialty grocery store that allows you to shop for specific niche items that you can't find elsewhere. Its an experience, when compared to general grocery chains . Outside of a true meat market, they carry some of the freshest meats/seafood in town that a grocery chain could provide. This is one thing that TJ's has not... a meat counter with high quality options! Finally, besides the healthy living section filled with vitamins and minerals, they also have a general produce section along with frozen foods, much alike TJ's.\n\n~The Bad~\nThey are always a bit pricier than other spots in town, very comparable to TJ's. This is where once again that comparison will help you. It is pricier to shop here for your primary grocery list. Its best to gauge the weekly specials and to see what items are on sale, which is straining but will save you a lot in the end. They do not have many household products like at a grocery chain, but that's not the primary reason to come here anyway.\n\n~Extras/Rating~\nOn Wednesdays, they come out with the next week's special sales. This also coincides with the closure of the previous weeks' specials. Thus, you have twice the specials on Wednesdays!! This is the best day to shop here, so much is on sale! Take a look at the frozen section, they have some interesting items I never even noticed... Sashimi Grade Tuna, hooray! That's just a small example of what else they have. They get 4 stars for having such an excellent healthy selection of foods. The prices drag them down one star, but you can't haggle with prices too much when you see the selection and quality you get here. This location has wonderful, fast service, and will always do you well. Enjoy food shoppers!", "type": "review", "business_id": "2e3v5rl80j4pI3L2135xYg"}

Ok I am exaggerating on all fronts here but the bottom line is Smith and Wollensky is what we thought they were--an outstanding steakhouse. If you read there tagline, \"It's a place to end all arguments\" and after one visit, you will quickly learn why! Matter a fact if she can't get over the fact you were texting a random on behalf of your friend who lost his cell phone *wink wink* then run my friend, run. Because if she can't forgive you after wolving down a $50 steak, your SOL and she can go eat at the Olive Garden with the next chump she meets! Good riddance sista..ok back to the food. \n\nI'm a creature of habit so I order pretty much the same thing every time..if it aint broke, don't fix it right? First off you have to wet the palate! Beefeater straight up with Olives Sir (throw a little bass in your voice too). \n\nNext up, the Wedge salad! Um..excuse me waiter, can you tell the chef don't be tight with the Blue Cheese! He will usually laugh and wa-la you got extra complimentary Blue Cheese! Fuckin A!!  \n\nNext Order the cajun ribeye if you like a little kick to your steak and you won't be disappointed. And don't be that guy that orders it Well Done, act like you've been there before and calmly say, medium rare thanks...I'll usually go with this cut and it takes up the entire plate. Also at this time I will order a glass of Pinot or Cab and tell them you want it delivered simultaneously with the steak!\n\nAs for sides there Mac and Cheese is without question the best Mac and Cheese on the planet. Other sides that are worth trying, the sauteed mushrooms, grilled asparagus and of course the twiced baked potatoe. Also there seafood tower is legit although I don't reccommend it if your palate is set on beef because it's overkill with all the food and you might of walked in looking like Vin Diesel, but after indulging you might leave looking like Tony Soprano, so be forewarned. (This happened to me once, was on a date and somehow the fuckin shirt shrunk during dinner and when I left, I couldn't breathe! dohhh)\n\nAs for cocktails, the mixologists here do a great job here on whipping up that concoction that you enjoy. Extensive wine list and a great selection of wines by the glass. On the side bar, I believe they still sell cigars although I am not sure where you can fire up at. There scotch selection is great and I reccommend going with an 18 year Glenlivet single malt to wash down that great meal. \n\nLook let's face it, you're in Vegas, your going to drop $200 easy gambling, at the club or at the strippy...SO do yourself a favor and call your concierge at your hotel and tell that cocksucker you need a reservation at Smith and Wolls baby! Never. Stop. Eating.", "type": "review", "business_id": "btp0v0Qk7CmOmuMdt3aqkQ"}

I think this dish would have been awesome with regular sausage or bacon.  The potato hash and poached egg were very good.   My friend had the crab club sandwich, which he said was very good, although the fries which came with it were slightly salty and over seasoned.  The maine lobster was good, as was the kobe burger.   My favorite dish was the poached eggs and duck hash, it was presently beautifully on top of a pastry puff, and the flavors were delicious!   \n\n We ended with the signature souffl\u00e9, which did not fail to disappoint!  Overall, the food was good, but I would have liked a little more variety for brunch.  I think Bouchon has a better brunch menu, prices at Tableau are slightly higher than Bouchon, and the portions are smaller here...but the signature souffl\u00e9 is excellent!  Non of the dishes which we tried were unsatisfying  or disappointing , but most of them did not stand out as great or exceptional... besides the Duck Hash and the Souffl\u00e9.

Complete with gold plated wheel chair, two body guards, middle-aged Asian nurse / possible wife, attempted-assassination related paralysis and all! \n\nAnyways, this is one of those classy places that I do not frequent myself, unlike people like Larry Flynt. A place that will provide you with a chair for your purse. A place where they serve you two different kinds of butter with the bread and I am the only one at the table gauche enough to ask why. A place where the only table not too blase and nonchalant to gawk at Larry Flynt is the table that I am sitting at.  \n\nThe service here is impeccable, as is the decor. There are accouterments like: a single sunrise rose in the middle of the table in a simple, acrylic vase; white linen tablecloths; the aforementioned purse chair (!); everything is so classy and \"pinteresty\" here!\n\nBread basket included: BACON PASTRIES. Holy crap, I have no idea how you make a bacon pastry light, fluffy, and flaky, yet still taste of bacon and have bacon bits all over it, but somehow they accomplish that here. \n\nI ordered the Nautica Smoked Salmon Benedict. I like my yolks super runny - the ones here were a little over for my tastes, but there was a s*itload of smoked salmon, so I could not complain. Literally half the dish was smoked salmon (!). In retrospect it's probably the same good stuff that is at the Wynn buffet, but at the time, I was truly impressed. All my company was equally pleased with how tasty their food was.  \n\nYes, Tableau is expensive, but what nice place on the strip isn't pricey? All in all, this is really a great place to take a break from the Vegas craziness to just have a 14 dollar mimosa with a 27 dollar eggs benedict, with a couple of your buddies, all the while gawking at Larry Flynt.", "type": "review", "business_id": "vEeiIvhzz29rO-6EPFqkjQ"}

First, we went to a 4pm matinee and it cost $24 ... that is $10 more than seeing a matinee at our usual theater.  Then we ordered some of their Italiano (sausage and pepperoni) pizza.

The ice tea was $4.50 for unlimited refills, but it didn't taste good and we couldn't even get the server to bring us a glass of ice (since they put hardly any ice in it).  The popcorn was $7.75 with unlimited refills, but I was the only one eating popcorn and didn't need refills.  My usual theater gives me free popcorn if I spend $20 yearly for a t-shirt and $1 drink refills on their souvenir cup.  Our total tab was around $64 including tip.  Thought it was just too much for bad food.  Seats are okay, but I find them uncomfortable since I don't like to lean.

Peter did his meticulous research and for my birthday dinner took me to a Douglas Rodriguez restaurant called Deseo.  We asked the manager for some more recommendations for dining in the area, and it turned out that he had worked with Binkley's, and sent us there.\n\nOff the radar, and a half hour along cactusy single lane highways outside of Scottsdale, it is a place we never would have found without a local's help.  Daily menus change with the seasons, the ingredients, and the mood of the chef, Kevin Binkley, who is young enough to be intrepid and old enough (five years at the French Laundry directly under Keller and then several years at the Inn at Little Washington with Patrick) to understand fine dining.  Binkley takes the fine dining concept out for a spin and brings it home via the back roads, and the result is a comfortable, homey, small restaurant that can be dressed up or down.  People sat at the bar and had beers, and people came in their Sunday best to celebrate anniversaries.  \n\nThe menu can be arranged in several ways, served a la carte, in full portions, or arranged in tasting menus of various combinations, paired with wines, and smaller in size.  We opted for the five course tasting menu with the cheeses in lieu of dessert ($82), and I ordered a half-bottle of Minor Viognier ($29) from their well-chosen, well-priced wine list, since Peter doesn't drink wine.  On the menu, it states that the chef can and will accomodate dietary requests, which knocked us both off our feet....low carb, vegetarian or whatever, you're in good hands, and the chef actually welcomes your challenge!\n\nSent home with the menu (tied in a blue satin ribbon), I can tell you what we chose, among three or four options per course:\n\nPeter's choices:\nBigeye Tuna Tartare with watermelon, edamame,l daikon, wasabi-coconut pana cotta, lotus root chips, lychee and chili oil\n\nSoft shell crab with lime, fried green tomato, red onion marmalade, lemongrass ginger sauce\n\nKing Clip with wild asparagus, ramps, pattypan squash, roasted fingerling potatoes (we asked for those to be left off and they were), spring garlic and rouille\n\nRibeye steak with egg yolk ravioli, broccoli, maitake mushrooms, baby bulb onions and hollandaise\n\nMy choices:\n\nSteak carpaccio with an heirloom tomato tart, mozzarella cream, cucumber, balsamic vinegar, basil and charred red onion\n\nCorned beef TONGUE Reuben, with sauerkraut, thousand island \"dressing\", a cornichon, and french fries\n\nCopper River King Salmon with giant gnocchi, sweet peppers, tasso ham, sea beans, orange and mustard\n\nThe same ribeye as Peter--we both had to have it.\n\nWe both had the cheeses at the end, and I can't remember all of them, but all six were outstanding.\n\nOthers have mentioned the plethora of amuses that come out prior to your courses, and while I did eventually find them a little distracting, most were very successful, with only the disco coaster presentation of a pineapple shooter failing to amuse my bouche or anything else.  Others include a house-cured beef jerky with horseradish creme fraiche, a bacon and egg puff pastry bite, a melon and basil soup shot with pancetta dust rimming the glass and a date and chorizo bite that was nothing short of heaven.  Most were savory and enjoyable.\n\nOur food was very good, with the only failure of my meal being the overabundance of orange with my salmon.  In sauces, in segments, all over, it distracted me from the other savory elements instead of complementing it, but the salmon was delicious.  I would go into more detail about the food, since what is listed above is, in THEORY, what we were served, but in actuality was not, since Binkley is an adherent to the molecular gastronomy/Wylie Dusfresne/Adria/Michel Richard style of cooking.  It defies description, so I won't.  You'll be happy if you go with an open mind.\n\nOn our visit, there were three breads to choose from as they bring it around.  We tried a sourdough ciabatta & a cracked wheat, both extraordinary, helped not a little by Normandy butter, served room temperature in a ramekin.\n\nService is from the left, French style, one waiter per person, with knowlegeable servers directing traffic and helping as needed in the small space.  We were made to feel welcome and at home from the  moment we entered for our 8:15 reservation.  Young people learning the fine dining business are the norm here, servicewise, with three steady young women in black overseeing them and taking orders and discussing the wines with the diners as they are seated.  I had no problem with the youth and inexperience of the servers but Peter found it a little offputting.   Don't expect perfect French from these youngsters and you'll be satisfied, is my opinion.", "type": "review", "business_id": "yJMLD-6AggZNdC-GonVBsA"}

With that said, I think we can all pretty much agree that this is  not and will hever be the kind of place where you will do all your shopping.  It will however be the type of place where you go for things that you can only get a Trader Joe's.  Things like Orangina, and pretty kickass one person dinners.  The help here is definitely not as attentive as they are in other places but that doesn't take aware from my love of this place.\n\nOne more thing that I love about this place is that even though it is a small little thing I have seriously somehow managed to spend over an hour in it, on several occasions.  This place will always be one of my faves!  They are always adding new things so it makes shopping here almost like an adventure. Did I mention that they also have samples.  Not Costco status by any means but a little something to snack on it always popping in the back.  \n\nTrades Joe's, keep doing what your doing!", "type": "review", "business_id": "SDNsfcWackoUtqsmuubvrw"}

I liken this dining experience to a movie that everyone raves about, should be good and you set your expectations very high only to be let down hard. B and B was not only not good, it was overpriced too boot! I don't think there is a foodie out there that does not mind spending any amount typically as long as the entrees are well prepared. Here is the breakdown of my meal so you can compare:\n\nANTIPASTI:\n\nBeet Salad: One of the better dishes. The marinate had a touch to much vinegar. The pistachio with the beats was excellent however!\n\nWarm Lamb's Tongue: Really bad. I love lamb. Almost every part. Haji Baba in Arizona does wonderfull lambs tongue for $6.00. Haji blew away B & B on every note. The tongue was sliced so thin it was almost unrecognizable. The Chanterelles had very little flavor. A poor dish.\n\nGrilled Octopus: While every flavor hit, it would have been nice if the octopus was cooked properly. The Octopus was dry and fibrous.\n\nPRIMI:\n\nBeef Cheek Ravioli with Black Truffles and Crushed Duck Liver: I LOVE fresh pasta. It should be cooked properly. Al Dente it was not. It actually was hard, absolutely undrcooked! The Beef Cheek was lacking creaminess. The crushed duck liver was not crushed duck liver? It was pureed tpgether with an overly salty beef stock. No earthy chocolate notes from the black truffle was present.\n\nBone Marrow Ravioli with Osso Buco Rag\u00f9: The worst dish of the evening. I'm a Bone Marrow aficionado and this was DISGUSTING! What was inside the undercooked Ravioli was BONE MARROW FLAVORED OIL. The Ravioli was like a Gushers fruit snack. Hard and chewy outside with an disgusting burst of oil inside. TERRIBLE. I actually told the waitress how bad it was and I my comment was dismissed instantly. Basically our waitress turned my statement into a MY PROBLEM, not hers or the restaurants! I had every Ravioli on my plate minus two and she did not offer a replacement or to remove from our bill. The Osso Buco was not Ragu. The Osso Buco was minimal in size, with large anounts of chewy, unrendered fat.\n\nSpaghettini with Garlic Chives, Sweet Garlic and One-Pound Lobster: The pasta was toothesome and cooked perfectly on ONE order of this dish. The other again was undercooked. The Lobster was not sweet, although plentifull. Some was translucent and inedible. The sauce was simple, not a lot going on HOWEVER, I did really like the natural subtle flavors and freshness of this sauce.\n\nWe were all very dissapointed! Skipping dessert was a first for me but we did indeed skip. Man, what a fucking let down. Really bummed out! As far as the movie review, it sucked. It sucked worse than Glitter!!", "type": "review", "business_id": "rNahhyqDlouyDMHh57p3ug"}

It actually comes out separately on a plate (with 4 types of seafood) and they won't take it back or let you take it home...but that's really besides the point. The salad bar was very good in my opinion - cold salads, hot pasta and rice, soups, cheese biscuits, and more. I thought all of the meat was delicious as well, especially the bacon wrapped turkey. They also offer lunch for $20 without the seafood, which I would gladly go back and pay full price for.

Crossing the barren desert, everyone rejoices when they see the lights and know they are on the strip. This was our first time in Caesar's Palace- we paid online on Caesar's website where the room was advertised as \"pleasing to the senses.\" The first contact we made was with Elsa, a loud mouth, rude, snappy front desk attendant. I paid for the room with my B of A debit card and expected no issues as I have been to many, many hotels in Vegas and beyond with no issues. Elsa made a point to berate me for not having provided a credit card- I made it clear that there was more in my account than most people have lines of credit for and eventually had to get a manager as she was making such an issue of it. Meet Tyler Moeller. Tyler is the night hotel manager, he comes across as well spoken and appears to be attentive- he simply does not do anything for you other than nod in mock understanding and say mmmhmmm.  I realized that the pool of people that the recruiting department had to pull from \"was what it was,\" - I made my way to my room. Now keep in mind, it is a Monday( I am writing this as I am sitting in my room now) and we paid top dollar due to Easter being so close. The room was utterly plain and devoid of anything- Hard Rock, Palms, Venetian, Wynn...even Treasure Island, hell, the Tropicana have better rooms. The TV is a barely working 32 inch from 1995( I just had to check) you know, the large 100 plus pound, can't get your arms around TVs of yesteryear. Shocking.  Cheap. Crude. I called and Annisha, the customer service rep answered the phone with a breathy, nasal voice. After a few seconds speaking with her and her limited sentence construction, I realized I was getting nowhere- her last interest was in making sure that I had a good first time.\nI decided to order room service- the \"hard charge\" they put on my card did not work for room service and I was told that I would have to provide my card # again or pay cash??!!!?

When I asked how much for 6 she looked up in the air and was like I think $19.00. I was like ok how much for four and she was like ummmm $12 I think. If you paid for just one they were $2.99 each. That is an expensive cupcake! Anyway I figure they will be amazing and hey food network winners so let's splurge and get the 6 for $19. She rings me up and says well since they are 50% off your total is $9.00. What?! Why not say that from the beginning. Like maybe say well we normally sell the for 6 for $19 but all our cupcakes are 50% off right now... Like I said weird.

And we were shocked, these were FAB seats!  The two big screens on the sides kept us entertained until the show actually started.  It's a smaller size theater, but it just makes it that much more intimate.  \n\nWhen the sound system came on, \"oh my gawd!\"  What a great sound system!  The BF and I were so impressed!  They played good music before the show started that pumped up the crowd too.  \n\nSeats are slightly curved in a large oval to the stage, and there's plenty of leg room, so people can easily pass by.  They have a pretty decent size standing room area right in front where body surfing and the like were immediately stopped.  However, there was some serious moshing going on and it wasn't stopped at all.   \n\nFor the fabulous sound system and the great seating, I can't wait to see another concert here!\n\nSidenote: They could offer a greater variety from the snack bar.

Problem was, it was a little after 10pm and nothing down the street was open - but El Taco Tote was...The first experience for both of us.\n\nWe ordered the quatro tacos and the Panchos. There was a salsa bar in the middle of the room, which wasn't a bad discovery. The pico was a little peppery and had good flavor. The panchos were okay - perhaps because it was late at night they were out of nacho cheese. Nachos without nacho cheese are not the same, but they threw some regular cheese on to replace the deficiency. The quatro tacos were small street tacos, and they were fine. \n\nThe place was descent - especially after our time at the bar and not having dinner, but I don't think I would choose it over Filberto's if they were side-by-side.", "type": "review", "business_id": "_NnOolczVHfhEHgCOhpxAw"}

Now however Costco has a new tool to make them even better.\n\nThe biggest problem with Costco has always been the crowds and lines a check out. Well they have no figured out a way to alleviate that by letting you use your membership card to check out a portable scanner that slides into a nice litte mount on your cart. You scan your items as you add them into your cart and then when you are ready to leave you head to the self checkout it totals your cart and you pay, then you are all done.

Since I already checked out the menus online, I was ready with the first of many questions regarding my numerous food allergies to ask my server as soon as he walked up to my table- Yes, I'll have iced water, please.  Oh, and could you find out if your bbq sauce contains ...?  (Some don't, you know.)  Next thing I knew, Liz the manager was at my side.  After mentally jotting down which of the \"major\" allergens I was most worried about, she disappeared into the kitchen to do some research: are the sauces safe?  is the cod fresh or frozen, and is the batter *-free?  the fish is def. not frozen, but she'll check re * ingredients... are the breads made in-house?  (home-made reduces the chance of * usage.)    and the verdicts?  lay off all the sauces, just to be sure; not sure on the batter, so stay away.  breads are made locally, and she didn't have any ingredients info.  and with all of that data, i pretty much had most of the menu items crossed off (sandwiches/burgers that contained buns and sauces, entrees that used sauces (award-winning ribs, entrees adorned with sauces,  marinated meats, etc.), fried fish, anything battered.  this left the wraps (well, those that did not use *, sauces, etc.) and the sweet potato fries.\n\nAh, the SPF!  What was I thinking, laying off of the raspberry mayo for the first half?  This sauce brought the greatness of the fries to a new crescendo.  I REALLY love crispy/crunchy textures (probably due to my compulsion to be healthy and stay away from deep-fried anything most of the time.  Plus, grease-flavored foods really don't rock my boat.  Oh, but these SPF's with the razz mayo were really good.  \n\nThe meat wrap, $7.95.  With beef tenderloin, $8.95.  Comes with choice of side.  Other sides not listed may require an upcharge- most likely with my SPF.  My beef wrap looked quite appetizing- thin slices of beef tenderloin with SW rice and shredded cheese wrapped in a chipotle tortilla, with shredded salad mix and salsa with sour cream drizzle on the side.  Took a bite.  Mmm... very tasty, but wha?  Is that * in the SW rice?!?!  For the rest of the meal, I was picking * off.  What I really should've done was return the wrap and get one sans rice, since the * juice would be all over the rice.  But the first one took so long to reach my table- I had eaten all but five sticks of the fries- that the option didn't even enter my thoughts.  The fries cost an extra $3 bec. I was served the app portion.  Whatever.  I'm also thinking that the chipotle wrap had * in it.  (I was in pain for the rest of the day, and still am, twelve hours later.)  Yes, I was disappointed, but I can't say all of those minutes chatting with the manager were for naught.  I just wished she and especially the staff were more knowledgeable of all of their dishes and sides.\n\nI'll return for the sweet potato fries and razz mayo.  And maybe a delectable icy beverage.  Anyone know how the margaritas, pina coladas (haven't had one of those in years!), and daquiris are here??  \n\nInside atmosphere (standard booths and rectangular bar tables and chairs with TVs everywhere you look up- like a cafeteria) is a striking contrast to the lazy Sunday, who-knows-who's-coming-to-dinner vibe (bossa nova music was playing in the background) I felt outside as I walked past to get indoors.  One problem- I just can't stand inhaling cigarette smoke while I'm eating.  I can't stand inhaling tobacco smoke anywhere, anytime, actually.  I hope I didn't offend anyone just now... For some people it may be flatus or body odor that offends them; for me, it's smoke.  Unless it's a clove.  Love that spicy scent.  (Body odor offends me, too.  But I digress...)\n\nAnyhoo, for all you sweet potato fry lovers out there, try them here.  You'll thank me later.", "type": "review", "business_id": "55seKyxRWUmHC1s52xk45g"}

I didn't want to get any further into my review without declaring my warning up close and personal. From start to finish my recent experience with Paesano was atrocious. First, I called to ask if they had a website since I would be ordering a lot of food for a work event and the guy gave me a website that doesn't exist. When I told him it didn't work he raised his voice in a \"are you stupid tone\"? He repeated the spelling of the website which still didn't exist so I finally asked for him to fax a copy of the menu.\n\nWhen I placed the order the next day I asked if they include paper plates and utensils to which he replied in the same \"are you stupid tone\" \"uhhh why would we do that? People either eat in our restaurant or they take the food home where they have plates and forks there.\"  OK...\n\nWhen I arrived to pick up the food at 4:00 like I said I would, no one was at the front counter.  An entire five minutes goes by and still no one.  So, I called the restaurant from INSIDE the restaurant until someone came out to acknowledge me. Turned out to be the same gruff guy from the phone who appeared to be the owner and manager.  Nothing was ready...not even the side salads. He disappeared and spent another 10 minutes preparing the food which came out to extremely small portions for the price.  I mean, each little ravioli cost around $2 a piece!  When he went to ring me up the final kicker ensued.  First, he charged me for 9 entrees when I ordered 7.  When I asked him to go over the itemized receipt he said \"what, you don't trust me?\"  Ummm...hello...NO turns out I shouldn't trust you at all since you overcharged me for 2 invisible meals!  Then, without apologizing for his mistake, he rang me up again and this time charged me $1000.06 for my 7 meals. You read that  correctly - one THOUSAND dollars.  When I looked at the credit card bill before signing I pointed out his error and he replied \"No, it says 100 dollars.\"  To which I was blown away.  I practically had to shove the bill in his face for him to accept his mistake.  Finally, 20 minutes after I was supposed to have left I finally had my overly priced food and paid the correct amount.  The owner/manager could not have been ruder and I hope this review prevents you from facing his wrath in the future.", "type": "review", "business_id": "38G8LPiqECn_P6LQfUnfZA"}

Patrick was our pilot and he gave us a amazing tour.  There were 12 of us in a 16-passenger balloon; a bit crowded trying to maneuver to get the perfect photo but anywhere you stood you had amazing views.  We got an incredible shot of a nearby balloon passing in front of the sunset.  Patrick called it a \"balloon-ar eclipse!\"  Very cool.  After our safe and smooth landing, the crew set up a spread complete with champagne, treats and a special cake for my birthday.  Very thoughtful and a great way to end the ride.

This will be one thing I miss about TMobile BUT, with no regrets, I AM NOW A VERIZON WIRELESS CUSTOMER AGAIN! WOO HOO! 7 years later, that is... \n\nAlright, so the MAJOR issue I had with TMobile is either their phones or network suck! I don't care at this point to find out which one it was as I am happily back with Verizon. I got mislead a million times by customer service because they wanted me to stay with a windows based operating phone for some reason. Either way, something was not right and they couldn't resolve my issue over a 2 year span worth of my patience! That's ridiculous in itself! \n\nSo If you have a few minutes, I'll tell you all a little story. Go ahead, grab a snack and an ice cold refreshment and take a seat. I'll wait for you to get back... \n\n2 years ago I had a phone that was giving me problems. I had had that phone for about a year. After a couple of replacement phones, they recommended I upgrade; especially for what I mainly needed my phone for (I do Real Estate, need web access, etc.) and I needed to catch up with the times anyhow so I was cool with that. I ended up getting the most expensive phone they had at the time (HTC Touch Pro 2). Cool phone when it worked but I ended up going thru 5 master resets and 8 (YES, I SAID EIGHT!) replacement phones in one year! And the crappy part is, they had just come out with the HTC HD2 a month after I bought that phone and it was a million times better AND about $100 cheaper!!! Were they gonna tell me this?! NO! Would they let me swap phones because I was an awesome, very patient and one of their coolest customers? HELL NO!! I was stuck with a crappy phone and all the problems it had for over a year before I had to threaten to leave! FINALLY, they upgraded me to the HD2. And guess what??? Yep, again, you guessed it... After a month of trying it out, it started up again. The problems were continuing and they wanted to do the replacement thing. All the customer service people were astonished by the encyclopedia size notes that were noted on my account for the past 2+ years yet they can never manage to satisfy my cellular needs :( The Loyalty Dept (aka: Retention Dept) was the worst! Supposedly they have magical powers and can make things all better so that everyone's happy again! Nope, they would insult me with crappy offers that would make the average person wanna strangle their necks thru the phone! Not to mention that for the last few months I was with them, it would take (and this is no exaggeration) a minimal of 45 minutes on hold before I could get to someone! DID THEY KNOW I WAS CALLING AGAIN?!?!?! 45 effin minutes!!! MINIMUM!!! \n\nThe best solution they had was for me to upgrade AGAIN to a Android operating system (thanks for the late recommendation, 2 years later!) phone with a 2 year contract when I was on a month to month plan. With all the issues I was having and problems I went thru and inconveniences, etc, I voted against that thought. If I was to sign another contract, it was not going to be thru them! I was not going to be \"TRAPPED\" for 2 years after what I wen thru. 7 years of my loyalty down the drain because this is how like to show loyal customers they are appreciative. \n\nI love my Droid X! It does everything I ever wanted and more! Thanks Verizon! \n\nThe End \n\n***Da Bafroom: They ain't nun heya", "type": "review", "business_id": "oFu9fPx4kRcJyVw2_ttJVg"}

This was basic as it gets.  Dare I say it was canned corned beef hash...it wasn't great.  The whole wheat toast was good with my order but everything else tasted pretty average that something like Denny's would serve.  For me, this was 2 stars at best...with the toast being the only good part.\n\nMy wife saw on the menu the apple pancakes with the 'you must try' -- heck if it says that then it better be good.  This was not disappointing.  This item actually should be featured higher up on their menu.  I wish I could consult with restaurants on how to design a menu.  Had she not decided she wanted pancakes she would have not looked in that area of the menu and not ordered these.  They were great.  The 'syrup' (which is like a cider applesauce-ish thing) could have been toned down a bit, but the cakes were good portion and with no butter or regular syrup there was not a problem with fluffyness, texture or taste.  These were great and if I go back I'll get these.  This dish was 4 stars.\n\nOverall, a quaint place for breakfast (lunch menu looked average).  \nFood: 3 stars\nService: 4+ stars\n\nI would say not great for small kids because it is pretty tight quarters.", "type": "review", "business_id": "R1ySBCVS2eQf-s0Z4ifIug"}

For the most part though I and all of my employees typically stick with Dollar, moreso because it is what we are used to and the price is fair.  Sometimes there are crazy long lines, other times we walk right up.  Recently I finally signed up for Dollar Express and while the concept is nice, I've found it doesn't actually save any time as frequently there isn't anyone in the parking lot to help you.  This happened to me in Chicago recently.\n\nToday may be my last time I will ever patronize (or permit my employees to patronize) Dollar again.  I returned a car after refueling as always and didn't have my gas receipt \"to prove I filled it within 10 miles\".  Now while yes I'm aware of this \"policy\", I've not come across any receipt Nazis before today.\n\nThere have been times I didn't get a receipt, but the check-in people used their BRAINS and looked at the fuel gauge and saw it was full.  The guys at Dollar at the Phoenix airport however, weren't smart enough to see that the car was OVER the full line.  When looking at the mileage I drove, I OBVIOUSLY had to have refueled.  \n\nToday the receipt printer at the gas station wasn't working and I didn't have time to wait around for them to fetch someone to try and produce a receipt because I have a plane to catch.  No big deal right?  The car is CLEARLY full, right?  I've rented from Dollar for 10 years and it's never been an issue in the past, right?\n\nWRONG!\n\nThe large man checking my car in was quite rude about it and when I spoke to the supervisor Enriquez he clearly didn't give a flip either.  (The desk clerk who fetched Enriquez was polite and professional, but unfortunately he had no authority to make things right.)\n\nTo Dollar Corporate, I hope you enjoy the $10 you effectively stole from me.  I have no plans on giving you any more of my company's business based upon the staff at the Phoenix airport and this RIDICULOUS \"policy\" you have.  Use your brains.  If the car is full, then it's full.  End of story.  Why is this so hard?  The answer is simple, it's just another tool to screw customers like happened to the people who wrote other reviews here.  You may make an extra $10 today, but you're going to lose thousands from this one incident with my employees and hopefully more as other customers are warned here of your business practices.

People still go to Blockbuster?\" Yes, I may be the last person on Earth with a Blockbuster card...but not for long. \n\nAfter a surgery, I was pretty much out of commission for a few days, so I had the boyfriend go to Blockbuster and pick up three DVD's. We don't yet have a Netflix account, and the boyfriend is apprehensive about using the Red Box contraptions because of an article he read about alleged debit card fraud. We do have an Apple box on which we can download movies, but we had workers in our condo, and were forced to stay in another unit temporarily. With only a smaller TV and a DVD player. This left us no choice but Blockbuster.\n\nA couple weeks later, while walking home from dinner, we decided to make it a \"Blockbuster night\", and walked over to rent a DVD (and then, of course make our last stop at Total Wine before heading home). We finally agreed on a movie, and when we went to check out, we were rudely told that we owed a late fee of 48 cents because one of the three movies we rented was a day late. This is the part where you hear the screeching record followed by silence. \n\nThis is by no means about the 48 cents, but entirely about principle. First of all, Blockbuster, I seem to remember being bombarded with commercials cheerfully announcing the abolishment of late fees. You people were screaming it from the rooftops. I don't seem to recall any such publicity about the return of said late fee. Nor do I even remember even being told about it in the store. Discreetly. \n\nAnd also, and even more aggravating, I returned all three DVDs at the same time. On time. In the middle of the day. So how just one could be checked in late is beyond me. \n\nWhen I tell the stocky checkout boy of this, he looks at me in disbelief, as if I would lie about it to save myself less than half a dollar. He rolls his eyes, and spends a good couple minutes pounding away on his keyboard (a la the airline agent in \"Meet the Parents\"), and finally gives me my new total, sans late fee, as if he's just done me the world's biggest favor. \n\nThen he makes sure to give me the receipt and personally go over the new Blockbuster pricing policies with me, as if I was a disobedient child who didn't listen the first time. I guess he just wanted to make sure there would be no confusion for the next time I came in.

I mean, what's the point?  He voices my opinion anyway.  But in this case I just had to post.\n\nWe love Mexican food.  We have enjoyed it extensively everywhere we've lived except Boston, where we longed for it and settled for average, albeit overpriced, local chain fare.  But of all the places I've lived, no selection of Mexican cuisine is as rich and diverse as what we find in the valley.  And now we know, without doubt, whose is worst.\n\nWe wanted a bite before a movie so, when we arrived at Rio Rico, we told them we were in a hurry and had 40 minutes.  They said they could accommodate that.  But the service was some of the worst I've ever seen.  It was impossible to get anything in a timely fashion and we usually had to ask several times.  A couple of times a harried-looking staffer asked if someone else had done something -- taken our order, given us the check -- and then growled when we told her no.\n\nThe food was absolutely terrible.  No one liked what they ordered.  I had carne asada, one of my favorite dishes.  When it finally arrived I was surprised.  When I had those birkenstocks resoled in Boston a couple of years ago I never thought I'd see the soles again but there they were, charred on my plate.  The steak was the driest, most burned piece of meat ever set before me in a restaurant.  The beans were tasteless and the rice was so-so.  My youngest didn't like her enchiladas (which were supposed to be chicken but were cheese) and my oldest couldn't stomach her huevos New Mexico.  Jim said his shrimp was okay but the sauce was spicy though utterly without flavor.  So much for the food.\n\nThe water was skunked.  It was absolutely undrinkable, which you knew before you tasted it because the smell alone kept your lips from the cup.  We ordered sodas, which we didn't intend to get.  They were semi-skunked but you needed something to cut the spicy yet flavorless stuff, whether it was the sauce or the bottled salsa.\n\nSo when you read Jim W's review and he says don't go, listen.  In fact, if you want excellent Mexican food in the southeast valley, I wholeheartedly recommend El Ranchero on Chandler Blvd. about a block east of the 10.  For $7 or less you will receive a heaping plate of incredible, authentic Mexican food.  We went there for lunch today in an effort to erase the trauma of last night's dinner at Rio Rico's.  Thankfully, it worked.", "type": "review", "business_id": "IUFi5rcfmu_Bn6PkdozbBg"}

I actually managed to find 2 separate delivery menus, but ended up ordering from Asia Lee because they were cheaper and had a lower minimum delivery requirement. I also appreciated the \"New York Style\" note on the menu. An Arizona restaurant serving food from another country in the style of another state. It reminded me of a dream I had where I was the lead singer of a Green Day cover band that only did Journey songs, but in the style of Green Day. BTW, I'm totally starting that band.\n\nI got hot and sour soup, kung pao chicken, and an eggroll. They're all sitting in front of me right now. Well, except the egg roll. That barely made it out of the bag.  The hot and sour soup is okay, but has too many undercooked carrots and not enough tofu.  The broth is a little weird too. If you like hot and sour soup, you might need to manage your expectations here.  Kung pao chicken is my go-to chinese entree because I need heat in my food or I feel like I'm not really eating. The heat is definitely lacking here, and I forgot to ask for Siracha. The lo mein is okay but also a little bland.\n\nI'm still eating it, but not as quickly as I should be, because it's not that good. Plus, it's hard to eat while simultaneously being sickened by the atrocious hair on Real Housewifes of New Jersey. But that's not Asia Lee's fault.

We'll, that's exactly what I got.\n\nThe selection was pretty good but there were only about 10 things I ventured to try. The fried rice was skank; bland, tasteless and mealy. The \"lo mein\" was actually the best thing on the buffet.  The chicken dishes were ok.  The pork spareribs were disgusting; mushy candy-red chunks of bone with hardly any meat, swimming in a gelatinous sea of sauce that tasted of only 1 thing I can compare the flavor to -- pink urinal cakes.  There was some nasty looking fried fish remains left dying on the buffet (the skin had been crackling under the lights for hours) and some assorted old food.  No egg rolls. Nasty dried out rangoon. The tables were sticky (which grosses me out completely) and the bathrooms were actually better than I expected given the rest of the place.\n\nI think if we'd come earlier the offerings may have been more appealing.  We hit the place around 8:30 on a Saturday nite and they closed at 10, so they weren't refilling the tables much. Such is life in buffettown.\n\nOn a positive note, the fountain Coke was the best I've tasted in years -- perfect balance of sweet Cokey syrup and enough carbonation to not seem flat.\n\nI doubt I'd go in again, although the register receipt did crack us up.

At least they have never given me a hard time when I come back but I live in Glenwilde and the last thing I want to do is go all the way back to get missing item(s) while my food gets cold and family finishes without me.", "type": "review", "business_id": "GvUgjHP0aooaD1dltpK_5w"}

Dinner on weekdays are $15.88 and weekends are a dollar more. Drinks are not included in the price. If you want to just eat all u can eat sushi and some asian food then I suggest u only come for lunch where it's only ten bucks which is a really good deal.\n\nI always come for dinner though because I like to eat seafood. The crab legs are not that great though. They taste old and flavorless so do not come expecting it to be awesome. On the weekends they taste a little better but there usually is a huge line for them and everyone takes it all within the first minute of it coming out. It's seriously a pain to deal with.\n\nThey also have raw oysters which are decent if they haven't been sitting out for too long. It's a hit or miss because some of them taste fishy while others taste fresh.\n\nAs for the crawfish, it's frozen and then cooked but it's not too bad considering we do live in AZ.\n\nThe sushi is the best asian buffet sushi you will eat in AZ hands down and I've been to almost all the Asian buffets in AZ.\n\nI also like the short ribs here that they have located near the grill and they also have fresh strawberries and an assortment of typical Asian dishes that are tasty.\n\nI generally skip this though because I come for the seafood and sushi. Some other seafood dishes are escargot, stone crabs, shrimp cocktail that u have to peel, cold mussels on ice, steamed clams, dry salmon, steamed fish, sometimes fried frog legs, sashimi, popcorn shrimp, clam chowder, and some weird baby scallop thing that doesn't really have any flavor. Everyone should try this buffet at least once to see if you like it! I really like this buffet, it's very clean and a bit more upscale than other seafood Asian buffets.", "type": "review", "business_id": "KpCKaIDZ1m4bQj2ur3olfg"}

I'd overhear coworkers chatting about a \"farm\" and I wondered if I possibly worked with a bunch of former farmers? Then I stumbled past the Farm one day and experienced Morning Glory Cafe for the first time. That first time turned into many many more visits and I still try to make my way to the south side from time to time. \n\nBurgers. Yes, I do like burgers. It's an all American cuisine so therefore I don't think I should be judged. Well, the Morning Glory Cafe burger is tastilicious. It's so good I had to combine two words. The breakfast is scrumptious and they have a tasty brunch as well. Full of fresh ingredients, each item on the menu has its own unique taste. And the baked goods. Oh my baked goodness. Try the scones. \n\nThe atmosphere is adorable and filled with character. Hidden in the middle of a \"farm\" you could pass by this little gem in the desert and never realize it was just past the main road. Whenever I enter, I feel like I've left Arizona and I've been transported to a little farm in California. I love the quaint feel the Morning Glory Cafe gives me. It isn't a big and open restaurant full of hustle and bustle. Instead, it's a small and intimate setting and I feel like I am having lunch at a friend's home on a Saturday afternoon. It was the perfect escape from the work day. Oh and I could get in and out and still make it back within the hour. \n\nSo if you're ever in the vicinity of South Mountain and looking for a little escape from desert reality, give Morning Glory Cafe a try.", "type": "review", "business_id": "9yKzy9PApeiPPOUJEtnvkg"}

At least three times during the morning, you will get to hear Carlos Diaz's Extra Entertainment Report, where he will indeed give you the most updated celeb gossip...with commentary of course from the peanut gallery (i.e. Chet, Spence, and Lauren). I find the background comments most amusing, because you have to listen hard to pick up on the humor, but once you do, you are cracking up in the shower or in the car on the way to work. There is also Gary Spivey, the psychic, who appears on the show once a week, and takes calls from the viewers. Then there's Group Therapy, where they will answer a relationship question of the week. The crew also has random contests and questions they'll throw out at the listeners, asking them to call in. The morning phone scams are hilarious as well.\n\nI'm not going to lie, I'm so obsessed with this show, I friended the radio station and Chet Buchanan on myspace!

They never look at as us like we are stupid when we ask questions since they understand how new parents can be.\n\n-Even with sick kids with grubby little hands, this place is always clean even without the stench of bleach. It is always organized too.\n\n-We have never had to wait too long after our scheduled appointment. Maybe only 20 minutes at most and we always come later, so I kind of expect them to run behind. \n-Their front desk ladies have zero personality. Never smile, never greet you, never have any pep in their voice. How can you not be happy looking at adorable babies all day? Wanna be a crabass, go work somewhere else. Don't ruin my new mommy glow.\n\n-My son had a cold with cough and congestion at 2 months and they still gave him his 3 shots since he didn't have a fever. They said it should last about 10 days max. 2 weeks later I went back since it just got worse. They did an RSV test which was negative and sent us home. A week later we went back again and they finally gave us a prescription. They put my son on penicillin, but I was concerned since I am VERY allergic to it. They said that we won't know if he is allergic until we give it to him and that the allergy isn't genetic. That just didn't sit well with me. Here it is 10 days later and he still is somewhat congested, but is getting better. No reactions, so i guess I worried for nothing, but with good cause. They also were able to get us in the same day when we called.\n\nI will continue to see them since I do love their doctors. I just wish that they would get someone nice up front.", "type": "review", "business_id": "3ZKcmh0XczhqVSkbn9ucuw"}

It was time for the annual invasion known as going to see the GYN peeps.  I've been a patient at WSC for at least seven years and usually see Dr. Volker, but he didn't have any appointments available until July.  I was okay with being seen by a nurse practitioner, so I accepted an appointment with Sheila Tack at this location.  WSC has a few offices around the valley, but it was my first time at the Spring Valley office.  I walked into a packed waiting room,  which is typical for an OB/GYN office; I was prepared to be there for at least an hour and a half.  I signed in for my appointment 20 minutes early and sat in one of the comfy chairs and settled in.  I was given some paperwork to fill out a few minutes later and having completed that, I sat down and was engrossed in reading my friends' Yelp check-ins when I heard my name called.  What?  I even looked around before I got up to make sure there wasn't another Theresa there (yes, that's my name)--I was called in at 10:20am, my actual appointment time.  I got weighed, had blood pressure taken, and then donned the fashionable exam gown with the opening in the front, of course.  And then...I waited for about twenty minutes in the exam room.  At least in there you can lie down on the exam table and chill out.  Sheila came in to do the exam and she had company:  a male medical student.  Oh joy.  Whatever--these students have to learn somehow.  I just tried to ignore him.  Ms. Tack was very professional and personable.  She didn't rush through the exam and answered the questions that I had thoroughly.  Of course, the whole thing probably took less than ten minutes.  I'm happy to say that this session with the lady doctor, er, nurse practitioner was done in an hour from the time I checked in and I don't have to do it again until 2014.

(I was a customer with my ford explorer years prior BTW at the Meadows location.) Since we came after dinner time on a monday evening, there were just a few customers ahead of us, so we were assisted in a timely manner. We needed a new battery for our PT Cruiser. Chrysler has a habit of situating the battery underneath another part (like the air filter, for example), so for the cost of the Die Hard battery @ $79.99 with a 1.5 year warranty (prorate for 6 years) plus the installation fee of $12.99 (reasonable cost) and tax, the total was $100.67 (no core charge). (The alternative is a Pro Start battery with a year warranty @ $49.99 but it didn't sound like the CSR believed in it, was a little hesitant in his offering.) It's just a little weird that there is a display of tires directly behind the line for the cashier (there should be a defined line- tape on the floor or something), which created an awkward line around the tire display. I guess you'd have to be there in order to understand what I am saying. \n\nWe pulled into the garage for Express Service. There is a small waiting room with chairs, some vending machines, a trash can, and a tv. Since there was a customer ahead of us and it would be a few minutes, we walked to the mall and browsed a few stores and got a new watch battery too (love when we get things done). We asked him to call us when it was done. There was another customer in front of us before checkout so it was a few minutes. But another rep helped us and we paid for it; went off on our merry way. \n\nDuring the daytime, the place is swamped. Usually there is a line of about ten people. So, if you want to avoid the crowd, get there in the evening.", "type": "review", "business_id": "pztPhlvnt_18gAg8j6TmvA"}

So when I took my car there and before the diagnostic was done-- my car failed the smog, and I was really upset.  I had no idea that having a check engine light on was an automatic fail.  And my light was on when I smogged the car.  I was upset that the technician did not warn me so I did not waste my money and could return once the light was turned off.  So I called the manager and asked why the guy could not warn me so that I could have saved my money, and he explained that it is against the law for them to coach me.  That the DMV checks by sending people who try to break the law to ensure that the garage is compliant.  That I could call the DMV to verify this.  (And I did; it is true.) However, I explained that I did not understand this and was upset that the money for the smog was wasted when all my car needed was a $15 dollar part.  So the manager agreed that he would let me resmog my car at no extra charge once the car was repaired.  I went in resmogged my car and passed, and it was all done in under 15 minutes.  I gave this location 5 stars, because they went out of their way to make a new customer.  I appreciate that the manager allowed me to resmog my car for free due to my previous lack of knowlege of how smogs work.  I believe that 5 star businesses give you the excellent service you expect.  I believe that some businesses deserve a 6 star rating when they go above and beyond excellent service to earn your business.  So the main point of this review is this: 1) never smog your car with the check engine light on and 2) this is an excellent business with an superb manager.  I gave them 5 stars, but if Yelp allowed a 6th star for extra credit I would.  Great Job! Many thanks, Colleen", "type": "review", "business_id": "RB03-j9Ls_PI8FpQtUPg5w"}

His opening comedian was also excellent and this show was current and I'm assuming changes often enough that you can see it repeatedly and never get bored.  Carrot Top is the best comedian I have ever seen.  If you loved this show too you may want to consider Gordy Brown and Absinthe which were also funny and entertaining. I got 3rd row center seats with a little bit of a discount by booking one month out.  The theater is small enough that no seat is bad but being up close is always the way to go.

(not like that shitty chocolate covered bacon at the county fair!) it comes with directions on how to eat the chocolate (rub with thumb and index finger, inhale, bite off a piece, let it melt, etc etc) omg i definitely followed these instructions to rub my thumb to release the aromas! WOW. and its milk chocolate but the richness of it really makes it taste like dark chocolate. a-ma-zing! we also got the caramel toffee. wow. it was soft but had a slight crunch and not overly sweet. it had a nice nutty crust of pecans and walnuts. mmmm. so good! \n\nyes they sell vosges chocolate bars at speciality stores like whole foods but you gotta go to the vosges store for the experience and try the truffles. its now a must-go-to-stop for me in vegas to see what else i can try and love :)", "type": "review", "business_id": "3eD46byrm9HE01MCTdrA2A"}

We made reservations ahead of time, but we were running extremely late, so we gave them a call to let them know we would be there soon. When we got to Mandalay, we couldn't find it for the life of us, and finally, we were directed to TheHotel. The elevator was extremely scary because I felt like I was going to fall straight down. The view was very nice, but we did not get a window seat since we had a big group.\n\nI shared the tuna tartare appetizer with a friend. It came with taro chips and guacamole. Very tasty! For the entree I had the Atlantic Cod. The croutons in it were so good, then again, what isn't when it's drenched in butter right? The cod was cooked perfectly, moist and flakey. The sauce was buttery and had capers in it. If you don't like capers, I still suggest you get this dish because you can't taste them, probably because the butter masks the flavor, but still very tasty. And for the record, I like capers (Thanks Tiff L.).\n\nFor dessert, we were all too stuffed, but the birthday girl ordered tiramisu and our waiter got down on one knee and serenaded her. So sweet! The service was extremely good and they don't make you feel awkward like most nice places do. In the end, they gave us complimentary freshly baked madelines with nutella sauce. They were still warm and in the tin! LOL, yum.\n\nThe next time I come back I definitely want to try the foie gras, gnocchi, and the beef tenderloin.\n\nBest of all, the prices are not bad.\n\nI will be back Mix!", "type": "review", "business_id": "Pz7SWZQhxL6ZbhL9jE2NTA"}

It's open til 4am Sun-Thurs & til 6am on Fri & Sat. They have quite the selection of rolls. However the rolls are a bit smaller than other sushi places I've been to. The food is good though & comes out rather quickly regardless of what the wait staff tells you. The wait staff is a bit slow at times even when it's not peak hours. Try a saketini if you get a chance they taste a bit like sangria. If you're like me & order a Sapporo you expect it to come w/ a beer glass chilled not a Modelo Especial glass. Deduction of points on that fro me. The atmosphere is well lit. You can sit at a booth area or at a table. The tables are picnic style so you could be rubbing elbows w/ neighbors during busier hours. \nIf you're a local this place a bit pricier than other sushi restuarants for less of the food. Again great food, just need to eat more to be full. Normally 2 rolls & an app w/ a beer will fill me up. It took 3 rolls & an app w/ a beer to fill me up here. \nTried 9 rolls last night out of our group:\nShrimp Killer - Good\nSpicy Rainbow Roll - VERY GOOD\nTeriyaki Roll - Not so good\nSilver State Roll - SO GOOD\nDragon Roll - ok\nAvacado Roll - ok\nTiger Roll - Good\nFirecracker - SO GOOD", "type": "review", "business_id": "ofhhRbEYZnmd2eKsD575nQ"}

Averaging 3 trips a year to Sin City,  for the past 5 years, definitely makes me well versed in all things Vegas.  So when my friend decided to have his bachelor party in Vegas, I was stoked.  I'm always looking for an excuse to go... and when I found out we were going to be staying at Planet Hollywood... they didn't need to ask if I was going, just tell me when and I'm there.  \n\nStayed from Wednesday to Sunday.  I know I know... that's an eternity for Vegas. Typically, two days and three nights is more then enough; any longer, and you'll be burnt out.  By Friday I was pretty much fried... mainly from all the drinking sunup to sundown.  Anyways, I'm getting off the topic.  \n\nHere are it's Good Points:\n\n** Planet Hollywood is a decent size casino by Vegas standards. Even though they have only two mini-baccarat  tables, a table minimum of $25 for a weekend was fairly priced.   If mini-bacc is not your game, all your usual table games are there for as low as $5 min.\n\n** After taking over the former Aladdin, they've really given this place a face lift .  I love the crystal chandelier from the lobby escalator.  Catered definitely to the younger crowd, this place exudes a lot of energy.  A good amount of traffic inside the casino.\n\n** Positioned centrally on the \"Strip\".  A definite plus, saves you on cab fare.\n\n** There's a mall... provides plenty of shopping and cheap food court eateries.  Trust me, after 5 days here... I needed it.\n\nNow here's the Bad:\n\n** The standard rooms are over 450 sgft (good size for Vegas).  Linens are nice but I'm not a big fan of purple (yuck!).  That's the theme color at this place.  Each room has an article of clothing from an actual movie that's encased and displayed.  Mine happen to be the dress from the Exorcist... not good, not good all.  Creeped me out.  We also booked a suite.  It had an air hockey table... big plus.  Problem was the low ceilings and again, the purple decor.  What made this a negative for me was the price (average daily rate: little over $200).  During that time-frame, I could've stayed on a nicer property like Palazzo or The Hotel @ Mandalay for the less.  Oh well, ultimately we all wanted to stay in the same Hotel.  All-in-all, the accommodations has more good points then bad, it's more of personal reasons for me... \n\n** Their Pleasure Pit, a designated table game area with scantily clad girls dancing on stripper poles, is a uglier version of the Pussy Cat Doll lounge @ Caesars.  The girls are really not that ugly, just not as attractive compared to PCD lounge or Playboy Club.  If you're going to rip-off an idea... you gotta make it nicer.\n\n** Since they do have a night club (Prive) here, you get the drunks and obnoxious folks after 1:30 roaming the casino floor.\n\n** Don't have any fine dining restaurants, except for the Strip House.\n\n** Outside of the mall, there's no real attraction or landmark.  For example: Bellagio has the Fountains and the Conservatory, Mirage has the Volcano, Wynn has the light show, etc. \n\n** Their comping system is very slow and lacking.  When someone plays a minimum of $100 a hand and average about $300.  One would think you can get things right away especially when times are hard and you're starving for big players.  Granted we're no whales, but when I ask for something simple as having my cigarettes comped.  It took the pit boss over 30 minutes later to approve.  Took the the cocktail waitress another 20 minutes to get it.  BAD, VERY VERY BAD!  Also the pit boss was rarely rating the players.  Played for 3 hours at the table, the dealer had to apologize after she saw our disgust.  I never have this problem at Bellagio or MGM, I get it w/in two minutes.  They definitely need to improve their customer service or they'll never have any committed gamblers.  \n\nAll-in-all, it's a good property.  More then likely I won't ever stay here again, especially after dropping a couple of g's here w/o reaping anything.  Decided to spend the rest of my gambling money at Bellagio.  Planet is on par with properties that cater to young folks like the Palms and Hard Rock.  Modern and contemporary everything.  So if you want something centrally located with plenty of cheap eateries then Planet Hollywood is a safe bet.   Just don't gamble here.", "type": "review", "business_id": "uJYw4p59AKh8c8h5yWMdOw"}

They try to jazz up the interior by putting in deep rich colored carpets and a very Hollywood and/or nightlife-like atmosphere, but for the most part the casino looks the same and all the slots are still old. \n\nThe rooms I would imagine to be quite nice but PH is always a must visit for me every time I come to Vegas simply because I'm a big fan of the Miracle Mile shops. I love that there are so many stores, normal stores at that, which sell normal people underpriced, on sale and great size selection items. I love that they kept the thunderstorms in the shops. Mostly though, I love the random strips of casino through the shopping so when you're tired, you can take a seat, lose some money, and keep going!\n\nThe casino is arranged in an ok fashion, they somehow have a Pink's hot dogs stand outside although I'm not sure how authentic it really is ... The buffet is the same and I still like it, but I don't think it has *as* much variety as before. Their shows are somewhat lackluster as compared to other casinos. I don't know that I would necessarily stay here again, but if there was some killer deal it's definitely not a BAD hotel to be at.", "type": "review", "business_id": "uJYw4p59AKh8c8h5yWMdOw"}

Planet Hollywood is one of Harrah's many properties in Vegas, but it's truly one of the company's nicer, hip and modern offerings more akin to Caesars than to Harrah's, Imperial Palace, or the Flamingo.  No vestiges of its past incarnation as the Aladdin remain (thankfully), as it possesses a sleek, stylish, energetic and loud atmosphere, especially on the weekend.  \n\nThe casino floor has the standard complement of slots and video poker machines as well as the standard variety of table games.  The center of the gaming area is dominated by the Heart Bar, which has a dj, go-go dancers, and bottle service on the weekends.  Of course, I'm not sure why it has a dj, go-go dancers, and bottle service, but it's Vegas...so why the hell not?  Following the seeming trend of casinos offering gaming areas with attractive female dealers at the tables and go-go dancers gyrating in the gaming pit area, Planet Hollywood offers the Pleasure Pit.  PH may not have started this trend of nightclub/casino convergence, but they seem to do it better than most.  The dealers are very personable and attractive, as are the go-go dancers.  Despite their appearance, the dealers are quite adept at dealing blackjack.  Truth be told, I didn't find it too pleasurable losing money at the blackjack table. \n\nAlthough my GF and I didn't stay at PH this trip, the rooms aren't bad, albeit a bit kitschy with the whole Planet Hollywood motif.  To my recollection, the bed are decently comfortable...certainly much better than the torture devices called beds at the Paris.  PH's restaurant selection isn't the biggest on the Strip, but Koi is a very decent place for sushi.  Planet Hollywood may not be my first choice to stay and play, but it's definitely on my short list for consideration, especially if they're offering a special rate or comped room.  Call it a 3.5 star place, rounding up to 4!", "type": "review", "business_id": "uJYw4p59AKh8c8h5yWMdOw"}

We had rooms at Flamingo but our VIP host found rooms a Planet that saved us about $80 and since this was my daughters original choice we switched hotels.  We got in very late so the hotel was full, the front desk clerk said he had two dbl queen rooms, or a suite that we would have to move from in two days or gave us the option of changing in the morning after checkouts.  We figured if we're spending more than 6 hrs in our room we should be beaten with a tack hammer anyway so we just kept our rooms. \nRooms: very easy to find, clean and roomy, not much of a view, large bathroom and pretty quiet. Maid service was great.\nCasino:  layout is a bit confusing, lots of walking in circles but that could be attributed to the drinks, they definitely aren't going to cheat you hear.  I do enjoy their sports book.  Actually being able to sit in the bar/lounge and watch all your games is nice and the bartenders are great.  Sat down for a few hours while the ladies shopped and grabbed a nap. My dealers Ellie and Yolanda were probably the two best I've encountered, lots of fun and helpful.\nOverall it's about average.  For the younger crowd that's there to party I'm guessing they'd go 4 or 5 stars but for the parents I'll stay at 3 or 4.", "type": "review", "business_id": "uJYw4p59AKh8c8h5yWMdOw"}

But you must have lost your damn mind if you think it's ok to say something like that in front of customers. I don't think it was personal because she wasn't even looking in our direction when she said it, but it was still totally inappropriate. I've had better customer service at the Wendy's around the corner from me. Half of the incident was the hostess' fault for walking us away from the hostess stand and trying to seek out a table with us in tow, but I would've appreciated the extra 10 seconds it would've taken her to ask us to wait while she checked with the waitress.\n\nOnce seated our waiter was blah and disinterested. I don't expect you to approach our table with the pep of a Dallas Cowboys cheerleader, but I do expect you to be approachable when you approach our table, regardless of whether you're serving at a Winchell's or a Zagat-rated restaurant. I got the San Fran grilled cheese which was ok, but could've done without the extra slice of bread in the middle of the sandwich. I wanted lunch, not a carbohydrate-induced coma. Everyone who ordered a sandwich had that extra slice of bread in the middle which leads me to believe that is a Winchell's specialty if there is such a thing. The fries were pretty tasty-probably some Ore Idas, but with a good spice mixture on them. They were good about the refills.\n\nThis Winchell's was out of my way, but even if it wasn't, I wouldn't be back.

Don't get me wrong, I've got no doubt that this was one of the better lamb burgers out there.  But I've come to realize, after eating here, that I shall be keeping my lamb on its rack, and having the traditional cow in my burgers.\n\nThe condiments, by the way, are plain old condiments.

I think this is just a result of assuming that since a bottle is on your table, it's all good.  But in the grand scheme of things that's a very minor complaint (maybe not so much for my pregnant friend who was ONLY drinking water, and was left without for a good chunk of time).  It also struck me a little odd that there was no bread or other goodies put on the table.\n\nI had the mushroom risotto, which was brilliant.

Michelle is that rare find of both a gifted and passionate hair artist and a down-to-earth \"real\" person with nothing but positive energy.  \n\nI have left greatly talented stylists in the past because I tired of the negativity, constant complaining about everyone and everything, and the bizarre tendency a lot of hairdressers have to share their escapades of the night before with you or with each other while you are trying to relax and enjoy your time at the salon.  Michelle and her co-owner mother have staffed Dolly Rockers with talented stylists with great attitudes.  As a result, this salon is a unique gem in terms of the culture of the business and the amazing sense of \"team\" they exhibit while you are there.  If they don't truly all like each other and want to see each other succeed, then they are amazing actors.\n\nMichelle can do both amazing cuts that work with YOUR hair (mine is challenging), but she also seems to have almost a sixth sense where hair color is involved.  She is a natural at this, but she also puts a ton of extra time in with her entire staff to attend continued education and training the most cutting edge products and technology.\n\nALL of the gals there are awesome and I love seeing them when I go in!\n\nMy teenage son is a very loyal customer of Melissa, and for good reason.  Michelle recommended her for men's hair when I first set up an appointment for him to get a \"real\" haircut.  He would kill me for saying this, but I'd go as far as saying he gets a hair \"style\" - not just a cut- from Melissa every time.  What guy doesn't want to look like a movie star, if he were really honest?  And, because she has a son his age, she knows how to interact with him and he has become totally comfortable going there without me in tow.\n\nBe sure to try the new product line that is just being launched!  I was lucky enough to get a test run with it and it blew me away.  I've never had, at any price, products that make my hair look that shiny and healthy and remarkably clean for days.  These products were created  as an answer to the frustration Michelle and others had with finding great products made with great ingredients that would give customers healthy and beautiful hair.  There really is a difference and you won't believe how great your hair looks and feels!  I found their new website for the product launch at DollhouseEmpire.com\n\nThe salon looks very cool and funky... definitely not your grandma's hair salon.  The \"rocker\" in Dolly Rockers is not referring to a chair.  LOL.  Rather, think \"rock star\" because that is what you will feel like as a regular customer at this salon!", "type": "review", "business_id": "ZIxydC4eGrKNLJ6ChlajWw"}

Why this place wasn't absolutely slammed for 'weekend breakfast', as they call it, I have no idea.  $4 bloody mary and cape cod carafes, as well as screwdriver and mimosa carafes.

The bloodies were delicious, served with all the requisite greenery (lime, celery stalk, olive).  I love the idea of carafes.  I've spent up to $9 on worse bloodies in INDIVIDUAL glasses.  \n\nMy boyfriend got the special for that weekend, which was a Maple Bacon Pecan Sticky Bun.  I had to capitalize it because OMG.  I took a bite and it was perfect.  Warm and bacony and mapley, and not too sweet.  He gobbled up every bite.  I ordered the fried bologna sandwich, sans tomato.  It comes on texas toast, with housemade aioli, mayo's fancy cousin.  It also came with a side of perfect potatoes.  I asked for them to be made without onions and they obliged, and they were delicious.  A good fried bologna is on the opposite end of the spectrum as the oscar meyer stuff.  And this was the best.

But it is.  It's been not only that but a place of longing that various co-workers have agreed that when we hear some Chet Baker or otherwise lounge-jazz music that we'd \"rather be at Panera.\"  It's reliable, the food is always good, and I always know what to expect.\n\nThat said - for those who aren't in the know of Panera, get out from under your rock and get in the 'know!  Panera is a light lunch/breakfast eatery that offers a bakery with morning bites, with jazz music floating throughout.  It's a hit with all ages, offering free wi-fi, and its very popular with everyone from children to seniors.  They have a you pick two deal which allows you to mix and match a variety of things from the whole soup/salad/sandwich/etc so you can get a pretty sweet combo for just six-ish bucks.  You typically have kids working there who remember your name, your preferences (One girl would give me a free cookie if I always wore one piece of Nintendo gear so I ended up with a lot of free cookies!)\n\nMy only complaint with this particular location is that the upholstery, carpetry, and the door handle and a few things here and there needs an upgrade.  They're worn and their age is showing as opposed to a few years ago when they looked brand spanking new.  A major warning that I have as far as just \"dropping into\" this place is to make SURE that you are not coming on a soccer afternoon!  See that field across of Rainbow?  Chances are that a lot of the players are going to flood Panera as soon as their game lets out and not only is going to grind service to a halt, but you may be finding that a good chunk of the menu is now depleted.  The upside to this is that there are other very good restaurants in this place about twenty feet away: Viet Bistro, Market Grille Cafe, and Chipotle.  \n\nMy particular favorite dishes?

From what I could make out in the blackness, the decor was spartan, understated, and more or less contemporary.  The men's room smelled bad, but it wasn't a disaster.  There was no lock on the door though, god forbid you had to drop an \"emergency deuce\" cause you'd be putting on a show for all the bystanders outside.  Overall, the place is pretty nice and not your typical shithole music dive.\n\nThere is a full bar and a decent selection of beers on tap, but the major downside here is that draft beers are served in clear plastic cups.   So my first drink of the night, a Kiltlifter draft, got warm prematurely.  After that I switched to a shot of Hornitos Sauza to sip while knocking back a salvo of Pacificos for the rest of the night.  I didn't have any mixed drinks so I can't comment on how the pour is.  Beers were $4 IIRC, wells approx $5.   Door cover is usually ~$5-10 weekend nights, $15 for out of town acts, no cover weeknights.  \n\nThe sound was good, and pretty f'ing loud if you ask me.  Bring earplugs if you don't want to sustain temporary hearing damage and a bout of tinnitis the next morning.  \n\nSo far as the crowd goes, it was a good mix, easily more than half female, undoubtedly due in part to the good looks of lead singer Shelby James.   I'd say it was mostly late 20s-30s.  Everybody we talked to was cool, no attitudes, creepiness or aggression from what I could tell, aside from a brief spat of drama with a couple of girls out on patio later in the night. The staff was friendly, good humored, and attractive.\n\nAll in all a nice night out.", "type": "review", "business_id": "xU10GeaLiXcozY8PDMSlKA"}

Fibber's is your classic multi-faceted pub/bar that pours out great craft beers while cranking out awesome tunes. Lets have another, and review Fibber Magees.\n\n~Fud/Drink~\nI can only really vouch for the drinks here...Just for starters. They have a very well-rounded selection of craft beers on draft from around the country that is rotated very often... I would assume more than just a seasonal rotation. Besides the crafts, they offer up all the traditional pub favorites on draft as well, my personal fav being Smithwicks. They also serve up their own special cocktails and offer a full bar, as well as a menu chocked full of traditional Irish pub food. I have had the garlic fries before, and they were OK... I have had better  (sorry Meagan B.!) Next time I am there, I will what my diet can allow me to eat, and report back with my review on the food.\n\n\n~Atmosphere/Service~\nEach time I have gone, I have been there when my favorite Irish Rock band \"Keltic Cowboys\" were playing. Being a loud band, the atmosphere was obviously a bit more upbeat. But, that tells me that this location knows how to get the place rockin' and keeps their customers happy. Different flare is located across the wall, from sprots to different Irish heritage signage. The inside is predominantly wood based, so its got that old-style bar feel, nothing contemporary to this place. It is not overtly loud when the band is not playing, however it can get crowded on busy nights, making it a tad difficult to get to the barkeeps. The bartenders are knowledgeable, and helped me pick a couple brews out when I first started trying to get into darker colored beers...So hats off to them! Service is a bit lacking, however, from the waitstaff. This is due mainly in part to the fact that they had 1 person running tables, during a show, on a SATURDAY NIGHT. That's not helping anyone...not the waitress who is trying her best, or the customers. We barely got touched during our 2+ hours there...I'd say about 3 times....that's no bueno. So note to management, get an extra body out there to help everyone out!\n\n~Extras/Rating~\nOverall, this place keeps serving me well. I really love coming here, and despite the 25+ minute drive from Phoenix, it is totally worth it when a band is playing or if you have some friends whom want to relax and kick back. I must note that they are an official Gameday location for Seahawks fans, and my UYE group will be heading over soon enough to drop in and see how the location fares. I can't wait to return to kick a couple back, sooon...sooon...", "type": "review", "business_id": "57YV3wsiNBp-aK25qjUeww"}

Some choices of \"meat\" include Beef, Turkey, Ostrich, Lamb,  Buffalo, Salmon and Veggie.  Also what is great with Stax is that for wine folks, they offer ONLY 1/2 bottles.  And these two owners know there wine.  Both came from wine distributing backgrounds before becoming restaurateurs.  \n\nWe decided to get the \"stax sandwiches\" (which are all ready pre-fixed as opposed to being a la carte) we choose the Beef, turkey and salmon.  YUMMy!!!  I really loved the turkey and salmon burger because they were so different. These burgers came with 5 different sauces...of course Ketchup, Chipotle mayo, a spicy sauce (my favorite), a pesto and one that slips my mind!  We also choose to get 2 sides...since my friend loves tater tots and I love sweet potato fries, we opted to get these 2...even though the mac and cheese looked good....tater tots and sweet potato fries were exactly what we expected.

Being an avid fan of Cirque Du Soleil, I've seen almost all their productions on the Strip (except for Viva Elvis, which I have no interest in.) Then I came across Matsuri. Tickets were reasonably priced, so I thought I would give it a try.\n\nThis was truly a pleasant surprise. Think Cirque Du Soleil, scale it down, but add HOT japanese gals (and guys, but that's not really my thing). The music was upbeat, and doesn't seem like a Cirque Du Soleil ripoff. Very nice Asian flare to everything. The Oiran girl was super cute! Basically all the girls were cute. And I'm not even biased towards Japanese girls.\n\nThe tempo was fast, and there were no boring moments. The clown acts were interesting and timed just right. The parts that required human muscle performance doesn't seem to lack behind Cirque Du Soleil. And since they don't have over-done makeup like CDS, it's easy to see how excited and energetic the performers were. Also, since there were relatively few performers (I think about 8 guys and 8 girls), they constantly change costume and do back-to-back acts. it's amazing how much physical endurance they all have.\n\nIf you like acrobatic and a great experience, I strongly recommend Matsuri. kid-friendly. The ONLY bad things I can think of are that 1) It's short, only about 70 min. long (I want more!), and 2) It's at ghetto Imperial Palace. The parking lot stinks.

I'm vegan, so I usually like to call ahead and just mention that and make sure something can be done, but someone else made the reservations, and it was last minute. I've never been treated as poorly or snottily from a supposedly high class restaurant as I was at Aureole.\n\nI discretely asked the waiter if something could be done vegan when he came by initially to introduce himself. He replied \"oh, it is very difficult, but we will try.\" I should have left right then. \"Just pick something out and I will talk to the chef.\" \"OK, I'll take a look.\" Every dish headlines with animal protein, but a fennel orzo that came with one dish sounded nice and maybe close to vegan if the fish that came with it was left off. When the waiter returned, I asked for the green salad and asked if the fennel orzo that normally came with fish could be made vegan. The waiter,without checking with the kitchen,said \"no, that would be difficult\" and offered no suggestions and asked no other questions. I said, \"OK, how about the spring rolls?\" \"Yes, that will be easy.\"\n\n5 minutes later - \"the spring rolls cannot be made vegan - they have a lot of wheat\" ... and that was all he said without offering anything else. Now, there should be two obvious things wrong with this, but I just said \"Oh, that's OK, wheat is vegan. If that's all, the spring rolls sound good.\" The waiter didn't look happy but said OK and left.\n\nWhen our meals come, a fairly plain fish served over nothing is put in front of me. I said, \"I did not order this\" and the servers looked confused. The waiter returned a minute later, looked at my dish and asked \"is there a problem?\" I looked at the fish, then the waiter. After our conversations I have a hard time believing this was not intentional, but like to give people the benefit of the doubt, so I simply said, \"I didn't order this.\" It was not a busy night and the waiter, same one I had been speaking to all night, didn't acknowledge any previous conversation or apologize and said, \"well, it is already made, so you might as well have it.\" This exchange of \"I didn't order this / I don't want this\" and \"you might as well have it\" went on for a few exchanges before, looking and sounding irritated, the waiter said \"OK, why doesn't someone else at the table have this, what would you like then sir?\" \"I ordered the spring rolls.\" A couple minutes later I get what appears to be a big pile of spring roll filling without the wrapper, plainly presented in a heap in a bowl - not quite what I expected but at this point I'm hungry so I eat it.\n\nI should say, the salad was quite good and I loved the abundance and selection of fresh herbs, but the service was awful and the chefs unimaginative when challenged. At best the waiters don't know what vegan means, don't care to find out and the chefs can do nothing but replicate the same 10 dishes over and over. At worst some of the staff are extremely rude and intentionally offensive.\n\nI emailed the only email I could find, which is the general email for Charlie Palmer, so I'll see if they care to reply.  Its interesting there isn't an obvious email for the restaurant itself.", "type": "review", "business_id": "3w5gd4EuSc75UKYMJiNUPA"}

Maybe it's that I can only appreciate rude humor and mediocre food when it's not accompanied by an astronomical bill.  Maybe I'm just a sourpuss. But this place sucks.\n\nLater on in the trip, we would have known, with pictures of dirty overweight hairy shirtless bartenders adorning posters encouraging us to come to Dick's Last Resort for abuse.  But only a few minutes after arriving in Vegas, starving, with most restaurants in Excalibur closed and the buffet line with no end in sight, we decided to sit at the bar and grab a snack.\n\nThe bar is right next to Excalibur's 'Party Pit', a phenomenon we only saw that Sunday afternoon, where one underwear clad dancer appeared after another gyrating to mediocre rock.  Yes, this IS the highlight.\n\nThe bar was tended by two rejects from the school of obnoxious sidekick characters in bad 80s drinking movies, and one grumpy girl who seemed out of place in a land of innuendo, chauvinism, and party pit girls.\n\nThe one guy was the shirtless poster guy, leering at women at the bar, pouring beer on himself, and making the lewd paper hats I would later see middle aged women walking around Vegas in later in the week, proclaiming, 'Dick says my vagina smells bad' to all the world.  The other guy apparently gets his wardrobe from the lewd sidekick thrift shop, complete with fake cowboy hat with loop hanging under chin, Hawaiian shirt, and, of course, modified Van Dyke.\n\nThe female bartender wore a sweat shirt, jeans, and a scowl.\n\nWe got a shrimp entree to share for $20. It had 5 shrimp and some fries.  My companion also got a weakass Malibu and coke for $15.\n\nWe left.\n\nI'll tell you what Dick's Last Resort  did leave us with... some lingering entertainment.  I had a mental block over remembering the name of the place, especially when I would agitatedly try to describe the horridness of the place, leading me to develop increasingly bizarre and inappropriate alternates, usually completely unintentionally.\n\nIf you met me in Vegas, the restaurant I am describing may have been called, among others:\n\nLast Chance Dick's\nThe Last Dick Resort\nLast Chance for Dick\nor\nResorting to Dick", "type": "review", "business_id": "QcTj9AgGJA0ifMHCCPNblg"}

I must say it was definitely a different experience than your typical restaurant experience and I loved it.

They also let you make fun of them which is alot of fun. Then at the end of the meal you get these big paper hats that say funny things on them. Our waitress was so funny. When we first got there she threw our plasticware on the table and walked away. Then she came back and asked us if we decided yet and was telling us to hurry the hell up. She was making funny jokes and really had us laughing the entire time. She actually scared this Asian family out of there. I don't think they knew what the place was about and she was asking them if they spoke English and she told them to lighten up. They got up and walked out. I never laughed so hard in my life. When we had a legitimate question she went into waitress mode and answered it for us. This is the only restaurant where I told a waitress to bring me a damn to go box and it was ok. My husband told her to bring us the fucking check. It was a hoot. As far as the food goes I thought it was really good actually. I got the pulled pork plate and I loved it. My husband got the BBQ beef brisket and the ribs and he loved his also. The prices were good for Vegas. We all know anything in a Vegas casino is going to cost way more than it would anywhere else so I have different price standards for Vegas. This is by far the only redeeming quality the Excalibur has to offer and I will only return there to eat here.", "type": "review", "business_id": "QcTj9AgGJA0ifMHCCPNblg"}

To my husband and I, everything seems fresh. We recently went to Osaka and Brian's is much better! Brian's AYCE menu offers a really good variety of aps and rolls. My husband gets mostly Nigiri and it tastes pretty fresh to me. I like the rolls. \n\nI will agree with some other reviewers that the poke stack is lacking ahi. I've been here about 10 times and I just noticed yesterday, that it was mostly tomato. I have had it before and it was great, but yesterday I noticed the difference. \n\nI will say, they always accommodate our requests for the baby and they don't try to charge us for a small bowl of rice or have a problem if we share some of our food.

The shrimp had been prepared in an acidic vinegar and citrus sauce and mixed with flavorful herbs.

It was artistically created and the taste exceeded our expectations.\n\nGelato Dessert\nThe gelato was served cold and offered a creamy taste of three different flavors.

The service was great (we had bartender Ben who was awesome).  We even met local Charlie who let us try one of his special flour tortilla chips that we were curious about;  which were great.  If you're an enchilada fan, I would suggest getting one chicken and one cheese and mixing them.  We found the combination to be great together.  The cheese crisp and fideo are always a favorite too.

Having lived in cities where grocery store options were limited (try finding a good grocery store near Bentonville, Arkansas - if it ain't a Wal-Mart Super Center, it doesn't exist), one of the first things I do when in a new city is check out their markets.\n\nAustin has HEB, Central Market, and Whole Foods.  San Francisco has Golden Foods & Trader Joes (well, a lot of places do... but theirs seem best).  Atlanta has Kroger & Harry's.  Madison has Woodman's, Willy, and Jenifer Street Market.  \n\nThe thing all of these places have in common?  Selection, price, convenience, and general quality.\n\nNow, I realize there are better places to buy produce than Woodman's.  However, they are improving their organic produce section, and what they do offer is quite good.  It's also very reasonable.  \n\nIf it's staple goods you're after, Woodman's is THE place.  They consistently offer common items at prices that are embarrassingly low.  Their ethnic food section is excellent - whether it's Asian or Mexican items you're looking for, they will have it.  Their dairy section is massive and offers a great selection of boutique cheeses, believe it or not.  And then there's the liquor section... Ehhhhrmahhhgawd.  It's not quite a Speck's or a Binny's, but it's impressive.\n\nThe upsides:\n- Plenty of self-checkout lanes that are usually quite speedy\n- Great selection and pricing for staple goods\n- Great liquor section\n- Decent organic produce offerings\n- Expanding selection of organic/natural foods (dry, frozen, etc)\n\nThe downsides:\n- Mediocre non-organic produce\n- Very few options for organic/free range/pastured meats\n- Disappointing deli\n- A bit dingy at times\n- It's always slammed busy\n\nAll-in-all, Woodman's is a win.  While I'd love to see us get a HEB or Central Market, I'll take Woodman's as a consolation prize.", "type": "review", "business_id": "fAVu_-C5-zrhkqPiKBpovw"}

Our room (a Bella suite) had a pretty unique lay-out. There is a step down to a living room styled section along with the upper floor being the bedroom and bathroom. The only con to the room layout was the velvet couches and chairs that over the years have become mangy. God only knowns how many people have stayed in our room so the fragile velvet had patches missing. Another guest had ruined the large marble table completely taking the finish off, however I don't hold the hotel accountable. Room service stunk and you are expected to wait up to an hour for service?! The birthday boy however was given the presidential suite which it's fair to say that he had the very best of everything. He had the top floor with a nice view and the room had a pretty cool layout. From his room we could watch the Treasure Island pirate show and see the sunset.\n\nSince we were with family, my sister-in-law had brought her young children (3 and 6) along. Although we rented a cabana at the secluded private pool other guests were infuriated by their presence. Keep in mind there are 3 other pools and the location and we chose the smaller pool so that the children could be away from the raunchy main pool. The four or five other adults (who mind you did not have a cabana) were furious with us. Seriously? I'll admit the two were excited to be at the pool and at times were laughing and giggling but they never jumped into the pool and never splashed. All the same, a lot but people actually got up and left scowling and complaining the whole way. But once again the hotel is not to blame. \n\nThe lobby and casino was a little flashy, this crowd has got money. Beautiful girls are everywhere (don't get too excited, most of them are underage). By sunset, if you are not wearing the six inch heels and little dress than you are given evil glances by the younger gamblers. Since this is my style I didn't mind, but other members of my group were really uncomfortable by it. Overall I liked the feel to the Palazzo it may be flashy but what else do you want from a Las Vegas strip casino? \n\nJust beware of the Phantom of the Opera & Jersey Boys soundtrack that is played over and over again, I truly pity the staff.", "type": "review", "business_id": "5paMI5Hhciyl09yGpzdoJw"}

You're first encounter was a success and a second is inevitable. However, scheduling is hard between the two of you. As a compromise, the person says \"Hey, I've got a younger sibling. They're just as hot as me (if not more), and about 8 years younger. I know you guys will totally get along... Don't worry, I don't mind sharing. Oh, and your date is totally on me!\" \n\n*********************!!!!!!!!!!Jackpot!!!!!!!!!!********************* \n\nThat's basically how my relationship with The Palazzo started. After my first encounter with The Venetian, I was totally a fan and couldn't wait to get back there. Naturally, I enrolled in their loyalty program (Grazie) and started to receive offers for free rooms. Sadly, our schedules weren't a good fit. However, in walks in the younger, sexy sibling... The Palazzo. The rest is history! \n\nThe Palazzo is the younger, modern, and chic sibling I was thrilled to meet. Her vibe is very sexy and tantalizing while maintaining a demeanor of cool and collected. Think beautiful woman in a sexy outfit commanding a boardroom full of CEO's. The crowd here is definitely older and more eclectic. She attracts a more diverse crowd comprised of international travelers from around the globe. \n\nAgain, I'm in love with the rooms because they are all suites! The smallest room they have here is 720 square feet! Layout is pretty much the same as The Venetian. But the in-room decor and accents are updated. To quote Barney Stinson \"Newer is Better\". The standard suite is either 1 King or 2 Queens, sunken living room, marble bathroom/foyer, separated shower and bath, 40\" flat screen in the living room, 40\" at the base of the bed, and 19\" flat in the bathroom. \n\nThe Palazzo also has some of the best on property amenities! My favorites include Emeril Lagasse's Stadium, Cut by Wolfgang Puck, and Grand Luxe Cafe. \n\nThe casino is great because of the large vaulted ceilings. The smell of cigarette & cigar smoke is dispersed nicely. They even have a non-smoking corridor which is great! \n\nOverall, The Palazzo is my second home away from home. I am more than thrilled to stay here when I'm in town. My only gripe is the bottleneck that can occur in the elevator banks when conventions are in town. The Palazzo is closer to the convention halls and thousands of people coming and going at the same time really congest the elevators.

I'm constantly looking for the best ribs in America. \"I've got to stand for something!\"  I've been to Kansas City and Memphis but I still come back to El Paso. Until I get proven otherwise, it's still my #1.\n\nThe ribs are the \"fall off the bone\" variety. And what I like about El Paso is their ribs \"glisten!\" Great word, huh!  Some rib places bake them or grill them and then slather them with sauce just before they serve it. Now there are some styles of ribs that use rubs which usually don't have sauces, but if you're looking for the glistening kind, then try El Paso.\n\nI don't work there and can't tell you their exact methods but if you're looking for great ribs, El Paso is the place. Now...since I've moved back to Scottsdale, yes their prices have gone up and  I noticed their portions aren't as big, but they're still the best I've had. There are a couple of places in town that are very close. Look for their reviews on my profile. El Paso isn't usually filled so the food usually gets to you fairly quickly and I like their jalopena corn bread as well. Not as good as Boston Market's but good. It's got a slightly sweet outside texture and warm inside, great with butter! mmmmm", "type": "review", "business_id": "8nRXiNdt_8-aePTlVxKqmA"}

If you're expecting something chic and expensive, I'd try Kierland Commons, or Scottsdale Fashion Square. PV doesn't even come close to the par that those two reach, but in a sense, that's part of it's charm. \n\nLocation wise, it's bordered between Scottsdale and Phoenix, giving it two different consumer markets, which has provided the mall with a more diversified variety of stores. It's also at the cross roads of a major  intersection, and transit center, giving it a constant supply of business (In theory, that is.) \n\nMoving to the Valley in the early 2000's, I distinctively remember PV mall's walkable distance and fabulous accessibility to be it's strong points. Stores were flourishing, the movie theater was convenient, and it seemed like an all-around good place to hang out, see a movie, and do some casual shopping without being overwhelmed by a large atmosphere of crowds or getting lost in a huge maze of buildings. It's a good sized mall, and has easy parking, which many malls do not offer. \n\nHowever, as the years passed, PV mall has taken a walk of shame. Originating from the closure of the Harkins Theater, numerous other stores have closed, even the Taco Bell! I found that the selection of restaurants is depressing as a whole, and the food court is although very spacious, is exponentially loud and messy. (And more recently, Televisions screens spew out loud music from Vh1 to entertain the middle school kids who now dominate the food court.) \n\nNevertheless, I've grown up with PV mall. It's locale has served me nearly everyday, and the collection of strip malls surrounding Paradise Village Parkway is one of the more navigable array of stores there is. I have a repertoire of memories from this mall, and it's middle class environment is a happy median between Fashion Square and Metrocenter.\n\nBut PV mall, you seriously need to upgrade your selection of stores, and Costco won't save you from the same fate that's taken Christown.", "type": "review", "business_id": "akCEmlqxFOTpn2oxSPDLkA"}

What did separate Island from the game was their Sunday Special AYCE \"Pupus\", which I am guessing the Hawaiian version of a tapa.  From French Toast Malasadas to Mahi Mahi Sliders with Wasabi Aioli, the Pupus is what made my 20 bucks worth spending.  If I ever make second rounds, it'll only be for the Mini Peanut Butter Malasadas.

Her mini massage was probably not as long as it should have been - in fact she just sat there next to me while my mask was drying!  I could hear her breathing right over me!  Very weird and uncomfortable!  However, my skin did look good after.\n\nI would have given five stars had my facial been better and if my massage was the entire 50 minutes (she stopped 10 minutes to soon).  \n\nThe staff in the locker room were very pleasant and helpful!  The lounge and overall environment was relaxing and beautiful!  I liked that they had everything you would need to get ready: brushes, blow dryer, curling and flat irons, Aveda skin care products.  \n\nI also paid the $15 fee to use the gym and spa amenities (steam, jacuzzi, sauna, locker room) another day during my visit.

Made a point to find out if we were waiting long, even though it wasn't his fault...place was busy. Food is okay... Tempura - standard, poke was pretty good. I think they topped the shishito peppers with bonito flakes, which I didn't like too much. Rolls were ok. I really like spicy tuna rolls, so if a place doesn't get that right, it's all downhill for me. Not likely to go just for kabuki, but if I happen to be at Tempe marketplace, and I want sushi...

I was trying to recreate poke bowls from Hawaii because I missed them so much. They serve their poke on a bed of seaweed salad and radish strings. I left the salad behind but the poke was super delicious, well seasoned and fresh. I got a side of rice and asked for happa rice (half brown, half white). My waitress was nice enough to accommodate my request by serving me half white and half brown, not the mixed together rice that I am used to, but the rice was delicious. Second to the quality of the fish, the quality of the cooked rice really makes or breaks a place for me, and this place ad great rice. I got there during happy hour so after my meal I also tried the salmon sushi, which means salmon nigiri, I thought i was getting a sushi roll, but it ended up being two pieces of sake nigiri. I was a little dissappointed in the way the salmon tasted. Salmon is my most favorite fish but this one wasn't terribly fresh. Definitely not as good as the tuna I had in my poke.\n\nI gave them 3 stars because I had pretty bad service. I think my waitress forgot about me. I was sitting at the sushi bar and ordered everything at the same time as soon as I sat down. I got my poke directly from the sushi chef first, then waited 10 minutes for my rice, later got my edamame appetizer and had to remind her that I asked for water too. It all came out of order!\n\nTruly, the service wasn't bad enough to keep me from returning.

About 15 minutes later, we'd had a few refills of our water and ordered and received a bottle of wine from the Som. when our waiter finally showed up.  He turned out to be particularly annoying like he'd taken a happy pill. \nA good laugh was had when the guy who brought our bread and butter described the butter and second dish of salted lard.  We looked at him questioning the lard and he stated he'd never tasted it thinking it was disgusting and questioned why they served it.  His honesty was great and pretty much set the tone for the night.  I tasted it and it's not good.  Lard?!?!\nFunny thing, as we were finishing our appetizer of pretty good fried calamari but, not yet finished, I saw our bus boy walk by with our entrees.  He found somebody to set our table for the entrees and ask if we were finished with the calamari.  The timing and obviousness of all this was unfortunate.

The waxy look is not just for show either ... the beef is tender and suffused with the waxy texture as much as the look.  It was literally as if the fat had endeavored to permeate the fibers of the meat itself and succeeded.  The flavor was just slightly funky, but deep and textured.  It paired perfectly with vegetables.  Post-bite, you could still feel the flavor seeping into your taste buds.  Until you lifted your fork and did it all again.\n\nDefinitely call ahead to be sure they'll have the right aged meat ready for you and some better seats.

The avocado spring rolls are great, and the mango that comes with them is kind of addicting. The staff is friendly though never very attentive, and once mischarged my credit card, took 3 days to get it cleared up. They also list items on the menu that come with the entree, but dont show up. When you ask about that item, they tell you there is an extra cost for it... odd!\n\n+1 for being a unique option to Phoenix, and +1 for being clean as a whistle.", "type": "review", "business_id": "cLojUtqkFpVIHFEvA_5Atw"}

Went to RumBar recently, but hadn't had a chance to check out the Breadfruit and its updated menu until tonight.  The original place is still largely in tact, but has a distinctly refined look to it now.  It used to be just a hole in the wall type of place, but it now feels like a really well rehearsed performance.  The food has largely stayed the same with alot of the usual jerk and caribbean favorites.  On this night I went for the pimento wood smoked mussels.  Good stuff (though I wish I could've had more).  The beans and rice were solid.  The bread was delicious just as I remember.  And the drinks from the RumBar were on point.  We topped off the evening with a chocolate creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e.  My girlfriend was a happy camper with that one.  Overall the Breadfruit has definitely matured from its early beginnings.  It still has the feel of a neighborhood haunt, but feels more like a sit down restaurant than a humble startup.  The prices are a little on the high side with some of the dishes and some of the cocktails are a little steep.  But overall I'm very impressed with how Breadfruit has evolved.", "type": "review", "business_id": "cLojUtqkFpVIHFEvA_5Atw"}

Personally, I don't understand when I'm sitting next to someone at the rail ordering a dragon roll and a martini while constantly looking at his or her watch while griping about the time.  You want something from the sea in a hurry?  Go eat a Filet-'o'-Fish.  I like to relax and savor, and Pearl is comforatble enough that I can do that.\n\nPrices?  Best I've seen for Sushi.  Their \"always happy hour\" promotion is great- I can walk in with a friend, have a couple beers and sake, split a few rolls, and walk out full and content for under $60... for BOTH of us.  That's amazing.  On Sundays, they actually have even more promotions, where they let you roll dice for even more off your bill.\n\nI highly suggest Sunday or early weeknights if you're exploring it for the first time.

The server split the wedge salad for us and it was just enough food. The bread we were served was delicious. It had walnuts and cranberries that almost reminded me of a breakfast loaf. So good. My salmon....high priced (around $28?) but little did I know it was going to be a slab large enough to feed two people. Had we known this, this is the route we would have taken to save a bit of $. The salmon had a nice light sauce on it and did come with some oddly placed spinich and corn. The prices are fairly high and sadly it's one of those restaurants that everything is ordered seperately.

'kobe steak sampler', and then be forced to spend another $12 to $15 per additional side.  When I went here ~3 weeks ago, my Radiologist buddy dropped ~$500 for his meal--he had the Kobe sampler, 1 side, and had 2 to 3 glasses of wine and a desert (we as a table had split up the cost of all the side dishes).

I especially enjoyed the service by Tara who made our visit feel special from the very moment we sat down. \n\nAfter allowing us to peruse the menu for awhile, she returned with a cart of steaks and proceeded to give us a brief but detailed description of all their signature cuts and I must say, they all looked enticing! \n\nShortly after, we were served our wine and breads, which included the usual steakhouse suspects of fragrant & savory onion focaccia, pretzel roll, one of my personal favorites, mainly because of the firm outside texture and soft and chewy inside... and it wasn't too salty like most other pretzel breads I've come across. \nParmesan bread stick took a close second  place for its addictive light, crisp & crunchy texture with a generous coating of Parmesan breading on the outside.\n\nBone Marrow Appetizer - From the buttery soft marrow to the warm, flavorful mushroom sauce, it was a blissful combination of ingredients and love. Simply unbelievable. If there's one single dish from this entire trip, I will be craving for months afterwards, it will definitely be this!\n\nSteak Tasting \nAmerican Kobe Style from snake river - paired with a house steak sauce. The beef was perfectly tender and seared beautifully leaving my mouthwatering for another juicy bite. The tangy flavor of the steak sauce was a perfect addition to the meat as it brought on a bright acidity to the steak. Let it be known, I'm determined to get the recipe for that irresistible sauce!!!!\nUSDA prime dry aged - much softer and juicier than the New York, this cut of steak was praiseworthy in every way. Honestly, it was a cut of perfection on a plate and the accompanying chimichurri sauce added a brightness to my palate that made it all the more satisfying. \nAustralian wagyu from Blackmore -\nWorthy of it namesake, was truly the best of the best. It's like they took 50 steaks and concentrated all the beefiness into one bite. The best steak I've ever had. It came with a b\u00e9arnaise sauce but honestly this piece needed nothing to dress it. It was perfect all on its own.\n\nWhite corn had a fresh & crunchy bite with a slightly sweet caremelized exterior that added a pleasant rustic flavor to the dish \n\nDessert\nBaked Alaska - Tasted like a giant strawberry mochi. Btw, that's a good thing!  It also came with a small lemon bar, which had a lip puckering natural citrusy flavor!\n\nBanana Creme pie came with chocolate ice cream, sauce, and chocolate crunch pearls. Now that's what I call a triple chocolate threat! Having said that, It was surprisingly mild and less cloyingly sweet, which I really enjoyed.\n\nBefore we left, Tara gave us more sweets in the form of a chocalate truffle cookie bar and a chewy peanut brittle...both were absolutely delicious! \n\nService was very thoughtful and the staff in general were ever present without being overbearing. But i'd have to say Tara made all the difference! She transformed a pleasant meal to an unforgettable dining experience with her natural charm and warm tableside manner, which easily made the evening five stars in my book!\n\nBravo to CUT for an exquisite meal and extraordinary service! \n\nYou bet ill be back for an encore! \n\nUntil then...\n\nHappy Eats!", "type": "review", "business_id": "naLrErBuJr9IWd6_rv6-XQ"}

Coming from a heavily Asian (Chinese/Taiwanese/Vietnamese/Filipino) city of San Jose, I really tried to measure up Dessert Avenue. I really did.\n\nLOCATION: It's on Spring Mountain Road which is a strip of Asian stores and restaurants. That's nice because you can hop straight here after dinner.\n\nThe actual store is located on the second floor of a complex. Parking CAN BE tight, but fret not as there is \"underground\" parking - under the second story buildings.\n\nSEATING: A decently spacious cafe with seating for about 40ish. They have a magazine rack and some games. The counter (no seating) is towards the back and a small kitchen behind it (open view). I didn't visit the restroom, so no comments can be made about it.\n\nMENU: From what I hear, the menu is really a lot like what is being served in cafes in Hong Kong and Taiwan: lots of fruit mixes with sago, aloe, and mango jellies. Though called Dessert Avenue, they do serve hot foods, but it really only takes up one page of a 4-5 page menu.\n\nWHAT DID I EAT: I had a hot dish and a dessert (duh).\n\n- HOT dish: I asked if they had fried squid (calamari), but they didn't. I stuck to the FRIED CHICKEN. When it arrived, there were 6 wings (no drumsticks) on a plate with 4 small forks. But I didn't have 4 plates for the other party members, so we had to eat on top of napkins until the waitress arrived with them (after a customer request). They were decently sized, fried thoroughly, juicy, but not memorable (except for some of the chicken hair that was present).\n\n- COLD dish: I asked for recommendations as most of the items were not recognizable to me. I decided to go with something safe: MANGO JUICE with COCONUT MILK/JUICE and MANGO JELLIES. As I was served with a milkshake-sized drink, I was intrigued. There were three layers that seemed like three different substrates that were not mixing! Mango juice on top of coconut milk on top of mango jellies. As I sipped, the mixing would occur until finally, there was a uniform consistency. They didn't offer any boba (which I'm used to), but this was an interesting departure from my usual drink of choice.\n\nFINAL COMMENTS: I didn't enjoy my visit, but I'm not going to ding this establishment because of my ignorance of HK desserts. You might like it, but I don't think I'll be returning.\n\nNOTES:\n- Accepts CCs\n- Only one server (when I went...2:00 p.m.)", "type": "review", "business_id": "aNT8asMBtMhc35a9EH7zrw"}

As we were leaving to find another place, the hostess informed us that they could fit us at the counter. The \"counter\" is a raised area that looks out into the restaurant. I'm struggling to figure out how to describe it right now. It's a long table where everyone sits in a row- like a sushi counter- which overlooks the dining area. And you have to be very careful while sitting there. There's not much room and I doubt the people with spacious bench seats below us would appreciate a spilled drink. However, it was the perfect spot for people watching. \n\nService was a little slow. Hence, the 4 stars. It took a while for us to get refills on our drinks. The server came over once without us having to wave her down. But food was amazing. I recommend the serviche and taraditos (especially the tuna). The duck breast robata was also amazing.

Eyewear gave her a professorial look, high heels a come hither look. Yet it was the direct and patient manner in which she explained the menu items to my father that sealed her as the total package for me. I wish I remembered this fine creature's name but, alas, I was much too smitten to remember such a detail.\n\nDad ordered his usual Scotch and Mom and I opted for plain water. As we looked over the fare--a Japanese/South American type blend--I kept stealing looks at The Professor. She caught me a few times but neither of us cared. Both of us smiled, in fact. It was an old game played by many throughout time, usually with far more success than ever attained by yours truly. That aside, the dining room was darkly lit, with a sushi bar in back and bar in front. A raucous group of tuxedo wearing party boys were slamming shots on the stools but eventually simmered down. Perhaps one of the uber hawt barmaids had mentioned their over exuberance and they'd relented.\n\nAnyway, after smooth as silk tutoring from The Professor my dad finally settled on sea bass(miso) and Peruvian corn with a side of roasted vegetables. Mom went with a single samba roll which contained Maine lobster, mango, tomato, chive, crispy rice, soy paper and peanut curry. And as for me, I wasn't in the mood for seafood so I asked for chicken teriyaki(samba style) with purple mashed potatoes. \n\nThe verdict?\n\nPerhaps everything was fine. I never really know when with my parents. Their company is somewhat like being immersed in fine mist after a few drinks. You can sort of see and understand what's going on, but not very clearly, which means you occasionally misread what's actually occurring. To wit: Dad liked his fish(but he picked the restaurant so he would have liked whatever slop they put in front of him). Mom said her lobster roll was good(but she never says negative things until years after the fact. Kind of like her own statute of limitations if you will). And me? I always kind of defer to their mindset when in their company so I think my chicken and potatoes were good, although for something touted on the menu as a Large Plate I wish there had been more bird and buds.\n\nEventually The Professor laid our check on the table, and Dad swiped it up before I could, although I must confess it was a lame and slow attempt on the part of my right hand. He gave his usual 15% tip and we departed Sushisamba--which by the way is located off the shopping section of The Palazzo Hotel/Casino. \n\nI guess we might have had a nice time there(I can't really be sure) but this much I do know: Mist or no mist, The Professor in high heels forever has my heart in her grasp....", "type": "review", "business_id": "NsnZ5GhagXBKrCOelxVQxw"}

Arriving at around 8pm and ready for a good meal that could accommodate a group of 8 who didn't feel like venturing out of the hotel, the Brand was a great choice.  Despite waits at most restaurants on a Friday night, its large dining room just off the blackjack tables provided the perfect medium for our evening's start.  \n\nThe service was a little slow here, and that was my one reservation about a giving it a five star rating, as the food was wonderful.  It wasn't unattentive once we ordered, but getting our waitress to take the order took some time.  Drinks around began the night, and for me it was a perfectly made gimlet with lime juice, not roses, which was a pleasant surprise.  \n\nWe didn't splurge on appetizers but went right for the meals.  My entree was the 18 oz bone-in Veal Porterhouse steak cooked medium rare.  Warm to the core but deliciously pink, this was a fantastic choice.  The well seasoned veal was salty but not over-seasoned.  it was a bit like eating meat candy, and I loved every bite...or, at least most of them.  It's worth saying that this piece, and only say this because it was $50 dish, had a bit more connective tissue around the bone than I would have liked, but I didn't let that ruin the meal.  Still, it was a bit disappointing and was not the signature of a great steak house.\n\nAs a side, I ordered the wood grilled asparagus topped with truffle oil.  This too was tasty, but not what I expected.  It was both a bit smaller (very thin rods of asparagus) and a bit soggier than I expected, as though it had sat in the back under a heat lamp after they cooked it.  The flavor was enjoyable, but the experience wasn't what was expected.  \n\nIf I were at an outback steakhouse and paying $35 for a steak and side, I would've given this a higher rating. But the cost and the billing made me expect more.  This is a restaurant that had a lot of things going for it, and gave us a relatively enjoyable meal, but wasn't a place I would write home about...but, obviously, a place I had to yelp about.", "type": "review", "business_id": "U6stLkJYMaro_4-3KI84_Q"}

We get there and it was packed, so we decided to sit at the bar, where there were some seats. \n\nService in the beginning was spectacular, really nice bartenders, suggesting what is good on the menu.  I wanted everything on the menu but it was a bit pricey so had to be selective. \n\nTheir edamame app is unique as it comes with two bowls of edamame one tradition with the salt, and one with a sweet chili sauce. Both were fantastic and just the right thing to have before the sushi.  Next up, Miso soup - delicious!! \n\nI had ordered sushi, along with my two other friends, and figured it would be up after the apps.  It was a long wait for the first round of sushi for my friends, and even longer for me :( They had forgotten about my order and somehow the sushi chefs never got it! The bartender (our server) was trying to figure out what happened.  He gave us a round of drinks on the house to apologize.  \n\nPersonally, I was not even that mad even with him apologizing so many times, and him saying this was not acceptable to their restaurant.  I was just happy to be in Vegas an having a good time.  Yeah, it did suck that my wait was really long. Never had to wait that long before in my life.  Hopefully in the future that does not happen with anyone else.  Once I finally got my sushi roll, Shrimp Tempura type I think it was, it was delicious and so happy it was good for me waiting so long. \n\nI would want to try this restaurant out again but at a table next time and not the bar :)", "type": "review", "business_id": "JsDZZ9S3qntzCfo5N_Ci6A"}

Some things were the same, and others were radically different.\n\nThe pork buns were as good as ever, but inexplicably this time they arrived after our three main entrees and just before the soup.  Yes, we received our soup last, even though I had asked for the appetizer and soup to be served first.  At least the soup was hot enough like the tea to last a long while.  To take the tension out of the dining equation, we have decided that the next time we dine at China Mama we will initially only order a hot appetizer and soup, and not until these items arrive at our table, will we order any entrees.  Last time I was more adventurous, trying out new culinary offerings never attempted before, and found the Beef Stew Hot Pot to be excellent.  In fact, the serving was so enormous that this tasty dish lasted two more meals beyond our restaurant stay. \n\nIn sampling common Chinese fare, I found the Kung Pao Chicken to be very good except for two bites of gristle; Beef Chow Mein to be very good and plentiful; and the Sizzling Rice Cake with Seafood Soup to be excellent except for utilizing undersize shrimp.  The soft greens like bok choy and the Chinese ear-shaped mushrooms floating in the broth were simply superb.  The broth itself was a bit spicy--but in a subtle, good way.  Walmut Shrimp and Combination Fried Rice were very good.  I was a little disappointed in the Potstickers because I found them to be a bit dry and undersized compared to the best I have tasted elsewhere.  But this was easily made up for by the unbeatable Steamed Juicy Pork Buns.  Trying Stir Fried Shredded Potato on a lark resulted in mixed reviews.  I liked the dish, but my wife found the potatoes to be undercooked.  They looked like hash browns that were never browned.  But we were not at a breakfast diner, so I did not expect hash browns.  Tomorrow my better half gets to fry the two-thirds of the order we did not finish to make the long strands of shredded potato as crispy as she desires!  \n\nService was good in the beginning, but bad at the end.  I had to attract the manager's attention to get leftovers wrapped and receive the bill over 10 minutes after we had finished eating.  In all fairness, in the midst of our meal, without any prodding or sideways glances from us, we were asked by the manager if we wanted more water, and our glasses were quickly refilled.  And, if one asked for silverware, Sweet & Low (a habit of mine even at Chinese restaurants except for those that serve the finest jasmine or green tea), or extra napkins, they were promptly supplied without any resistance or grumbling.  So, service was adequate overall.  The ambience in China Mama is rather spartan but the upholstered booth we sat in was quite comfortable and our table large enough to accommodate all of the several dishes we ordered.  \n \nOverall, China Mama still reigns as one of the best Chinese restaurants in Las Vegas I have sampled thus far.", "type": "review", "business_id": "NhpdNYXoRofaa649drCz3g"}

The jalapeno cornbread was soft, sweet, and with the added  touch of tangy jalapeno it was possibly the best I've ever had.  Also, the sides were all-you-can-eat, though we were far too full to even consider seconds.\n\nThe atmosphere was fun, covered in vintage signs and quirky decor.  You could spend hours just reading all the signs in this place.  Despite being a smaller joint, it was brimming with character,\n\nAll that being said, the service was just terrible.  We had an older blonde waitress, and she was vacant, unattentive, and just downright disinterested in serving us.  I work in customer service, and this time of year, I know it's rough, so I try to hold judgement for those in the service industry.  But we absolutely could not get her attention for anything.  She spent most of the time sitting in a table near the restroom chatting with another server.  She never once came by to check on us, we actually had to track her down to ask for a refill.  Forget requesting condiments.  It took her over 20 minutes after the meal to bring our tab and then she never came back to pick it up. I actually had to go up to the counter and ask another waitress if she could kindly ring us up.  It took 40 minutes after the actual meal to get out again...\n\nIf the server was even halfway decent, this would be a 5-star review.  I'm not suggesting anyone avoid this place, it's great.

Overall it was \"good\" but COULD have been fantastic if they hadn't been stingy on the tapenade and/or balsamic. It just didn't have that much flavor honestly. The bread was tasty though as were the \"gourmet chips\" they served along side the sandwich. \n\nFor the panini and drink, I paid just over $12.

The salad is large enough to share, too, especially when you know that you can't stuff yourself with it because your pizza is coming soon. They do bring out a single roll when they bring the salad, which is weird because the deal is for 2 people. This time we tried the chicken, spinach & apple salad first, which was very good.I think it had gorgonzola cheese on it, and walnuts, too. For our pizza we opted for the chicken pesto, and we were very happy with our decision. It was delicious! I had a glass of Merlot and my wife had a glass of Chardonnay. I wasn't familiar with the label of either wine, but both of ours were good. There is a price cap for the items if you are getting the Summer Sampler, but 90% of the options fall within the allowance. I think the pizzas have to be less than $9.75, the salads have to be less than $7.75 and the wines have to be less than $6.

The menu has varied from time to time but some of my favorites have been the Foie Gras, Braised Short Rib, and Cork's version of Mac and Cheese.  The deserts were amazing and we paired them with a desert wine that topped off the evening perfectly.  I have yet to be disappointed when eating here and the atmosphere is relaxing but yet upscale.  The prices are in line with what you would expect at a fine dining restaurant and I'm thrilled to have a high quality restaurant like this out in Chandler.", "type": "review", "business_id": "iV7D7fHKb-bF9fCL_bEMtA"}

(Say that three times really fast) Culver's, sure it's another fast food joint but they have great food and exceptional service! They offer a more diverse menu than most places.  It kind of a cross between a Burger joint and the Market Place.  In addition to burgers they offer things like fried cod, fried chicken, pot roast, chopped steak and fried shrimp.  They also offer a selection of different cooked veggies as sides.\n\nBut it's all about the burger for me.  The Bacon Deluxe served with two fresh, never frozen, beef patties seasoned well cooked to almost perfection with hot-melty-cheesy goodness, two slabs of bacon, served up hot and fresh on a lightly buttered bun with lettuce, tomato, onion, mayo and pickles.  Now you can create any type of burger you want so don't let their menu deter you from ordering something you would like that may not be on the menu.\n\nThey have those crinkle fries and great onion rings.  My family loves their fried cheese curds (little balls of cheese fried, imagine that).  You can get either one covered with chili and cheese if you wish.\n\nSome people go to this place just for the frozen custard but I recommend getting their lemon ice with blue berries! Less filling and really refreshing and tasty!  We've also got one of their frozen custard cakes for a B-Day and it was gone in less than 5 mins!\n\nHere's a Culver's Secret: \nWhen ever you get a french fry that is longer than seven inches (laugh first, then read on) show it to one of the Culver peeps.  They may give you a free frozen custard in trade for that seven incher! (it's a promo they run every now and then) Also for those on a budget, order the kids combo you'll get a burger, fries and a drink with a free custard!", "type": "review", "business_id": "8T8B_xK10FuO6MBOFcVQ3w"}

I have never seen a piece of beef look this way in my life... needless to say, I sent it back (never heard from a chef or a manager, and the place was dead)\n\n-the wedge salad was not nearly as good as we've had at Twin Creeks in the past\n\n-the grilled asparagus was too wet (I am assuming with too much olive oil)\n\n\nTHE TERRIBLE:\n\n-the bartender who served us was not very polite or kind... she tried to be helpful, but often came across argumentative and condescending (not only to us, but also to her co-workers)... when ordering my steak, I requested a thick cut. instead of being helpful and noting 'thick cut' on the ticket, she said there's nothing she can do about it... this is the first steakhouse I have been to where I was told they would not look for a thicker cut... next, after being served a thin, grizzled, wet, porkchop skillet looking piece of meat, rather than resolve my dissatisfaction, she tried justifying what I was served; this, while also being condescending by lecturing me on steaks (hello, I eat out nearly every day... I have been to nearly every steakhouse in Las Vegas and have a wife who can out cook most of the chefs in this city... I know food)... to top it off, she scolded her fellow bartender (maybe he was a bar back, but he made one of my drinks for her, which came out great) right in front of us, in a volume and tone flat unacceptable... you should never treat a coworker the way she did, and NEVER in front of customers\n\nThe place was dead, which seemed unusual for a Friday night.

Jamie W. got it for a couple of nights as part of a boondoggle his company was having in Vegas. I just tagged along as the proud freeloader that I am. I arrived after midnight and had no idea that the Palms complex consisted of three towers. Naturally, the Palms Place was the furthest away from the main action where the taxi driver dropped me off.\n\nAh, the Palms Casino...now THAT was a zoo, just the way I would expect a casino to be that was aimed at the just-turned-legal set this place seems to attract. I can see why the likes of Britney and Paris liquor themselves up and get married to anyone handy for 48 hours. But the Palms Place is in the adjacent building connected by an airport terminal-style automatic walkway. It's a definite study of contrasts where you enter a quiet lobby with absolutely no activity. I had no idea this was a condo building as well, as I kept wondering where the slot machines were. Gee, I had my rolls of nickels ready to break. \n\nThe studio room is nice enough though from my perspective, lazily designed and somewhat impractical. I could never figure out why there were two large flat-screens nearly next to each other on the same wall. I also wondered why they used a cheap counter veneer to simulate the chocolate wood you'd find in a West Elm catalog. As befitting a studio apartment, there's a kitchenette, a breakfast bar, and a small living room area surrounding the king-size bed. By far, the bathroom is the best feature with a vessel sink, a deep jacuzzi tub, and a rain-shower. \n\nIf you want to be away from the in-crowd, this may be your hotel of choice. Hey, I don't mind admitting that I am well beyond the age range for the party-hearty Palms Casino crowd, so the quietude of the Palms Place is a plus. As they are hurting like the rest of Vegas, they appear to be offering a $159 per night deal during the week.

She took our drink and appetizers order right away, and the food was swift to come our way. \n\nWe had the crab cakes, which had a very beautiful presentation. The green and red sauces were sweet chili sauce and olive oil. Then on top of that was cole slaw with a vinegar dressing. Then two golden brown crab cakes stacked on that. I thought the crab cake was really good, I had big bites of crab which I love, and the sweet chili sauce made it zesty. I don't think my husband cared for this dish, his comments were \"it's too sweet\". \n\nWe also tried the fried goat cheese, with macadamia nuts and soy sauce glaze. I love the bold flavors. It was served over a bed of diced mango's. The cracker served with it was a little thin, since the goat cheese has pretty strong flavor a thicker wafer would be better. \n\nWe both tried the Cuban sandwich with fried yucca. The sandwich came cut on the diagonal and it was difficult to eat, as each bit I lost a little bit of the insides, the meat and pickles kept sliding off. The yucca fries were light golden brown, and had a very different texture, it looked like fries, but it was very soft when biting into the wedge.

The giant billboard featuring a mouth-watering slice of key lime pie had been calling me for well over a year now, so tonight was the night to finally make the short drive to Town Square.\n\nUpon arrival at the restaurant I was immediately struck by how friendly the staff were. I didn't get the name of the girl who greeted us, but she was extremely welcoming and let us know that our server, appropriately named \"Tommy\", was excellent. She was certainly right. Tommy was friendly, sharp, congenial, accommodating - everything you want from a waiter. He gave us lots of good advice and engaged us in conversation about the food, ranging from the bread with honey-cinnamon butter, to the excellent lemonade we ordered. He really seemed to have a passion for the menu items and did a great job of at least appearing to delight in our enjoyment of them.\n\nI ordered the Sanibel Stuffed Chicken and my wife got the Antigua Quesadillas appetizer and a variety of sides to share with me. We both loved our food and were particularly taken by one of the sides, the enormous basket of plantain chips, sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar and served with a black bean, charred corn salsa with lime sour cream.\n\nAround halfway through our meal the idea of eating the key lime pie that had lured us there in the first place began to look like a bit of a pipe dream - but we were so happy we decided, what the heck. Two slices to go.\n\nOverall our experience here was wonderful, particularly helped by the pleasant outdoor dining section and the lovely early April weather. My only minor criticism of the place is the lack of any real vegetarian \"main\" option for my wife. She was more than happy with what she had, but a little variety would call us back all the more often.

Finally, for my birthday this year, I got my husband to take me.\nWe made reservations, and it's a good thing we did because the restaurant is tiny - like maybe 20 diners can sit down at tables and 4 more at the bar, tiny. We got an early table (hey, we have a little baby at home!) and we saw two groups come and leave because they couldn't get a table.\nFirst, the drinks: an excellent selection of sake with a very informative menu, and a handful of bottled Japanese beers (and not just Asahi, either!). We both had new beers and they were both good; prices were average ($7-8).\nFor our meal, we started with the oft-reviewed hot and cold tofus. I thought the cold was really delicious, and the green tea salt and house soy sauce really made the dish pop. The hot was just meh. We didn't finish it. My husband is a miso soup lover, so he got a bowl of it and it was good, but just miso soup. It was packed with tofu, so after that, we were feeling kinda tofu-ed out. Next up were the specials (a blue-fin tuna and a yellowtail dish). They were both really good and the dishes completely came together with all the accompaniments. I always like blue-fin tuna and yellowtail, but these dishes were a cut above. Almost up to Nobu status, I think. \nThen we branched out with something kind of adventurous - uni with poached egg and salmon roe. Wow, it was so mushy and runny, I had to force down the second bite - ew (but that's just me). Finally, we got the juicy fried chicken (good, but not the best fried chicken I've had by a long shot) and the skewers of duck (thumbs up for that one). \nThe final bill came out to about $135 with tip.\nMy overall thought is that it's good and I'm really glad I went to experience it once, but I'll probably never go back since I didn't love all the food and it's expensive. \nAlso, I'm not sure, but I may not be cut out to eat the food they actually eat in Japan.", "type": "review", "business_id": "xNcqwYAUeVOhe3KNC4Xjaw"}

I'm busy.  On this side of town and I whip out my Yelp app to see if I've book marked a place to eat in the area.  Yep, I was a mere few feet from this place.  So, I pull my car into teh parking lot and go in for a quick meal.\n\nI order shrimp chipotle and a michalada.  I ALWAYS have the michalada.  So, I'm sitting at my table waiting patiently for my food whilst I read messages on my cell phone.  Suddenly, out of no where I hear a crash and then I instantly feel COLD.  WET and COLD.  Oh yes, a waitress walking by spills an entire tray of waters and beer on me.  I was in complete shock!  Total SHOCK.  I said nothing for what may have seemed like FOREVER as everyone in the resto GASPED to see what my reaction might be.  I quickly check to see if my phone was drenched, it wasn't.  I take a moment to think... did they mess up my nicely coiffed hair?  no, it wasn't... So then I look up and FINALLY break my silence and I tell the waitress..... \"Ok, so I guess I\"ll be taking my food to go\".  They fuss over me and ask if I was ok or hurt and I say no, as I wasn't.  I wasn't even embarrassed by it.  So, I just simply move to the other chair across the table and I reached down and continued to sip on the michalada as I waited for my food.  They comp'ed my order, naturally.  And as I was leaving, the waitress apologized again and I said, \"Accidents happen, NO WORRIES!  I'll be back next week\"  And so, I did go back the next week with my mom.  For me, this water experience has little to do with the rating.  I enjoyed the shrimp chipotle ALOT, except the shrimp seemed to be overcooked.\n\nMy mom and I went there on a Sunday.  Packed house.  Oh and the people saying the music is loud in there, are NOT over-exaggerating.  The music was fairly loud.  It comes from a paid juke box, so it won't be like that all the time.\n\nI had the camarones diabla and my mom had the molacajete.  neither of us were crazy about our own dishes.  However, we both liked the other's.  The camarrones diabla was the spiciest that I've ever had any place EVER.  My mother likes spicier food than I and she loved it.  I, on the other hand enjoyed the milder flavor of the molacajete.  But all the meat was  a little over cooked to me.  \n\nAll in all, I don't think I'll be running back here.  there's another Mexican Seafood Restaurant that's not too far from there that I like much better than this.  If you are in the area, you may like to try it out.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Us49chcQrPwU9Em67mQk1g"}

She verified with the person on the phone that we'd get 2 queen beds because on the website it says they only have suites with a king bed. My friend gets there, checks in and of course there aren't any rooms with 2 queen beds. The good thing is after complaining we got a roll away cot that was actually pretty comfortable. \n\nBeing such a new hotel, I think the staff is slightly inexperienced. My friend had added my name to the room because I was arriving at a different time and at first the person at the front desk couldn't find my name on the reservation and after a minute or so was like oh I looked in the wrong place... uhhhh ok? Then when directing us to the elevator to get to our room, we got the wrong directions and ended up somewhere else... \n\nThe location is only ok. It's all the way at the end of the strip so it's not as easy to get around but if the weather isn't bad, that's not too much of an issue.  It is close enough to TI, Wynn and Venetian that if you usually only stay around that area than it's no biggie.  Also it's right across from this large mall so there is plenty of shopping. \n\nOk so the good... \n\nThe room is really nice and up to what I expected. It was nice to have the drapes open and close right by the bedside. The bathroom is great and being a new hotel, you can tell the towels, sheets etc. are all crisp and clean. \n\nA big plus was that we had left our curling iron on in the room. We called the hotel and they helped us go into the room and turn it off.  I know it benefits them more than me because if their hotel burnt down after opening for 3 weeks would be a disaster but it was still nice of them to do it.  So overall the staff is very friendly and they try to be helpful.\n\nChecking out was also very easy.  As soon as we came down the elevators, they had 2 people waiting to check your name off and that was it. Check out down.  Fast and easy.  We didn't have to return any keys because they print your name on them which I thought was kind of cool.\n\nAnd other random comments... \nSo this hotel is definitely geared towards an Asian clientele (and more specifically chinese) because the red from the hotel was overwhelming. Also floor 40-49 is missing. \n\nThe casino seemed kind of empty for a vegas hotel. During the day, the bj tables were around $10 even though it was Sat. At night I think you could find tables for $15.", "type": "review", "business_id": "eRRyfI6QVvSviirRF8UGzQ"}

I have never been to a Korean BBQ place before, and from what I heard from the girlfriend and many of my asian friends, this place was the place to be at.\n\nWhen we walked in, it was fairly quiet. Many other patrons were quietly eating their food. It looked like Honey Pig was airing out the restaurant by opening all the doors and windows, and having the vents on full power. Honestly it sounded like a factory or something haha. No biggie though, I'm there for the nitrosamine foods, not the noise.\n\nMy girlfriend and I got the AYCE, which included several different meats. In my opinion, everything tasted great, but I especially enjoyed the bulgogi and the Sirloin. The Ribs were delicious as well! There was squid included, but honestly I don't like the texture of squid. My girlfriend said it was good though, so there's my review on that haha.\n\nI was very impressed with the attentiveness of our waitress. She came by often to help us grill and also bring more meat out. Although there were times where she looked like she had too many people to manage, she never forgot any request that we had.\n\nThat cinnamon drink at the end tho!!! I think I wanted to take a gallon home! Haha! Overall this place was great for the price. Would I come back? Yeah probably... I hear there are many great Korean BBQ places in Vegas so maybe I'll check all of them out also.", "type": "review", "business_id": "cQJM8VpY21O3HVu7j_b7Vw"}

The salad was large and I enjoyed the large crouton that came on it, but it was not the best salad I have ever had. It needed a bit more dressing to give it more flavor.\n*BLT Burger - our friends really enjoyed this burger. While it was simple, it hit the spot.\n*Asian Bahn Mi burger - one of our friends ordered it as it was not a traditional beef burger and while he liked it, it seemed that he liked his wife's BLT Burger more.\n*Onion rings - cooked perfectly and I liked how the breading was not too heavy.\n\nThe burgers do not come with a side, so if you want fries or onion rings, you need to make sure to order them as a side. Our bill came to about $65 per couple (includes tax and tip), so it's a tad pricey for a burger and milkshake joint.

I wipe my hand off and look to the left.  I see a pirate ship.\n\nWe go inside because the techno on the patio is killing my vibe. Still clutching drink 8 I dance to Lollipop, great song btw. Love Lil Wayne. The dance floor is fairly empty compared to the Tangerine days when you had to stand awkwardly just to wedge yourself into a tiny spot while watching the bottle service tools basking in their space and giant top shelf bottles.

There is no way that would have ended well. \n\nThis is our French friend's first time to the United States and true to Euro form he is bouncing up and down all night long upstaging the stamina of even the most seasoned skull-t shirt wearing Las Vegas coke heads.

After the great time I had last time I thought to bring my family because of my high expectations. This time we were greeted by the hostess who took our names down said 15-20 min wait. We were waiting for some time and after 20 I thought OK it was busy so whatever that can't be helped. As I noticed further there were people who JUST walked in and got a seat. I would like to say that these people were not ones who had a reservation because they came in took there name down like me then 2min later were seated. We were forgotten plain and simple. I waited a little longer to see if we would be noticed. It happened again. Then the last straw was that a group of 15 people walk in and were seated before us. The first girl the hostess seemed alarmed that we were not seated and said \"oh my god she forgot you.\" it wasn't until another waitress came by and said that they had a reservation. They way she said that to me seemed like she just didn't care. The hostess saw us to our seats right away. The waitress then had was much more enjoyable than the other one. I wish I got her name because she was very helpful and apologetic towards us. The food was wonderful and the price was great. Other than the first encounter it was an enjoyable dinner. \n\nThe third time was a nice evening. It was myself and my boyfriend. Seated in about 15 min on a busy Wednesday night. The waitress was very attentive and got out orders in and out in no time. Kudos to the cook that night my steak was grilled perfectly. \n\nOverall I am not sure what to make of this place.

I have been to almost all of them in the city at least once. My current favorite has been Flavors of India on 16th street & Cambell because it is near work and they make an awesome chicken korma. \n\nLet me state for the record that I never, ever, ever get the buffet which is pretty standard at most Indian places in the valley. Aside from buffet-phobia I am a pretty big chili head. I like HOT in any shape and form. This means I need to order off the menu and ask for it spicy. I typically order \"Indian Spicy\" or \"The hottest you make it\". \n\nSo, I jumped off the 202 a bit early the other day because of traffic and headed north on Scottsdale, imagine my surprise to see \"Taj Mahal\" there at McKellips, so close to my home stomping grounds. I immediately made a mental note to try it.\n\nToday was that day. I popped in to grab lunch \"take out\" for my wife and I. The place was completely empty and there in the back was the requisite buffet (I didn't get close enough to it to see what it held). I sat at the bar and ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala (mild, rating 0) for her and the Chicken Vindaloo (as a 10) for me as well as an order of garlic naan.\n\nLet me say, I was impressed. The chicken tikka was on par with any I have tried in the valley, the garlic naan was better than most, but I think the Delhi Palace in tempe has that beat. The basmati rice was 'ok', probably the least impressive part of the meal, I really prefer it with a nice mix of \"crunchy\" bottom scrapings. HOWEVER! The real winner was my chicken vindaloo. \n\nI AM IN LOVE. Finally a place that actually brings the heat, a 10 means 10. It was exactly the level of spiciness I crave and have yet to get in an Indian restaurant in AZ. I think I might still have a little endorphin high from it right now. The flavor was phenomenal as well, a nice rich flavor. I like vindaloo because it's not quite as heavy as some of the creamier ones and this one did not dissapoint. A crisp, deep flavor with a beautiful slow burn spiciness.\n\nI am definitely a regular now. In fact, I am going to bring some fellow chili-head friends next weekend. \n\nOh, they also have a nice selection of Indian beers, more than is normally found at similar places. You can't go crazy with the spice without some refreshing beers on hand right?\n\nIf you like spicy, or even just like Indian food pop in and give it a go. I will cry myself to sleep at night snuggling my plush habanero if this place goes out of business because of people not knowing about it ;)\n\nOh, the prices off the menu were very affordable, if my wife liked spicy (or vice versa) we could have easily split the one or the other $13 entree and been full.", "type": "review", "business_id": "wjdliX7p3uNZJSSiwB737w"}

It was formerly another bar but not too long ago changed into an English pub. We've been in the strip mall a million times but hadn't tried it since the change or in its previous incarnation.\n\nWalking up, it looked pretty cool. They have a small patio that had a firepit (portable) outside that was lit. As it was a bit rainy & chilly, looked pretty iniviting. With the 2 small kids, we headed inside though.\n\nInside was interesting as well. Huge circular bar in the middle of the restaurant was definitely the most prominent feature. It had a very casual vibe, TVs showing sports throughout, and posters giving it some English character. It was quite busy and the crowd was very mixed. After being there for a good while, the Mrs. & I agreed that it was an interesting place to people watch. There were a good number of seniors concentrating on their food, some super casual young folk drinking & hanging out & some middle aged folks that looked to be kind of on the prowl. Definitely had a huge local feel. The server said they have a ton of regulars. \n\nAs far as the food, we did 3 orders of the fish & chips (cod). They also had a couple walleye dishes. The fish & chips were great. With the Mrs. being from Australia, fish & chips are a big thing. Totally got her approval. In recent visits to places we've really liked in the past, we've come across dry fish with way too much batter. This definitely wasn't the case. The fish was moist, mild & tasty. The batter was light but crispy. Just right. The server said the owner was from York and they make their batter the traditional way every morning. The fries also passed the Aussie test. Nice big \"chips\". Malt vinegar, HP & the other necessities were also available. They also had some nice beer on tap (Boddington's & Tetley's were 2 that stood out in my mind).\n\nThey also had some other interesting things on the menu that we need to go back & try: Scotch egg, shepherd's pie, bangers & mash, bangers, beans & chips. No pasties or sausage rolls.\n\nAll in all, it was a good time & we'll definitely be heading back.", "type": "review", "business_id": "DL8sIhW5Ew7dXvYxEOj9TQ"}

We brought Lucy in for her post adoption checkup and a diagnosis on some sniffles and sneezes, and walked into Spencer Springs without an appointment. We had to wait a while, but we waltzed in instead of being good citizens with an appointment, so it's to be expected! I also respect any establishment that takes their appointments first and leaves the walk-ins for last, even if it means I'm the last. There's nothing worse than waiting an hour after your appointment time in a doctors or vets office, but that's neither here nor there.\n\nThe girls were all very, very sweet to us and very patient with our scared little girl! By the time we left, Lucy assumed she was queen of that castle! Our exam was complimentary since Lucy was adopted 2 days ago, so our bill only came to 10.00 for some antibiotics. \n\nWe'll be back in a few weeks for her booster shots, and she'll be back for every other vet need she has! Thanks, ladies!", "type": "review", "business_id": "EySCN4m7vO-dFZ22V40NYw"}

However, it seems older and maybe a little dirtier as well. (They always have sticky floors!) This AMC has an IMAX, which was a nice experience, and the other screens seem pretty big as well.

Apparently, we weren't important enough to warrant a table...because we actually had the NERVE to seat ourselves. Sammie would not tolerate such a transgression against protocol, rudely \"ejecting\" us because we were all not having dinner...despite the fact that we had just spent hundreds of dollars at the bar minutes ago. Sammie, you see, profiled us as less than high rollers because we were from the automotive industry, i.e., we were not \"important.\" When we approached Sammie the next night, she callously replied, \"What...are you looking for...free drinks?!\" Floored.

New dentist, new practice, a $40 all inclusive special when I had no insurance, etc.  The receptionist, Samantha, seemed very nice, so, she gets 2 stars, but the service here, SUCKS.\n\nI'll explain.  I just moved to Las Vegas from NY 2 months ago and was looking for a dentist.  This one is right near my house and it got good reviews on here, so I decided to give them a try.  \n\nThe first question the Dr. asked me when he looked in my mouth is if I ever considered braces.  I told him no.  My teeth are relatively straight.  In fact, Rosie, the hygienist, had WAY worse looking teeth than I did.  She was nice also though.\n\nSo my story is that I have 4 relatively large, amalgam fillings on my left side.  2 up, 2 down, both in molars.  Dr. Tran's recommendation was $2400 worth of replacement fillings for all of my teeth.  This seemed bizarre as I know that amalgam fillings are typically used to bigger cavities and tend to hold up better than their \"tooth colored\" counterparts.  \n\nI did, however, feel as though I got a good cleaning and it was done by the dentist, which you don't see very often anymore.  \n\nAnyway, today I called my dentist back in NY who told me that replacing all my fillings was unnecessary and seeing as how I was just there less than 6 months ago, there is no way my teeth could have gotten THAT bad.  \n\nI went to a new dentist today and he was right on with my old dentist in stating that there were nothing wrong with my fillings, and, in fact, if he were to remove them and put in porcelain or resin-composite, my teeth would be MORE sensitive than they are and I would probably end up with nerve damage seeing as how my cavities were all pretty deep.\n\nSo, save your time and money and go see Dr. Ruper @ Boston Dental on W.

The atmosphere was good, the service was average and the food was average.\nThe garlic bread that started the meal was delicious...but that is as good as it got. I ordered the Rigatoni Melezzana. The pasta was too hard and the sauce was bland. My husband ordered the Spaghetti with Angus Meatballs he said it was \"ehhh, ok.\" We heard such good things about the food we expected a lot more. The portions were acceptable.  They charged for cola refills which is always tacky and always pisses me off. \nThe evening got a little strange when my husband spilled spaghetti  sauce on his favorite white lacoste polo. I tried to get the sauce out in the bathroom but it wasn't coming out. We were pretty much done with our meal so we got the check and threw in cash and started to head out. The manager chased us down in front of the restaurant and was asking us if everything was okay.  It was clear he thought we were trying to dine and ditch or something. We just looked at him like he was crazy and told him we put cash in with the check and walked out. We looked back to see him run to the table and check to see if we paid...seriously guy. My opinion...there is better Italian for better prices even within the same hotel.", "type": "review", "business_id": "5GKbGn9-fAgQ0njSh3OJ8A"}

We chose the Intimate Mix ceremony at the chapel, followed by a reception for 40 at MIX nightclub upstairs. The ceremony was simple, but very nice. Just what we wanted. We added an isle runner and rose petals and these stand up vases at each row. The minister was fantastic. I don't remember his name, but he did a great job. Flowers for the bridesmaid and for the groomsmen's lapels all looked great. Photographer was good, but all business...fine with us since we just wanted to get to our reception (pics turned out nice). \n\nThe reception was fantastic. the hand-passed finger foods (mini grilled cheese, brie, chicken satay, beef skewers, macaroni, and sliders) were all delicious, as was the cake. Most of our guests commented how tasty the food was and that is was the best tasting wedding cake they have ever ate. Drinks were great and served by two waitresses promptly...very pleased with that. Two hours of drinks AND gratuity was included in the package so we didn't really have to worry about a huge bill at the end of the night. I was kind of worried that there was no music playing for the two hours we had our area reserved, but it turned out better since people were able to chat. About 10pm the music kicked in and our wedding group hit the dance floor with the other patrons in the club. The view at MIX is awesome. \n\nIf you and your future wife/husband are looking for a casual but still classy ceremony and reception where you can party and have a good time and not worry about all the minutia and stress of wedding planning I would highly recommend Mandalay Bay. It wasn't \"cheesy\" like most Vegas weddings seem to be. \n\nHappy to say that every aspect of our wedding here actually exceeded our expectations!", "type": "review", "business_id": "p52urKcTRb5T7gUapawBTg"}

The $60/person price tag was a bit scary but definitely worth it. The service is amazing and each server treats every guest as their own. The view is spectacular especially during the spring and summer when you can truly enjoy the beautiful weather and scenery. Live music on the weekends which certainly enhances the dining experience. I don't even know where to begin with the food! Inside there is an omlette station where the chef even prepares waffles, french toast and pancakes. There is bacon, sausage, hash browns and oatmeal along with cheese blintzes (heavenly with the accompaning strawberry sauce). Moving more towards the patio, there is a set up with an assortment of fresh cheeses and meats including, but not limited to, brie, goat, manchego, aged cheddar, smoked salmon, beef carpaccio and so on and so on. There is an array of fresh fruit including pineapple, rasberries, blackberries, strawberries, melons, grapes etc. The raw bar has blackened ahi, shrimp cocktail, snow crab claws and more. Outside, there is a prime rib carving station, fresh crab cakes, filet mignon medallions, swordfish, snapper, shrimp scampi and scallops. There is a pasta station where a woman mixes in desired toppings with a marinara or an alfredo sauce. Next to her a lovely woman makes homemade tortillas which she makes into quesadillas or tacos with fresh salsas and guacamole. Im sure there are many items that I am forgetting! Moving on to dessert, there is a chocolate fountain with fruits and cookies and rice krispies to dip! There is also ice cream and a made to order bananas foster station. There is also a setup of pastries and cheesecakes and cupcakes and more! \nHonestly this is one of my absolute favorite brunch spots, and my boyfriend and I truly enjoy every second of this amazing feast. Of course the bottomless mimosas dont hurt! For special occasions this is my go to choice, or for the relaxing sunday brunch date with a significant other or a group of friends, Rita's kitchen truly caters to every group!", "type": "review", "business_id": "FhjdZ2DtjVgCfK47bYO6sw"}

I rate this as 5 stars when compared to other hotel restaurants not compared to every restaurant.\n\nFood: \n--Overall: The food is new age American food but luckily it does not suffer the usual downfall of being over-thought. There are multiple elements to each dish but they generally work in harmony and don't overpower each other.\n\n--Breakfast: The breakfast here is fantastic. Everything is cooked well, and not overly complicated. Most importantly they make sure their bacon is crispy, none of that limp bacon you get at some places. Its always nice when they have the buffet (based on hotel capacity as I understand) because it gives you a bit more choice and selection.\n\nI only wish they used their filtered water for the coffee, because you can really taste the saltiness of Phoenix tap water in the coffee and it ruins otherwise good coffee.\n\n--Lunch: Only had lunch here a few times, decent chicken salad,  but the awesome tater tots will turn you into Napoleon Dynamite.\n\n--Dinner: The dinner menu really shines here. The appetizers are all very good, but the street corn soup is a MUST have. Every entree is $22 (at least with their current deal) The steaks are cooked with skill, the salmon is nice an light. I would recommend anything on the dinner menu with the exception of the chicken and biscuits which I felt were rather heavy and too deconstructed.\n\nService: \nThe waiters and waitresses are all very friendly and know the menu well. They maybe talk about the concept of the restaurant and dishes a bit too much but it's not that imposing \n\nBar:\nAfter being stuck in meetings all day, the sanctuary of your hotel room feels a bit claustrophobic. Instead of watching tv or reading in my room I prefer to go down to the hotel bar and have a drink or two, read, and chat with other out of townees. The bar at district is perfect for that, however it has been rather empty most of the time I have been there, so I can bring a book and enjoy some good drinks. My only complaint would be the DJ they bring in sometimes, at least when I am there the DJ is playing way too loud for the setting. When there are 15 people in the bar sitting around you should not be playing EDM, at the very least play some background trance and turn your volume down a bit.\n\nAmbiance:\nThe ambiance of the restaurant is very modern and spacious, feels a little cold because it is so wide open, but it's not off putting.\n\nOverall:\nIf you are staying in downtown phoenix it is probably the best restaurant among the high rises.", "type": "review", "business_id": "9ziO3NpoNTKHvIKCBFB_fQ"}

I've been here maybe like 4-5 times over the last couple years and the first few times, I thought it was pretty good. I only come here for curry. I usually order the Panang curry and I get it really spicy. I  was in the mood for it yesterday and stopped by for the first time in maybe 6 months or so. My boyfriend and I agreed that they were off their game yesterday.\n\nFirstly, my glass of water tasted funny. It had a weird... sort of floral flavor to it. I thought I was imagining things because my nose was a little congested and I thought my sense of taste was off, but then my boyfriend said that his coke, which was flat, tasted a bit like soap. I'm guessing they didn't rinse out our cups all the way. Next, my curry was all bamboo. I've had curry (and other dishes) where there were a few strips of bamboo in it, but it's not like it's the main part of the dish. My curry yesterday was just a mound of bamboo with sauce that went halfway up the pile. I found a few pieces of green pepper. I asked for chicken in it and I had like 4-5 small pieces. I had to really look for them underneath all the fluff.\n\nThere was just so much bamboo that after eating a few spoonfuls, I had to leave the rest of it. Don't get me wrong, I don't not like it, it's just that it was too much and I thought I got chicken curry, not bamboo with some curry sauce dribbled on top. To top it off, I asked for a 3 (you get to choose the spiciness, 1 through 4 with 4 being the hottest), but it wasn't even remotely hot. It was borderline mild. I remember coming here and starting to sweat over the 3 and 4 (wasn't in the mood for a 4 yesterday), but what I had yesterday felt like nothing.\n\nLastly, the bathroom wasn't terrible, but when I walked in, someone used the sink that was out of order, so it was backed up and full of dirty of water, someone had used up all the toilet paper, and whoever that person was, they didn't bother to flush.\n\nSo not only did I not really enjoy my meal, I couldn't even go piss out some soap water before we left.\n\nI liked this place in the past, but I have reservations about coming back now. I would've given it a 4 before today. Maybe I'll try some other dishes if I ever go back, but I don't think I want to have their curry anymore.", "type": "review", "business_id": "P6HbQnaNOqp9MDgrmbUTRQ"}

There are many restaurant options to choose from which might provide inspiration for your grocery shopping list.  My only complaint is they are primarily Vietnamese (at least 4) cafes to choose from, and one Chinese place.  No Thai, no Korean. I've eaten at 3 of the restaurants- MyLynn cafe, Taiwan Express, and a place to the right of the main entrance which specializes in broken rice, has a crazy name i can't remember, and has seemingly 300 menu items to choose from (!).  MyLynn is my favorite- they have a happy hour, Karaoke, great hot-pot and table barbeque, and crawfish during the weekends flown in from Louisiana.  Selfishly I would like to keep this place a secret so I could keep the crawfish and $2 beer to myself, but they deserve more business and it would be great if more Yelpers would patronize them.  So there, the secret is out.  \"You try, you like, you buy\" (as my Chinese grandmother would say).

Usually dodging around the persistent small gathering of tourists gathered around the Greyfriar's Bobby statue. I imagine this bar often gets a lot of passing trade from said tourists, and locals alike.\n\nThe bar has recently been renovated inside, and the result is a very homely, traditional Scottish pub feel inside. It reminded me immediately of the local village Smiddy pub that my family took me to every Sunday for lunch or dinner (the type that did pate,  steak sandwiches, death-by-chocolate cake. That was my order for a good 12 years). Anyway, I digress. What I mean is, it's homely, it's inviting and not only is it homely, it feels like home. A magic wee trick, where it will both appeal to tourists looking for something very Scottish-y but isn't OTT or a faux-Scottish feel, and instead recreates the cosy Scottish pubs of old.\n\nThere is a very large dining area, for a bar. The bar area itself is quite small and I can imagine would get crowded if many people tried to stay here all at once. So I can imagine they'll be looking more for families for dinner, and larger groups, than a large group of mates all meeting for a pint. But that's just fine. \n\nThe food menu itself is extensive, and I was immediately intrigued by a Crabbie's Ginger Ale glaze on the chicken. Served with a good helping of skins-still-on chips, it was hearty and filling and good, honest, pub fare. The Thai green curry looked delicious, and I heard the prawn and chorizo salad was very spicy (if a little on the small side compared to the other mains).\n\nIf I had my family visiting and in need of a good pub lunch, I wouldn't hesitate to bring them to Greyfriar's. Definitely not a 'tourist trap' or selling out, they've recreated a genuine little pocked of a quieter Scottish lifestyle.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Nq_BMV7kyx9_C3w0Jip6CA"}

They had cute little musical wind up boxes that played Greensleeves and there was even a wind up turtle and spider too. Many of the gifts here are completely unrelated to the optical illusion museum and I even bought myself a soap cat which was supposed to grow hair and when you used it all up a red plastic mouse was supposed to be inside.

But it's nice to find somehwere that settles into a happy medium.\n\nIt's calm inside, even when it's busier. It seems clientele have a common shared interest for wanting to enjoy a quiet drink without too much noise. Their bar menu is nice, with some fancy offerings on the table, but it seems surplus to what the bar is actually about. They sell a good stock of booze, including cheap pints as some of the other reviewers have said. It's hard to come by a pint that's cheap and also tasty these days, but Au Bar manages to come up with the goods.\n\nI'm not sure what market Au Bar is gearing itself towards, but that's not a bad thing at all. It's a very serene place to go that will appeal to people looking for a quiet and intimate night out. It's nice enough to deter a rowdy bunch, and calm enough to steer away from cocktail bar wankery (sorry, it has to be said).

Outstandingly beautiful and peaceful with an attractive array of wildlife, including some very friendly squirrels who will eat out of your hand if you're patient enough - though be warned they will bite if they feel threatened.\n\nThere is a restaurant on the grounds which is ridiculously overpriced and a not inexpensive shop, but the shop is good for souvenirs and if you take a picnic with you there are plenty of places you can enjoy it.  The arboretum is spectacular, though not cheap, but you don't need to visit it to enjoy the gardens and entrance is free.\n\nMy favourite part has to be the Chinese garden with its bamboo and waterfalls, though there are plenty of nooks and crannies to explore and you can easily spend an entire day out there.

We were a party of 4, and we walked in without reservations early in the evening.  We promptly got a table and great service.  The fried lamb starter was amazing, and my friend couldn't even manage a conversation between bites because it was *that* delicious.  They were also very accommodating and allowed us an order of haggis, neeps, and tatties off of the day menu even though we were there in the evening.  The haggis was yummy, and our friends who were trying it for the first time liked it too!  \n\nFor main courses we were all satisfied with our choices.  I found the veg bake a bit bland and greasy from the cheese.  The walnut and apple salad with stilton had quite a generous helping of cheese, which was nice.  I took off a star because while this was great food that hit the spot, it wasn't wow-blow-my-mind good.  It is a good choice for a good quality meal in Edinburgh, though.  Oh, and I'm a sucker for good puddings, but the desserts we ordered (fruit crumble and a frozen parfait) were not particularly memorable.", "type": "review", "business_id": "l5geRDF0zXr6l9A-42z8qQ"}

Again for main courses the fish is also a wise choice, to be honest you won't be disappointed with much on the menu.\n\nThe prices are pretty reasonable and they do a lunch menu for \u00a37.95.

But cast that image from your mind and replace it with a sausage roll the size of your face, oven baked and golden brown, stuffed full of real sausage meat, mustard, oregano and served with a side of chickpeas in a delicious red pesto dressing. The result was 5 minutes of near-silence and glazed eyes as my friends and I had lunch (brunch round 2 if you will) and long drawn out \"oooohhhhmygod\"s. Earthy, my tastebuds thank you.\n\nI was actually sad I didn't have room for the: plum sponge, pecan pie, bacon and french toast with maple syrup, and porridge with apple and plum compote. I wanted it all.\n\nI also spent a large majority of my time looking at all the amazing food, teas, and produce for sale in the shop. The deli cafe is up the stairs, at the back of the store so you (rather cleverly) need to walk past all the food in the shop to get to the cafe. They stock every type of organic brand, home-made, locally sourced Scottish produce you can think of, and there is a huge selection. Most organic or local-Scottish produce stores are quite small, but Earthy is really quite huge, the staff are all really friendly and know what they're talking about from the range of cheeses to the pickles and jams.\n\nThis is probably too long-winded a review but Earthy deserves these extra pixels. Earthy is now my favourite place for Sunday brunch, Wednesday lunch, anytime coffee and cake. FACT.", "type": "review", "business_id": "7yAmxml_awXKadGjYW8SnQ"}

There's not a large city centre with suburbs. There is simply one or two main streets, with lots of 'neighbourhoods' that are self-contained and sufficient, and have a real community feel to them.\n\nWarrender Swim Centre is the epitome of this to me, in the wee 'village' of Marchmont. Tucked up a street, not everyone has heard of it, but going inside at 11am on a Tuesday I found it to be pleasantly busy with students, parents and kids and OAPs. No city slickers, no Olympic athletes. Just a nice mix of people looking for a morning swim, a spot of exercise, some socialising. And every time I've been back it feels that way. It reminds me of the Community Centre in the (literal) village I grew up in. Although obviously with a pool. And gym.\n\nIt has great opening hours. I'm already a member of another gym (*coughEdinburghUniversitycough*) whose pool is only open to the public three hours a day, one hour at a time, with busy waiting times for lanes. Pft. Warrender is pretty much 8 - 6pm with one or two hours a day closed for pool maintenance, schools, or disability swimming. But it's open the rest of the time, \u00a34 a pop without membership, \u00a325 for a month's unlimited access. There's a wee sauna (it is quite wee, but does the trick) and a gym with all the essentials. I really like it.\n\nBy no means would I say to someone living in Leith that is the *the* best swimming pool in the city and they should transfer over directly. It's just a really nice, moderately sized, local community pool. So if you live in the Marchmont, or even Bruntsfield, area it's ideal. And I'd highly recommend it.", "type": "review", "business_id": "UnuHfMm1o3E3P4tpVNJ8fg"}

This place is owned and run by Indian Muslims, so the food is Halal (preparation of the food, but especially meat, is supervised by Imams, usually this means a step cleaner, more humane, than just U.S. Government inspected, but this isn't always true), and they serve beef curries (you won't find this in Hindu establishments, just like you won't find any pork in here).  The minimum critical mass of South Asian customers is in the area thanks to the elite graduate programs of UW-Madison to ensure that any Indian restaurant in this town has to be at least pretty good, and this one is a step up from that.  \n     We first dropped in after a long, cold day of protesting for worker rights, and inexplicably, every other restaurant and bar surrounding the capitol was packed with cold weary protesters, this one was empty, normally a warning sign, but we needed to sit down.  A very helpful Madison police officer (who all seem ridiculously over-educated) recommended the place, but I was a bit leery since he was slim and in good shape, I usually get my better restaurant recommendations from fat cops). What a pleasant surprise, it was dhinchak (wonderful)! \n     The service was traditionally unhurried, the waiter was friendly and polite, and unlike a lot of South Asian Muslim restaurants, quite nice to my consort (my disobedient and independent gori wife, and chief of staff).  The papadum was hot, fresh, and crisp, served with what seemed to be fresh made chutneys, we enjoyed the shrimp curry, chana dal (chickpeas), and palak paneer (a distant cousin of American creamed spinach), make sure you order an Indian bread with your meal (chapati, paratha, nan, they have a good selection).  A nice basmati rice came with the meal, as it should. They have a wide selection of vegetarian dishes, almost a requirement in Madison.\n     The decor is pleasant, though uninspired, nicer than the usual casual Indian joints, but not as elegant as more expensive formal Indian restaurants.  Instead of Indian music, they piped in some annoying Muzak-like smooth \"jazz,\" though at a forgivable background volume. Surprising for a Muslim establishment, they have a good selection of wine and beer, some local, some Indian, there really aren't many places in Wisconsin to have wine from India.  Still, I recommend the Indian beer instead. \n     I highly recommend this restaurant for you firangi types who want to try Indian food, but are leery of the reputed heat of South Indian (Tamil) cuisine, the food here is pretty mild.  Try to eat the food like we do, with your right hand, it tastes better that way.  If you're a Desi bhai who likes your food spicy, know that I wasn't successful in getting them to make my food nice and hot, but in general I've found that Northern Indian Muslim cooking isn't relatively spicy, the food here is quite flavorful, it's not bland, it's just not hot enough.  I did get the waiter to bring me a \"hot sauce,\" a red chillies paste which did have a little bite to it.  Finish your meal with a sweet Indian desert, like galub jamun and masala tea (chai), and don't expect the waiter to come running up with the bill, they employ Indo-Pakistani manners and expect you to relax after eating.  They're pretty attentive though, so they will bring you your check when you signal for it.", "type": "review", "business_id": "KZqtFAwDj83bTXxft2FMjg"}

(Perhaps Muramoto Hildale?)\n\nAs an Asian fusion restaurant, I can highly recommend Muramoto's. Their choices of amuse bouche such as tempura king crab with truffle mayo and foie with peach jam were pretty well balanced and creative. The selections from the raw bar especially the hamachi were very fresh and well composed. (I do question however why they have to torch the hamachi before serving it, hamachi is beautiful completely raw)\n\nI do agree with other Yelpers that this restaurant has fresh fish; however, the way that they choose to exhibit their wonderful offerings in the form of sushi was a bit underwhelming. With such wonderfully fresh fish, the chefs should be able to execute beautiful nigirizushi. Instead they offer interesting maki sushi that may be very fresh, but strangely unbalanced. \n\nThe roll that was strange and completely unbalanced that I tried was the Dante roll. As I said earlier the hamachi was fresh and the combination of tobiko and greens worked well for this roll. What killed this roll, and everything else on the plate was the addition of straight up sriracha artfully squirted under every piece of the roll. Capsaicin spice is VERY different than wasabi spice. I love sriracha when it's appropriate, but the lingering burn of the capsaicin instead of a clean burn from wasabi destroyed the taste of any of the components from the other rolls that we ordered. It is never a good decision to put undiluted sriracha anywhere near sushi. Sushi is a celebration of fish and rice and not supposed to be Ralph from the Simpson's \"it tastes like burning.\"\n\nOne last thing that burned at me the entire time I was sitting at the sushi \"bar\" was that there was no interaction with the sushi chefs. Why spend so much money on a sushi bar setup complete with fridges, fancy knives, and experienced staff when your customers cannot interact and order fish straight from the sushi chefs? If you offer a seat at the \"sushi bar\", then I expect the \"sushi bar experience\"\n\nMuramoto's offers a great selection of playful and fresh bites of Asian fusion cuisine. For those that enjoy more Americanized maki, this place is right up your alley for an intimate date, but for those that want to celebrate fish, rice, and the tradition of enjoying sushi and sake, I would try another place.", "type": "review", "business_id": "u2JMTEY5H0NRk8ZTMkxPGg"}

I did so based off the countless high reviews it had been given on yelp and google.  I started my night off by ordering the beef carpaccio however what arrived was battered fried cheese with a bowl of canned tomato sauce.   I decided to eat this concoction because our waiter was new and clearly nervous.  The appetizer tasted about as good as it looked which i would rate as average at best.   Next we were served out salads, the house and caesar.  Both salads followed right in line with our appetizer, average but severly overdressed.   Our main course consisted of the Linguini ai Frutti di Mare and Meat Ravioli, which our server recommended.  The ravioli was what i would expect from an Olive Garden caliber restaurant.  The Ligunie is where I took offense.  The basic concepts of cooking this dish were missing.  This is my favoite dish and something I consider a staple of a good Italian restaurant.  The pasta was overcooked to a mushy consistency.  The Seafood was generous however was also overcooked.  All of this was served in what appeared to be a tomatoy soup that was filled to the brim of the bowl.  I ate the entire meal with fear I would have this red water in my lap or all over the table. \nI am confused by the numerous high ratings for La Calabria.  I have grown up eating great italian and recently moved to Phoenix.  If my only experience of italian food  was eating Chuck E Cheese I might be more inclined to give 3 stars.   If you are looking for a great Italian meal look elsewhere.", "type": "review", "business_id": "bbcMao703oGQPsZ6wvPirQ"}

The rooms and Prado restaurant have beautiful Tuscan decor and the ROQ and other areas of the resort have a Southwest /  Mexican feel.  It is very well done.  The staff is outstanding, yet inobtrusive.  The rooms are beautiful - combining old and new.  They have gorgeous bathrooms and nice patios / balconies.  The bed is so wonderful that it is hard to get out of it.\n\nMy one and only complaint is the mandatory resort fee which supposedly includes parking, complimentary wireless internet and access to the Joya spa.  We were led to believe that this fee was optional and you could decline it but that was not the case.  We were there one day, did not use the internet, parking or spa.  Also, we ate two meals in Prado, whereas many other guests brought pizza and subs, along with beer and wine, to their rooms and others went to other restaurants in the area.  I feel if you eat in the restaurants and drink in the resort's bars the resort fee should be waived or be included in the daily rate since supposedly all guests have to pay it.\n\nWe are frequent Intercontinental Hotel guests in different cities and have never experienced this add-on fee.  I personally found it insulting and will take this into consideration in the future and stay at a resort that does not have such a fee.", "type": "review", "business_id": "qt_GH5ZBn6xT0CtzNdrvyQ"}

We came to enjoy a low key, relaxed long weekend getaway and that is exactly what we got. The grounds and the resort itself is gorgeous and very well maintained. All of the staff we encountered were super friendly and helpful. \n\nWe stayed in building 16 at the back of the resort with a lovely patio that opens onto grass with a fabulous view of the Camelback Mountains. \n\nWe spent our days at the pool laying out and enjoying the sunshine and the views. I love that even if you aren't getting food or drink service, they bring you a pitcher of water. Such a thoughtful and appreciated touch. The chairs get reserved pretty early on Saturday so as long as you know that and can stake your spot out early it shouldn't be an issue. \n\nWe got breakfast once at Prado and the other days at the newly opened cafe Crave. I much preferred Crave in both quality and price. We ordered delicious margaritas at the pool as well as lunch too. Hugo was our pool server and he was awesome. He always went out of his way to make sure we had everything we need. \n\nWe only left the resort to go to dinner. If you wanted to stay on the resort the entire time you could too- they have everything you need. \n\nI got an 80 minute massage at the Joya Spa too during my stay. The entire spa experience was top notch. A relaxing waiting area, steam and sauna, exclusive access to the private pool reserved for Joya customers on their day of service, not to mention a heavenly massage. My massage therapist was John and I'd highly recommend him. Sure the spa is more expensive than I'd pay pretty much anywhere at home but that's to be expected. \n\nOverall I loved Montelucia and have nothing bad I could even think of to say about it. I'd recommend it to anyone and hope I get a chance to go back!!", "type": "review", "business_id": "qt_GH5ZBn6xT0CtzNdrvyQ"}

My roommates have been eating here about a year. Everyone loves it! I must say this food blows away the Olive Garden which in my opinion is a compliment. I started off on a bad note here because the firts time I ever came here I was picking it up as a 'to-go\" order. It took about 25-30 minutes over how long it was supposed to take. They seemed very busy so I sat around and waited, they seemed very disorganzied with the way the orders are placed. The two people who were running things didn't seem to commincate very well. \n\n#2 experience,\nVery different, getting ready to fly home to California. Decided to grab a bite before my flight we sat at the bar, drinking beers waiting for our yummy italian dishes to come out. The bartender was such a character, he was witty and gave us alot to talk about which really made my night. And he gave us beer for free, what a chill dude. \n\nI really like Off The Strip. \n\nIt's been nothing but excellent. I always order the same thing because I'm so happy I found my perfect meal. Spaghetti with Sausage and Softball Meatball, Bacon wrapped Filet Mignon, and the house salad comes for free. Cheesecake is a must for dessert, and believe me I'm very, very, very picky about cheesecake. It's good enough to cheat on a diet for! \n\nTucked away from all the touristy spots around the strip, this place is a growing family operated establishment, locals loves this cooking. I guess I am one of locals now.", "type": "review", "business_id": "l_qgSgZfarlgVjYy6NybPw"}

Keep in mind that meal portions are smaller than standard restaurant fare, as the restaurant is ultra health conscious and holds true to its suggested portion sized meals.

Understandable. \n\nNext, we order coffee. Cold and tasted like it was out all day. Server seemed annoyed that we wanted hot coffee. Again, sorta understandable since they close in 1 hr. \n\nThe food was pretty good. We ordered: \nSide of bacon-- very crispy and delish \nBelgian Waffle- good, but it came very naked- when placing order we didn't specify whip cream. Server was pissed she had to take it back to kitchen. \nOmelet- Pretty good \nBiscuits and Gravy-- AMAZING! \n2 eggs - Great! \n\nThe omelet came with pancakes and we were scared to ask the server to bring them. Towards the end she did, but blamed the whip cream confusion on the mistake. (Whip cream situation was after all the food was brought out anyways). \n\n$35 for all this. Not shabby. I think the experience would have been better if the server was better. I have been a server before, and I treat all my servers well and I don't send them back every minute. This time we had to. She seemed experienced too. But as a server, the first thing you do is over ask questions so you don't have to run back and forth and irritate the guests. Also, up sell! \"Would you like whip cream on that waffle?\" \n\nAlso, there was only one other table of people in there. Not busy. \n\nWill go back again soon to try it out.

We were looking for something close, good and healthy and Pita Jungle met our criteria. I live around the corner and eat there often. I would not say this is the most authentic food on the planet, but the food is always fresh, affordable and AMPLE! My mom and I could have (and should have) split a pita and left there completely satisfied. She got the gyro and I had a chicken shwarma pita. Both were pretty good (although I prefer to go a mile down the road to Eden's Grill for the real deal, which I did later that night).\nThe atmosphere at Pita Jungle is great. It's very open and the decor is contemporary, music is decent. The patrons seem to be healthy and happy, which adds positively to the ambiance. The service can be hit-or-miss, but overall everyone is friendly, just at times can be a bit slow. \nI recently went there for Happy Hour, which I liked and hated all at the same time. I enjoyed being able to sample several small plates, expanding my experience with the menu, but the portions were minute, which was really surprising/disappointing since everything I've ever had there is ridiculously over-sized.  While it was fun to taste some new things, it was a bad value and I likely won't return for another Happy Hour. \nOverall, it's convenient, has a nice atmosphere and is fresh and healthy. I think it's well above average, but again, when I have a craving for real middle eastern fare, I would just assume running a bit further down the road for some more authentic food.", "type": "review", "business_id": "wl51t6lT7leiX64SlkOx6g"}

These places typically do not come with the white glove treatment.

This is seriously one of the dumbest things I've ever read on Yelp. She then tries to shore up her ignorance by stating that her friends are Texans. \n\nAnother common theme with the lower star ratings seems to be with the sauce. Some people tend to feel the sauce was too \"watery.\" I'm really not a fan of the KC style sauce but I understand if that is your thing. I guess I'm just not a fan of covering a pile of slow cooked pork with a ton of super sweet and thick sauce. Instead I chose to review Bryan's for what they do extremely well, and that's prepare a phenomenal pulled pork sandwich. Plenty of smoky flavor (sorry Donna), tender, delicious bits of smoky bark, not over sauced, juicy, and on a nice soft bun that doesn't get in the way of the meat. They also feature a nice selection of premium craft beers. I'm a happy man when I come here.\n\nLook people, it is obviously your right to say whatever you want on here (god bless America.)

First and foremost the price seemed pretty high for what they put on the table. This is not the best of what peruvian food has to offer. 3 people ate for almost $100.00. They brought a bread to the table that was stale, very poor quality and that should have been a warning which we did not heeded, they just heated the old bread and presented the offering with no shame. The ceviche was below par. We also had the mussels with their fresh salsa on top and that dish did not impress anyone. Tried the causa and it lacked the authenticity of taste that distinguishes this dish. One of our group had the \"arroz con pollo\" (cilantro based rice with two squalid pieces of chichen) and got a whole lot of rice with almost no chicken. The other had \"pescado sudado\" (poached fish) and even though edible it was not great. I had fish with a shrimp sauce which was acceptable but not great. I do understand that this is a special type of cuisine but like anything in life there are peruvian restaurants that are far superior in quality and taste and for the money it just did not ring any bells. Wanted to like it for we go constantly to Las Vegas but compared to the top ones in Los Angeles this one fell way short of the mark. The place was semi-empty at around 6PM, (something that never happens at \"El Rocoto\" in LA which is always buzzing with activity and you can feel the energy in the air) and the kitchen had absolutely no movement. This is definitely not a top choice and do beware of the high prices, which we wouldn't mind at all if the food was worth it. I give it an average 3 Stars and perhaps the reviews I saw in urbanspoon.com are written by people that hasn't had the very best of peruvian food or perhaps even relatives for I seriously contest this restaurant to be anywhere near a 5 Star eatery. Save your money and when in Los Angeles do go to \"El Rocoto\" (just google it) and you will enjoy every minute of it compared with this bland, uneventful take on peruvian food.  The reason I used \"El Rocoto\" as an example is because this is one place that never fails to deliver fresh, authentic and delicious peruvian food and every time I've gone there it always crowded and like everyone should know the more crowded the place the fresher the food because it is always being consumed, no room for food to grow stale or to be re-heated in worst scenarios. Top of the line Chefs from Peru doing what they do best. 3 Stars for Mi Peru.", "type": "review", "business_id": "JBqnbJyOA2q_wtJ8xuWvUQ"}

There's a huge disco ball above a relatively standard size dance floor with some strobe lights coming from the bar, also hitting on the live band playing cover songs from the 80's to now - mostly rock and pop songs. The crowd was everything from mid 20's to late 50's. \n\nMy friend and I easily got a spot by the bar which was nice. Although there was a lot of free seating inside and outside. Inside there are two bars, one underneath the platform of the live band/stage and another bar in the back where it's quieter and away from the dance floor as well. There's also a third bar outside, a huge one at that, with lots of seating at and around the bar. \n\nThe food was phenomenal, shared the Beef Tenderloin and Apple Tart ala Mode. My friend had some drinks which tasted great. But both the food and drinks are extremely pricey. To get in, the cover for ladies was $5, which I found funny since it's more of a restaurant anyway than a nightclub like Maya or Mint in old town haha. There's tons of police at the front which was comforting. \n\nThe bathrooms were stunning, granite and marble throughout and extremely clean!

But it's also more chill and relaxed than a traditional dance club or nightclub because it does serve food and has more seating and areas for conversation rather than investing in a large dance floor (more of a makeshift let's move some tables out of the way). A cute transformation of restaurant gone nightclub.

I opted for the healthy option since I was going hiking a few hours later, but I'm sure i will indulge in the infamous french toast eventually... when I'm wearing my comfy and forgiving sweat pants.\n\nthe coffee was superb as well.. self serve beverage area makes it so much more convenient to refill your java.\n\nGreat place, nice people, easy to spot location, yummy food, decent prices... Scramble is an instant fave.", "type": "review", "business_id": "XHr5mXFgobOHoxbPJxmYdg"}

And whenever possible, I try to find a good one wherever I go. \n\nI have to say, my wife found this place. She told me it had four stars and a lot of reviews, I was sold.\n\nHere's the rundown. \nTom Yum Shrimp - it was a super cold day again, so a hot soup was the perfect remedy for that. Love this soup. I was  craving the sourness from the lemongrass flavored soup. The mushrooms & shrimp were very good. But what set this Tom Yum from the others I've had was the cherry tomato. Never had that in this soup before and it worked so well. The pop in your mouth was a flavor explosion, delicious. \n\nSatay Chicken - it was just okay. It was lacking in flavor IMO. Even with the satay sauce. The cucumber salad it came with was outstanding. \n\nLemon Chicken - I never had lemon chicken at a Thai place before. Usually I find this dish at a Chinese restaurant. But I have to say, I am a fan of this dish. The lemon flavor really stands up to the deep fried battered chicken the sauce was in. \n\nPanang Pork - I usually get Panang beef. Having pork even though it was very good. I still prefer the beef. The panang curry was outstanding. \n\nPineapple Fried Rice - it was good. Chunks of pineapple and cashew nut pieces all over the dish. As for the flavor, it was just ok for me. \n\nPad See Ew - my wife's favorite Thai noodle dish. It's a good dish, but it didn't have the burnt wok (in a good way) taste we are accustomed to at our regular Thai spot. Still very good. \n\nI love spicy food, but on this trip we have a bunch of kids so the heat index was dialed down quite a bit. The pickled serrano chilies help a lot. You can request it and they have them in tiny cups to go. \n\nThis was a solid Thai restaurant. I'm rating this a 3.5 Stars and rounding up. \n\nI'll definitely be back.", "type": "review", "business_id": "52ThhgAweE-ZOhj8ugjS0w"}

I think the hotel still needs some time to run its operation smoothly.\n\nPros:\n- Decor was contemporary.  Everything was new.\n- High tech features in the rooms.  You can choose to open the curtain, turn on the TV with a specified channel, and turn on all the lights when you set the alarm clock.

We walked pass the elevator banks a couple of time because they are hidden behind the chocolate shop.\n- The layout was not clear.  We did not know that there was another side of the casino hidden behind the Players Club until after we checked out.\n- No covered walkway from Aria to Crystals Shopping Center.

Picked it up, done. \n\nWhen we got home, we realized the receipt from the reception desk did not in fact remove the charges for the 1 free night as the TV had indicated.  No problem, call to get it remedied. \n\nThey acknowledged the problem and proceeded to remove the charge.  Turns out, they actually ADDED one additional night and we had to call to remove that charge along with the first overcharge. \n\nReview your receipts carefully!!!

We really liked this hotel a lot.  The hotel is smaller than the other resorts around which makes it quicker to check in and also short walks to the elevators.  Great trendy decor throughout the hotel.  We had a corner suite on the 5th floor.  Had a great view of the street and city center complex.  Staff was friendly and service was fast.  Fridge and Kurig coffee maker were a plus.  Only downside to this hotel is it is on the backside of city center and getting to the strip is a bit of a chore.  Not having a casino was not a big deal as Aria was a 2 minute walk away.  My only complaint that takes away a star is the AC in my room.  No matter what I set it to it never got cooler than 74.  We had two other guests that were with us and their rooms would cool down into the 60's.  It may have been that having large windows on 3 sides of our room and that they faced towards the west caused the room not to cool properly.  Might be something they should look at.  Also a fan in the bedroom would have been nice to.  Overall I would definitely return to this hotel.", "type": "review", "business_id": "WIlklz81DcJkUWJThbnJbQ"}

I personally like Thai flavors on my pizza, even peanut sauce, my friend not so much, says she prefers that kinda thing cold. \nThe service was just so-so. I asked for water with lemon. Then I had to ask 3 more times for the lemon. I should be used to this by now bc this always happens to me at every restaurant even though I always ask for \"water with lemon please\" when they ask what I want to drink. I think I need to just start bringing my own lemon with me everywhere. Then we also asked what spices were in the Lebni cheese appetizer & she said she really didn't know but would find out.

Around the holidays the wait gets to around 3 hours and I've actually been rejected from lining up once because it was so full. \n\nNow on to the food. The buffet serves a wide variety of foods from standard American fare (fried chicken, prime rib, mashed potatoes), to Asian (pad thai, stewed oxtails, sushi), to European ( pasta, pizza, antipastos). Though some items are passable, most of the things served are decently prepared and cooked properly. The fried chicken is crunchy and hot, the pad thai noodles are cooked to a perfect al dente,  etc. In the end, they have a great selection without sacrificing much quality.\n\nThe free drinks are awesome here, you can have beer on tap or wine with your meals. They sometimes even have creamed sodas which are pretty good. The beer is decent (most are light ales) and the wine is pretty good (if you can chug down Charles Shaw you wouldn't mind the stuff they serve). \n\nThe desert bar is also stacked with many dessert pastries and also comes decked out with a full on gelato bar. There's even a coffee machines where they can add Bailey's Irish Cream free of charge to it. The desserts are sweet and all very good, and the gelatos are bold and intense tasting (just like the Wynn buffet). \n\nDefinitely worth checking out despite the long trek out here and the long waits", "type": "review", "business_id": "vxxMqBaAHuWdx4impsLSSA"}

We asked where they wanted to go and they suggested the Studio B Buffet at the M Resort, Spa and Casino in Henderson.  It is about 10-15 min south on the Strip from Mandalay Bay and Airport, which was perfect for us since we had to catch our flight after lunch.\n\nThe lunch on M-F is $15.99 and dinner on M-Th is $23.99.  Friday seafood dinner and the weekend seafood brunch and dinner is $39.99.  With this price, included are several beers on tap, root beer on tap and a selection of wine.  Also, the price charged INCLUDED tax as well. \n\nWe were promptly seated and the waiter came by and took our drink orders.  \nThey have an extensive selection of salads.  All the ones that I tried were fresh and delicious.\n\nThe carving station had tri-tip, turkey, ham and rotisserie chicken.  Tried the beef and ham and both were moist and very good. The crawfish, paella, and the steamed clams and mussels were good.  The BBQ ribs were tender.  From the Asian station, tried the kalbi ribs and oxtail soup were both delicious. The limited sushi selection was the only let-down.  The rice was on the hard side, which meant they have been sitting there for awhile.  \n\nOn to desserts.  They had an extensive selection of various cakes, cookies, flans, pies, cheesecakes, desserts in cups, custard balls, cannolis, macaroons and a very nice selection of sorbets/gelatos.  Also, they have a coffee bar and you can get a cappuccino, latte, and mochas. \n\nOverall, this is a very good to excellent buffet.  For $15.99 for lunch with includes beer and wine and tax, it is a great value.  Since it is off the Strip, it was not crowed.  But I think once the word gets out, the crowds will be coming.  I would rate this buffet 4.5 stars.\n\nWish we had more time to enjoy more of the buffet.  But we will for sure make the Studio B Buffet a stop on our next visit to Vegas.", "type": "review", "business_id": "vxxMqBaAHuWdx4impsLSSA"}

The bread basket service was a nice touch and pleasant suprise. We  really enjoyed the olive bread and raisin bread but all were pretty good.  For entrees we order Capalinni  and Osso Bucco. Both had very nice presentation and tasted very fresh. The food was good. Wine selection by the glass is decent but not large. They have some nice selections.  For desert we had Tiramisu and Gelato. But looks great but were just slightly above average.  If cost was not a factor I would give Marinilli's a solid 4 stars but since it is pricey for Italian I expected more. For a nice place if you like the ambiance I would suggest Pane Vino. For food alone Nora's tops the list and Lucio is right behind it. Much better than Nove at Palms though.

We had to wait for 20 minutes for our table, but we were given one of those vibrating, light-flashing coasters to let us know when our table was ready, so we went outside to wait and people watch until our table was ready.  Awesome dry desert heat, interesting people, and view.\n\nWe got a great booth and the service was awesome.  I asked if I could apply both gift cards to our total bill and he said of course I could. Win! :) The meals were reasonably priced and took about 15-20 minutes to get to our table.  We all ordered something different and I was hankering for some noodles.  Not sure what I ordered but I think it was deep friend noodles that were then stir fried.  What was I thinking...Anyway, the sauce was thick and the meal sat heavy in my tummy.  The food wasn't super duper in my book, but then I've only had one dish there so far.  Nothing super spectacular about the food that we ordered but we loved the restaurant, location, and service.  You can't beat that!  Oops, wait.  My friend ordered a shrimp dish that was actually fresh and delicious looking.  I will definitely go to PF Changs again to give it another try and we have one here in Seattle.  Next time I will try something less fried.

Note that the taco I had was rather greasy and I didn't necessarily like that part of it. \n\nConsidering the airport generally sucks for any meal option for the vegetarian/vegan, 360 definitely helps even out the equilibrium. In relation to other airport establishments I'd give 360 a 5 star review. But in relation to other restaurants, 360 would have to get a 3. \n\nI have to say that my tofu breakfast taco with a Caramel Macchiato from Starbucks made this flight a lot more bearable. \n\n(360 is located near the B gates - Southwest)", "type": "review", "business_id": "1dnarzaw3bwFrK38hldi_Q"}

As it was, you could easily have a bottle of a $30 central CA Syrah next to a $200 Bordeaux next to a $40 NZ Sauv Blanc.  because of this, i felt less inclined to sample many wines as i would have liked because it made tasting from say, lighter bodied to fuller bodied, incredibly difficult without having to do multiple laps around the floor.\n\nbesides this (relatively significant to me) issue, i kinda liked it.  we ended up doing a not so cheap (i know its Vegas, but you're 5 miles from Mandalay) flight of 3 different kinds of bubbly for $25, with obviously measured 2oz pours, of which the most expensive bottle in the flight probably retails for $35-40 normally.\n\nthe Grape has a lot of good things going for it, but if the prices (on the flights and by the glass) were toned down just a tad, and it was better organized i'd be a much bigger fan.  as it is, the next time i visit M i'll definitely stop by to see whats changed, but i doubt i'll taste or drink anything there, which is a shame.", "type": "review", "business_id": "CR4rAbV2-3Or0Z-Qb6bQsQ"}

I hear the one at the M is also top of the line (and also where many pros hang out), but I haven't had a chance to check it out just yet. \n\nPositives: \n- Tons of HD TVs and two huge screens (one that shows the main events and the other that shows horse racing)\n- Comfortable seating - There are many seats where you will have your own screen with access to all the sports channels and horse races.  During busy days such as college football Saturdays and NFL Sundays, most of the seats are reserved.  If you are staying at the hotel, just let them now you want a spot reserved at the sports book, and they will set you up.  \n- Great betting odds - I spent about three weeks in Vegas recently and the odds were favorable compared to MGM and many others. \n- Overall comfort - It's at the Wynn...what else is there to say?  \n- The Cocktail Waitresses (not that it matters if you are with your wife or girlfriend...) - Very friendly and gorgeous.  They are always attentive, even during busy days.  \n\nNegatives: \n- The main reason I don't want to give 5 stars is because of the drink ticket situation.  These guys are cheap asses.  I've heard that you need to bet $200-$300 for just one drink ticket, but I don't know what the answer is.  I never got a drink ticket for betting under $200, but there were times I would bet $500-$600 and I wouldn't get anything.  Maybe I should have asked, but if I place a decent bet, I shouldn't have to ask for a drink ticket. \nAfter I cashed out a few grand one time, I was tempted to tell the manager that I could now buy hundreds of his drink tickets and he should stick them up his ass.  But of course I didn't because I didn't have the balls to, and besides this complaint, the workers and managers are actually really friendly...  \n\nOverall, if you are looking for a great place to hang out, drink, and watch/bet on sports, the Wynn sports book is one of the best places to head to.", "type": "review", "business_id": "xXAKgohFaXGdQddKbzAbYA"}

Needless to say, when the time came to use the groupon, we were disappointed to realize our mistake. Even more so when I looked the restaurant up on yelp and read all the numerous negative reviews and complaints. But the money had already been spent and a week ago we found ourselves in the area. So we stopped in.\n\nWell, I'm happy to say that for once, Yelp was wrong. My expectations were low and when we first stepped through the doors, there was no hostess at the stand. I had enough time to think \"Yup, here we go\" when the hostess walked over from the main room to politely seat us.  She sat us and Amanda, our server, came over almost immediately to greet us and take our drink orders which were promptly served a few minutes later. We took our time to order and the food, once delivered in a timely fashion, was tasty and flavorful.  Everyone was polite including the busboy who helped keep our table clean and our drinks full.\n\nOf course, the place isn't perfect. The audio from the TV was far too loud (a football game with commercials competed with our conversation). The prices were a bit steep too.  I also think it's ridiculous when a Mexican restaurant wants to charge for chips and salsa.  Even Baja Fresh gives them for free.\n\nI don't think I would go out of my way to eat here again but if I found myself in the area, I would definitely consider stopping in.", "type": "review", "business_id": "jtqPBGcsvmKI7VeHLG0KsQ"}

Sadly, I don't think this dream will come true anytime soon, but because of that I cherish anytime I get a spa day and I'm pleased that my visit to Agave Spa was everything I hoped it would be!\n\nThe Westin Kierland itself is gorgeous and flawless, but it has more of a concrete decor feel to it. It doesn't have the Old Phoenix feel to it like some, but it's clean, gorgeous and flawless just the same. The Agave Spa has just the same feel. \n\nWalking in, I immediately caught wind of the delicious signature scent of the spa. It smelled so good, I wanted to put the scent in my bag and keep it with me at all times. The staff was extremely friendly right off the bat and quickly showed us to the ladies locker room to get us settled. I like to arrive to the spa as early as possible in order to enjoy as much time there as possible. \n\nOnce I was settled in, I first used the gym to feel better about the pampering I would be doing later. As hard as it is to actually work out on a spa day, it makes me feel so much better and I've added it to my spa routine. But, I make sure I do it when I first arrive. The gym is refreshing because it overlooks the pool. The treadmill is state of the art, offered me way more options than I needed and even had a tv built inside. After my workout, it was time for the massage. The 50 minutes massage was just what the doctor ordered! The masseuse was friendly but not overly chatty which I really appreciate in a masseuse. The room felt refreshing and the music was soothing. The only problem I had with the room was that it was a little too bright for my liking, but then they put a scented mask on my eyes which helped. \n\nAfter my heavenly massage, we continued our girls day out and winded down in the jacuzzi, ordered lunch and drinks while we laid out at the tranquil adult's-only pool and used every amenity the spa had to offer. I decided to shower at the spa because the showers are gorgeous with the popular Westin shower heads and delicious Kai products. They even offer limeade in addition to water and tea to quench your thirst. The entire day was tranquil, relaxing and an excellent way to cool off during the extreme heat. If I could, I would have purchased every Kai Fragrance product they were selling, but the pocketbook wouldn't allow. It's officially on my wish list though! \n\nI will end with a special tip to all my fellow locals out there. Every Wednesday, they offer discounts for local residents including 30% off spa services and 20% off spa products!

Our favorites of what we ordered were the grilled scallops, the garbanzo beans with chorizo & the cold red potato salad (not the one with tuna). Oddly, the low point of the 6 dishes we ordered was the Spanish olives; I love these when we are in Europe, but have never had any in the US that aren't over-salted & under-flavored. The table next to us ordered the cold mussels & we wished we had tried them, too (next time). The service was excellent- attentive but not intrusive. The other highlight of the evening was the music- The Sweet Tooths! We had never heard them before, but when we got home & looked them up on MySpace & YouTube we may be in the minority. If you have never heard them (also known as Bronson & Preston Taalbi), remedy that IMMEDIATELY. You don't have to like Spanish or flamenco guitar (but I bet you will after you hear them), because they intersperse that with guitar standards like Clapton, Santana, & Stairway to Heaven. We will definitely go back to Tapas Rias & will probably break a traffic law or two if we hear The Sweet Tooths are there.", "type": "review", "business_id": "girHOrL-3_pZGw7INEoehQ"}

While the architecture, and the fact that it is tightly linked with the genius that is Frank Lloyd Wright, is worth at least a night's stay, the overall experience is somewhat confusing and a mish-mash forcing one to ponder whether one has experienced an elite bastion of resort history or a dying emblem of what might have been. \n\nI stayed at the Ocatilla -- the \"hotel within a hotel.\"  The room was well-appointed and delightfully lush compared with my friends' off-the-rack accommodations which appeared somewhat worn and needing refurbishment.  \n\nAs part of the Ocatilla, one is promised amenities such as a shoe-shine and pressing service.  None of which was ever offered, nor seemed realistically obtainable.  \n\nThe Ocatilla executive club room was tightly guarded. Indeed, when my room key would not open the club room door, I was asked for my name and room number and I was somewhat humbled that I just might have entered under dubious circumstances.  The offerings for breakfast were carbohydrates only, with an exception for yogurt in a martini glass.  And I did see at least two gusts bring in their own cereal. \n\nThe swimming pool near my room, one of several on the property, was delightful.  As I'm not much for Phoenix sunlight, we reveled in the salt water pool at night.  With few people present, it was a great deal of fun and was by far the most fun I've had in a while. \n\nThe spa was not so delightful.  The men's locker room was eery, with lockers being close to the door.  To walk into such a small area with retiree genitalia flailing may be entertaining to some, but can be somewhat disturbing for those with higher expectations.  The attendants that were on staff ranged from over-reaching (acceptable) to a too-young apprentice who I overheard talking with a loud-mouthed receptionist about the horrors of toilet paper remnants lodged in women's pubic hair.  While anyone able to afford the high prices should be strong, who among us should be that strong? \n\nThe spa's manicurist was terrific.  I just wished there would have been a more private area in which to have my hooves trimmed.  Passersby were gawking through the windows and it reminded me of a cheap Asian nail establishment in the Indianapolis mall. \n\nMy overall experience memory stems from my initial check-in experience.  The Waldorf sent an E-mail after I had made my reservation that said that, if available, when I checked in I could spend an additional  $20 to be upgraded.  When I mentioned this to the desk clerk she had no idea what I wa talking about and said: \"Well, you already have an Ocatilla executive room.\"  Though I was silent, my reply should have been: \"Honey, if you told me I could have something a little better for twenty bucks, then make it happen.\"  Oversold.  Under-delivered. \n\nThat I was with friends a week after my mother's death was cool.  But the physical experience was lacking.  My opinion only, but I think this property was built for a timeless level of service that time and numbed expectations will deny her.", "type": "review", "business_id": "5Feaj6aixO_QxKFnkHf3xg"}

I ordered the shredded beef (red sauce) classic.  The meat was very tasty and the sauce had a smoky flavor to it, that I enjoyed, though I would call it mild, maybe medium at best.

I frequently change my hair going from light to dark and short to long, and she gets it right every single time.

I have recommended her to many of my friends, all of which have been super happy with her services, as well.  On top of it, she is so sweet and down to earth, it's easy to sit in her chair for longer services.  I even bring my daughter in now for haircuts, and she loves her!

After reading the reviews we were both very much looking forward to the meal/experience.\n\nI'll begin by stating the service was \"top-notch\".  Probably one of the best I have ever had in my 36+ years.  Our dinner reservation was on the early side, 6:30pm as we had a 9pm show and wanted to allow enough time.  We arrived on time and were promptly seated at a very private table for two towards the back of the restaurant.  The restaurant itself is very attractive in a dark, purple sultry type of way.  Now with that out of the way, the reason we went here in the first place... the food.\n\nUnfortunately this is where I truly feel, it was just \"ok\".  If I'm putting down over two bills for dinner, I want to at some point be blown away by the entire meal, or atleast one of the items experienced.  Once seated and having reviewed the drink menu, we started with our drinks.  I was in a beer mood so went with the Sierra Nevada on draught, and the gf went with a pino grigio.  When the drinks arrived, my beer was only half-full and was issued an apology that the draught system is having problems, and I would need to select a beer off the bottle menu.  Not the way I was looking to start off the meal.  After going with a different selection and review of the dinner menu, I opted for the 4 course chef tasting and the gf went with the halibut.\n\nThe choice of bread was good, as we both went with the bacon infused and the amuse that arrived was just \"ok\".  Some sort of jelly that was pretty much tasteless.\n\nMy first course was the beef tartar which was good and a decent enough portion to share a significant amount.  The second course was the scallops.  They were cooked fine, but honestly the portion size was a bit ridiculous.  Two very very tiny scallops.  I mean verrrry tiny.  Third course was the 48 hour beef belly.  LET DOWN.  This was about 98% pure fat.  Pretty much inedible.  As normal the course was brought with a separate meat knife.  Unfortunately the only use was to try and find any meat at all in an entire plate full of fat.  Even writing this review now, i can't believe that was served as one of the courses in an $80 4 course menu.  The fourth course was a warm carrot cake with cream cheese ice-cream.  I'm not the biggest carrot cake fan, but the gf is and I didn't much care for the other dessert option.\n\nThe gf had the halibut for her main course.  It was a nice piece of fish, however, when you drop close to $50 for a piece of fish, what you don't want to hear is \" it's good, but I can do this just as good at home\".  Problem was that she was right.  There was nothing spectacular or anything to set this dish apart from a very fresh piece cooked at home.\n\nWould I eat here again...no.  Would I recommend anyone else to go who has only a brief period of time to experience vegas dining....no.  Was this meal worthy of the number that arrived on the bill... not even close.\n\nHad two very good meals at the same exact price point while out there the last three nights ( Tao, Emeril's ), and unfortunately Sage was quite a let down when it came to the food.", "type": "review", "business_id": "OiCxoAIoBvEWxf7p1qVVmA"}

We paid around $37 per person and I don't feel like it was anything special. The waitress was nice, but very slow even though the place wasn't even packed. It was amazing how slow they were and it was pretty stupid since another waitress passing by could not serve us, she had to hunt down our waitress to refer our request to her. Even for just a simple refill. Talk about inefficient and slow! \n\nThe food wasn't really unique or tasty, nothing really stood out. I would go to the Belagio buffet for better stuff and seafood. There were however a good selection of meats (prime rib, ny steak, lamb, etc). The thing that turned me off was the food manager who was throwing an absolute piss fit. Yea, sure the table was messy, but he was yelling at the chef right in front of the customers in line. Talk about total humiliation and making yourself look like a jerk. When you're pissed it shows and people tend to avoid pissed off people or think differently about them. \n\nEnd: \n\nOverall, I wasn't impress and I didn't get sick.

The Atlantic Salmon was pretty decent. The desserts are probably the best feature of the buffet.\n\nThe omelet station is a bit... interesting? The omelet station shares a space with the Mexican section. I asked for cilantro in the omelet, which is the FIRST thing next to the omelet czar. She tells me that \"too many people are allergic to cilantro, so we cannot do that. The pans are not cleaned out in between omelets.\"\n\nMy parents are vegetarians that eat eggs. My mom was standing next to me, so i inquired about how ham, bacon & sausage can make it on omelets. What if someone wants a vegetarian omelet? She says \"That's different. No one will get sick from eating meat.\" I honestly felt like walking away from the stupid omelet while the lady reams me up one side and down the other over how ham and bacon in an omelet is much different than cilantro. She would have gotten a $2.00 tip from me. I'm certain it was worth it for her to chew me out than give me 2\u00a2 worth of cilantro.\n\nFor the dessert, they had one of my favorites, lemon meringue pie. However, they were only serving it in Sugar-Free. My family does not do aspartame. I asked if they have regular lemon meringue, the employee tells me it is all the same and to just take that. They will put out the sugared version later. \n\nSo, I suppose Jews & Muslims who do not eat pork will not get offended by eating an omelet from someone just before them that ordered a ham & bacon omelet? But if I ask for cilantro on top of my omelet, the CDC will come in and quarantine the whole place for allergies? \n\nSo, we have people that believe sugared desserts and sugar free are essentially the same, and an omelet person who believes it is ok to make a bacon & ham omelet, not wash the pan, and ask the Jewish man what omelet they would like... and argue loud enough over cilantro to have the YelpWorld wonder WTF.\n\nIf it was priced at more than $7.00 for the buffet, I'd have been offended. I suppose if you just want some cheap eats and have some dessert afterwards, it ends up being cheaper than IHOP. However, there are hundreds of better places to go get breakfast.", "type": "review", "business_id": "RUz4d1D83xRRXcc-ffkM5g"}

OMG it was!\n\nFrom my first conversation over the phone with Tomi Sue, I had a great feeling about what our dining experience was going to be like. Tomi Sue was exceptionally friendly, professional, and accommodating to our group's needs. Thanks for substituting in the walnut shrimp- as it turned out, it was the overwhelming favorite of the evening!  The rest of the food was delish (watermelon/arugula salad the other crowd pleaser) and plentiful!\n\nFrom the hostesses, to the servers, and the cooks (who came out to pose for pictures)...EVERYONE seemed to LOVE ther job at FIRST and that made a lasting impression on us all.\n\nFor our fixed menu I knew a penis cake was coming but I had no IDEA it would be so elaborate, 3 dimensional, and might I add, eh hem, detail oriented (use your imagination). We will never forget the look on our bride's face when that cake arrived! \n\nOther little doses of amazingness included the free pictures in the photobooth, the super sweet cotton-candy martinis and the restaurant's flexibility in pushing back our reservation time.\n\nBravo to FIRST for delivering a most thorough dining experience.

Very clean, which is always a plus.  To me frozen yogurt is a category all on it's own.  The taste and texture are different than ice cream.  I personally will take Frozen Yogurt or Gelato over ice cream any day.  There are several flavors to choose from with some that stay static while others are switched out to keep it interesting.  I would like it if they changed these transient flavors more often.  If I remember right it was pineapple that rocked my world, but I haven't seen it since.  Pistachio is also very good.  Wonderful variety of toppings.  I usually opt for the coconut, white chocolate chips, and some fresh fruit.  I put the fun stuff on for my kiddos.  Price is per ounce. \n\nThey have specials/discounts written on a blackboard.  There's also a card you can get where after 9 punches the 10th Frozen Yogurt is free.  Fills up quickly for us since it's a family event when we go to Yogurt Jungle.  There's a refrigerator with prepackaged yogurt.  As others have mentioned free use of two computers and wi-fi.  My 2.5 yr old and I love the kid sized table and chairs that they have inside by the windows.  Makes it more fun for him.  \n\nOverall a fabulous place to have a treat.  Our family loves it.  We would go more often if we could, but the price is a tad expensive for us and that prevents it from being a more frequent outing.", "type": "review", "business_id": "FM9Wf69gZS2nHbgnGlh6mw"}

I had an appointment with Shawn and when I first got there it was like I was invisible, it took about 5 minutes for someone to let me know when Shawn was going to be ready and then I had to sit on the bar stools for another 5 minutes waiting for him. The front desk area is very small and congested and I felt very uncomfortable with the number of people standing around me waiting to pay.\nOkay so then once I was seated with Shawn he asked me how I would like my hair, I told him to cut off NO more than an inch because I have been growing out my hair for 5 years now and I hate it when I tell someone I want a light trim and they go crazy. Well he didn't really listen either and took off a good 2-3 inches, which I was not happy about. \nThen I showed him a picture of how I would like my hair done, I wanted my hair to have an ombre, so dark on the top and gradually get lighter and l had a picture that I showed him of exactly how I wanted it. I even put it as my lock screen on my phone so that he could look at it whenever he needed to, to go off of it. Well he didn't look at it again after I showed him the first time and it probably would've helped him more if he did. \nTo make the rest of the story short, he messed up my hair. It wasn't anything like the picture, it was too high up and it was completely all orange, it didn't gradually go from dark to light, it was just all solid orange.\nHe thought that it looked amazing, so gorgeous, blah blah blah. When someone messes up on my hair, I expect them to man up to it and say something like \"We are going to get your hair to how you want it, come back next week so we can fix it, no charge\"\nI will not be going back to this salon.", "type": "review", "business_id": "mlgD0zcqkWdGBzX97NS-8g"}

Although, they always seem to be understaffed here no matter how many people are there, so on occasion you might have a bit of a wait time on a refill.\n\nAt the bar they have all of your Irish favorites on tap, and the happy hour special for drinks is great. Buy one get one on all drafts...not just the cheap crap. They have also been running a check in special recently where if you check in while you are there you get a shot of Jameson for $1.\nOK...so 2 Harp's for $5......Check\n1 shot of Jameson for $1.....Check\nNow I was in need of some food. They have a great happy hour menu and reverse happy hour menu late night.\n\nAs you look over the menu I have to recommend one thing: \nTHE ROUND REUBEN...What's that you ask...Well, you take the ingredient's of a reuben sandwich then you roll it into 4 or 5 balls, then batter it in the same batter you would do fish and chips, and then you deep fry those little guys and serve them with a side of Thousand Island, (and I always add a side of Buffalo sauce on the side as well as the vinegar helps cut the oily, fatty, fried taste.)\nIf you are thinking to yourself \"wow that sounds like a heart attack.\" You're right...but there are few things on this earth that go better with beer.\nI've also had their wings, and the fish and chips. I'd give the fish and chips probably 3 stars, but the wings are some of the best i've had anywhere in town.\n\nThey have a trivia night, a karaoke night (which tends to play more towards the alt rock, metal crowd) and a dozen other random nights, and events.\nSo...unless you are on ANY type of diet...give this place a try, but like I said it's a different bar every time, so who know's what you will walk into", "type": "review", "business_id": "3C84uawGg_icNH4BNiSmjQ"}

LA Fitness is exactly A-OK. For the price of the membership, I feel that I get exactly what I pay for: a solid, in and out, calorie burning experience with maybe a class or two thrown in here and there. \n\nI've been going to LA Fitness for about four years now. I only ever visit this one. I had a brief stint with the one on McDowell, but this Wildcat felt more at ease away from the ASU gym hangout. Like I mentioned, the membership is decently priced, even with a budget. The equipment is A-OK. It's not top of the line, but it's rarely broken. I will run on the treadmill for 20 more minutes if they ever get ones with TVs built in! \n\nI really only go to LA Fitness for cardio, but the free weights overtake much of the gym and they have a large selection of bikes, treadmills and ellipticals. Even during the busy time aka gymaholic's happy hour, I always seem to find a treadmill relatively quickly. \n\nThe classes at LA Fitness deserves another star to the review. They have spot on classes! I rotate between spinning, kick boxing, pilates and most recently Zumba. I love them all! The teachers are energetic and kick my butt, the music is fast paced and motivating, and the class agenda stays current. \n\nThe bathroom and locker room is very nice with enough space for a small army of weight-loss hungry gym goers. I pass by the sauna and the pool and while I've never tried either, they look appealing. I always tell myself I should swim more, but haven't made it to this pool yet. The last two highlights for this gym would be the day care classes they offer and the brand new juice bar. I have no idea if the day care is yay or nay, but it was worth mentioning. And be warned, bottles of H20 are a whopping $2,00. Yikes! \n\nSo I suggest LA Fitness if you're like me and use the gym to focus on working out and look for a workout of getting in, getting your sweat on and getting out in a reasonable amount of time.", "type": "review", "business_id": "wum4pbf9mlYt1g8gJzfG2A"}

I ordered takeout, had a shrimp pad thai and the chicken drunken noodles, both at level 3 spicy (from 1-4 where 4 is spiciest).  I thought that both dishes were pretty good although I am accustomed to eating spicy food and would not recommend a higher level than 2 for your average foodie. I liked the drunken noodles more than the pad thai -- it was full of flavor and made better by the abundance of thai basil in it.  The only thing that would made it really stellar was if the noodles (chow fun noodles) were a little less soft and more al dente.  But that could be because i ate it 15 mins later and not right at the restaurant so it was soft, and broken up -- just a personal preference, dish was still good.  The pad thai was also good and I might be in the minority here but I do not like too sweet of a pad thai.  Thank goodness, it was not too sweet, a little bit tangy and just right!  I really like the pad thai.  Service was very friendly.  I would go back.", "type": "review", "business_id": "4QtD359vkU7Jq8vP0uQEww"}

The massage chairs look brand new and the entire place is beautifully decorated.  Normally, I don't like talking to the staff when I get my nails done, but Hannah was so nice and charming I didn't mind it one bit and it wasn't awkward at all.\n\nShe used to work for high end salons in strip hotels and the quality definitely translates.  She took high end salon procedures and customer service and made them affordable.  I could tell she took pride in her work when she meticulously worked on my nails to ensure each of them were perfect - and I am thrilled with the end result.  She made me sanitize my hands right away (never been asked to do that in a nail salon before but it totally makes sense) and talked about how she emphasizes cleanliness in her salon to prevent Staph infections.  The inner health care professional in me was ecstatic.  Also, since I had never had gel nails before, she took the time to show me how to remove them at home.  She also stressed she asks all her staff to speak English around the clients, which I think is a huge plus for customer service.\n\nThe salon itself is beautiful, my nails turned out wonderful, the service was phenomenal, and the prices are super competitive with other local nail salons.  Hannah trains the staff herself so I believe you'd get the same level of care even if she wasn't there.

The place is pretty easy to find, not far from the strip and other things, the complex is not to big which is nice. Found a parking space by the check in office. Since Lucy was a doll and called ahead to let them know we would be arriving before her and David G. and that it was okay to sign in and get the keys. Office staff was friendly and got all the paperwork together fast, looked at my ID, i filled out the forms on who was staying in the condo with us, we were handed our card keys and directions to where our condo was located. But before we could run outta there, we were told to stop by the desk across the room to get our parking pass. Oh god here is where the \"fun\" started:\nAs soon as we walked over to the other desk we were greeted by Jeff who tryed his best to sell us on getting a time share, not taking NO for an answer he then tryed to tell us there was a meeting the next morning at 11:00am and that their personal chef would be there cooking everyone breakfast who was attending. Trying to be nice, we both said we would be having a late night with our friends and probally wouldnt make it. Jeff then said he would give us a call to remind us about it, he even gave us a welcoming present of assorted samples (razor, craisins and someother stuff i cant remember). Ugh!  We finally got our parking pass and booked outta there as fast as we could!\n\nFinding our condo was a tiny bit confusing because they didnt mention it was around the corner and down a little bit. Keep in mind this complex doesnt have any elevators, so if your on the 3rd level your going to be hiking up 3 flights of stairs (which we did)!! No worries got our daily/nightly cardio in!!\n\nOur condo had 2 bedrooms and 2 baths, a living room with plenty of seats, a pull out queen bed (murphy bed), TV/DVD player, Boombox with an ipod dock, a full kitchen with everything we need just incase we decided to cook or bake there, a laundry room, and a balcony that had a nice view and best of all air conditioning which we all froze on the second night!\n\nLucy and David's room was nice with a King size bed, a full bathroom in the room, large closet and a TV.  \nOur bedroom had twin beds (no worries with some quick thinking we pushed the beds together to make a bigger bed!!!) The closet space was enough for two people to share. The other bathroom was just outside our room to the left, again plenty of space.  The kitchen was across from our room (score).\n\nWas super impressed that the complex was quite at night. I would stay here again the next time we are all in town together!

I called ahead for reservations, which were taken politely.  I was told we'd have no problem getting in.  Which, despite my own error of one hour, was true...we arrived an hour earlier than I had understood and were still promptly attended to.\n\nAs before, the service was quite good.  We were attended to by a completely different person...actually, a couple of very attentive people.  Nice to see the service was consistent across folks.  Again, nice to see the women at the table addressed first.  You know, I don't consider myself 'conservative' but, I was raised to hold doors for women, and to allow them to go first.  I think it's a nice tradition and it preserves a charming, though not trite, respect for a past time when manners and civility towards our fellow citizen mattered.  Refreshing in this day of so much negativity and vitriolic disregard of our fellow citizens.....though...I digress....  Suffice it to say, I liked the service :)\n\nWe ordered an array of hors d'oeurves which were delivered quite promptly, and just as promptly eaten.  They were nicely presented (quesadillas and crab cakes) and tasty.  The quesadillas are quite a nice size portion.  Crab cakes can serve two people (one if you're greedy).\n\nFor dinner, I had the Ahi Tuna...and it was INCREDIBLE!  Company had dishes including the scallops, steak, 1/2 rack of ribs, and walleye.  All were well respected and consumed though, the walleye fish fry was reported to be a bit bland, on the batter side.  Scallops and ribs were enthusiastically devoured by, apparently people we thought we knew but who, in reality, turned out to be ravenous Velociraptors when presented with tasty treats for eats...any English majors out there want to tackle the grammar on that sentence?  :P\n\nAll in all...it was a very nice evening.  Friendly, professional, and attentive service, yummy food, and a nice ambiance.\n\nHint:  In the winter, when the darkness sets on early in the evening, if you sit in the front of the restaurant facing the windows...expect to have glaring headlights regularly swirling in and out of your vision as cars pull in, and exit the parking lot.  I think this was a bit exaggerated by the frosted glass.  Simple remedy, ask to NOT sit at the windows.

But her bf talked to the workers and managed to get a really nice table overlooking the main dance floor (pole and stage included) with plenty of sitting space and a mini dance area.\n\nThe music was ok...lots of old school tunes for the old school crowd. I'm guessing a lot of 30 somethings up in there. The place was crowded to max and it was a chore to make your way to the restrooms. At least I didn't have to wait. The dancers costumes looked pretty and interesting but were too far from our table to really be appreciated. What made the night was John Legend coming out to perform 2 songs for his bday!!! I love him. We got a pretty good view, too!! \n\nThe bottle servers kept the area clean, danced with you if you wanted them to, but kept walking back and forth which got a little annoying. Another annoying thing was the people upstairs were spilling their drinks every now and then on the dance area below. I wish there was a small overhang to protect us in case someone had dropped their glass cup completely!! This place is decent, but it's not my top choice in clubs.

It was great, and after that, I felt 100% comfortable. I came back a second time to narrow down my options and again felt absolutely no pressure. When I finally made the purchase, I was confident I was getting a great diamond and a great ring. I got the ring appraised afterwards, and it was appraised for more than I purchased it.

The food is not very good. I'm not a wine connoisseur by any means so I can't honestly give a wine review. I had the Pinot Grigio and it was decent. \n\nMy husband and I came the first time for the jazz music on a Friday night. He had seen an ad for this and, not knowing anything about the place, had called ahead to see if reservations might be needed. He was told that reservations we always a good idea and they reserved us a table for 7:30. Well, the table reserved was near the back and against a wall. Not exactly what you would expect with a reservation. But once we got there we realized this was not a \"reservation\" type of place--really just a bar with a menu of select entrees and appetizers. Ok, no big deal. Two guys played jazz guitar and we enjoyed that enough to try it again.\n\nWhen we returned a couple of weeks later the music was a guy also playing acoustic guitar but mainly 90s music of which we aren't really fans. Still, it would have been ok because he actually played very well but it was way too loud to have a conversation even though we were seated in the back. I pity anyone in the front of the place.\n\nAs for the food, the only thing I've had here that was any good was the bruschetta with cheese and spinach. I don't remember what they specifically called it. Other than that, my first visit I had the Shrimp on the Barbie, which was so-so (rice was cold and tasteless) and on the second visit I had a salad which was ok but nothing great. My husband also had the shrimp the first time but ordered the Kobe burger on the second visit. He took one bite, and totally lost his appetite because it tasted to him like \"wet dog.\" The waiter apologized (I'll elaborate on that later) and claimed it was definitely the Kobe burger even though I asked if maybe they accidentally gave him a Kangaroo burger. He offered to have them cook up a new one but my husband declined as the first bite had turned his stomach. My son had also ordered a Kobe burger and his was okay, so I'm pretty sure they just gave my husband the wrong type of burger or the meat was just bad.\n\nThe service was good enough on our first visit. The second visit was all around very strange. We walked in and a gentlemen told us someone would be up to seat us in a minute, then came back and took us to a table himself, saying someone would come back and take our order. Several minutes later he returned, apologizing for the wait, saying he guessed he would be taking our order. He took our drink order and left. After several minutes he returned bringing one drink at a time (there were 3 of us). Finally, he came back, again saying he was \"so sorry,\" I guess for the wait. It was too loud in there to really know exactly what he was saying. He took our dinner order and then returned a few minutes later apologizing that they did not have Ranch dressing as two of us had ordered. A bar that doesn't have Ranch dressing? Oh well, maybe they don't have Ranch dressing \"down under.\"  It seemed like a while before we got our food. He came by and apologized at least once for the wait again before he actually brought it to the table (one order at a time again). When he did, he apologized that he thought they had plated the fries with the wrong burger (the burgers were ordered cooked differently) but in fact they had them plated correctly. I was pretty tired of hearing him say he was \"so sorry\" by then, but I was about to hear it again after hubby couldn't eat his burger.\n\nMy husband says the waiter reminded him of Phil on Modern Family and I have to say he did resemble him a little in looks and manner. He was very nice but apologized WAY too much. Unfortunately, he had a lot to apologize for, which explains the low rating given. Won't be going back :(", "type": "review", "business_id": "9dopZKjYiKwPiw7kEQsEag"}

Its location is the greatest blessing AND curse: if you work in OC, its a great bar at almost-walking distance, but SINCE you work in OC, you're likely to bump into coworkers and managers from your office... often sipping on cocktails with ladies other than their wives.\n\nOh dear.. look away, pretend you never saw each other.\n\nSocial awkwardness aside, I have been pretty pleased by the accommodations at The Living Room. When I organized a 20+ people happy hour here, they were able to reserve the community table for me and extend the happy hour until 7pm (not a hard bargain for them). Our server was suuuuuper slow, which although understandable for the crazy packed venue, was still quite annoying. \n\nTheir cocktails are a tad pricey but decently put together and tasty. Out of their food, probably the best thing on the damn menu is the caprese dish: fresh mozzarella served with pesto, cherry tomatoes, aged balsamic reduction and toasted bread - super simple, incredibly delicious. Their bruschettas were tasty but nothing to yell about: the roasted red pepper hummus was standard (hummus and bread, we've all tried it) and the olive tapenade was a bit better, but nothing you can't make at home. Their pinwheel rolls were A-OK but the cider vinaigrette was beyond terrible and did not go well with the tortilla bread and sandwich contents. yuk. Finally, their fondue is simple and nice (at $10) but I think the ratio of dipping items to cheese was a little off. Read: we need more cheese. More cheese!!\n\nA solid 4 stars after multiple visits.

According to his story, H&R is the place to find it.\n\n8:23 pm. My partner and I are on east Sahara when we spot what appears to be a classic Vegas dive bar. Industrial plain building leads me to believe the trail may dead end here. Stepping through the door and we are greeted by a remarkably warm and inviting interior.

I remember the Vegas of the 80's as the last whimpers of organized crime faded behind corporate greed. Herbs and Rye brings a classic, personal touch to service. Our bartender is a consummate professional with enough personal interaction to make you feel more than welcome. I would trade ten modern servers for one who studies the art of service like this gentleman.\n\nThe true test comes when I tentatively ask for a Sezarac, fully expecting to have to explain what it is and what's in it.

Reponded... \"Killian's Irish Red???\". \"Oops! Excuse me! It's only Red... doesn't taste like Killian's.\"\n\nYes, the House Beer is Red... He was right... no way did it taste like Killian's.\n\nLittleneck Clams Appetizer (*** 1/2 $11.00 Happy Hour Reg-$22) Parmigiano, Lemon, Broth. \n\nSmallish Clams in a... watery Broth. Frankly, could have used more Butter... a lot more. Had better last year... somewhere else in Vegas...\n\nBread & Butter (**) I'm a Dipper, an expert Dipper from way back... Love to Dip Bread & Butter in Broth from the Clams Appetizer and from my daughter's Linguine & Clams entree. At first EVERYONE received their own individual six-inch mini-loaf of hard, over-baked Bread. Asked for refills... only two were brought out. Asked for refills again for just me, which the waiter didn't know... only received one loaf. I'll bet if I asked again... we would have been ignored...\n\nKansas City Strip Steak (** 1/2 $14.50 Happy Hour Reg-$29) Chose this Steak over the Filet... mainly because of the price and size, which was 12oz... the Filet was $34, but was only 8oz. Chose the Jalapeno Cream Corn as a side. Wanted to take it easy on the kids' wallet...\n\nWhen the entree came out... The Strip Steak was on a separate plate, which surprised me... and the Side of Jalapeno Cream Corn (which was Not Creamed!) was in it's own deep-oval dish almost as long as the plate itself.\n\nSteak, itself, was the thin, smallish Steaks you'd buy for yourself at the local Super-Market... the one's that are gristly, and that you'd always over-cook... never can get right because it's so thin. Hate to say this... the best part of the meal... the watery Jalapeno (Creamed) Corn.\n\nAlso received donations of....\n\n   Filet Mignon (**** 1/2) Word to Yelpers.... the ONLY Steak worth it's \n      price regardless whether it's Happy Hour or not is the Filet Mignon at \n      $34. $17, during Happy Hour, is an absolute bargain!\n\n   Linguine & Clams (*** 1/2) Used the same Broth as the Clam Appetizer.\n      Same conclusion... more BUTTER, PLEASE!\n\n   side of Truffle Mac & Cheese (***) Tasted OK... if you ignore the \n      over-cooked Macaroni!\n\n   Looks like I ordered the wrong things... all the way around!\n\nBee's Knees (* 1/2) Hand-Crafted Cocktails? They might be Hand-Crafted... but not by a qualified Barttender! NOT!\n\nWhen the drink, which consisted of Gin, Honey & Lemon came out, there was the thin film of dark Honey on top over the light-colored Gin & Lemon Juice which indicated inadequate mixing of the beverage - minimum 30 seconds of continuous shaking, stirring, mixing... whatever. Very amateurish attempt. Sorry, fellow Yelpers, whomever mixed this drink will have to go back to Bar-tending school...\n\n\nIf you want to \"do\" Vegas on the Cheap, I guess this place is as good as any versus the super-duper-expensive Strip. But, you'd compromise first of all with the character of the establishment.... first impression... Old-School, Dank Red-Velvet Wallpaper, and Dark, mood lighting. And then when you're seated, you're handed a hefty, black, faux-leather bound Menu... that should have been re-bound years ago. \n\nAbout twice as many people at the Bar than people having a sit-down meal.", "type": "review", "business_id": "LXrq0Fw6MCz70KMA928ldQ"}

Baguette Caf\u00e9 makes my heart flutter.\n\nEverything they offer from the pastries to the soups made daily is made from fresh ingredients. You can just taste it. On my first visit, I had the prosciutto sandwich and cream of mushroom soup. I expected for the baguette to be hard and crunchy but that wasn't the case at all. I took a bite and it was crunchy on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside. On my next visit, I had the chipotle chicken panini and cream of potato and leek soup. Everything was divine. They are good lunch portions and affordable at around $6-$7. \n\nThe service and ambiance is 5 stars all the way. You can tell that Olivier appreciates all of his patrons because he tries to get to know everyone by name. He takes the time to explain everything that is on the menu. He is so enthusiastic and passionate about the food that he makes everything sound irresistible. His French accent doesn't hurt either. True to his word, the food is every bit as delicious as he describes.\n\nUnfortunately for me, they are only open Monday-Friday from 7 am to 5 pm.

You will have nothing but found memories of walking the streets of Paris (not so much street but get my drift) and walking into Cafe smelling fresh baked pastries, daily soups, and fresh baked bread most notable baguettes. The irony is this gem always been in my backyard neighborhood. Shout out too my beast training partner Suzy H for showing me this gem after our beast bike ride not think of better place too refuel!!! \n\nUnfortunately the only thing with this gem is words out. So we were very lucky too find spot too sit down for lunch at prime time 12. But they do have outside seating and few inside or if anything can always order too go. It SOOO worth the wait!!\n\nI order the chicken pesto sandwich and we shared the granola bowl. I mention many times but really believe no matter sandwich its ONLY as good as the bread. The baguette. It bread from heaven. Truly  only one other experience that had that baguette had that authentic everything on point. It nice crispy crust one that bread the bread away with hands, It nice moist and hot on the inside. I could just go bread crazy eat baguettes all day, Inside find perfectly cooked chicken breast nice moist and hot just like the bread. The pesto spread was awesome! Basil, pine nuts, cheese, and chicken is there better combination for chicken sandwich. Maybe the curry chicken sure bookmark that one for next time. I like the little (literally) salad couple bites. I like the salad dressing on top of it. Not sure if house salad dressing but in any case could have had big salad be happy for lunch. The granola I really enjoyed. It came with fresh cut banana on top and side of milk. We tried it both ways. I prefer it with the milk but either case really good. Suzy nice enough got too try her acai bowl. It first time tried one. It was delicious. All the menu items are under ten dollars for the most part so definitely affordable lunch/breakfast spot. \n\nI love the fact the owner Oliver very much puts his stamp on the restaurant. He constantly on the go walking around asking customers for their input and making sure everyone happy! The acai bowl something relatively new on the menu asking Suzy her thought on it if something that could improve the dish on. I respect any small business owner that always willing too listen too customer feedbacks. You can tell much passion goes into all the dishes at Baguette Cafe. Not just the owner but the entire staff is great! Friendly, helpful, and even if not have the answer they go back too the kitchen get one. \n\nNo doubt see myself coming her more often for light lunch, healthy lunch, and really best food for recovery from triathlon training days.....", "type": "review", "business_id": "OHsuvX4rmhnPvvRBb-QK7A"}

A fun adventure for family and friends to tag along. It's an alluring concept.  I can see runners still signing up DESPITE THE HORRENDOUS REVIEWS FROM THIS YEAR. \n\nIf you're one of those brave (or foolish?) runners, go prepared.  Here are my tips on what I'd do differently, if I only knew! \n\n1.  TAG ON VACATION DAYS AFTER THE RUN, not before. The run is Sunday, so it's tempting to want to have a vacation weekend by arriving early.  But if you're a serious runner, you can't drink, you can't overindulge in foods out of your routine, you shouldn't smoke second-hand--you basically won't get to do any of the things that make Vegas fun!\n\n2. LINE UP YOUR PRE-RACE MEALS AHEAD OF TIME--and have back-up plans anyway!  Room service at the hosting hotel (Mandalay Bay) on race day was 1.5 hours backed up.  The line for most restaurants and buffets in the vicinity was about 1 hour just to get seated, with food service delayed.  Even the ready-to-eat carbs were mostly gone at the cafe--I grabbed the very last sandwich and scone at 11:55am, 4 hours before the race!  I suggest pre-ordering room service the night before or making reservations AND placing your order at one of the non-buffet restaurants beforehand, and still have a couple of back-up PBJ sandwiches and bananas just in case things don't work out.\n\n3. LINE UP DINNER POST-RACE AHEAD OF TIME. Getting out of the race area took hours, after which it took more hours to find food.  I suggest arranging for room service ahead of time to avoid the mess of people.\n\n4. AVOID GEAR CHECK. It was a disaster trying to retrieve items at the end.  For race start, your friends/family can go all the way to the corrals with you, so you can hand them your jackets then.  Or just buy something from the thrift store you can throw away.  For race end, grab plenty of space blankets, and have family/friends bring you lots of warm layers (and a thermos of hot chocolate perhaps!).\n\n5. CHECK OUT THE FINISH AREA AHEAD OF TIME, and scout a way back to your hotel or a meeting spot that is FAR AWAY from the shortest/main route indoors.  This was a major disaster as all the runners and their family and friends headed towards the Mandalay Bay after the run--understandably so, as it was COLD.  But the jam just to get to my room (at the Mandalay Bay) was almost 1 hour.  Not only annoying--but seriously DANGEROUS.  Many runners passed out.  As the runners mixed in with the Vegas revelers in the crowd, I kept worrying--one drunken scream of fire, and there would have been a major stampede.\n\n6. HAVE ENOUGH OF YOUR OWN WATER FOR THE ENTIRE RACE.  Many runners got sick this year because the water handed out by volunteers was very unsanitary (from big trash cans).\n\n7. FULL MARATHONERS, MAKE YOUR TIME AS MUCH AS YOU CAN IN THE FIRST HALF.  The second half, just be mentally prepared that you'll be merging into 40,000+ half-marathoners.  You'll find out how narrow the Strip really is.  (The half marathon starts 1.5 hours after the full, on the exact same course.  Unless you're an elite who can run the first half in less than 1.5 hours, you can't avoid the merge fiasco.) \n\n8. BETTER YET, JUST DO THE HALF MARATHON INSTEAD.  The first half is through industrial Vegas--you might as well be in Detroit.  Only the 2nd half is on the Strip, and if you're fast, you can maybe outrun the crowds and the merge fiasco.\n\n9. WEAR A HEADLAMP.  There were stretches of dark areas--both in the first half and second half--with serious potholes.  (They gave one out as a freebie this year, but failed to mention its necessity in any communications to runners before the race.)\n\n10. BOOK YOUR MASSAGE SEVERAL WEEKS AHEAD OF TIME as they fill up.  If not, call the morning of and see if there's a cancellation (that's how I got mine).  I highly recommend the Spa at THE Hotel at Mandalay Bay, as they have hot and cold tubs you can soak in before/after your massage.", "type": "review", "business_id": "M4aGbEXZjOnBFn9C6IbrYQ"}

I mainly eat here because it is cheap and healthier than most fast food. I usually get the burritos but they have tacos, quesadillas, and bowls. The attraction for me is the delicious meats. The barbacoa here made me fall in love with barbacoa because it is so flavorful. The steak and chicken is great too because they are usually locally raised and without hormones. I don't care for the carnitas (pork) here because it is too dry.  For toppings they have three types of salsa, corn, cheese, sour cream, lettuce, guacamole, white or brown rice, black beans, pinto beans and peppers and onions. The sour cream is way too watery for me and lacks flavor. They have chips, soft drinks and beer. That is pretty much their whole menu, but you tell them what to put on your burrito or bowl or whatever you are getting so you can change it up each visit.  One other downfall is that you don't get your tortillas browned on your burrito like you would at some other places that serve Mexican food. The barbacoa burrito I got tonight was $9.24 after tax because I got guacamole for $1.80 extra.  Overall, Chipotle is decent, but it is up to the customer to be creative and go against the norm if you want something like pollo asada then you would have to tell them to skip the rice and beans and just give you a ton of chicken, the green salsa, and guacamole. If you think like this you can stave off boredom for a while since they don't have some of the other things you would get at other Mexican places like fish or shrimp tacos, mexican rice, refried beans, chimichangas, taquitos, tortas, or tostadas.  Dear Chipotle corporate: If you are listening, I like your concept but more variety would be welcomed with open arms.  I realize that some of the items Chipotle doesn't make are not very healthy (like anything fried) but how easy would it be to make tortas or shrimp tacos?

We needed this fixed asap. When asked if we could find and bring in the part they said sure. How awesome is that. The car was done Sunday at noon for a very reasonable price. No hassle and a great price.", "type": "review", "business_id": "PhAOb3vhLzTmhh9f06sYgQ"}

My name is Mimi and I am addicted to Shelley's Specialty Desserts.  \n\nOh my, what words can describe the magical treats created inside this darling little bake shop every day.  I work not terribly far from Shelley's so I drop by every once in a while (okay at least once a week) to see what new confections have been invented since my last visit.  I am never disappointed.  Everything at Shelley's is made from scratch.  No artificial anything.  Yum!  Dessert that is almost good for you.  My favorites are the macaroons, the chocolate chip cookies, the cupcakes, the pecan sticky buns, the buttermilk pie, the cheesecake bites, and the heavenly lemon bars.  Didn't see your favorite in the list?  Try one of the many brownies, home made fudge, key lime pie tarts,  special occasion cakes, oatmeal raisin cookies, bread, gluten free bread and the list goes on forever.  \n\nThe irresistible special part of Shelley's is her sugar candy work.  You have never seen such beautiful little pieces of art.  Stop in and just let your eyes take it all in.  Eventually your mouth will file a protest and demand you try a sample of something . . . and don't worry, Shelley always has a sample for everyone.  \n\nI love Shelley and all her little treats.  What a treasure!", "type": "review", "business_id": "rXQn6FNGO78zeY6Jc0og8Q"}

Over the years John has become more than a massage therapist to me....he has become somebody that gives great advice and actually listens to what I have to say.\n\nAnd because he listens...my massages are always customed to what I NEED!  Not what I want...not a massage that you can get anywhere.  Example last week when I got my bazillionith massage from John.  I mentioned to him that my job requires that I now where high heels....he knew that while my back was messed up he knew that my feet and lower part of my legs needed added extra attention.  Just through conversation he knew what I needed.\n\nAnd to me this is the most important thing I need from a massage therapist (or any therapist!!! HA!)  John is so attentive and really really really does give the most amazing massages in the universe!  \n\nI am happy that my schedule is more flexible so I can make the time to see John and Space Massage Studio.", "type": "review", "business_id": "9VqoZVN8iqf5UsMIwQkgDA"}

Well needless to say I have been on them for three months now and love them. \n\nFor years doctor's have said I need a prescription hormone replacement to balance myself out. NO way, I do not like drugs other than wine.....hee hee \nSo I decided to see if I could purchase them cheaper without having to run over to Whole Foods all the time. I found this website and yes they are much cheaper and more convenient. \n\nIt is a great website they carry vitamins, herbs, beauty products, sports, organic, nutritional items, sexual health, homeopathy, etc....such a great selection. They also have one price shipping for $4.99, which is awesome because this allows me to order a few month's supply making it much less expensive then purchasing from the store. Vitacost.com truly offers wholesale prices on thousands of vitamins, supplements and over-the-counter products. Most of the products they carry are sold at the Published Wholesale Price which is typically 33% to 75% less than what you would pay at the retail level. They also offer auto ship, which is very nice.\n\nThey have a clearance section and run promotions all the time once you order with them. The vitamins I am taking have really balanced me out naturally, no more major hot flashes, oh and they help you sleep like a baby. The shipping is fast and the Customer Service department is excellent. \n\nWould highly recommend this website.", "type": "review", "business_id": "AOzZOE3D5G6B7QHBU1QS-w"}

In a hipster mecca like San Francisco, Seattle or Brooklyn I'd just assume it was ironic but I wasn't sure the target audience would get it.\n\nI'm not sure if it counts as de-gentrification but at least the management gets it. \n\nCulinary Dropout is, straight up, excellent American comfort food at prices that aren't overall comforting but are reasonable for the neighborhood. The staff, for which a minimum beauty and/or edge standard is strictly enforced (the explanation that best explains a visible mohawk in the open kitchen) are friendly and help it along in a cavernous, moodlit dining room suitable for friends or a date along with a bar boasting live music on weekends and the obligatory fair-weather outdoor seating.\n\nWe hit two of the three specialties (the third being a turkey pastrami sandwich on pretzel bread) and a dessert:\n- Soft Pretzels with Provolone Fondue ($10): There's a reason everyone orders this. Fluffy pretzel rolls that are made better with a *small* amount of warm cheese.\n- Fried Chicken ($16): What must be multiple pounds of juicy chicken (I'm not sure I'd want to meet the chicken to which the breast piece belonged in a dark alley) with honey-glazed biscuits, mashed potatoes and cole slaw.\n- Chocolate Peanut Butter Tart ($6): For lovers of dense and sweet desserts only.\n\nEspecially if considering dessert, I'd strongly recommend ordering the pretzels and then one dish less than the number of people - comforting in the United States means heavy and even if I'd just hiked 10+ miles after not eating all day I don't think I could have finished the entire chicken platter. I just as strongly recommend coming though - it is one of the rare cases where my traditionalist meat and potatoes parents and I agree on a restaurant.

I love sweet tea but WOW I think theirs was more like drinking strait sugar water. \nWe ordered our food with the waitress, my boyfriend ordered the pork chop dinner & wanted spaghetti and red beans with rice as his two sides. They were out of spaghetti so he got Mac n cheese instead. I ordered the smothered chicken dinner but had to change to fried chicken dinner because they didn't make any gravy that day. I wanted mashed potatoes and Mac n cheese for my sides. A few minuets after ordering the waitress came back & said they didn't have mashed potatoes either. Red beans and rice it is then. \nIt took 30 min easy for our food to come out. We were the only people in the restaurant. If it had only been my boyfriend & I we might not have cared but we did have our kids with us and they do get a little impatient. When we did get our dinner, wow, it was hot and fresh. My fried chicken was perfectly cooked and the seasoning in the breading was delicious. The Mac n cheese was ok along with the red beans and rice. My boyfriends pork chops were delicious, breaded of course & cooked perfectly. He loved the red beans & rice but not so much the Mac n cheese. Our dinners came with corn bread which was good as well. \nThe food here was good, I would go back. My only suggestion would be for them to maybe make a daily menu of items that have so you don't sit & read a menu, decide on something only to be told over & over they don't have it that day. They really are hurting themselves there. \nAnother couple came in before we left & wanted corn or green beans with their dinner and was then told all they have for veggie's that day were greens. \nThe food was good but lack of options & not being informed of what you could or couldn't order until you tried to order it was a little annoying.

Its decorated with dark woods and statues, the type of place I wouldn't mind a sit down meal. I came because of a $20 for $10 groupon, and the woman at the register was super sweet. A lot of times places kind of give you a little sneer when you break out the groupon or restaurant.com but she was just as pleasant and smiley. \n\nI did a to go order of ala carte garlic short ribs, honey duck and spicy beef salad w Thai tea. I'm really not a fan of this chain's shrimp fried rice so I never get the house specials. Total for everything was about $28 cheap!\n\nFriends had highly recommended the spicy beef salad, but I wasn't that impressed. When I saw slices of beef in the description, I assumed a piece of beef sliced like most other Thai beef salads I've had. This was thinly sliced then cooked, basically what they'd put in their noodle or rice dishes. Cooked with julienned carrots and served over a few romaine lettuce leaves w cucumbers, onions, chilis, lime juice and cilantro. I got 5 out of 10 spicy and it had just enough heat for me. \n\nThe garlic shirt ribs are probably my fav dish there. Its a generous portion of little pork ribs fried super crispy and dredged in a sweet soy sauce. It reminds me of Hawaii style Korean chicken. Yum! Ribs are mostly meat, a lot of boneless chunks and not too fatty which is a plus.\n\nHoney duck was also disappointing, but at least reasonably priced. A half (small) duck for $8. It says roasted but I'm pretty positive it was fried. It was really crispy like the ribs but meat was pretty dried out. Had no seasoning or taste on its own, but served with a sweet honey sauce on the side. \n\nIt was a ton of food and with 2 ppl sharing we still had a lot left over. This is the best of the original Thai BBQ chain in Vegas, and I'd definitely come back (because I bought 2 groupons!)", "type": "review", "business_id": "0FfB4c7KABDCFITS4rPY_Q"}

Hash House was packed, which was a good sign. I'm surprised this many people trudged through the casino to actually eat here.\n\nService was pretty good, although the ice water tasted pretty gross--it was probably just tap water.  Our server was very helpful in taking our orders, since it was our first time and we didn't know what to expect. \n\n I ordered the Sage Chicken with a side of crispy potatoes. Man this thing was huge! Two breaded and deep-fried chicken breasts sat atop 2 biscuits, bacon, eggs, cheese, and mashed potatoes, and covered in a chipotle sauce. It was messy, down and dirty, and I felt my arteries clog up with each bite--just the way I like it. You've got to eat this right away, otherwise all it all becomes soggy and not as tasty as it could be. After tackling this heavy meal, the tap water wasn't so bad at all. The Crispy Potatoes weren't that good--they were burned and a little dry. I should've opted for the side of Sausage instead.\n\nOf course, major food coma is to be expected afterwards--the host commented on how slow we were walking.

The huge portions just blew me out of the water. Now, they're not impossible portions; they're just a belt-snapping, belly-bursting kind of do-able. \n\nI especially loved the fried chicken eggs benedict because the hollandaise sauce had that perfect tangy, creamy, almost spicy kick to it. Just perfect. Probably the best hollandaise I've ever had. The friend chicken and waffles? Similarly delicious. The waffles were fresh, with that just-barely crispy outer layer with the soft, warm, steam-filled insides, topped with a healthy pour of maple syrup along with a giant portion of delicious fried chicken: not too much fried, and not only chicken, if you know what I mean. After this meal, I literally felt drunk. My head was light and my vision was lagging behind the movement of my head. I had to go sleep off this food-hangover right after I paid the bill. Now that's class. \n\nI'll be honest, I haven't had anything else. But my friend said the mimosas were good. \n\nThe reason I didn't give this place 5 stars was because the hostess was kind of a sourpuss. I get that we can't be seated until our whole party is there, but they were literally coming up the escalator and as we pointed that out, she turned and helped someone else, only addressing us again 15 minutes later. I don't know; I expected some more friendliness? Some more courtesy? She was definitely kind of rude in her demeanor as well. But the serving staff? Wonderful! So friendly, so helpful, and so cheery.

Yay, made it!\n\nConfused? Did I go to the wrong place? Is my memory failing me already? My second time (9/10/11) here within 24 hours, can't be. \n\nService: \nGoing to have to start with this vs. food. How can service differ so badly from one night to the next? Absolutely the most dreadful service. \n\nWhen we got there, there was NO host(ess) in sight. Patiently waited for about 15 minutes by reading the news prints. Then I started popping my head into the main seating area. Seen but not acknowledged by several employees: bartender and 2 waiters(tresses). \n\nAnother 5-8 minutes pass... Now there is another party waiting with kids. FINALLY, an older male waiter with glasses quickly announces that someone would be with us shortly. He also asks where the hostess is and answers his own question by saying \"she's around so wait.\" Before we can say anything, he's gone. WTH?!? \n\nIf I wasn't dying to try their food, we would have left. Darn you, taste buds and cravings. \n\nOkay, another 5 minutes pass. Two additional parties have joined at this time. Now, I'm irritated and hungry. Before, I could take action (my BF hates it when I do this), another gentlemen who just arrived about 2 minutes earlier walks into the main seating area and loudly states... \"Is anyone going to help us?\" A different waiter says someone will be with us and ushers the man back into the line. \n\nAfter another 2 minutes, a very apologetic waitress (old school glam girl, looks young with dark black hair) quickly seats us. She also makes excuses to us indicating the hostess must be in bathroom or something. \n\nAbout 32+ minutes to get seated.... 30 minutes before getting acknowledged. \n\nOur waitress didn't make up for it either. She was a tall, heavyset Caucasian with glasses. Our glasses were empty and NEVER refilled. I had to ask a busboy 2x for refills. She was prompt with the check though. Go figure. \n\nFood: \nWas it worth the wait? Yes, yes, yes... Almost an orgasm in the mouth. \n\n- Sage Fried Chicken and Bacon Waffles \nLarge portion, definitely 2-3 could share. Very innovative dish form preparation to presentation. Better than Roscoe's, no doubt. Just like the host said the first night we came. \n\nChicken was tender and flavorful. Waffles were perfectly cooked, fluffy and bacon stuffed. Green onions were deep-fried and surprisingly delicious... I couldn't stop eating them. \n\nThe kicker though is the garnish dressing. There were 3-4 bites that had this amazing spicy kick. The dressing with maple syrup and the spice... OMG, to die for!! It was that good that I had to ask. I think the waitress was off though. She said it was the same as the rib place... soy-teriyaki sauce. But it wasn't, it was different in color and taste. I tried each drizzle multiple times to verify and it was definitely DIFFERENT. \n\n- Ribs (Small Plate) \nThis was a just-enough serving. Succulent, savory, and it fell of the bone. Take note, this is the way ribs should be. \n\nIt was accompanied with a simple potato salad with dill dressing. Very tasty. \n\nParking: \nThere is a garage available for parking. \n\nOVERALL \nFirst visit was waaaayyyy better than the first, service-wise. Honestly, I am still in utter shock of what a big difference my experience. I'm big on service. I'm a reasonable person, if it was busy, I would understand the wait. But considering the situation, it wasn't. \n\nWould I go back? \nAs much as the service sucked, I would have to say \"YES,\" but maybe I'd try a different location. The food was extremely good. If I had to rate the food alone, it would have gotten 4.5 stars. \n\nFor 5 stars, they need to make that spicy, maple garnish sauce for the chicken and waffles plate. \n\nNo matter what... Even if food is awesome, if service sucks, rating will suck.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**REVIEW BASED ON SERVICE ONLY... FIRST VISIT**\n\nOn a recent Vegas trip, everyone was raving about the food here and said it was a \"must go.\" Then I saw it on tv when we were having some downtime, and the food just called to me. It actually made me salivate so we had to visit it.\n\nSo the plan... Get the chicken and waffles. \n\nLocation:\nThere are multiple locations, this is one of four. Others are located at the M Hotel, Plaza Hotel, and off the strip.\n\nMenu:\nBe warned, there are DIFFERENT menus.  We hit it up pretty late, around 11:30pm. So that means, we made it for the LATE menu. So what sucks is that only select items are offered. \n\nService:\nThe host was pretty cool. He was down to earth and really informative. He said if I really wanted the chicken and waffles that we should come back because it was worth it.\n\nOVERALL\nBased on the service, I'd come back again. Trust me, I will to try the food.", "type": "review", "business_id": "QbmcCE_cLq4WO8ZMKImaLw"}

Love the ambiance, menu looked great, have heard great things about other locations so we decided to make this our last nights meal in Vegas.  Glad we did because aside from Mix, and JR's this has now become one of our favorite places in Vegas. I would not hesitate to recommend. \n\nSeated in the main dining area right in the middle of the coolest structure for a restaurant you will ever see. Warm dining room, very welcoming as were the staff. Ours were a attractive redhead young lady and a younger guy.  Piano playing jazzy christmas tunes, nice touch.  Immediate introduction by the servers, it looked as if there were two for every table. We started with the house special martinis, served chilled and shaken at the table and blended perfectly. Really, perfectly.  Scanned the menu,  server came back by to check on the drinks and announced the specials. Decided on the following:\n\nSaut\u00e9ed Sea Scallops\nWarm Spinach Salad\nChilean Sea Bass\nNY Strip w/o bone\nLobster Mashed \n\nScallops arrived, great presentation. Now I love scallops, being in the PNW we have lots of choices on seafood and some of the best scallops I have ever had are at the barking frog near the Woodinville winery and home of the famous Herbfarm. These were excellent, large but not too, perfectly seasoned and prepared. All sitting on tip of the most wonderful cheese bread cracker in a wonderful sauce. Yum! \n\nSalad arrived, again great presentation, just made, plate warmed just enough you could smell all the ingredients. Now this was key. Onion, egg, bacon and greens all perfectly aligned to emit this wonderful fragrance that just made your mouth water.  None of the heat or tartness you sometimes get with places putting too much red vinegar on the greens.  And the taste, I shit you not this was the best salad I have ever tasted. The senses alive with the fragrance and the taste perfectly aligned. \n\nSteak and bass arrived, simple but elegant in preso.  Bowl of steaming potatoes with over a pound of lobster and a beautiful sauce. Steak done to perfection, one of the best cuts and flavors I have had. And I am a steak house freak.  Steak was severed still sizzling on the plate, little bit of butter on top on a simple white plate.  Wife's Sea bass was served equally as elegant. Simply in presentation, nice cut of fish perfect flavor.  \n\nService was just right, friendly, genuine there when needed. Asked the server to choose a wine for me to pair with the steak. Perfect choice came back again.\n\nI don't work for this place, wish I owned stock or had ownership though. This was by far one of the best dining experiences we have had all year. We will be back. \n\nThanks to the wonderful staff and happy holidays!", "type": "review", "business_id": "1U1GRksKXF7q8FKcW0e5VQ"}

It was good, packed with meat...and the eggs' texture was great and the flavor was amazing. \n\nI, being the more traditional one, got my most favorite breakfast (you can even include lunch and dinner to that)...Bacon and Eggs with Toast. It came with potatoes which I was too full to even touch. I liked how it came with 5 long strips of bacon that were perfectly fried and not too salty. The eggs i ordered came out just the way i wanted. Over-Medium. \n\nIf eggs were a topic.

Everyone knows about the Carnival World Buffet and their Village Seafood Buffet.  That's how the hotel pushes it's marketing: \"go to our Carnival World Buffet\".  I don't think too highly about the buffet.  In the 90s, it was the buffet to experience because of the quality and price.  Now it's only about the price.  Well, surprisingly, I was surprised that the Rio has one hell of a restaurant on site.\n\n\nMartorano's!!!!!  I went with three picky eaters.  We normally stay at the higher end casinos like The Wynn or Caesar's.  But we had to stay at the Rio due to Business reasons.  Well, we were tired so we chose this place.  What a great surprise.  In fact, it was the best meal I had during my 3 day trip, although the Wicked Spoon Buffet also ranks up there!\n\nMy friends are picky but they all three decided to have the Meatball Salad.  What a weird choice.  Meatball Salad????  But they LOVED it.  It was so memorable that we spoke about it weeks later.\n\nMe on the other hand, I don't like to follow everyone else so I decided to order something else.  I ordered the Bucatini Carbonara.  I love Carbonara.  I've had it in some of the best restaurants.  Beverly Hills, Paris France, New York.  Well, hands down, this was the BEST Carbonara I have ever had.  Wow.  It was so beautiful I wanted to take a picture but my friends would have laughed at me.  They are obviously not a foodie like me and my fellow Yelpers.  The Bucatini, which is a thicker spaghetti, was al dente.  Perfectly al dente.  The Carbonara was delicious.  It had a raw egg yolk on it and you had to pop it.  It goosed out and made the Carbonara authentically delicious.  I added some fresh ground black pepper and it was PERFECT.\n\nI actually think about it.  I recently had Linguini Carbonara at two fancy places in Los Angeles and was disappointed.  Martorano's has set the bar very high for me and has ruined Carbonara for me......unless I'm willing to make the trip to Las Vegas!!!!  This is one instance where \"What happens in Vegas Stays in Vegas\".  No......spread the word.

The Cosmopolitan has set the gold standard for casino resorts in Vegas. If you are intending to open a resort in Vegas, well, there's the model by which you should meet or exceed!\n\nI suggest getting there early and leaving late.\n\nArriving to the hotel is like arriving to the set of a movie (or some island resorts if you've been to few with the epoxy drive ways, etc).  Once you turn off the main street and into the valet area of the hotel, you know for sure you are in for an ultra-hip experience.\n\nFrom the fragrance that fills the air to the details of the 5 story chandelier, you know that no detail was spared the hotel. The thing that's most impressive about this resort is the casino area on the first 5 or so floors. WOW. \n\nI beg of you - get to the Marquee early!\n\n3 fantastic pools!  The strategy should be different for all 3.  #1 - Bamboo - go here in the morning for a more peaceful atmosphere and brunch. #2. Boulevard - check out this pool for the special events or if you want to do lunch and play some games in between soaking in the pool. LOVED it.  Louder younger crowd.. #3 Day Club pool - this is a spot for all day and night.  I believe it is connected to Marquee, but I can't really  be sure. I should have asked.\n\nThe Bond Bar - uhm basically a club, sans the $25 cover charge.  I preferred being here for that reason.  Great drinks and nice bartenders. Oh yeah, and it practically sits on the strip!  So people walking by wave at ya if you're sitting on the near side of the bar... they just basically wish they were you.\n\nmy only complaint is the Cosmo's rooms just are not as nice as Aria's rooms.

This place is one of the newest on the strip so therefore is likely going to be the nicest. The rooms are very beautiful with awesome TVs that control the music, AC, lights and more in the rooms. The bathrooms are pretty swanky with lots of towels robes, etc provided. The balconies have great views, just everything anout this place is nice. The nightlife here , Marquee, is pretty good too but very hard to get into without paying $$$$ to get in. The 2 main bars here also make the best craft cocktails on the strip so check those out as well. I'm taking a star off due to service / operational issues at the hotel. This includes the longest check in and check out  lines I've experienced at any hotel ever. So check out via the TV if you want to get out fast. I also had to call multiple times to get a roll away bed even though I requested one before arriving. This paired with some other problems at a friends room showed they need to work on back of house operations. Otherwise this place pretty much had everything I wanted and didn't need to leave the hotel.", "type": "review", "business_id": "AtjsjFzalWqJ7S9DUFQ4bw"}

Asked room service to come back at 4pm but they never came back to our room and never came back to fix our light which the request was made less than an hour of check in and we had stayed 3 nights. We were in the West tower facing one of the pools and on Saturday they apparently have pool parties. I usually can sleep through anything but couldn't with the house/electronic music playing. I even tried turning the TV on but the TV was so loud and could still hear the music I gave up and left the room.

Very glamorous feel! Chandeliers & crystals hanging everywhere. It's decor makes it my favorite hotel in Vegas! Elegant, tasteful, modern. From inside to out, top to bottom.\n\nFirst of all the rooms are amazing. I got a killer deal on this hotel room for 3 nights. I booked with LasVegas.com & ended up paying about 540$ total for the city view room with 2 full beds. The room had modern decor but not over the top. The beds were extremely comfortable. Not a fan of the feather pillows, mostly used a long somewhat skinny decor pillow since it was the most comfortable one in the room. Our room over looked the Bamboo Pool & We could see the beautiful Aria hotel and some of the city lights. Loved that. The bathroom was very nice, huge mirror, marble counters, floors, marble shower. Oh THE shower. \n\nThe shower is open to the sink area of the bathroom, it's a clear glass door facing the \"toilet room\" which is separated from the bathroom by a foggy glass door. The shower also has a clear glass window from top to bottom into the actual room facing both beds and the window to the city. It has an interesting design of blinds on the OUTSIDE of the window that faces both beds. Only the people on the outside can control it while you're in the shower minding your own business. My husband sure got a kick out of that while our male room mate was showering. And of course, when I was showering. It was definitely the hit of the room.\n\nThe touchscreen phone next to the bed controls everything in the room from the tv to the lights. Thought that was pretty cool.\n\nAll of the girls in this hotel look like expensive models. That wasn't a bad thing. :) \n\nExtremely helpful and friendly staff. We ordered room service one night when we got home super late from the club. A hamburger and 2 bottles of water. When we checked out, we found out that cost us $50. I wouldn't recommend it. The food wasn't anything worth $50, but hey it was delivered to us..\n\nWe went to check out the boulevard pool but it was shaded in the afternoon so we went back to the bamboo pool, which seemed to be shaded by a big hotel for a couple of hours maybe between 1-3? We spent a lot of time at the Bamboo pool. It was very relaxing, could have done without the few kids running around playing but oh well. We ordered a raspberry drink a few times from the bar, not sure of the name but the bartender(good looking dude at the bar with the tatt's and the faux hawk) said he made it up and we'd like it. We did. Delicious. We also ordered food, steak quesadillas & hamburger sliders. The quesadillas were delicious, the sliders were good, but lacked any sort of sauce. Used some of the guac from the quesadillas on the burgers. Much better. :) \n\nI also loved the CO Bigelow products they supply you with in the bathroom!", "type": "review", "business_id": "AtjsjFzalWqJ7S9DUFQ4bw"}

Since my wife and I discovered it last year on our mini-moon I haven't stayed anywhere else on my trips to the city that never sleeps.  I highly recommend getting a premium view room on an upper floor.  The view of the Bellagio fountain is amazing and a completely different experience than watching it from the strip. The rooms have always been clean with all of the cool electronic room controls that guys like me LOVE!  I prefer the 1 bedroom but have stayed in the standard room and both have been comfortable and VERY modern feeling!\n   Another nice thing about this property is the diversity of things to do.  Between all of the restaurants, shops, Marquee and all the pools on the property there was never a lack of things to do.  Speaking of the pool, you HAVE to try out the Neapolitan at the main pool for some booze infused ice cream.  \n  The spa is a little pricey but it is very clean and has plenty of work out machines to use.  A little suggestion, I used the main gym in the West (?) Tower and had a $20 per day fee...A different time, I used the smaller gym in the East tower with no charge.  Not saying it will work for you, but it's worth a try.  \n  A final note...if you drive you are going to LOVE the parking garage.  Each level tells you how many open spaces there are AND there are lights that indicate where the open spaces are.  Totally eliminates the hassle of space hunting in the parking garage.", "type": "review", "business_id": "AtjsjFzalWqJ7S9DUFQ4bw"}

I especially appreciated the fact that my dogs were not caged (unless necessary).

The owners excuse was that the day was hectic (sorry but that is not my problem), don't overbook your clients. Then I get my dogs home and find a clot of dried blood on one of my dogs ears (enough to soak through an entire paper towel). I immediately called the owner Penny, she asked me to bring my dog back in so she could take a look - and I told her I would take care of the problem on my end since my dog was already so stressed out. The owner explained that she trusts her groomers and this has never happened before. When you're in the business of dog grooming, I understand there can be mishaps - but you need to own up to it, regardless of whether you trust your employees (even though someone was clearly not being honest here) and regardless of whether it has happened before. The groomer not being up front with me or the owner was very upsetting, the way the situation was handled, and the unwillingness to call me back as promised and make up for the mistake was how they lost this long time customer.", "type": "review", "business_id": "zQoTg2HZgickIONX9oXToA"}

He ordered his phone from the AT&T website and designated the retail store on Decatur and Blue Diamond as his pick up location since it was so close to our house.  \n\nHe received an email stating his phone is ready for pick up.  He goes down there and speaks with one of the reps (female, extremely petit, around 4'10\" - you would know who I'm talking about if you saw her) and they go through the normal conversation - what's your name, the number of the original account, is this a new line, etc.  She told him he can't pick up the phone because he's not a authorized signer on the account but if the account holder can add his name, than he's good to pick it up.  \n\nI called AT&T and the rep walked me through doing the additional authorized signer online.  It took less than a minute and she confirmed that he can get the phone now.    \n\nThe in-store rep refused to give my husband his phone.  She said because he is newly added on, he would have to wait 2 days but if there is another authorized signer already on the account (myself), I can come anytime to get it.  \n\nI go to the store after work and was refused the phone as well.  Not only did the rep (Asian male) not give me the phone but he tried to sell me on a home wireless box.  Seriously!?!?\n\nTheir manager was rude and all she kept saying any new line has to be handled directly with the main account holder in person.  I asked her, shouldn't the store policy reflect AT&T corporate policy?  And since I spoke with AT&T directly they confirmed I could pick up the phone as I am authorized signer.  In addition, the little female rep that my husband spoke with earlier said I could pick it up as well AND she knew it was a new line.  \n\nI wouldn't be surprised if other people have customer service issues with this store.  I cant believe how inconsistent they are and the moment you have a discrepancy they all turn rude.

We sat at the bar as the 4 of us were very causal. Very comfortable bar stools, spacious, nice dark lighting, perfect old music...\n\nThe portions are huge so be careful of over ordering as we did. The broiled portabella was juicy and tasty. The caprese salad was very well prepared. The tower of chips and onion strings were ok (the chips were better, but a gigantic portion of onion strings)\n\nNext came the wedge salad. They cut it in half for my husband and I to split, and my plate alone was a huge dinner portion salad! Very crisp fresh iceberg lettuce and they served it on a chilled plate! Very smart touch.\n\nFinally, my husband and I split sides: Broccoli, creamed corn, grilled asparagus, and the baked potato no bacon. Again, huge sides. But all very good and very fresh. No microwave tasting potato or rubbery canned corn here.\n\nOH I forgot another fantastic part. The Pinot Noir from Oregon is fantastically smooth. The cheese platter is delicious. Its pricey though.... says market price on the menu so ask if you are interested. Ours came out to $27 I think, but they gave us a variety of 8 cheese (good portions of each), honeycomb, seasonal, sweet blueberries and blackberries, and dried sugared orange rinds. Perfect spread to construct many tasty little cheese breads.\n\nWill be back... great romantic spot for couples!", "type": "review", "business_id": "Kle8p08OShKRw5zwH4R1Gg"}

This location is my favorite. It's clean, doesn't stink like sweaty bodies, there's plenty of parking space. The staff here is friendlier. Ive met cool people and gained new friends, and I'm a fan of the group fitness classes they offer here.\n\nThe membership I signed up for included unlimited group fitness classes at Gold's Gym. This location here at Stephanie offers the most group classes. It's a no brainer taking advantage of  what they have for the membership price I got. They have classes for every level, low or high impact, some even designed for seniors!\n\nMy favorites are the dance fitness classes. Love Hot Hula Fitness! It's like a bit of Polynesian dancing, alot of cardio! It's a great core workout!  It's not high impact, it's not hot, temperature wise, but you'll sweat! The class isnt too crowded, so there's more room to move. The instructor provides the \"lava lava\" no special shoes needed, since you workout in bare feet. They welcome walk ins, and even if you are a few minutes late, or running on Hawaiian time like me... no worries, the class is easy to follow.\n\nThe Zumba classes are really popular too, especially the evening sessions, but don't get discouraged if it looks too crowded, you'll manage to move! ... but come early if you prefer to be at the front of the class. Wear comfy gym clothes and shoes. Bring water...that goes for anytime you come to the gym...that and a towel is a must!!!  Most classes are an hour but you'll have so much fun, it'll fly by!\n\nIt's never too late, you don't have to be a New Years resolutioner  to come try one of the classes they offer I encourage everyone to get into the \"fit life!\" Happy 2014!", "type": "review", "business_id": "ZHvCePeFfeZ9PN41JA-ZzQ"}

Unfortunately, the Yelp reviews let us down this time, WAY down. Although the pancakes were decent, they were nothing to wax poetic about. Two of my favorite comfort foods are fried zucchini and chicken pot pie, but their renditions are the worst that I have ever had, bar none The zucchini had this greasy and thick breaded coating which we ended up just picking off. The zucchini itself had this slimy, mushy yet fibrous/stringy consistency which was utterly disgusting. The chicken pot pie had a thin soggy pastry crust covering a gelatinous starchy filling that was virtually devoid of chicken or vegetables. To call it nasty is being generous. To add insult to injury, my wife's turkey sausage links were undercooked and still pink in the center. While the service was adequate, the value was not there. The meal cost over $30 for the two of us for one appetizer and two entrees with no drinks. At that price, you would expect decent or at the very least, mediocre food.
