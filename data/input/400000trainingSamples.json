Finally after much run around I was told we would have a man out for no charge Monday morning at 8am. Of course no one showed up. after 3 more calls and missed times finally we had a tech arrive at 12noon. They do NOT do what they say, they are rude, and not the least bit proactive.

What I mean by this is the quality of the meals and the atmosphere of this supper club is good enough to warrant return visits but not to elicit rave reviews.  I'm not a supper club kind of guy, so right off the bat a place like the Green Lantern isn't going to be my favorite.  However there are plenty of old school supper clubs that do a nice enough job that I've got no qualms tagging along for dinner on a Friday night.  The Green Lantern is one of these places, albeit just barely.\n\nMy friend, however, absolutely loves this place.  As such I've had cause to dine here many times over the years.  There are quite a few pluses.  The bartenders are quick and generally friendly, and they've got an adequate tap selection including Ale Asylum offerings.  I love the location right off the lake, and two-thirds of the seating areas have great atmosphere.  The service has always been above average and I can't think of a bad experience - this type of consistency over the years is very hard to maintain.  They've got Wiggies, which are kind of like low-rent roesti - hashbrowns with onions, peppers and American cheese.  And finally the Green Lantern is obviously popular with the denizens of McFarland.  I don't recall a single trip out here where the bar wasn't mostly full and the restaurant hopping.\n\nThe negatives: first and foremost I've always found the menu to be pretty limited.  I'm not big on fish fry, and the Green Lantern's Friday night menu doesn't have much else aside from sandwiches and a grilled chicken breast entree.  Now as I said, I'm not big on fish fry so my opinion should be taken lightly, but the times that I have ordered the fish I've been underwhelmed.  This is probably just me - my friend simply can't get enough of the stuff.  Prices are moderately high for the perceived quality, though the bar is quite reasonable.  There's also a bit of a hassle when it comes to paying the bill.  While I've never had any concerns with service from the waitstaff, I have stood around for upwards of 15 minutes waiting to have the hostess swipe my card.  That is unacceptable and it's unfortunately led to smaller tips to otherwise deserving waitresses.  Finally, it always seems that after waiting 20-30 minutes for a table on a Friday night we always end up either in the basement or at one of the few poorly located tables upstairs.  \n\nIf it were just up to me I don't think I'd be going to the Green Lantern all that much.  After all, I don't live in McFarland and I don't really go for supper club fish fries.  But so long as I know people that love going here I'll tag along and have a decent enough time.  I think you'd be hard pressed not to at least be able to do that at the Green Lantern.", "type": "review", "business_id": "rdAdANPNOcvUtoFgcaY9KA"}

There are a few places in the mag that I am looking forward to trying but Green Lantern was the first one that we hit up.  \n\nDriving up the place looked kind of small and beat up which was not what I was expecting and not looking forward to.  As we got closer however I realized how big this place was on the inside.  It's huge!   At least it felt huge from where we were sitting.  I'm not sure if it was the article in the magazine that attributed to how crazy busy this place was or if there was a concert or what but this place was insane.  I mean we had to wait for an hour for our table.  On the plus side we had to wait an hour for our table which meant an hour of drinking so I can't really complain.\n\nBecause we had been waiting for so long we also had a chance to look at the menu so when we  finally sat down we knew exactly what we wanted; the waitress loved this.  We started with the calamari which I'm starting to find out is not one of Wisconsin's strong suits.  I don't think I have ever had good calamari here; maybe this will be my next food challenge 'The Great Calamari Showdown'!  Anyway, I had a few pieces of that and let the man have the rest'' he actually really liked it.  \n\nI ordered the salad which was huge, cheesy mashed potato, and 3 pieces of the lightly breaded cod.  The man order the same but with cheesy hash browns.  The fish was pretty good.  It was juicy and fresh and not bad.  I thought it was maybe just a little over the top with the seasoning.  I think I would have enjoyed it more if the flavors were a bit more subtle as opposed to all up in my face the way it was.  With that said however I though it was alright.  The man on the other hand was in love.  He likened his enjoyment of this place to the Tornado Room.  Pure blasphemy.

I guess I could think of a few things.\n\nI went there today for the first time and was dazzled by the charm it flaunted, while still maintaining the gritty edge of a backwoods Wisconsin eatery.  Let's not get it twisted folks, we're not breaking gastronomic ground here.  What we are breaking are your misconceptions of what a restaurant can be whose parking lot is largely composed of Chevy and Dodge trucks, and whose front, snow-covered, lawn is full of snowmobiles.  Deal with it kids, this is that slice of Midwest Americana you've been looking for in any number of wayside eateries in rural America.  Fish fry anyone?\n\nTo begin, let me explain that one of the many draws for the Beach House's patrons is the fact that it is still legal to smoke indoors in McFarland.  I stepped inside and was immediately made aware of this fact as plumes of smoke took up residence in my clothes and nose.  \n\nDo not fear, however, there is a separate dining room that is nonsmoking.  And man was this separate dining room packed (Superbowl Sunday).  Packed with large women squeezing into convention center chairs.  Packed with waitresses who wore skin tight white Jordache jeans, giving you a fleeting sense of their giving nature.  Packed with the eager anticipation of an entire day spent watching football and football-related activities: drooling, eating, drinking, and smoking.  God bless America.\n\nThe AM dish to get here is the Walleye and eggs breakfast.  I would tend to agree, although their limited selection of omelets is made marginally more tasty by the addition of broccoli (you heard me punk).  As breakfast wore on, the dining room filled, emptied, and filled again; the waitstaff eagerly setting new places, removing paper place settings, calling people darlin' and hon'(always appreciated).\n\nSo give it to me hard backwoods Wisconsin.  Give me every sinew of your being: your ice fishing, snowmobiling, smoking, bloody Mary drinking, being.  Just be.  And give me a friggin' huge piece of deep fried walleye to help me digest the spectacle, with scrambled eggs on the side.

I can say that the breading was perfectly crispy and well seasoned and that the fish was not at all over cooked, nice and moist. plus I think it cost $10 which was awesome (you can't get fish for breakfast at these prices in Chicago) \n\nFor me the biggest highlight of breakfast here is what they do to the potatoes (their name for them is eluding me at the moment) by request they will top your breakfast potatoes with a heap of meat, veggies and cheese, enough to make it a hangover-soaking-up meal unto itself.\n\nTo sum it all up: if you find yourself looking for breakfast and a little \"hair o' the dog\" in McFarland Wisconsin because \"What happens at the Beach House, stays at the Beach House\" and we all love that about any restaurant.", "type": "review", "business_id": "_wZTYYL7cutanzAnJUTGMA"}

She said that she would have the kitchen make up a new meal, and about 15 minutes later she returned with my same plate, with my original fork and original food.

When we got to The Parsonage, I was so happy we decided to stay there instead of in Madison proper.  It was quiet and cozy.  We picked the Mentor room which had a big awesome jacuzzi tub in there, and also a really nice outdoor patio (which was covered in snow, but i bet will be awesome when spring comes!).   Our bed was SO COMFORTABLE, i think i actually miss it.  Since our room didn't have a shower (which we knew when we booked - well worth it to have that awesome bathtub!), I used the shared bathroom on the second floor which was also very nice and cozy.  Breakfast the next day was so nice.  Craig made homemade cranberry orange muffins with a cheesy kale egg dish - so yummy!  Everyone else got delicious smelling bacon, and Craig very awesomely made me veggie breakfast sausage.  There was also pineapple, juice, and a really great tea selection.  The conversation was also really nice - I like that we all ate together (me, my boyfriend, Craig, and the 5 other guests who were staying there.  Great people and great company.

I don't actually remember the specific dishes I ordered (I've had fish, chicken, pork, and beef there), but it all just tasted as if it had been sitting in the freezer for months.

The waitstaff has always been attentive and professional, and the wait time for food is reasonably short. The restaurant itself and the bathrooms are clean and spacious. The ambiance is relaxed and pleasant, and noise levels are comfortably low.\n\nBut none of these things can save the mediocre-to-bad food. That is, if you get your food at all. On more than one occasion, they have forgotten to include entire entrees or side dishes when I've picked up take-out. I now double-check all of my orders before leaving. The egg rolls taste like they came out of a box in the freezer. They are greasy and heavy, with very little flavor until you douse them in sweet-and-sour sauce that's so sweet it might as well be syrup. The same problems plague the entirely unremarkable crab rangoon. I've had the hot and sour soup, and disliked the taste quite a bit. Not spicy enough, and far too sour. I usually order the ginger beef stir-fry. There's hardly any ginger flavor, and the sauce is thick and also fairly sweet. If they halved the amount of sugar in everything, it would be a good start. I've had more success with the sizzling black pepper beef, which has a punch of black pepper and a good balance of meat and vegetables. On a recent trip, a friend got the beef lo mein. It had a nice quantity of beef, but an anemic quantity of vegetables. It was also very greasy and watery, and tasted extremely bland. The only reason I go here as often as I do is that my grandmother (the poster child for stereotypical Wisconsin taste buds, bless her heart) loves the three delicacies sizzling rice.\n\nI did discover one saving grace: if you dump sriracha on the food, it blends very well with the food and elevates all of the flavors. Too bad they don't have any of it at the restaurant, it could save many a dish. Bottom line: there's much better, more authentic, more balanced, and less heavy Chinese food available in Madison at comparable prices.

Waited a full 2 hours for our food. So if you have don't mind waiting an unbelievable amount of time for food and have all day to waste, then read on. . .\n\nFor years I have drove by the Imperial Garden and referred to it as the \"Chinese Restaurant Gas Station\". I don't even know if they are connected or what, but you see them both as you turn the corner. We decided to go to this place for Mother's Day and check it out. Talking to friends over the weekend, we were told it was pretty good.\n\nThe building is nice and the atmosphere of the restaurant was way nicer than I expected. Very large and nicely decorated. Not so cheesy like a lot of Chinese-American places in Wisconsin. The hostess greeted us very nicely and having reservations we were seated right away. \n\nNow - we were a larger than average group - table of 8 - but they clearly were set up for groups this big as they had large tables in the corner of the rooms with a spinning lazy susan in the middle that was perfect for us. I think we probably could have even gotten 9 or 10 people on this table. The waitress was very nice too. Came right away and got us drinks and very friendly.\n\nThis is when things went down hill. We did order appetizers, which came out right away. Pot Stickers - both steamed and fried - which were pretty good. Once our whole group arrived we all ordered regular items from their menu. Then we waited. Waited and waited and waited. Apparently so did everyone around us. For hours - over two to be exact. The waitress did her best - kept coming by and telling us she was sorry, that the Kitchen was crazy and that we were next. Honestly we should have left - but it was hard enough getting family members from 4 households together at one time. \n\nEventually the food came out. To their credit, I thought everything tasted pretty good. I got two different shrimp dishes. Decent flavor, cooked perfectly - the snap peas and water chestnuts were good. Portion was decent on the Shrimp dinner and much larger on the chicken dinners that others in my group got. I agree with other reviews - its not the most adventurous food. Flavors were safe and my spicy shrimp wasn't very spicy at all. My sister-in-law was upset her Sesame Chicken with Broccoli came with one piece of broccoli. She complained and the waitress brought out a side of broccoli.\n\nOverall, If the food wasn't pretty good - I would have given this place one star. I give our waitress credit for holding it together too. She offered free desert but we were about an hour late for getting to another place so had to go. Saddest thing is we heard that this has been an ongoing problem with the Kitchen. Sounds like they don't fire dishes in the order they come in and they have a lot of trouble keeping up with things. If they could correct this problem and add a bit more flavor into a few dishes, the place really could be ok.\n\nTry it on your own risk - but I would plan on spending several long hours while you wait for your food.", "type": "review", "business_id": "SKLw05kEIlZcpTD5pqma8Q"}

My usual dish is Cashew Chicken.  It's hard to deviate from that when it's sooooo good.  Other dishes are excellent as well.  What I like about Imperial is that the meat quality is good.

The chicken is good as well - not some of the gray chicken-like material found at lesser establishments.  \n\nWe don't dine in often or at all.

That's the way to go here, imho.\n\nTheir location is very convenient for those of us that work in town and live in the western 'burbs.

It was perfectly seasoned for my taste, though it was a bit hot for my mother.  The tilapia was lightly fried and was still tender.  The accompanying refried beans were decent, and served to allow for the spice from the tacos to dissipate.  I still put the blackened tilapia tacos at Tex Tubbs at the top of my favorites list, but these easily jumped to the #2 position.  On previous trips I've gotten flautas, which were perfectly fried and not too crispy, and the enchiladas sonora, which comes with an excellent spinach and a creamy sauce.  I also really enjoy the cheese and mushroom quesidilla and the fajitas.  My sister, who is lactose-intolerant, had found the menu a bit dairy-laden, but she did end up finding a chicken breast entree that is now her favorite.  The prices are quite reasonable and given the amount of food always a good deal.

We called Acura Roadside Assistance and they sent out a tow truck that jumped us so that we could drive to the nearest dealer to have the car looked at and fixed. The closest Acura dealer was Zimbrick of Middleton and we dealt with Shane (the manager) in the service department. They replaced the battery in our car and then informed us that our car now had a check engine light on. We asked if they could pull the codes and tell us what was wrong or even clear them and see if they came back. He told us that we would have to take the car in its current condition with the light on because he said, \"It's the day after Christmas and I just don't have the manpower to deal with it.\". My Husband reiterated to Shane that he please just pull the codes so that we have an idea of what we were dealing with, Shane refused. We were worried about taking the car as we were traveling from Minneapolis to Chicago and it already broke down on us once. Plus, with the delay of the battery ordeal we'd be getting into Chicago during rush hour. We decided to cancel our hotel reservation that we had for that night in Chicago and called Acura of Brookfield. They said they could get us in first thing the next morning to scan it and see why there was a check engine light on. So we spent the night in Brookfield and that dealer took great care of us! They even reserved a rental car in case it was needed. I just wish that's who we would've went to first. Oh, and I forgot to mention earlier...Zimbrick of Middleton put a three inch black scuff on the drivers side rear quarter panel of our white car while it was in the shop.

If I reviewed my first stay if probably would have been 2 or 3 stars. Lucky for them.  \n\nBack to my most recent stay.  It was the best experience ever.  (Second to the Double Tree in Carmel, IN.)  I walked in the lobby around 1PM and was greeted by Bobbie.  He was handling the desk by himself and I explained that we would wait in the lobby until they had a room ready (since we were 2 hours early for check in).  \n\nMy husband was anxious to watch the Bears game so he found a spot in the cozy waiting area with a big screen TV.  Bobbie offered to check us in early and I asked about our accommation request to be near the elevator or an area that would require very little walking.  It appeared that he may have had a challenge with our request.\n\nI explained the huge inconvenience with our last visit.  The lady that checked us in, sent us to one of the farthest rooms along the zig zag cooridor.  AFTER we requested a room that required very little walking (due to traveling with a family member on oxygen) and THAT was the best they could do for us?  My husband was exhausted before he was half way to the room.  Needless to say, he didn't want me to request a \"closer\" room after that.  This is why I give them my request when I book the room.\n\nFortunately for all of us, the extra planning helped. An extra bonus was that Bobbie ask if I was Priority Club Rewards member.  Well I wasn't, but I planned on asking...and of course it slipped my mind.  Thankfully, because Bobbie asked me about it, I am now a Priority Club member! This is great because we will be coming here a few times a year.  Bobbie was really good about explaining the details of the membership and even let me know how I can get extra points online.\n\nDid I say how great Bobbie was?  Well...he was everywhere!  He hand-delivered our new membership information to our room (with chocolate and a beverage). Whenever he saw me in the lobby, he always asked if there was anything I needed.  He also helped out with the breakfast buffet in the morning.  He literaly was everywhere!  It's not like he was leaning on the counter when I saw him.  No, he was very proactive in genuinely making his guests feel comfortable.  He's definitely a keeper.  \n\nWhenever I'm in the Madison area, I will continue to book at this Staybridge because of my experience and the excellent service that Bobbie provided.", "type": "review", "business_id": "rKNtd_M2kWDW8sQKYzetKA"}

Earlier this year, I had a one-bedroom suite for almost three months.  A family member was in the hospital at UW-Madison during this time and this hotel was more than accommodating for the specific needs in our situation.\n\nI'm not going to go into the specific details of the accommodations partly to protect individual privacy.  The other reason not to get so detailed is simply because I think the staff went so far out of their way that these \"favors\" may potentially be abused by other guests if they were aware of the extreme kindness.  \n\nAs I mentioned, this hotel offered many special accommodations.  This allowed us to truly  feel like we had a \"home away from home\".  Most of the staff knew me by name.  They were sensitive to the fact that I had a loved one who was in the hospital and critically ill. I wasn't alone in this, though.  There were many other guests in a similar (if not same) situation as me.  This hotel could be a pilot for partnering up with hospitals in a win, win, win scenario that benefits the hotel, hospital, and the guest/patient.  In addition, I would not be surprised if they have special training for their staff in the area of customer service and handling special accommodations.  \n\nThe manager, Brad, is visible and on-site on a regular basis.  He and his staff organize and manage a social for their guests three nights a week.  The social offers a free meal and drinks (including beer and wine) for a couple hours in the evening. And, as the name describes, it allows their guests an excellent opportunity to socialize.  \n\nThere are several hotel options recommended by UW and we tried three of them.  This one may be five miles away from the main UW hospital, but it is a straight shot along University Avenue.  Now that UW purchased the Best Western Intowner, there is much more of a push with them recommending their newly owned property to UW patients.  The Intowner is fine, but the best thing going for it is how close it is to the hospital. The Staybridge-Middleton, outshines them in so may ways - indoor pool, hot tub, laundry facility, garage, large suites, kitchenettes, socials, breakfast buffet,and most of all...the staff.\n\nUnfortunately, I can not remember all the names of the staff that I would love to thank.  Our housekeeper was perfect.  She cleaned only when we needed it and got to know our preferences.  For instance, she asked if we could use an extra box of Kleenex because she remembered us requesting an extra box the week before.  She always did a great job cleaning and freshening up our room and never invaded our space. \n\nI noticed how well the staff work together as a team and support each other when the need arises.  It's obvious that the staff members are cross-trained to manage various work areas and different shifts.  For instance, I first met Bonnie on the shuttle.  She arrived at UW Hospital to pick me up.  She even showed me a quicker route back to the hotel during rush hour.  During my stay, I also saw Bonnie at the front desk, at the breakfast buffet, in the kitchen area, in the dining area, managing the socials, and even came to our suite to fix the television!  It turned out that the remote needed new batteries - which she was prepared for.\n\nI also feel like I got to know Ana pretty well since she worked the breakfast buffet many mornings.  Between her and Bonnie, I just don't know how they always seem to make everything run so smoothly.  \n\nThere is another lady with short blonde hair (sorry, I can't seem to remember her name)  that always worked the socials.  She was so welcoming and learned what I like to eat and drink.  She even encouraged me to take food \"to-go\"  when I needed to rush back to the hospital.  It was like being with family.\n\nJan, Justin and Bobby are always a pleasure at the front desk.  Not only are they welcoming, but they go out their way to get answers to your questions and take care of any requests.  \n\nMy final comments are definitely not the least important.  During my stay, I noticed that there was a team of about three housekeeping staff members who appeared to have cognitive/mental disabilities.  I was so pleased to see this and know that this hotel and the manager recognize the need to utilize talents that are so often overlooked. There may have been moments of inconvenience for the guests or perhaps mistakes made by these staff members.  However, this is how they learn and become an integral part of society.  I commend Brad Cook for making diversity a priority.\n\nUntil my next stay...", "type": "review", "business_id": "rKNtd_M2kWDW8sQKYzetKA"}

It's largely a \"self-service\" type place, which is fine by me.  You place your order at the main counter, get your own coffee and condiments, find a table and wait for the food to arrive.  When you're done eating, you clear your own table, take the dishes to the \"dish basket\" and head on your merry way.\n\nThe pancakes aren't anything spectacular - just your regular \"mix made\" pancakes.  They're cooked well, with nice color, and are \"plate size\" so one or two should be plenty for most folks.  They're not obscenely thick; in fact, they're a bit on the thin side, come to think of it.\n\nBreakfast sandwich is decent - an egg, your choice of meat, some cheese, and served on a muffin.\n\nI've also had the Wright Breakfast and today, I had the special, which was two eggs, scrambled with tomatoes, peppers, onion, ham, cheese and a choice of toast.  Again - it was good, but not \"out of this world great.\"\n\nThey're currently serving Alterra-brand coffee; another review references Ancora, but it looks like they've switched to Alterra.  It's good coffee, nonetheless.\n\nStaff keeps largely to themselves, which is nice - no one bothers you throughout the meal.  They don't take credit/debit cards - it's cash or check only.  There's a fair amount of seating indoors and a few metal tables and chairs outside for when the weather is nice.  There tends to be a lot of families that meet here on the weekends, so if kids aren't your thing, steer clear on Saturday and Sunday.  I had the joy of listening to two screaming kids during my entire meal this morning - the parents were oblivious... \n\nMy biggest gripe?  Price.  My breakfast this morning (\"special\" plus two pancakes plus coffee) cost $14.10.  That's a little steep for standard breakfast fare...\n\nBreakfast is served all-day long on Saturday and Sunday; during the week it's served until 11am, at which point it's lunch only until closing time (around 3pm, I believe).", "type": "review", "business_id": "ShEYKerTwb2LSORE5o_s7A"}

It's a short bike ride from the 53597 and the Alterra Coffee (or is it Colectivo now, I'm so confused) they serve beats the pants off of what you can get from the neighboring Starbucks.  \n\nI wish the outdoors seating area took advantage of the nearby Pheasant Branch Conservancy.  Sipping coffee and watching the locals pick-up their dry-cleaning just isn't the vibe I'm looking for I guess.  \n\nI can't vouch for the breakfast or lunch selections, since I'm just a coffee and baked goods sort of guy.  As for baked goods, I've had some excellent scones and muffins at Prairie.  Like scream it from the rooftop great.  But not every time.  Just when I'm ready to proclaim Prairie my go to coffee and a scone hangout, I get a scone that's as dry as Atacama Desert.

Even when the place is getting slammed by waves of morning commuters looking for their sugar and caffeine fix, I always get a smile and courteous service.\n *  Always love me some free wi--fi.  Never had a problem connecting or with download speeds.\n * The noise level indoors always seems to be a soft murmur, with some relaxing music wafting in the background.  Never had a problem carrying on a conversation with my table mates.\n * When the FDA approves Alterra Coffee for intravenous use, I'll be first in line.  There are always are four or five roasts to choose from and I've never had a skunky cup.\n\nThings I don't\n *The \"cash only\" thing was so hip in the 18th century, but it's 2013 now.  Start taking plastic, people.\n * The baked goods are not inexpensive.  It's usually worth it, but it's annoying as hell when I lose the muffin lottery.\n\nIt's a solid three star option with lots of upside if the bakery improves its consistency.", "type": "review", "business_id": "ShEYKerTwb2LSORE5o_s7A"}

When we bring our dog to All Pets, she never seems anxious or fearful, as she had occasionally at our old vet's office, which I can only attribute to the genuine love and care the entire staff seems to exhibit towards all the animals that come in. to their clinic. I would recommend All Pets to any pet owner I know with no hesitation.", "type": "review", "business_id": "9874O-3GjXPotxYKNNAz5Q"}

More on that later.\n\nWe started at the bar and the bar tender was super cool.  He made a fantastic Sazerac, one of the oldest cocktails in the USA.  The four of us admired the decor of the establishment in addition to the fun columns throughout that separated the patrons making it a more private experience.  This place is in a basement  and the columns separate everyone, different than all the open air structures these days.\n\nWe had reservations and were seated about 10 minutes late however we were flexible.  The waitress was not very friendly and did not smile.  She was making the motions.  Likely tired because it was Badger Homecoming Saturday and they were busy.  We were celebrating a birthday and asked if they did anything special.  She said I don't know and can check.  When she came back she said if you buy a desert, we can put a candle in it.  What??  What restaurant does not do something for a birthday.  Oh well, move on...\n\nEach of us DID enjoy our meal.  We had the Crawfish Cheesecake for appetizer.  It was like a cheesecake?  Different and good.  Two of us ordered separate specials and the other two ordered items off the menu.  None of us could finish and we enjoyed leftovers the next day.  The food was rich and heavy, comfort food like.  If you are on a diet you'd need to be selective because no calories are spared here.\n\nIn summary a happy waitress and a little birthday treat and this place would be through the roof!", "type": "review", "business_id": "koRLvzIl-4fCybOIdk56jA"}

We had the artichoke hearts, crab puffs, and escargots for appetizers.  I didn't get the sense that the seafood was fresh.  Rather it was definitely of the frozen variety.  And everything was made with frozen puff pastry.  Even the escargot were covered with puff pastry. I think it was to cover for the frozen seafood?  Anyway, the appetizers reminded me of Pinterest recipes.  \n\nA big red flag for me is when there are too many components in a dish.  That usually means that the ingredients aren't good enough to stand out on their own or the chef doesn't know how to edit.  I think we experienced a little of both.  \n\nMy husband and I both got the special. It was a blackened pork tenderloin with shrimp accompanied by mushrooms in a sherry sauce with red potatoes.  Each component sounded good.  However, the presentation and preparation was a train wreck.  \n\nThe tenderloin came on skewers.  What?  The shrimp were over cooked.  The meat and shrimp were served in a jumble of quartered red potatoes and mushrooms.  Everything was covered in some sort of Cajun seasoning that was reminiscent of Durkee or McCormick.  Then it was all topped with some sort of cornstarch thickened sherry sauce.  The whole thing tasted like it was straight off the Sysco truck  and reheated. \n\nOne of our companions ordered the filet.  She let us have a taste, and the steak was good.  But it came with a buerre blanc dipping sauce.  I'm not sure what chef would pair buerre blanc with steak to begin with, but just like my meal, it was clear that the buerre blanc was another corn starch imposter.  \n\nDessert was a dark chocolate creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e.  It was dry and pedestrian.  \n\nReally I think this place deserves 2.5 stars, but Yelp doesn't do half stars, so I'll be generous.  Lousiannes clearly has a loyal customer base and is a popular place.  I would definitely go back for the cocktails and even the appetizers because the price point wasn't outrageous for all the puff pastry and I could still enjoy them now that I know what to expect.  \n\nBut I would not return for dinner.  If I'm going to spend $30 for an entree, I expect fresh ingredients, sauces made to order, and a chef that knows how to cook.  Madison has too many restaurants that offer far superior food to Lousiannes, and that's what will drive my future dining decisions.", "type": "review", "business_id": "koRLvzIl-4fCybOIdk56jA"}

Having never been to Louisianne's in the 5 years that I've lived in Middleton, I suggested we try it out.\n\nI give the atmosphere of this place a solid five stars. Although it has an rather bland looking storefront, the inside of the restaurant is anything but. You walk into Louisianne's and immediately head downstairs. It's all stone and looks like you're walking into a cool cave or something. It's dark, but there's a lot of ambiance. I've been to New Orleans, and it definitely has that sort of vibe to it. It's romantic, fun, and not what you'd expect from the outside. I felt like we were on vacation while we were there. Also, there was a live jazz band playing and they were really rocking. It was awesome!\n\nWe went at about 8pm on a Friday night had to wait about ten minutes for a table, which was fine. While we waited, we ordered drinks at the bar and watched the band. I had red wine, and my husband had Jameson on the rocks. \n\nWe were seated and ordered the Pecan Crab Cakes as an appetizer. They were good, probably just 3 stars though, as they tasted a lot like other Midwestern crab cakes that I've had before. They were heavy on bread and light on crab...with a lot of Old Bay seasoning. Again, they weren't bad at all, but not spectacular.\n\nNext, we ordered some more wine and our entrees (more on those in a minute).  We were given a choice of soup or salad with our entrees and we each ordered soup. They had two soups of the day: a shrimp -corn chowder (which I got), and a tomato-based pulled pork stew that was like chilli (which my husband had). Both soups were fantastic! Definitely 5 stars for the soup. \n\nI'll take a minute here to comment that I enjoy going to traditional restaurants from time to time, places where soup/salad and bread are included with your meal instead of everything being ala-cart. (It reminds me of dining in Wisconsin supper clubs as a child). By the way, the bread basket was delicious and was quickly replenished by the waitress after we ate all of the bread within 30 seconds of sitting down because it was warm and toasty (and served with soft butter) and we were starving! \n\nOnto the entrees! My husband absolutely LOVED his dish. He claims that it was possibly \"the best thing I've ever had in a restaurant\". He chose the Coffee Roasted Chicken, which featured a bed of (homemade) fettuccine topped with a coffee-crusted bone-in grilled chicken breast, in a \"hazelnut, orange, ricotta sauce\". I think there was spinach in it too. The pasta was perfectly al dente, the grilled chicken moist, and the sauce was rich and creamy. It almost reminded me of a Thai peanut sauce, but with hazelnuts instead. Although it sounded like something that could become cloyingly sweet, it was not. It had a nice subtle umami essence in addition to the sweetness. Delicious. 5 stars.\n\nThe reason that Louisianne's is not getting a five star review from me, however, is due to my entree, which I felt was very underwhelming. We don't eat pasta at home for health reasons, so I usually get it when we go somewhere nice as a special treat. I chose the tasso and shrimp fettuccine because it was homemade pasta, and because it featured authentic New Orleans style ingredients (for the unfamiliar, tasso is basically spicy ham). The shrimp and tasso pieces in my pasta were well-cooked, but they were sparse. The dish also featured mushrooms, and they were fabulous...probably the best part. However, the pasta was supposed to have a \"Creole mustard cream sauce\", and it didn't really. The sauce was very light, and had little flavor. It was kind of sad, because I was really hoping to be wowed and I wasn't. I'd say my item was probably 3 stars, and would have been awesome if only the sauce had been a bit more pronounced and flavorful. \n\nThe service was adequate. Nothing remarkable in either a good or a bad way.\n\nSummary: I'd definitely return. I think Lousianne's Etc. is a decently nice restaurant overall, and is great for special occasions. Their primary issue, from both my own experience as well as the reviews on Yelp, seems to be consistency. Some menu items are fabulous, and others are meh. The major problem with this is that Louisianne's  menu is at a price point where people only go occasionally...so the restaurant basically has one shot to impress, and if they fail at that, guests won't return for a second chance. I think this explains why the Yelp reviews for Louisianne's are so polarized.", "type": "review", "business_id": "koRLvzIl-4fCybOIdk56jA"}

It's disturbing that Parent's lives are so unfulfilled that they have to dress their children like Cocktail waitresses at a seedy bar. \nThe hotel was totally booked. You had ten floors worth of rooms, but yet the hotel only had two elevators. It was pretty annoying to wait 15 minutes every time you wanted to go up to your room. \nAnd the kicker was on Sunday morning when we wanted to have breakfast at the hotel restaurant. The hotel had nobody on duty to bus tables, so while it was obvious that the restaurant was half empty, but there was a 15 minute wait to be seated. Of course the hostess acted like an office temp, with a bad attitude. That was a perfect ending to our hell stay at the Marriott-Madison West.

I've logged over 50 nights at this hotel so I think I'm decently qualified to offer a balanced review.  This last stay will be my last overall.  Although the staff is generally friendly & professional, their competence is questionable.  I could offer a list of offenses but it would take too long & most aren't major, just a little annoying. Concierge lounge is fine, no complaints.  Overall, the hotel gives the impression that it is too large for its operating budget and the competence of the staff.  It greatly lacks attention to detail.  I frequently have to call for things that have been left out of the room (missing hairdryer, washcloths, double body wash but no shampoo...and so on).   The linens are old and tired (holes in the sheets & duvet covers, limp towels, some with stains).  I am a platinum member of Marriott and am always booked into a King room.  This time, they put me in a room with 2 doubles for no reason.  I immediately changed rooms and the TV did not work.  I then plugged my laptop into the lamp and it made a loud \"pop\" and blue sparks came out.  All of the power in the room was then knocked out.  This is unacceptable, as the wiring in that lamp was obviously faulty & dangerous.  I was lucky my computer was not fried.  The last straw came when I killed a large fly in the room with the first thing I could grab, which was the paper breakfast menu.  I then crumpled the menu and threw it away.  The next day, the housekeeper had removed the menu from the garbage can and placed it on my pillow.  I know it was the same menu b/c it was creased exactly where I crumpled it up.  Outrageous.  Anyone who would think this is acceptable service is out of their mind.  I will not stay here again and do not recommend it for business travelers.

Room service was very friendly and the food was YUM. The toilet handle was misbehaving and while it took some time for engineering to fix it, they were beyond apologetic and did all of the things you'd expect a good hotel to do - either offer a room change/upgrade or other free stuff. The hotel is in Middleton so don't book a room here and then complain that it's not downtown. Look at a map. How is it the hotel's fault that you are in need of additional IQ points? \n\nSo many Yelpers like to complain about every dumb, little thing without understanding that it's not about perfection, it's about how a business responds to a problem.

I recently attended an evening Board meeting and a one-day conference at this hotel.\n\nThe majority of the sales and catering staff at the Marriott were wonderful to work with.  This was the first time we hosted at event at this location.  The responsiveness of the staff was superb in setting up the event.  There were proactive in keeping our group on track with logistical issues leading up to the event.  On the day of the event, they checked in on us frequently and promptly addressed any concerns our group had.\n\nWe had some problems with the reservations agents indicating that no rooms were available at the conference rate.  The other problem has to do with the layout of the conference rooms.  There is one conference room (the Monona Room) located by the front desk, far away from all the other meeting rooms.  On the day before the event, you guessed it; the Marriott staff moved us to that room.  The calendar of events is not conspicuous, so on the day of the event, all the conference attended entered the facility through the conference center doors and wandered about searching for the Monona Room.\n\nLike most conference facility, the food was a mixed bag.\n\nThings I liked:\n* I enjoyed the caesar salad served with lunch with fresh greens (no iceberg lettuce), tangy dressing and herbed croutons that did not go overboard with the salt or garlic.\n\n* Other than the overcooked noodles, the penne pasta with mushroom, spinach, goat cheese, pine nuts and roasted red pepper cream was a well-executed dish.\n\n* While the filling had a bit too much citrus flavor, kudos to the kitchen staff for serving us a cannoli with a crunchy shell, a rarity on the conference food circuit.\n\nThings I didn't:\n* The rigatoni with fennel sausage, roasted peppers and arriabiatta sauce lacked the finesse of the aforementioned penne pasta dish.  With its mushy noodles, overcooked sauce and under-seasoned sausage, there was little to like.\n\n* If you enjoy a heavy does of garlic powder on bread with the texture of a teething biscuit, you would love the garlic bread served with the pasta course.\n\n* My least favorite dish was toasted cheese sandwich served during the planning session the day before the conference.  For $14.95, I expected aged cheddar served on gently grilled slices of artisan sourdough bread.  What I received was very different.  Served barely warm, the bread was soaked in butter and toasted to a brick-like texture that left cuts on the roof of my mouth.  The institutional grade cheddar and provolone cheese had started to congeal by the time the staff served it to me.  The server did not check in with us because she didn't want to interfere with our meeting, preventing me from sending this dish back for a replacement.  The roasted tomato soup, though cool, was the redeeming feature of my meal.\n\nOverall, the experience with the Marriott Madison West was A-OK, based on the positive interactions with the staff, which offset the spotty food quality.", "type": "review", "business_id": "ckLRf3lYn9DxmNxd-mu2yA"}

It is never too sweet or too oily.  The right use of butter also gives a desirable texture as well.

Fish was solid - nicely done, especially for the price and speed.\n\nDetailed review:\n\nI'd never visited the Middleton Sport Bowl prior to today, so I wasn't quite sure what to expect.  We arrived exactly at noon, parked, and made our way to the bar, where we found two seats and were promptly greeted by a bartender.\n\nWe both ordered the lunch special - 2 piece deep fried cod plate with fries, slaw, tartar, dinner roll, and soda.  The bartender took our order and came back with a complimentary bowl of popcorn, which was a nice surprise.\n\nPlates arrived about 10 minutes later - the fish was appropriately sized, as were the fries - no imbalance, and portions were fair.\n\nThe fish itself had a flavorful beer batter that was a little thicker than what you'll typically find at most places, but it was delicious and I welcomed the extra crunch.\n\nInside, the fish itself was a tad watery with just a hint of grease - not anything outrageous, but just enough to sense that it was there.  Flavor of the fish was incredibly mild; the batter stole some of its thunder.  \n\nThe fries were excellent - battered-style and straight cut.  I'm told the slaw and tartar were \"average.\"  Dinner roll was hard and dry.\n\nTotal lunch bill for two: $14.64, and we were in-and-out within 35 minutes.  Totally acceptable and a good lunch, all things considered.\n\nMiddleton Sport Bowl = NEUTRAL\n\nFood = 2.75 to 3 stars (average; not bad, not spectacular)\nService = 3.5 stars (prompt and friendly)\nValue = 4 stars \nMISC = 3 stars (actually seemed to be a nice bowling alley/bar)\n\nSummary: Not a win, nor a fail.  I'd go back for the fish at lunch, and will definitely be back to sample other foods - the sandwiches looked really good.", "type": "review", "business_id": "lN-5-YTsaJr_IByyA476iw"}

The Stamm House is walking distance from home, so I figured we HAD to try it... \n\nFirst off, let me say that the atmosphere is typical old(emphasis on the old)-school Wisconsin restaurant. Wood paneling, dated tables and chairs, and GOD AWFUL seventies music piped in. When we walked in(at six on a Saturday night) there was one couple at the bar, and another couple dining upstairs near us. The waiter seated us--close to the kitchen, I realized with disappointment. If I want to hear dishes clanging and the hustle and bustle, I'd be cooking at home. Dining out is for pretending that there's no work involved. It also didn't help that because it was so slow in the restaurant, I could hear every comment the waiter said to the cook-staff, some of which wasn't patron-friendly. \n\nThe BF ordered the fried walleye,and I the beef tips Moutarde. His french onion soup was decent, but my salad was lacking. When the meal arrived, I was so excited because I was STARVED. I picked up a piece of beef with my fork and bit down into tender, juicy...FAT. Fatty fatty fatness. Ewww. I did the not-so-sexy-spit-it-onto-the-side-plate maneuver. All right. Every now and then you get a fatty piece of meat in a dish. A girl can move on. MY next bite was better, and although the sauce was decent, it was nothing fabulous. I was disappointed when my next piece was also quite fatty. You know when you get that cheap meat that is mostly sinew and fat. *Sigh* I'm done. I pushed the dish off to the side and settled for my potato. \n\nTo give credit, the waiter noticed I wasn't eating the dish, and asked me if something was wrong. I told him, and he offered to get me something else, which I declined(by the time it was made, Chris would have been done with his dish). Later, he also offered a free dessert, which we really didn't want. He ended up knocking almost half off my dish, which was appropriate, I think. \n\nOver all, it just wasn't enjoyable. I could have gotten over picking a bad dish if the experience itself was nice, but it wasn't. Average at best. The waiter was decent and tried to be accommodating, but on the whole, it was just sub-par. I left wishing that I had picked another spot to spend my hard earned date-night budget! I realize that a place like this isn't going to be gourmet, but I've had MUCH better casual dining experiences...for less money!", "type": "review", "business_id": "IEmqrFe96NOhU07TA0rZdw"}

Unfortunately, that's about all it has to offer, unless you enjoy food that is extremely greasy, and of mediocre quality.\n\nDetailed review: Our fish fry crew decided to give Stamm House a try after we'd read good things about it on a fairly well known fish fry review website.  Normally, those guys (the reviewers) are pretty spot on, but they've completely missed the mark when it comes to the Stamm House.  Not even close to being a top-10 place, no way, no how.\n\nWe sauntered in to the Stamm House at around 5:45 on Friday night and were shocked to find the place darned-near empty.  The bartender greeted us immediately - very friendly guy - we ordered a couple of New Glarus Nakeds and a Spotted Cow.  After downing the first round, we went to order a refill, and whoops - Naked went empty, and there wasn't any more left.  Drat.\n\nAfter downing a second round of beers (Cows all around this time), it dawned on us that we probably needed to inquire about a table.  So, we wandered upstairs where a friendly lady told us she'd have an opening at around 6:45 or 7:00.  Odd, the place was empty... but, we took it and went back downstairs.\n\nWe ordered some cheese curds and the onion rings.  The bartender warned us ahead of time that the curds were \"standard-from-the-bag\" curds, but said the rings were hand-battered and delicious.  They arrived quickly, and once again, the bartender was spot-on with his description.\n\nThe curds were Sysco curds and were not cooked well at all.  I don't think the fryer was hot enough, because these curds were drenched in grease - so much so that we couldn't eat them.  Disgusting.  And the ranch dipping sauce was like water... you know what they say about oil and water... \n\nThe rings were decent, but again - the grease was ridiculous.  It really made for a bad first impression.  So, we ordered some Whiskey Old Fashioned Sours to help cut through the grease film that was sitting so heavily on our palettes.  \n\nOur table was ready by 7:00-ish, and much to our surprise, when we went upstairs this time, the place was packed.  Where those people came from, and how they got up there without us noticing remains a mystery... our waitress stopped promptly, checked our drinks, and took our order - fried perch all the way around with hash browns on the side.\n\nDinner salads came first and were nice; fairly fresh, fairly tasty, and just the right size.  Fish came out slightly later - served family style - along with our hash browns.  First bite of the fish?  UGH - it tasted awful.  Extremely fishy flavor (and I love fish).  Think \"stinky NJ ocean shore line flavor\" - not delicate, flavorful, flaky, and enjoyable.  No sir, this was the nightmarishly bad fish that we all remember from our grade school days - you know, the stuff that was about 2-3 days away from being used as feed for the sea lions at the zoo  \n\nSo, we doused it with lemon and gave it another go - and once again, the fish was so overpoweringly fishy that we reached for the (gasp!) ketchup.  That helped a bit, but it still wasn't an enjoyable fish fry.  The fish was cooked well - not too greasy, and it was breaded rather than battered.  If only it weren't so obscenely fishy...   \n\nHash browns were tasty - fried nicely (crisp and tasty).  Service was fantastic - our waitress was fun, helpful, and did a great job of checking in with us.  Total bill for three with a round or two of drinks was $45-ish.\n\nStamm House = FAIL\n\nFood: 1 star (grease, grease everywhere; horrible fish fry)\nService: 4.5 stars \nValue: 3 stars\n\n\nSummary: waaaaay too greasy + waaaaaay too fishy fish = fail.", "type": "review", "business_id": "IEmqrFe96NOhU07TA0rZdw"}

The remodeling removed some of the self service stalls (there are approx. 4 now) and used this space for a new Laundramat and a dog wash station, which i hear is one of the only ones in the Madison area. \n\nI have been there mostly on Sundays and they have an attendant who is an older gentlemen and is very friendly and fun to shoot the breeze with if you use the self service stations. Personally, I believe you cant get a better car wash than using the self service stations if you have the time and strength (your arms do get a little sore after!). For 5 dollars I believe, you get 12 minutes which is plenty of time to do a thorough wash, rinse, wax and time to use scrubber on front end/rims as needed. The soap is not watered down like other places. They also take credit card at the self service station, so no need to fill a sock full of quarters. The only other self service I know of in the Madison area is off Rimrock road, which is cheaper, but for less time, in a rough area, in terrible shape,  and the soap is MUCH more watered down. \n\nI have also used the laundramat there recently and received exceptional serivce. They have a special going on in March that all dryers are free! All new machines, therefore clothes come out smelling and looking great. In addition, this is a full service laundramat, therefore there is a regular attendant on duty who will do the washing, drying and foling for you. I believe the charge was 49 cents for every lb. They also have a promotion going on right now for the first 10lbs are free. It is a very convenient service if you have a lot of errands to run and dont want to waste an afternoon at the laundramat. I had quite a bit of laundry one day, and the attendant gave me a very good deal in addition to the 10 lbs free. Make sure to tip the attendant if you use this service, she did an excellent job and saves you a ton of time!\n\nI have not used the dog wash, as I do not have a dog, but I imagine it could be something fun to do.\n\nThe only negative I have about this place is that is hard to get in and out of, as you have to pull in behind the building and turn the corner of the building at a blind spot. Its about as narrow as one lane, and people come in and out of same drag.", "type": "review", "business_id": "qNBvH111qgJgLYUScbph7g"}

I received a shellac manicure, partial highlight and conditioning treatment and based on what I spent on the Living Social coupon I am satisfied with the results, but if I had paid full price for these services I would be very dissatisfied.  \n\nThere was just something \"off\" about my entire experience at Tangles.  The salon and nail room looked messy and unorganized, as did most of the hair stylists and nail technicians.  I didn't get that \"Aveda vibe\" at all, more like the \"Cost Cutters vibe\" (nothing against CC, but if I'm paying $75 for highlights I'd like the atmosphere to match the price).

Both times the waitstaff has been professional, helpful, and speedy.  The music is at an appropriate level, the atmosphere is cozy, the decor tasteful.  The wine list is extensive, and many dishes on the menu seem appetizing and imaginative at first glance.  With all of these elements going for it, I have high expectations for the food.  Although some of it is delicious, some significant problems have arisen when I've dined there.\n\nI have had both the bruschetta and the mussels as appetizers.  The bruschetta portion was a bit smaller than I expected, but it packs a large amount of flavor into the bites.  The tomatoes tasted fresh and sweet, and balanced well against the (presumably) homemade pesto.  The fresh bread served at the table is similarly warm, with a crisp crust and toothsome interior.  The mussels are flavorful and delicious, but they don't come with any bread to sop up the flavorful broth that remains after the mussels have been eaten.  Our plate was whisked away before we had a chance to ask for any bread to go with the sauce.\n\nTwo of my companions ordered the Ravioli al Vin Santo; both liked and finished the dish.  It is one of four vegetarian options (the Fettucini alla Putenesca does not list meat, but I've never heard of a putanesca sauce made without anchovies), which was a welcome surprise for the vegetarian with whom I dined.  One companion ordered the Insalata di Caesare (which also has unlisted anchovies in the dressing), and found it flavorful, if unimaginative.  A fourth companion ordered the Lasagna del Giorno (that day it was with roasted chicken), and savored every bite.  A fifth companion ordered the Fettucini alla Putenesca, of which I tried a bite.  The spinach fettucini was fresh and delicious, and the sauce was perfectly salty.  My entree, the Campenelli il Diavolillo, was pretty awful.  The combination of meat and seafood in a dish can be done artfully, but this felt like a clumsy mishmash of shrimp, chicken, and Italian sausage.  The sausage was very sweet and seemed to lack enough oregano, basil, and garlic.  It clashed notably with the rest of the dish.  The shrimp and chicken were both cooked well, and were tender and juicy.  The pasta was fresh and tasty.  It was really a shame that the \"spicy garlic broth\" as described by the menu translated into nearly an inch of oil at the bottom of the dish, making the entire dish almost inedible.  All portions were huge.\n\nThe desserts are delicious.  The tiramisu, which I sampled on my first visit, is fluffy and sweet.  I tried to order it on my return visit, but the waitress told me she had sold the last piece to a table that came in after us.  Since we arrived at 5 p.m., this came as quite a shock.  It seems unlikely that they started the evening's service with more than one piece of tiramisu, and seems like profoundly poor planning.  The bread pudding, while not much to look at, is also delicious, though it is so rich that by the time we finished one portion (between three people) it almost felt like i was eating a stick of butter rolled in cinnamon.\n\nI can't say I'll be back anytime soon.  I have to disagree with Zenide R.'s assertion that it's \"easily the best Italian food in the Madison area.\"  For the price, both Lombardino's and Tutto Pasta make better Italian food, and I shall stick to those restaurants in the future.", "type": "review", "business_id": "q8fD82us6uuGufvI44NoAg"}

The portion was HUGE, and the food was fresh and very tasty.  My colleagues had the eggplant parmigiana, which looked and smelled delicious, and a chicken dish that I can't remember the name of, but which also looked pretty good.  \n\nI'm not sure Vin Santo is the best place for a business dinner, but for a romantic date, it's perfect.

Small place, warm and inviting, and the lovely host/owner Clarissa greets us like family when we walk in. Her husband/chef makes fabulous and imaginative sauces to accompany the comforting Italian dishes. Their italian sausage is probably the best we've had anywhere (including fancy places in LA, NYC, Philly, etc).\n\n There are special lasagna, fish, and ravioli dishes every night. The lasagna is cooked to order so it takes a while, but is so worth it. If you are lucky enough to go on an Italian sausage lasagna night, the portion is enormous, and every bite (yes, every bite) includes sausage and cheese - it's the bomb. I had a veal ravioli in a butter sage sauce recently that was fabulous, and unlike some pricey new Italian places where the portion is 5 or so ravioli, this dish had 10 or 12 large ones. In fact, all the portions are large, and really reasonably priced. Their wine selection is pretty sparse, and we haven't had good look finding one we like. But that is the only down side to what is always a fantastic and totally filling meal.  \n\nWe are usually too full for dessert, but they do make their own tiramisu, which is light, fluffy, creamy, and enormous. Get one if you have someone to share it with. Recently they have added a couple of desserts, including a caramel cheesecake, which I hope I am not too full to try someday.", "type": "review", "business_id": "q8fD82us6uuGufvI44NoAg"}

Quaint and cozy, lots of comfort foods.  Nothing spectacular, though the homemade breads are quite good.  A bit on the pricey side and can fill-up with people quickly, especially on the weekends.\n\nDetailed review:\nI've lived near C's for about a year now, and have never stopped-in to check it out.  Folks at work gave mixed reviews - some raved about the place, others gave it a \"Meh.\"  I run past it nearly every morning and they always seem to have a good-sized crowd, especially on Saturdays and Sundays, so I figured it had to be somewhat decent... with that, I treated myself to a breakfast this morning.\n\nI wandered in at around 9:30am on Memorial Day and was pleased to find plenty of seating.  The hostess offered me a table outside, which was a nice bonus - the weather was gorgeous, so I happily took the offer.  I also grabbed one of their complimentary/shared newspapers to read.\n\nA waitress stopped by to ask for my drink order - I went with coffee - and to drop off a menu.  She came back a few minutes later with an acrylic coffee cup and a stainless coffee carafe.  She left to tend to another table; I needed some cream for the coffee... oh well, it was nice and I was happy to continue browsing the menu, sans cream for my coffee.\n\nBreakfast offerings were ordinary: eggs, hashbrowns, pancakes, omelets, skillets, and a couple of extras, like eggs benedict, belgian waffles, and some homemade pastries (turnovers, donuts, muffins, cookies, etc).\n\nThe waitress stopped by to ask if I was ready to order - told her I decided on the \"Hen's Nest\" which consisted of 2 eggs, hashbrowns, and toast.  I also ordered a pancake, and requested some cream for the coffee.  She apologized and immediately brought some half-n-half containers.  We were in business.  \n\nBefore leaving to take my order to the kitchen, she asked if I'd like anything in the hashbrowns.  I was pleased!  C's has some specialty hashbrown items on the menu, but I didn't want to order a huge plate of them... so, when the offer surfaced to add onions, peppers, tomatoes, etc to my potatoes, I jumped at the chance.\n\nFood came about 20 minutes later and looked tasty.  The pancake was a lot thinner than I had pictured, but it was quite tasty.  I found myself wishing I had ordered 2.  \n\nThe Hen's Nest was just \"OK\" - the hashbrowns weren't greasy and featured a nice, crispy char,  but the onions and peppers didn't do much for flavor, oddly enough... I found the entire dish to be largely flavorless.  :-(  \n\nThe multigrain toast was very good - and was probably the star of the entire meal.  The waitress only stopped by once more - to drop off the check, which was a bit of a shocker as well... $12 for my modest breakfast - $5.99 for the Hen's Nest, $0.89 for adding extras to the hashbrowns, $2.99 for one (1) pancake (!!!), $1.89 for coffee.\n\nService = 2 stars (nothing great)\nFood = 3 stars (average breakfast fare)\nValue = 1.5 stars (quite pricey for what it was)\nMISC = 3 stars (bakery items looked stellar, nice outdoor patio, very relaxing)\n\nI'd really like to give C's 2.5 stars, but I'm feeling a bit generous so, it's a 3-star \"gift\" rating.  Had I been in a crankier mood, it would've gone 2-stars... :-)\n\nFor what it's worth, I think the Hubbard Avenue Diner has a better overall breakfast, and it's about 1/2 the price.  It'll probably be a while before I visit C's again.", "type": "review", "business_id": "B0Vuwn6Hugc-0U5n31YBfg"}

After the tour, (weather permitting, I assume) you go outside to the beer garden to get your 2oz. mug to start sampling. The guide has to go around and fill up everyone on the tour (~50 people) before you get your beers, so budget an extra hour to sample. \n\nSo in the end, you get 8x 2oz. samples and a tiny beer shot glass for $2.50.

The beer garden (bier garten?) is huge, filled with weather-beaten picnic tables, and covered with a big awning to keep out the sun. Trees insulate the place, and the whole thing is topped off with a nice stage for weekly summer performances by local staples such as Westside Andy and the Mel Ford band. People bring their kids, their dogs, decks of cards and board games, and enjoy the excellent beer that's doled out at the outdoor taps by friendly staff. Bring your own food - some local joints like the Roman Candle will even deliver right to your picnic table.

Crikey - I'm losing it, I tell 'ya.\n\nNo visit to the Madison area would be complete without stopping-by the Capital Brewery.  During the spring/summer/fall months, their beer garden is phenomenal.  It's a large, trellised, open area that's sun-protected compliments of a huge blue tent cover/awning.  \n\nPicnic tables galore, it makes for an ideal location to chill with friends and family.  Bring along whatever type of food you'd like, because they don't serve food here.  Or, better yet, call one of the many local restaurants and request delivery - most of them service the brewery.  Dogs are more than welcome, as are kids. \n\nA large stage frames the eastern side of the garden; you'll find live music on most Friday and Saturday nights.  They used to show movies on Saturday nights, but I believe that has come to pass.\n\nThe staff is always excellent.  You won't find a nicer group of folks no matter how far or hard you search.  Kyle's the absolute best - the guy is unbelievably friendly, funny, and knows everything about the brews.  He often serves as the brewery tour guide, so pay attention if he suggests you try a certain brew.\n\nDuring the colder months, the indoor stube is warm and inviting.  There's a large flat screen television for game watching, and plenty of comfy seating.  The stube operates on reduced hours during the winter months, and just a heads-up that it's often times rented/reserved for private events (think holiday parties), so check their website schedule prior to planning a spur-of-the-moment visit.\n\nThe gift shop is nice, with a great selection of glasses, shirts, and other goodies.  Prices are more than reasonable.  The bathrooms are usually spotless, which is a bonus.\n\nSo... if you haven't been to the brewery, make it a priority to visit.  Stop by on a Saturday or Sunday and take the tour (it's only a couple of dollars, includes samples, and runs hourly), then spend time enjoying some of Capital's great beers.

Yes, I could save a ton of money on parts by buying items online, but as mentioned, I respect dealerships and understand the benefits of supporting local businesses.  \n\nThat said, this particular VW dealership (the Zimbrick on Century Avenue is only a VW dealer, BTW - no Acura any longer at this location) shocked me with their inability to comprehend a simple request for oil, an oil filter, and a fuel filter.\n\nI called to check the price and availability for some common, everyday maintenance items for my VW Jetta.  My Jetta has the 1.9L BRM Diesel motor (\"PD\" style), and as such has some unique requirements as identified by Volkswagen, specifically when it comes to oil.  VW mandates that you use their 505.01 approved oil in the BRM diesel motor.  Failure to do so may result in a voided or compromised warranty.\n\nSo imagine my shock when the parts guy told me to use \"any old oil\" while on the phone.

Since other reviewers did not go into significant detail about the offerings, I'll mention my first time experience recently on a Sunday (where there were about three other tables of diners):\n\n- peanut butter chicken\n- mongolian beef\n- chow mein\n- a few sushi rolls (x2 varieties)\n- crab rangoons (better than average)\n- spring rolls (eggrolls, more aptly)\n- popcorn shrimp\n- two types of soups - your basic hot and sour or egg drop (these were just OK)\n- chicken skewers (these were excellent even though I didn't expect them to be based on appearance)\n- seafood stir fry w/ veggies\n- fish fillets\n- dessert options looked like a few types of cakes and fruit, pudding, and jello.\n\nI like the emphasis on quality rather than quantity.

I thought I'd head east and come here for lunch since I didn't find anything better. Years ago, this used to be a place called Stockade and I loved it. Now it's a Badgers/Packers bar and grill. \n\nVisible from I-90, just west of Madison, there's a cheese place (Mouse Haus I believe) and warehouses for Pepsi and Walgreen's nearby. The Rodeside Grill resembles a log cabin style fort from the outside. Years ago, this place used to be called Stockade.\n\nOnce inside, it's quite spacious with high ceilings and an all wood interior, except for the tile on the floor. The whole place looks very clean, not grungy and aged like so many bars in Wisconsin. I sat down to eat at the bar. All along the bar counter, there were blurbs and excerpts of Packers and Badgers accomplishments underneath the laminated countertop. The place even had green-colored ductwork, so I knew I was deep in Packers territory.\n\nA big screen TV aired game highlights from the Packers-Saints NFL season opener from the day before. Large men with mustaches came in for lunch, typical Wisconsin body types. I kept a low profile and my Chicago origin and calmly requested the Friday fish fry special. Having traveled up north on many occasions, this wasn't the first time I was surrounded by Packer fans. It's not hard to deal with them if you don't disclose where you're from and stick to the menu items or make a positive comment about Jordy Nelson being an awesome rising star on the team.\n\nThe fish arrived in a few minutes and it came with a side of fries that were seasoned and coated - quite tasty in fact. Coleslaw is also a can't-miss item north of Illinois and this place has it right too. I found the meal quite enjoyable. The bartender got me another iced tea and then spent a few more minutes of admiring the place. The Packers highlights gave way to NASCAR on the TV, but I was on my way, 150 miles from Chicago once again.\n\nWhile I went for the fish, Rodeside also has some good burgers, from what I saw around me at lunch that day. Worth a stop on your way to the Dells or Lodi for that matter. Just leave the Bears stuff in the car.", "type": "review", "business_id": "O_Pu4mKGOqQVlmH07Zbnhg"}

My coworker exclusively gets General Tso's Chicken (this thing always looks amazing!)\n\nValue is always great...we can get both of our lunches, i usually add an egg roll (75 cents) and he usually gets a soda and it costs us around $12 for both of us.  Quantity of food is also great.\n\nAs you can tell, I highly recommend this place.

I can't speak for its authenticity or service, but I can speak for how often I find myself hungry, cold, and ordering from China Wok's online delivery system. \n\nI don't generally care for Sweet & Sour anything. That's not real food!  Have you seen that toxic-waste colored, gelatinous red sauce?  That can't be good for you.  But on a friend's recommendation, I tried it from China Wok. It's delicious. Somehow the battered and fried chicken had not become soggy during delivery, and I found it was insanely addictive over pork fried rice. (I like their fried rice- not too greasy. But it seems to turn bitter when you re-heat it the next day.)\n\nDecent dumplings, and my BF seems to enjoy the spare ribs, since those are the only two things he ever orders from there. The sauce that comes with those dumplings is pretty awesome I must say. I also enjoy the crab rangoons, though they are the very creamy kind with almost no actual crab meat. Ask me if I care. Because I don't. \n\nReally, I've probably had 75% of the menu by now, and nothing really sticks out as \"not good.\"  Though once we tried the Teriyaki Chicken and found it to be pretty dry. Who knows if that is how it usually is, since we only tried it once. What business did we have ordering Japanese food from a Chinese place anyway?\n\nThey are reliable, fairly priced, good size portions, hot when it arrives, completely non-threatening Chinese. If I wanted authentic Chinese cuisine, I'd be going somewhere for dine-in, not carry out.  China Wok delivers, and makes my insides happy.", "type": "review", "business_id": "xZwaUcrFMSY1O9dK2dAUpA"}

Nope.   The burgers are just that, basic burgers with a sauce to match the fancy name.   What chef dreamed up these recipes?   I doubt it was a chef.  Probably some person that said, \"good enough, let's go make some money\".\nOur burgers yesterday were about 10 bucks each and just basic burgers that should have cost about 4 bucks.   The meat didn't have any distinctive flavor and was rather skimpy, the sauce was not complimentary to the sandwich and the bun was generally regular too.   At least the bun was fresh.  \nI would only recommend this place to my Republican friends because they have no ability to think for themselves anyway and might actually like the place.\nIf you're looking for paradise you won't find it here.

Sometimes you want something that actually comes from Italy, which probably couldn't be further from the menu here.\n\nTonight I had a six ounce sirloin with some seasoned veggies. The sirloin was medium rare as requested, but pretty charred on the outside. I suppose ill stick to pasta next time, it's what they do the most of. I also tried their chili which was good but had no kick at all. Perhaps they meant minestrone? The best part of the meal was the fresh bread. I mean that not as knock to the meal and more as a compliment to the bread. It was seasoned really well and had a nice hardness to the outside to give it an awesome texture. Great starter!\n\nThe service was about as good as you can get from a restaurant that had their waiters write on your table in classy crayon.

But in the last few years, other venues in Madison have really stepped up their game, and the Barrymore doesn't seem to care about keeping up with its contemporaries.\n\nIts use of social media is near-archaic. The venue doesn't make an effort to create or even update pages for individual events, and good luck if you get any indication that a show is on track to sell out. And perhaps it's just my personal taste, but the Barrymore used to bring in excellent music acts on a much more regular basis. Now it just caters to the aging-hippie population of the neighborhood, preferring to fill its schedule with predictable offerings about far-left-leaning politics. These events don't offend my own political views, but they're often dull and serve as nothing more than an echo chamber for people who want their beliefs perpetually reaffirmed. They sell more tickets that way, so I'm not sure I can blame them for the strategy, but  I hardly ever like the shows there. Also, the tickets are 2-3 times more expensive than the tickets usually are at other live entertainment venues in town.\n\nThe building itself isn't falling into disrepair, like the Orpheum is (heartbreakingly, I might add), but areas of infrastructure could certainly benefit from attention. There is no public WiFi, and you'll be hard-pressed to get cell phone reception, even in the balcony. I do appreciate that the open dance area is slanted a bit so that we vertically-challenged folks have a chance to see, but if you want to be able to sit and see the acts, the balcony is your best bet. It's not often open, however, especially for shows that haven't sold a ton of tickets. I don't recall this being a problem at prior events, but at the show I attended last night, there were constant problems with microphone feedback, often necessitating acrobatics by the band itself. The tap beer selection is good, but that's pretty standard in this town. Bottled beer selection pales in comparison to other venues, and the liquor and wine options are slim pickings. The bar is cash-only. The only ATM in the place charges a $4 fee for each use, so if you need to withdraw cash, make sure to get enough in one go. The line can be enormous, and often is bisected by people exiting and entering the theater. The bathrooms are fairly clean and well-stocked, although I've used them on more than one occasion to discover that they were out of soap, necessitating the use of their hand sanitizer instead.  Also, the saloon-style doors are an easy way to get smacked in the face entering and exiting the bathroom, so exercise plenty of caution around them. The bathrooms are so tiny that the lines are formed outside the doors. They also don't sell earplugs, so make sure you bring your own.\n\nBottom line: in the rare event that they have a show I want to see, I'll go, but I make sure to bring plenty of cash, my own earplugs, and my plastic Barrymore cups (drinks are 50 cents cheaper when you remember to bring your cups back).", "type": "review", "business_id": "f5ntGOT9_0pCdeUaUVi9cg"}

Don't come to Pedro's in search of authentic Mexican food.

I would suggest avoiding most of the menu, which is essentially Tex-Mex T.V. dinner-type fare, except with molten cheese-drowned portions that could feed a T-Rex.  I would suggest, instead, the carnitas fajitas: the pork is very tender and flavorful, and the sauteed vegetables are tasty.  Not authentic--but perfectly fine.  They do have a good Tuesday/Thursday margarita special, though the drinks are too sweet for my taste.  I met my S.O. at Pedro's: hence the extra star.

We were seated at about 4:30 pm, and were the only ones in the dining room.  The decor is 80's \"americanized Mexico.\" It looked exactly as I remember it from years ago.  It did seemed to be kept up.\n\nI was really looking forward to the hot fresh tortillas they used to serve.  There is a tortilla maker in the middle of the dining room.  Unfortunately, the machine wasn't running.  I can understand that since the place was pretty empty, but the tortillas they gave us were dry and hard.  They had been sitting out for awhile.  That was a bit disappointing.\n\nI had a burrito, it was ok.  Nothing too exciting.  In the 80's and 90's it would have been great, but Mexican food in Wisconsin has gotten so much better over the years.  \n\nI still love their chips and salsa, though!

You can order in advanced (at least one hour ahead of time), or you can ask for a cab to be sent as soon as one is available. The online system also allows you to track your cab (once it has been assigned to you) and gives you an estimated time of arrival (fabulous!). \n\nSide note: I noticed that calling the number they have listed on their website is a huge pain in the ass and the hold time is always longer than their estimate. As such, I really appreciate the new ordering system because it allows me to bypass the wait time on the phone and to avoid speaking to operators who sometimes have trouble understanding what I am asking for. \n\nWhen the cab arrives at your address, a text is sent to your phone and you are able to communicate with the driver via text (in case of delay/change of plans, etc.).\n\nAlso, since you enter your credit card number into the online ordering system, once you get to your destination and are ready to 'pay' for the ride, all you have to do is sign a piece of paper and write in the amount of tip you want to leave, and everything is set. There is no need to pull out your wallet and risk leaving it in the cab or dropping it on the street!\n\nThumbs up, Union Cab! I'm in love with all this technology!! \n\nPS. If you get cab #59, you are in for a treat. The driver is a real sweetheart and a great conversationalist. Ask him for advice on which airlines to take and you'll get a lot of good tips and tricks. :)", "type": "review", "business_id": "5TQQy_x_ArR3_5L5L0fFVQ"}

Fatima in particular is so sweet, remembers my name and where I live, and goes above and beyond to make me feel like a valued customer. \n\nIt's really nice to feel like employees of anywhere recognize you as a good customer and treat you with mutual respect, kindness, and reward your loyalty. We all know that the squeaky wheel gets the oil, so it's nice to see positive karma reinforced at Enterprise. \n\nOnce they called me to let me know I had left a burned cd in their disc player and offered to drop it off with me while they were out doing their pick-ups. WHO DOES THAT? These guys do. Because they are awesome.\n\n Another time, there was a bit of a wait (they were insanely busy just before a holiday weekend, but still smiling and keeping it cool, even though I could see the exhaustion in their eyes) because they were backed up on getting their cars cleaned on the inside before they could ok them for rent.\n I told them I didn't really care, had no one to impress, and they could give me a dirty car as long as there wasn't literally bodily fluids inside it. Save yourselves a few minutes on cleaning that, I'm probably going to put new trash and crumbs in it shortly anyway. \n\nThey looked at me, and told me that they appreciated my sentiment and apologize for the wait, but they would feel bad about giving me a crumby car. So, tell you what. Lets just bump you up the list of cars and give you a free upgrade to a higher class of car, of which we already have one cleaned and ready.  I said that wasn't necessary, I wasn't in a rush.  They said they wanted me to have it, because I was so nice and a good customer besides. Well. I guess if you insist on a free upgrade... I'll take it. \n\nI like that the corporate Enterprise seems to value this sort of behavior in it's employees, and fosters a positive work environment.

Everyone who works here is incredibly helpful and they will never push you to buy any services or products that they don't think you need or that they don't think are good quality. They are super woman friendly, despite being staffed by mostly men, and offer their space on some nights for a women's bike mechanics class (that I've heard of and seen, but never gone to). They built my 3-speed bike from scratch when I first moved here, gave me an excellent price for it, and have helped me to keep it well-maintained. I have had only minor problems with the bike and I put it through a lot of hell. I recommend this shop not just for repairs, but especially for anyone looking to get a well-priced custom bike.", "type": "review", "business_id": "QMWdcByvCYCrs7-IQyr26w"}

They have always been friendly and helpful when I have a need for my bike. However, those reviews seem to be from older dates (most of them..), so perhaps there's a management change and please give revolution a chance!!\n\nThe bike shop is a middle-sized shop, so they might not have as much variety of products as other huge bike shops. The nice thing is, they are willing to go out of the way to order something for you, even if you just wanted one piece of something. Also, it is a great place to stop by for last minute maintenance, quick fixes. They usually have a long wait for huge project fix ups, but if you just need a quick check or putting on a saddle, something fast, they will do it on the spot and you won't run into the long wait time.\n\nI trust them to do a good job for my bike. Jacob, who I regularly see in the bike shop, was very detailed in explaining my options when I wanted to add gears to my single speed bike. He even suggested maybe building a custom bike might be something I should consider since my Sanwa is not exactly meant for touring.. A week and a half later (I was out of town), my bike was ready. It fits well, the gears are surprisingly smooth for a no gear gal like me. Everything was great! And they were so friendly and told me I should come back for a check up on the bike a week or two later!", "type": "review", "business_id": "QMWdcByvCYCrs7-IQyr26w"}

All we ordered was the fish and waffle fries- so nothing complicated- and on such a busy night, you'd think they'd be making sure to keep batches of fish and fries going steadily into the fryer.  When we finally got our food, it was the tasty fish we'd remembered from before, but by that time, we were so tired and crabby from having to wait for so long, it wasn't quite so enjoyable.  After our meal, we had to wait quite a long time for the waiter to bring the check, and then he didn't come back to pick it up for a good 15 minutes.  We would still go back to Dexter's just for drinks, but I don't think we'll be going there to eat the food anymore.  Two terrible experiences with inexcusably long waits is enough to keep us from going back for dinner.  It's too bad because the fish is good, but not good enough to justify the SLOW service.\n\nEdit: Turns out the fish wasn't so good- ended up being up all night with food poisoning.  Yup, definitely will NOT be going back there for dinner!", "type": "review", "business_id": "HTplzElel_F_U_qhWuDKdg"}

As luck would have it, a table opened up near the bar, so we snagged it and decided to eat in the bar area.  An extremely helpful waitress immediately took our drink and appetizer orders; we browsed the menu until she returned.\n\nWith drinks in hand and the appetizer (IPA hummus plate) underway, she regrettably informed us they had run out of cod.  We opted for 2 plates of the lake perch and 1 plate of the walleye instead (I was dining with a couple of friends).\n\nThe service was excellent; she regularly checked on us, refilled drinks, and kept us in the loop the entire night.  5-stars for service.\n\nThe fish arrived and it was swimming in grease.  Gone was the excellent batter that I had experienced in the past; the perch was rubbery and extreeeeeeemely fishy tasting.  The walleye was equally greasy, over-battered, and also very fishy tasting.\n\nI love fish, and my friends are huge fishermen - they take trips to Canada, the boundary waters, and all sorts of other places to fish.  But even they agreed that the fish didn't taste like it should - one barely finished his smallish plate of perch; the other left at least half of the walleye.  I felt especially terrible when they asked me why I felt the fish was so good here... :-(\n\nThe rest of their food remains superb, especially the IPA hummus.  I'm certain you won't find a better hummus in the area.  I would also recommend the habanero shrimp and any of their burgers - they're excellent.\n\nOur check arrived; we settled-up and left, disappointed by the fish.  It's a shame, because I like Nick, and I really like the crew here, but something is amiss...\n\n:-(", "type": "review", "business_id": "HTplzElel_F_U_qhWuDKdg"}

I like the Fajita salad and pulled pork sandwich. \n\nBeer -  Fantastic. This is real the reason to go to Dexters. They have rotating taps of featured beer.

The fish comes with your choice of  - baked potato, waffle fries, pub fries, homemade potato chips, and some other things like cottage cheese etc.  We had waffle fries, potato chips and the pub fries, which are beer pattered.  You also get a small container of cole slaw and a white grocery store roll.  There was a short wait for our fish, but the dining room was still packed.  When it arrived, it was hot, tasty and a generous serving.  We were all very satisfied with our dinner.  I thought the homemade potato chips were excellent, they came out warm and crispy.

Overall I had a really good experience and experienced none of the negative issues noted in other reviews. Most of the decor in my room appeared to have been updated in recent years, including the large flat screen TV.  A few things were clearly older, but I got the impression they were gradually being improved. The bed was comfortable and there was an assortment of pillows. The shower was fine. The staff were very friendly, not only the folks at the front desk but also the cleaning crew. The Wifi was free and fast. There is a Starbuck's with limited hours in the hotel itself, but there is a full service one just a few hundred yards down the road. Also within easy walking distance is a large mall and some great places to eat (including Mexican and Japanese). The workout room includes two treadmills, an elliptical, a recumbent bike, some dumbbells, a bench, and a couple mats. The machines were older but of good quality. I stayed a Saturday night and there was a wedding at the hotel, but I had absolutely no issues with noise. Overall I was quite satisfied. I should also mention that they have a free shuttle van that will take you anywhere within a 3-mile radius. It leaves every hour or half hour.  I have never stayed in a hotel with that service before.

I only had to wait a minute or two before being seen. I was given a great head massage while getting my shampoo and was asked again if id like something to drink while i waited under the dryer.

So, instead of getting my run in before I had to go to work in the morning, I logged my miles in the surrounding (very pleasant) neighborhood as the sun came up (there's a great hill and a few tiny parks that were fun to run through, large sidewalks and well marked streets). Fortunately, the runs were amazing, and the streets mostly well lit - but I would have been irate had I booked this room in the winter or if it was raining and I was stuck on the tredmill. \nSo If I'm back in Madison, I'll consider staying here again if the workout facilities are redone and expanded.

Sure, I still hit the Co-Op up for some things, but they're the things I know I can only get there.\n\nAnyway, this store is great and it's a neighborhood fixture.  It's cash only, but there is an ATM at the front door and when you get money out of it, you get a $1 coupon for shopping at the store.  That gives you the $1 back that the ATM took from you to get the cash.  VERY nice touch!!\n\nOverall, this is THE place I go to when I want to hit up a non-major outlet on the near Eastside.

Far past the expiration date; 2. Poor quality; 3. Stale. Of the expired items I can recall, one was a package of tortillas, purchased in the last few days that expired 12/09/13! Almost a full month past expiration! A month ago, I bought hummus. It didn't look right when I opened it (mold), & of course, it had expired 2 weeks earlier. Fortunately, we didn't eat the hummus. Unfortunately, we discovered the tortillas had expired in the middle of dinner. \n\nThere've been a handful of instances where rolls/breads are stale, particularly from the bins by the registers. Rolls weren't just hard on the outside or a day past fresh-baked, we're talking inedible. It's incredibly disappointing too, when you're looking forward to good bread. \n\nThen there's the deli, where there's been a few issues. \n\nDeli issue #1: My wife bought sliced deli meat, a cut known for being fatty, but this one was overly so. It was slimy, chewy, tough, flavorless, & ultimately inedible. It was the first time I've returned meat. I'm a carnivore. I've had hackepeter, steak tartare, tripe, chitlins, sheep brain, sheep testicle... things most people won't eat. This particular deli meat however, was a few steps beyond. \n\nDeli issue #2: More an observation, which now prevents me from buying from the previously liked, pre-made deli salad section. One time at the deli counter, I saw a JSM worker \"clean\" the front of the pre-made salad case, from the inside, with a towel. Mind you, none of the salads were taken out of the case or covered for the cleaning process. So when this worker brought the towel back out of the case, I was aghast to see a dirty towel, with all sorts of crumbs, crumbles, food pieces & products, being carried haphazardly, over uncovered salads. I saw some bits fall from the towel, over the salads, as it was brought out of the case. \n\nDeli issue #3: A JSM worker cut slices of meat & cheese, kindly packaging them with care. However, he did so without gloves & without washing his hands. I was pretty much done with the JSM deli at this point. \n\nYou can have all the locally produced, environmentally friendly, organic, small batch, artisan &/or handmade, gluten-free, nonsense all you want. It does no good however, when it's stored in unclean, unsanitary conditions, &/or expired all together. If I were a \"freegan\" I'd say this place was a rip-off. Everyone knows you can get spoiled foods in dumpsters behind most grocery stores, for free. I'd also make exceptions for small \"mom & pop\" businesses, but I have standards & limits. JSM has surpassed both. It's unfortunate since we like the place, or rather, we want to like it, but there are just too many problems.", "type": "review", "business_id": "MLD-FXAHLbdiHOcyeoW-Fg"}

I have contemplated a dine and dash many times.  I counted the minutes one time, and it was 45 minutes from the time I finished eating to when the check came.  It wasn't because the waitress didn't see me from behind the counter either, she was talking to another server.

Besides that, I've never noticed it being *especially* slow... just kind of slow, which doesn't really bother me.\n\nLet me take a moment here to recommend the Meatloaf Sandwich: Get it served cold.  Just trust me here.  Do not get it hot.  I've had it served both ways: Cold, it is a sandwich so delicious that fireworks go off in your head; Warm, it is an open-faced abomination with gravy and mashed potatoes poured all over it.\n\nTheir cheeseburger was surprisingly good (I'd even go so far to say that it's one of the best burgers I've had in Madison).  They had a special entree one evening, \"Cheeseburger Mac & Cheese,\" which was out of this world.  It really tasted like a cheeseburger over noodles!  They serve a great chef salad, have awesome spicy waffle fries, and I would die 100 times over for the buttermilk biscuits they serve with breakfast.  Their expansive dessert case is as tasty as it is impressive looking.\n\nI was beyond sold on this place one time when I ordered a piece of german chocolate cake for dessert.

That was after I approached the counter and saw several staff members stare at me for 20 minutes before I was finally helped.  The other time was when I was there for coffee and dessert with friends, and we paid with a card.  The waiter told us, upon picking up the card, \"You know, if you can, you should really give me my tip in cash.  We don't see it on our paychecks for another 2 weeks otherwise.\"  Um...thanks for the advice on how we should tip you.

Overall, though, it is far and away my favorite Food Fight place and a fairly reliable spot to get a good meal.\n\nMonty's food is better than hit-or-miss but not quite consistently good.  Most of the things I've eaten there, especially the breakfast foods, have been delicious (and huge), but I've had a couple of very sub-par meals (one was so bad I literally could not eat more than a couple of bites).  The things that I ate and disliked are now off the menu, so that does say something for their ability to identify what's working and what isn't.  What I can say is that the egg-based breakfast-y menu items are almost universally good.  The \"scrambled something-or-other\" never fails to disappoint, nor does the newer Blue Plate Omelet (the one with cheddar, avocado and bacon... good lord!).  And the breakfast burrito is especially good, even without chorizo (which is how I usually order it).  As for the breakfast side items, the potatoes are just okay; the biscuits are great.  Most importantly of all, the coffee is superb (even my mother thinks so and she drinks a hell of a lot more coffee than I do).  Unfortunately, I tend to shy away from the lunch and dinner items so I can't really speak to their quality.  The pies, though, are heaven.  And it's certainly worth noting that the menu pays special attention to including veg*n options.\n\nThe atmosphere is pretty awesome.  Outdoor seating is spacious and comfy.  Indoors, the blue-topped tables are fun for making patterns with the wet bottom of your water glass.  Get a booth if you can; the tables are a bit cramped.  The waitstaff are generally friendly and attentive.\n\nThe upshot is that if you think you'll enjoy eating at a diner that's 70% greasy spoon and 30% hipster hot spot, and if you like breakfast foods and are a \"good orderer\" (you choose from menus wisely), Monty's is an excellent choice.", "type": "review", "business_id": "fjaQ3Ixkofh8xGhklUtDnA"}

I highly suggest the sweet potato hash for breakfast and do try a biscuit or 2 as well, great with some honey and coffee! Great prices as well.", "type": "review", "business_id": "fjaQ3Ixkofh8xGhklUtDnA"}

My breakfast companion and I had the meatless meatloaf - a melange of carrots and other vegetables, covered in a cashew and sage gravy - and a caponata omelet, filled with a stew of perfectly-cooked, still-easily-recognizable vegetables and a pesto sauce made from basil grown out back.  Each bite of each dish was a delight.  I took home a slice of Reese's peanut butter cheesecake which I am hoping my son will find to be too rich for him because, uh huh!

This delicious and clean diner serves up some tasty eats with a twist. It didn't take long for my buddy Corey D to share his love and thus I had to experience it for myself.\n\nIf you're not carrying a child, you must sample their drink menu. Looks super fantastic. Please have one for me. But beyond the cornucopia of boozy beverages lie various menus that will satisfy just about every craving. Sweet, savory, both...take your pick. \n\nDuring my visit, I sample the hash...but due to Corey's insight, I kindly asked if they could make my plate half sweet potato hash and half corned beef hash. Yes they can, and yes they did. The hash was nicely crisped and the corned beef perfectly salty. Portions were sizable without being gigantic, and honestly, I kind of appreciate that. No one needs to start their day with 6 pounds of corned beef hash. Yikes.\n\nThe sizes were just fine - I appreciate the substitution of fruit. Gotta add some healthy in your meal! My main gripe is for their biscuits. Mine was uber dry and crumbly.

I tried this place for the first time the other week when my grandparents were visiting me in Madison.  It was just wonderful!\n\nThe decor is adorable, the servers were friendly and prompt, and the food was fabulous.  I went with the Heathen Vegan Sandwich, which is piled high with mushrooms, tempeh, and avocado.  For my side, I chose the bean salad.  Both of these items were delicious.  The sandwich was HUGE.  I could not eat it like a regular sandwich, so I ate it in an open-faced sort of way with a fork.  A little messy, but totally worth it.  The mushrooms and tempeh were perfectly seasoned and tender and the avocado brought it all together with the toasted bread.\n\nI got a bit nervous because at the *very last second* my grandma changed her order to the exact same thing I got (she's not vegan) because she \"trusts me\".  I was pretty nervous, but she ended up loving it!  I was so pleased.  My one complaint might be that my bean salad had a bit too much dressing on it, but my grandma's did not share that problem and it wasn't difficult to just eat it with a fork instead of a spoon.\n\nMy grandpa ordered some sort of breakfast platter and was very pleased.  He basically always orders the same thing at diners - two poached eggs, bacon, potatoes, and toast, so if he is impressed I feel that it is a good sign. He said the eggs were cooked perfectly.\n\nThey seem extremely accommodating for allergies and preferences as well, which is always a huge plus.\n\nOverall, I was very happy with my first visit to Monty's.   Not only because I loved my vegan options, but because you made my grandparents very happy too and that rocks in my book.  I will definitely be back!", "type": "review", "business_id": "fjaQ3Ixkofh8xGhklUtDnA"}

They are all different, yet are the same in one way.  They are good places to eat.\n\nMonty's is styled after a 50's diner - counter, chrome, lots of \"traditional\" diner foods, and a lot that you never got at a diner.  Service is fast, food is good, prices are reasonable (but not cheap) and wait staff is friendly.  Feels neighborhood friendly, although they bring in people from all over the area.  Plenty of good vegetarian options also.\n\nFood is interesting, with lots of things not found in your typical diner.   Coffee is from Just Coffee (that is a bonus feature people - if you like coffee, this is a great place) and many of the specials are made with organic foods.  Want a burger but don't eat meat?  Swap out the Walnut burger - which, as a meat eater, I can say is good.  Certainly better than their hamburger.  Speaking of which...\n\nWhat is up with that hamburger?  First off, it comes medium well done - no burger should ever be cooked to that.  Second, it is heavily, and funky seasoned.  As in, if I ordered it, it would go back.  A good burger needs salt and pepper.  They add a bunch of stuff.  However my niece who ordered it liked it, so we kept it.\n\nDeserts are very popular at Monty's, but that was our disappointment.  Cheesecake was rubbery and the carrot cake was dry - stale dry.  Really?  I am almost tempted to go to three stars just for that.\n\nOverall, I have to stick with four stars.  Great coffee, mostly really good, and interesting, food, fast, good service.  Without a doubt I will be back if in the area.

After the food arrived it took me two seconds to realize that the tofu was the best I'd ever tasted.  Tender, flavorful, caramelized on the outside.  The sauce was a little saltier than I prefer, but still quite good.  The pita had good texture and a nice, buttery taste.  My husband enjoyed the traditional-type burger he ordered.

I circled around the street 2 times before finding a parking space on the side street about 3 blocks away. It might just be Sunday though.. who knows. I do think the building and decor is kinda cool.. felt like a good old diner with a retro kick. so here comes the food part.. I ordered corn beef hash.. food was lukewarm. I usually like my hot food hot.. not like somewhere between hot and cold. It was greasy too. not a fan. I did like the side fruits that came with it..def gave my greasy hash a little break. I think I would come try their dessert next time. The pie and bakery goods look more yummy.. until next time.

My boyfriend did some yelping, and shortly we were on our way to Monty's. There is a private lot which is always nice when you're in a busy city. We did not sit outside because it was a little chilly but the patio looked pleasant and relaxing with beautiful flowers. When you go inside the ambience is a funky little 50's diner with amazing looking pies. Even though the restaurant was crowded, we were able to get a table fairly quickly. As I opened up the menu, I almost died but before that I even thought of moving to Madison right away! There are so many vegetarian, vegan, gluten free options that it is the majority of the menu, which is so rare to find at a breakfast diner. We both ordered the sweet potato hash and it was to die for! Just what we needed that day! I wish there was another one in Illinois.

Beef hamburgers were bratwurst patties. Pork cutlets were sausage patties....etc. Again, not a huge deal but annoying when you plan ahead, thaw an item for meal and end up having to improvise in the end anyway (hamburger stir fry isn't bad, neither is a bratwurst cheeseburger).\n\nFinally, I am not sure it was an outstanding value. We ended up with about 70 hot dogs, assorted bratwurst and assorted bratwurst patties which are quite inexpensive. Of the remaining items, portions were quite small and anything expensive was bulked up by wrapping it in bacon.

There is also a mini kitchen you can use, if needed, with snacks. Our room was a very good size and it was neat and clean. We had a tv and dvd player with movies to choose from. I also noticed how nice and quite it was. 4 of the 5 rooms were filled while we were there and yet it was always very quiet in our room. The breakfast was wonderful! The owners are very good cooks and served us 2-3 courses for breakfast. Some of the food we ate, like the eggs and some fruits were straight from the farm. Free WiFi was another convenient bonus. If you're looking for a romantic getaway I would highly recommend staying at the Speckled Hen Inn!", "type": "review", "business_id": "FrT0OQFkUZBtfoW3V1Wpfw"}

It had a huge shower/steam room, mini bar, great TV with satellite, fire place, and a bed that swallows you.  There are other features to this B&B other than the place itself.  As mentioned, there is the most amazing dog EVER here, properly named \"Happy\".  There are also a handful of amazing cats on the property that will gladly accompany you for a stroll on the property.  It's nice to hear that the B&B is also pretty sustainable.  All the food they make is pretty much from their farm/garden (fresh eggs, veggies) and anything that can not be grown on their property is from close by.  We have stayed at a handful of B&Bs but this one takes the cake.  I would recommend The Speckled Hen Inn B&B to anyone.

If you just need a place to sleep you might want something less expensive (unless you can afford it). \n\nThe first floor of the house is very clean and neat, but has a very comfortable and cozy feel. There is a small kitchenette stocked with coffee, tea, cold drinks and lite snacks. If we stayed longer I could see relaxing down there enjoying a glass of wine, playing a game or reading. There is a nice selection of wine available to purchase so you don't even have to go out. \n\nOur room was very nice. King sized bed, robes, our own deck with a great view of the sheep. The bathroom had a big Jacuzzi tub and a large duel-head shower. We enjoyed glasses of champagne on the deck before heading out to explore and hike around their land. \n\nHe had dinner downtown Madison which was an easy drive to and from. When we returned we were happy to have the fireplace in our room and cozied up with some of freshly baked cookies left out for guests. \n\nBreakfast was delicious.

The place is T-I-N-Y tiny, but that's not a bad thing.  There are a handful of tables around the outside of the bar, and about 25-30 seats at the actual bar itself.  A low ceiling lends to the really smallish feel of the place.\n\nGreat jukebox, great service, good value.  We really enjoyed hanging out at the Villa Tap.  \n\nDrinks: we tried the whiskey old fashioned sour.  Lost points for not being muddled and for not using Squirt.  It was decent, regardless, and a great value; three old fashioneds came in at under $10.\n\nFood-wise - mixed results.  The appetizers (onion rings and cheese curds) were excellent.  Some of the best we've ever had, even if the curds were \"out of the box\" curds.  They were cooked perfectly, didn't show any signs of grease, and were absolutely wonderful.\n\nThe fish - we had deep fried cod all around - left much to be desired.  It was cooked better than any other fish we've ever had - it was so perfectly prepared... the batter was light and crispy; it was served piping hot; no signs of grease - it had all of the makings of a great fish fry.\n\nBut it was too fishy tasting; not in a good way, but in a bad way.  Cod shouldn't have a strong fish flavor.  Save that for bad Ocean Perch or Smelt... and that's what this cod tasted like.  :-(  So, despite being prepared to perfection, it failed to deliver on taste.\n\nThe fries were perfect, which is such a shame.  The Villa knows how to fry a mean dish - just wish the fish wasn't so \"off\" tasting.  We'll give them another shot, though.  I'm sure the burgers and other offerings are going to be good - The Villa was spot-on with everything else, so the fish may have been a fluke.\n\nVilla Tap = No Win/No Fail - it's a tie\n\nService = 4 stars (fast, prompt, spot-on)\nFood = 2.5 stars (fish = fail; all others = win)\nValue = 4 stars ($40 for 3 people with appetizers and fish)\nMisc = 4 stars (atmosphere, homey feel)\n\nDefinitely a great little bar; we'll give the fish another shot at some point and we'll certainly try the rest of the menu items!", "type": "review", "business_id": "J2AiPQnKWBxBwc4MMkbH8w"}

Is it a diner? A bakery? An auntie's living room?

The Turkish coffee was weaker than expected, but wonderfully aromatized with cardamom. \n\nThere was so much food my eyes pin-balled for a minute. The red lentil soup made with sprouted lentils came in a bowl - a real bowl, not a cup-sized bowl. We also had the gyro plate which was satisfying, and mousaka entree which was like an eggplant, potato, and tomato casserole over yellow rice. By itself, the mousaka would last me two additional meals. We couldn't resist the Boston creme donut, which turned out to be the best I've had in Madison, and a gigantic cinnamon roll fritter. Plus the two coffees, the total came out to be $25 (!!) and some change. \n\nThe service is a relaxed pace, but the owners were charming and seemed to enjoy us enjoying their food.

The PA announcer consistently appeals to the good-natured (but peculiar) kitsch that fills a family-oriented outing (refers to foul balls as wieners or frankfurters for no particular reason). Check their web site -- their dates are chock-full of promos including autographed balls, celebrities (like the Fridge, Webster, Chewbacca and more) and post game events. \n\nAttending the Duck Pond (Mallards' park) re-energized my interest in baseball.

There are over 17 different beers available plus people selling Seagrams escape drinks (supposedly gluten free!), lime-a-Ritas etc. I was expecting pretty limited options for food as this is a smaller stadium but they really have everything you can get at an MLB game. Brats, burgers, chicken sandwiches, even cheese curds! There are even gluten free hamburger AND brat buns. Basically a food coma waiting to happen for anyone with celiac disease/gluten intolerance. The staff at all the food and drink stands was really friendly and quick!\n\nWisco fans everywhere are pretty chill but even more so here! Everyone is just here to have a good time and nobody gets really competitive about the game.\n\nWith plenty of food and drink options and great fans, a Mallards game is a great choice for a night out on a nice night!", "type": "review", "business_id": "4N7dN61pyPfcxmKgXWQPfw"}

Olbrich is a free botanical garden! Sure, the growing season here is very limited (even Milwaukee and Chicago have longer seasons!), but that is no reason to detract a star from a place because of the weather! \n\nThis place is gorgeous and the flora/fauna you might be inclined to visit depends on the time of year...the Thai Pavilion is probably the exception as the gold leaf and smooth stones stand out at anytime of year. (Did you know there are no nails in the entire structure? I think that is so amazing!) \n\nThe Bolz Conservatory is also open year round. It includes tropical plants as well as many species of smaller creatures be them mammal, bird, or butterfly. While the Gardens in Chicago or Domes in Milwaukee might run you a pretty penny, the Conservatory costs only $2. The gigantic koi, the exotic trees, and not even to mention being the cheapest sauna in Wisconsin! This place is so worth it! I adore it and still pickup the 'kids-only' scavenger hunt.\n\nEverything about this place is delightful. Also, I have navigated this place, with the exception of the rock garden, with a wheelchair. So for those concerned about others who cannot walk far or without assistance, there are many benches and areas for a rest! Did I mention that it is free?

I paid the $31 fee to have my pictures professionally done there, not a big deal bc I loved this place and it was worth that to me. I then found out we only had an hour to take them.  Ok still, we can hurry. As soon as we walked into the building, we were bombarded by the woman who runs the place(I assume), asking what we were doing, did we have a permit, and what not. We told her yes we paid, and we were waiting for our  photographer. She then asked me if I had any clothing changes planned, and I said yes, just one. Her answer astounded me. \"We don't allow people to change in our bathrooms, so you need to find someplace else, like your car\". Ummmm, it was a Saturday at 3pm and almost 80 degrees outside, how can you tell me I need to change in my car??  I was floored, speechless. She then goes \"it's in the contract\" bc she must have seen our jaws on the floor. How can you ask that of someone?!?  I work in customer service, and the way were treated that day was awful. Thank god a friend of mine who works with a limo service was there that day and I changed in the limo. My fianc\u00e9 did not bc he did not feel comfortable. When we came in, she followed us and goes \"10 minutes left\". Um again, what?!  I would assume she's walked the grounds before, and it takes a while to get around, especially in heels.  We ended up going 10 minutes over.. Oops. And my photographer stayed to take pics with my ring. Apparently the woman tracked her down and said she needed to leave. I was so excited to take my engagement pics there, considering they will be the only ones I take, and this lady ruined it. I've never been treated so terribly. Especially in a public place like that.

As several others have pointed out, the decor is nothing to write home about - nor even to dwell on it in a Yelp review, but It has always been my contention that if you offer great food at a fair price and are not offering a dining experience, then restaurant cleanliness and an attentive wait staff is a better investment than wood carvings and mood lighting.\n\nWe came for lunch and it turned out they had a fantastic buffet! Everything from tandoori chicken to palak aloo. Every dish was so flavorful and authentic. Having spent two years overseas where I associated with several Indians, I know they would have been suitably impressed. The waiter brought naan to the table and was there when our water glasses emptied. He didn't hover but he was attentive.\n\nMy lunch partner and I got a kick out of the sign that politely let buffet eaters know we were welcome to the food but would be charged for waste. It should go without saying, but I have been to several all-you-can-eat buffets and have witnessed first hand the amount of leftover food that has to be thrown away because people take too much. Personally I think part of the blame should be placed on the cooks/managers for not putting out a better product, but certainly the customer is largely to blame. Hence, a sign that clearly articulates the Maharaja's expectation of its customers is a good thing. Let's face it, if the food was bad, the customer would be screaming...\n\nBottom line, Eat here if you love Indian food.", "type": "review", "business_id": "jqo3Ljexof9sA8PhSTwEjA"}

The sad thing is that we \"tried\" to go to Red Lobster first, but were repelled by the large crowd of waiting people.  No, I don't want to stand around like cattle waiting for my pager to buzz so I can be ushered to a cramped seat, fed, branded, and ushered out again stampede style.  The mighty gods of chain restaurants everywhere are wagging their fingers at me right now saying, \"what do you expect lady?\"  I know, I know.  \n\nSo we went to Olive Garden down the street.  No wait there.  Our waitress was very young, I'll refer to her as \"Sparky\".  My dining companion had a sudden need to try some wine, so he asked Sparky what would pair well with the lasagna.  She didn't come across confident as she pointed to the list of wines on the menu that mister dining companion was holding.  She finally chose one and said that it would go well with the \"meaty\" dish.  I'm not sure what either one of us was expecting because after all this is Olive Garden and we have almost zero knowledge of wines.  So de-classA!!  \n\nAfter Sparky left our table, dining companion says that he expects the chosen wine to be the suck because Sparky doesn't look like she's even old enough to drink, let alone have knowledge of the fine wines.  But you know, none of this really matters when you consider the fact that compared to her we are old as dirt, and still don't know shit about wine.\n\nI had the eggplant Parmesan with Alfredo sauce.  It usually comes with marinara, but if I'm going to have a heart attack it had better well be because of something I enjoyed eating, not something I felt like I had to eat in the name of my health!  Hell no!  \n\nDining companion had his red wine something or other, and he was right it sucked.  He described it as tasting like, \"the barrel it came out of\".  \n\nAfter the main course I had the seasonal pumpkin cheesecake.  I made sure to look in a direction where no one could see my face before I crossed my eyes from sheer delight.  I am a pumpkin lovin' nerd by nature, and this cheesecake was gooood.\n\nSo this chain experience wasn't too bad.  The only thing that sucked was no refill on the bread sticks.  If I'm going to go slummin' at the chain restaurants, I expect the constant refills man.  Especially on those items they advertise as \"bottomless\" and/or \"never-ending\".   Finally, Sparky took a long time to bring by the check, and this goes against the code of chain fine dining, wham, bam, thank you mam.

The sound was terrible and I spent more time outside than in. \n\nMy second time was a better experience, but still not one that would cause me to suggest other people go there.

The sound was still deafening and subject to random strangers twiddling the knobs on the mixer, but overall not too bad. \n\nFree music is the best thing (only thing?) Mr. Roberts has going for it. Its biggest downsides:\n- it's touted as a blue-collar bar, but it's more an excuse to be shabby and dirty than anything; $15 for a 5-bottle bucket of beer is not a good deal, and $5 for a PBR & a rail shot is a special for a couple hours one night a week when it should be the standard price for such a combination\n- the ladies room is ridiculously tiny and awkward, had a seat that was half hanging off the bowl, and no TP\n- every surface was dirty or sticky, yuck\n\nYou probably won't die if you go to see a friend's band play, but supporting a friend should be the only motivation for setting foot inside.", "type": "review", "business_id": "-4PHmmCt_RmAfaE3sDKW_g"}

Fortunately, I think the staff finally figured out that two beers basically equals the cost of a sandwich (so what's the difference) and we got a nice row of tables.  Whew!

The beer list is good and reasonably priced ($4).  The menu offers burgers, apps, and sandwiches and sports several vegetarian options. Mr. had the special (Walleye sandwich) which he enjoyed while I had the Seitan Philly ($8.95), also tasty. We started with the cheese curds ($5.95) which were yummy. I'd previously had the kettle chips/dip, which were just that, chips/dip, nothing fancy and the fried pickles which weren't my favorite... \n\nAll in all I really liked the ambiance (but I'd go early so I can hear better) and appreciate the reasonably priced & yummy options for both vegetarians and carnivores.  I hope they are able to work out the kinks along the way (i.e., must order food to get a seat policy) but overall think this is a very nice addition to the neighborhood.", "type": "review", "business_id": "JJFoeKZXgi2_LeECDMkkoQ"}

We tried the carnitas - flavorful and tender - and a burger - expertly seasoned and juicy.  Both were slightly overcooked: the burger arrived more medium rare than the requested rare, and on the carnitas the yolk of one fried egg was deliciously soft, while the other was just a bit too set.  However the high quality ingredients and delightful flavors evened out any imperfections.  The drink menu was well rounded and we enjoyed both the beer and cocktails.  \n\nThe small touches in design elevate the interior from the ordinary in an entirely pleasing way.

Clearly the ribs have been highly reviewed so I actually went for the full slab.  Then it was a choice between the chopped pork sandwich and the brisket sandwich, I went for the pork sandwich from my fond memories of the same in Alabama.  Ordering over the phone, everything seemed to go well.  I then arrived about a half hour later.  There was 1 person in front of me who paid and was getting ready to leave when they brought my order to the counter and it was clearly wrong.  They had given my order to the man before me and I had his.  Apparently we both had the same first name.  Now this I was not perturbed by and was okay with, it was what followed that made me give this place 1 star.  So the counter lady tells me she'll take care of me first before resolving his issue, great!  So she charges my card for 64.66 which was clearly way more than I should have paid for 1 slab dinner and 1 pork sandwich + 1 side of fried dough.  Should have been 1/2 that.  I told her and she couldn't understand what I was talking about, I had to over-explain what I ordered and finally got through to her.  She took the bag back to the kitchen area saying some guy would have to deal with fixing this problem.  Now I was getting irritated.  She refunds me around 32 bucks in cash to make up for the overcharge.  I get a new bag of food and am finally done with the transaction, took about 15 mins to resolve.  Fine, I was happy in knowing I had a great dinner to enjoy soon.\n\nSo I come back and begin with the ribs, 1/2 a slab.  From the first taste I was not impressed.  I've had better ribs all over the country from Los Angeles to Alabama to Texas and Chicago.  Seriously?  This place has won all kinds of awards, I don't get it.  Almost every other place I've eaten ribs in my 40+ years of life has been better than this place.  The \"sugar-fried\" biscuits are nothing with nothing, you can get better donuts nearly anywhere, seriously (again).  The fries dipped in the BBQ sauce were the best part by far.  The corn was pretty good too, but still a little over the top on the taste, hard to describe.  So after being disappointed, I checked out the pork sandwich, and oddly enough there were 3 small containers with the sandwich, and somehow it didn't look like pork either.  I examined further, it was chicken, yet another screw-up with my order, wow!  And I ordered fries and mashed potatoes, neither of which was included.  Instead I found off-the-shelf beans, apple sauce (why?) which is not homemade, just spooned out of the jar, and the third container was BBQ sauce, which I didn't need since I bought a whole bottle.  So the other part of my order was completely wrong in every respect.  And note, the chicken was not anything to write home about either.  I drove to the other side of Madison, which was a fairly pleasant 1/2 hour drive, paid around 33 bucks for a very disappointing experience.\n\nI strongly recommend NOT going to this place, unless you like to take risks, maybe you'll like what you find, I know that if this is the best in Madison, I'll have to go elsewhere in the world to find good BBQ.\n\nOh well...", "type": "review", "business_id": "HLWtNcf3l-wKb6v9duteMQ"}

We 'd been looking for a good BBQ place in Madison, and Smoky Jon's was the first place we tried.  Needless to say, we won't be trying any place else!\n\nThe first thing that struck me was the great atmosphere in the restaurant.  It's a small place, maybe 15 tables total, and there's blues music playing in the background.  We put our order in at the front window and then grabbed a couple of tables.  We grabbed a couple of tables and didn't have to wait very long before our food was brought out.\n\nOh was the food good.  I ordered a 1/3 slab of ribs and the pulled pork sandwich combo platter.  The pork was piled on it's bun in plentiful quantities.  It was pretty good, the pork had good flavor and my only complaint is that it wasn't quite as tender and juicy as some of the homemade stuff I've had.  The ribs, though, were amazing.  The meat was incredibly tender.  More importantly, though, was that there was a lot of meat on each bone.  I'm used to seeing skimpy ribs get served at restaurants where you're left wanting more after a full rack.  Here, in just 4 bones I found I was very full.  Smoky Jon's sauce was a great compliment to the meat as well.  Good full flavor with a nice little kick at the end.\n\nThe sides were equally excellent.  The baked beans are a must, and I saved mine for the end so that's the flavor I would leave with.  I also had the sugar fried biscuits that were pretty good too.\n\nThe highlight of the meal, though, was something one of my friends had ordered.  The restaurant also had chili available (which may just be a seasonal item).  It was served with a fork rather than a spoon, and with good reason.  I've never seen chili that was that thick and meaty.  I was able to get a taste of it and was floored by how great the flavors were.  It was so good that I almost went back up to order some chili to go for the next day.\n\nSmoky Jon's is a must for BBQ fans in Madison.

Hmm... or maybe, next time don't be as dumb as me and say out loud you want to share.... sneakily share it at the table!!\n\nAnyways, Smoky Jon's was a great farewell from Madison meal for me, leaving me nice and full, the perfect prep for a long flight back to Los Angeles. \nI'd give it a solid 4 stars.", "type": "review", "business_id": "HLWtNcf3l-wKb6v9duteMQ"}

I love that it isn't just the regular brown house made goop that most BBQ joints serve. You can actually see and taste all the different spices/herbs!! Like I said, fabulous. \n\nI went with the smoked chopped pork shoulder sandwich platter and two sides: the potato salad and the corn. If you (like me) choose to order the corn to ease your conscience (after all, it is a vegetable, right?)...do not be fooled. The corn is puuuure buttery goodness. The potato salad is also delicious! Truly, the perfect complement to the sandwich. Creamy, no skin, no dill, just the way I like my potato salads. :9\n\nAt $8.45, the sandwich platters are very reasonably priced for the quantity of food you get. The takeout service is super quick as well - I think I got my food within 2-3 minutes of placing my order. Otherwise, Smoky Jon's seems like a fun place to dine in as well (lots of exposed wooden paneling and checkered tablecloths). You'll probably want to limit your party to a group of 4 or less though, the seating is limited!\n\nYelp recommendations for what to order as a first-timer to Smoky Jon's are on point. I can't wait to be back to try the ribs!!\n\nTip: their parking lot is tiny and shared with the bar next door, so don't expect to find any open spaces around lunch or dinner time.

This place is known for its ribs, and it deserves the praise it gets for them. There are some other hits, and some less than stellar items on the menu. \n\nWe got the half slab and jumbo 1/2 chicken dinner to share, which was huge! Big portions, but the chicken was really dry. The ribs were amazing. We also ordered some beef brisket, which is a much smaller portion than the ribs and chicken. If you're not a fan of fatty brisket (like me) than you'll be quite happy with their brisket. No awkward moments of biting into a string of fat and trying to spit it out in front of your date. \n\nThe sides, overall, could be better. But lets be honest, you're not here for the sides. If you don't want to order any sides you'll save about a buck, but it's worth it to venture out and try them. The baked beans were iffy. I heard a lot of good things about them via Yelp, but ours were grey-ish and tasted off. The potato salad is definitely full fat and more mayo based. It's a nice and cool way to offset the kick of BBQ. The french fries are more run-of-the-mill than anything else here. We also tried the fried biscuits after seeing so many people rave about them. Maybe I had too high of expectations? They were good, they tasted a bit like carnival food, but they didn't garner a \"Oh my, I'd eat these every day if I could\" opinion like the ribs did.\n\nThe sauce here is unlike any other BBQ sauce I've ever had. It's a bit chunky and sweeter than usual but has a nice kick at the end. \n\nDefinitely go for the ribs. The brisket is good. Chicken could be better. The sides are hit or miss.

Located nearby the airport, the well-lit, wooded interior starts with a pathway that leads to the large overhead menu, the ordering counter, and the dining area. Adding to the d\u00e9cor are the statewide accolades all around the walls. On this evening, the casual atmosphere happened to be unexpectedly subdued, quite unlike the other BBQ restaurants I've visited.   \n\nWe shared a Combination Meal ($17.75) that included our choice of 1/3 Slab, Smoked Pork Shoulder Sandwich, and extra serving of smoked pork shoulder, Cole Slaw, and BBQ Baked Beans. The Slab/Pork Ribs were smoky, tender, and the meat easily peeled off the bones. There was an excellent hint of smoke to deepen its flavor, and that was further enhanced by the BBQ sauce to provide a sweet higher note, strong black peppery secondary, and anchored by a noticeable spicy kick that reverberates with good hops. For the price, there wasn't enough meat on the ribs, but the flavors were still sensational. The dinner roll that this dish came with was sweet, soft, and spongy. I loved it.\n\nThe Pork Shoulder Sandwich was excellent as well. The pork shoulders were tender without one single dry spot--perfectly executed and delicious without the BBQ sauce. The meat was flavorful and deepened by its smoky flavor that coupled perfectly with the well-rounded, full-bodied spicy BBQ sauce. I absolutely loved it except for the buns that turned out flaky with hollow spots and lacking flavor. We finished the meat without getting into the buns very much. This sandwich could have been so much better with a bun of higher quality. \n\nThe BBQ Baked Beans were smooth, sweet, and delicious. The Slaw on the other hand was too wet with a weak texture. Compared to other BBQ joints, their sides could use more varieties such as green beans, collard greens, yam and other possibilities to complement this resounding BBQ. They also have two sauces, and I wished we had the option of trying both at the table.\n\nService was impatient at first, as we were initially tentative and indecisive about our choices. I wished the server could have been much more educational with their strengths and limitations to help us make the right decisions on this very first visit. However, she later became much more warm, accessible, attentive, and helpful towards the middle and end of the meal. Price-wise, their items were pricy with the portions we received.

They do have a ton of equipment available, but that's about it.\n\nI arrived on Saturday morning with my reservation for a 17' truck firmly in-hand. There was a line of people waiting to check-in/check-out equipment, and only one person working behind the counter. \n\nThe employee (a younger gentleman) appeared to be struggling with everything he did, and he wasn't shy about hiding his frustrations. After waiting for around 15 minutes, another employee (I believe he's the manager) jumped-in and helped folks. The manager was much more proficient, helpful, and friendly. I was third or fourth in line, and the manager processed all of us before the other guy finished his first customer.\n\nWhen I went to get my truck, there was an equipment problem, so they substituted another truck for me. Unfortunately, the truck that I was provided was ancient - it had 204,000 miles on it, the check engine light was on, and it ran so poorly that I thought I was going to breakdown at several points along the way. The steering components were so loose that the truck weaved and swerved the entire time; I could \"saw\" the steering wheel from the 9:00 to 3:00 position as I drove without affecting my direction/course.\n\nBecause of the check engine light, the truck averaged 3.2 miles to the gallon. My 46 mile round-trip move required 15-gallons of fuel to complete. That is absolutely absurd. The cost to refill the truck was $50 on the dot.\n\nEven more absurd were the fees for the truck... $29.95 for the day, $14 for insurance, and $1.09 per mile seem fair. Until they tack on additional service fees, etc. What should've cost around $70 - $80 for an in-town move cost nearly $100 + $50 for gas. \n\nReturning the truck was even worse, as the manager was long gone, and the lone dude was back at the counter. As soon as another employee arrived to assist with the line of people waiting to check-out, the first dude announced that he was \"f-ing out of here\" because he had \"the longest f-ing day of his life\" working there. Mind you, there were 5-6 people in line when he made his proclamation. \n\nI now remember why I've always used Penske or Budget when moving. It's unlikely I'll use these guys in the future...", "type": "review", "business_id": "tgGaaLuFPbeiwPZcAKFxGA"}

Luxury is yachts. Luxury is stretch limousines. Luxury is diamond tiaras and Rolex watches. Luxury is Bentleys and Beverly Hills; bone-in filets and \"bon appetite\". Luxury is throwing some glitter and making it rain.\n\nI once thought luxury in its truest form was to only be attainable by the rich and the powerful - but boy was I wrong. People -- luxury IS attainable. I know this, because I recently experienced it at the Country Inn and Suites outside of Madison, WI. \n\n Whether you opt for an \"inn\" or spring for a \"suite\" - you're going to love this fucking hotel. Upon entering the palatial lobby, a charming bellman presented me with my own personal luggage dolly, even though it was clear that my strapping, young body was more than adequate to carry my small, nylon duffle bag. The Sconnie at the front desk even put me up on the top floor of the resort (floor 3), which offered views of one of the most gorgeous bodies of water I had ever seen. \n\nThe ice bucket was a nice touch. It was large, though not too large as to take up much of the expansive counter space the room provided. There was even a plastic liner for the bucket--which I scoffed at. To think, who would even consider using it in such a pristine, meticulously manicured suite? I quickly tossed it, and when I did I couldn't help but notice the luxurious mini-fridge down below. Let me tell you, there was nothing \"mini\" about this fridge. I fit an entire case of Coors Light in there, along with some Gatorade, and cheese curds to boot. It looked so cool and cozy that, at the end of the evening, I wanted to curl up and sleep in there.\n\nThough it wasn't easy -- I refrained from sleeping in the mini-fridge. I mean, how could I sleep in there with one of the most luxurious beds I had ever seen staring me in the face? You could fit John, Kate, and the 8 on this bed. I never would, though. I'd kick them all out and keep all of the fresh pillows and down comforters to myself-- because THAT'S luxury, and Kate is mean. If it wasn't for a call of nature which I battled until my bladder nearly exploded on all of the luxurious bedding, I might STILL be laying in that fluffy wonderland of extravagance. \n\nNow, I've peed in some nice bathrooms... very nice bathrooms actually. Once, I came across a bathroom SO nice, I couldn't pee in there. I held it, and peed in my less fortunate bathroom at home-- but this bathroom? This bathroom was so luxurious; I HAD to pee in it. I couldn't unzip my fly fast enough (literally, I peed a little in my pants). Thankfully there was a cornucopia of fine soaps and lotions at my disposal. I would bet that royalty uses these same soaps - they just had that royal smell about them. When I was done drying my hands, I squirted a little more of that soap on them and didn't even wash it off.\n\nSummary: In hindsight, this is really only a place you want to stay at if you're celebrating something really special-- a honeymoon, for instance, or a significant wedding anniversary. I would've stayed someplace else had I known the Country Inn and Suites was so luxurious. Now, back at my home, I fear I may never taste that royal tang again. Enjoy your stay here; cherish it. I know I sure did.", "type": "review", "business_id": "hmYAW7mhIz_o8ArencdkDw"}

I used to be heavily involved in bike racing about 20 years ago, but becuase of the sport changing so much to this date, I once again went to the Village Peddler to ask the experienced and knowledgeable staff at VP. Having two boys changing from BMX style to Mountain bikes, I had no idea what to look for size wise. Gary showed both boys the different bikes and took the time to explain the differences. When each of them picked out the style of bike that they liked the most, Gary measured each of them and suggested the correct size knowing that they will need room to grow. In comparing two other bikes stores, their sale prices were still more than Village Peddler everday prices, can you say mark-up!\n\nEach of the boys were taught how to assemble and dissasemble their tires making sure to check the brakes to allow them for a seamless ride.Gary went over this a couple times to make sure the boys were comfortable to do it on there own, then asked them both to do it by themselves. After about two times, they are pros! I was impressed as I sat back and watched the interaction between the boys, Gary, and newly joining in on the conversation; Mike. It was impressive to see that both of the boys fealt comfortable and were totally ingaged with Gary and Mike like they had known them for years. It was obvious that both the men have kids and could relate specifically on a personal level before professional. Both Gary and Mike spent about 25 minutes with them, which in this day and age doesn't happen in the big corporate run stores. I have been in customer service myself for over 20 years, so it definitely takes a lot to impress me! \n\nI have visited other bike stores where we were just treated like a number, when finally asked if we needed help it was if the clerk was being timed to make sure he could get back to the next person in line. When I am considering spending a large amount of money, if I am not impressed with your customer service, you have definitely lost the sale. In this case, we as a family were treated excellent, and coming from a guy in his 40's, I don't find many places that are willing to make a good personal experience great, but in the case it most definitely was. \n\nWe added several accessories to our purchase and all together spent far less than we would have elsewhere. Once we were done, both guys wheeled the bikes out and helped us secure them in the truck conveinently out a side door of their shop. While in the store, I picked out a couple of bikes that I am intersted in, and soon as have time, you can bet that I am going to head back and buy the one that makes the most sense. When I have a good experince shopping, I tend to tell everyone I know, and this time will be no different. Thanks for a pleasent experience guys, I really appreciate it! \n\nCharles", "type": "review", "business_id": "BUOWRkEr9Au2BVW2QmW2bA"}

Most of the Wisconsin population will go out for fish on Friday night, not all, but most do. We were with friends and the vote was for fish. Fat Jack's was close and we had not been there for some time. And our friends were never there, so we pulled into Fat Jack's.\n\nWe all ordered the Friday Night Fish Fry. One thing I like about their Fish Fry is you can get their steak fries or their beans or Red Rice and Beans as a side. The four of us tried them all and all the sides were all good. The fish was done well with not too much batter, a trait I like in a Fish Fry. Their coleslaw is very good, but I would like more with my fish. Overall, Fat Jack's has a very good Wisconsin Friday Night Fish Fry.\n\nNow really why I was at Fat Jack's and that was for their Cajun Potato soup. It is just marvelous. I could just stop for the soup. It is spicy, but not overbearing. There are chunks of potato and the soup is thick, but not too thick. It has the color of toast that is not too dark.

I opened the freezer and everything was defrosting. I called a couple places and I was told I would have to wait until next week to have a new one delivered.  I called Brothers Main and Dave said he would see what he could do about getting a new one delivered the next day.  Dave, and the owner of the store were very helpful, no high pressure sales, just very interested in helping us out.  They even offered to give us a free loaner if the one we wanted was not in stock! The frig we ended up picking out was listed as having damage on it's side.  We saw nothing, but they offered a discount anyway.  The frig arrived this AM around 9:30.  They called half hour before they left the store to confirm and called again when on their way.  The delivery guys were very nice, and extremely careful.  I was happy to see that they used sound ergonomic lifting techniques too.  The new frig is up and running, looks great, and our food did not have a chance to rot.

You walk into a highly secure well thought out maze that forces you past all of their high profit items or whatever they want you to see on the way to your can of WD-40. They just \"remodeled\" the Monona store and made it much larger (like it wasn't large enough already), and it is now ridiculously large, to the point I will not go back unless I absolutely HAVE to. I am  partially disabled and can have a difficult time walking, so when a store forces you to walk through needless extra aisles it becomes very daunting.\nThis store seems \"artificially\" large and there is a TON of wasted space, it appears that they made the store as large as they legally could, and for no other reason than that.\n\nI also resent being distrusted to such a high degree. I fully understand that they must maintain a secure place, but Mernard's makes it super obvious. On the subject of distrust, I think they may distrust their employees even more than the customers. This is blatantly obvious when the cashiers have to get a manager's approval to accept a $20 bill or do any sort of pricing change in correcting one of their all to frequent \"computer goofs\"(funny how these \"innocent\" computer error/ pricing over-rings are ALWAYS in their favor).  They also boast a computer at the customer svc.counter displaying the Menard's website, but it doesn't go \"on-line\".  They offer a price guarantee but have no way to verify or look up a competitor's price due to this seemingly and prevailing level of distrust of everyone.\n\nI will give Monona Menard's props in just ONE area (Monona Menard's has an extra large wood shed and selection) and that is their lumber quality and selection. They have the most extensive assortment of awesome quality lumber I have ever seen in any lumber retailer anywhere. They have lumber assorted by species and size and it is not all culled and picked over, it is always nice, clean and straight. \n\nIf I have to ever return here it will be only for the lumber and building materials selection which is far superior to The HD or Lows.", "type": "review", "business_id": "SqdO4jenDHNwHeSKmULPrA"}

I love free stuff. Even if it appears to be absurd, like a Sunday paper. The deal is, you spend five dollars and they give you a two dollar Wisconsin Sunday paper. Okay, so know you know how I ended up here, let me tell you all about the magnificent Metcalfe's.\n\nIt is just a supermarket. Not of a Safeway variety, but a Gelson's or Bristol Farms variety. Despite the many Yelpers who proclaimed that this is expensive, its not expensive. If you are buying toilet paper or paper towel here, it is expensive, but it is no more expensive on food than anyone else. I don't care about some Brat Fest, I don't even care about brats. Cheese is just cheese, in fact, if you have been to cheese stores in New York and Paris, you realize everything else pales in comparison. In fact, everything pales to New York and Paris anyway.\n\nBack to the review. The store is well laid out, clean, the produce appeared fresh. It was early on a Sunday morning, but a lot of the prepared foods were already out. They looked good, but I don't buy prepared foods in a supermarket, unless its Wegmans, but that isn't a supermarket, its nirvana. Thus I can not assess the prepared section. I do buy baked goods, and it is on this basis that the store failed. As I was walking down the bakery aisle, I noticed a slice of white cake. I love white cake. The soft, dewy white cake, enrobed in creamy butter cream frosting *cue the angels and ethereal music* Anyway, as part of my five dollars, I bought a 2.49 piece of white cake. *gag* How much sugar do you people eat? The cake was okay, but the frosting was just a sugary, you could taste the granules, nightmare. This is not white cake!!\n\nThere was nothing wrong with the store, but if your bakery sucks, it is a good indication that the other prepared foods are not going to be very good and there are also some other flaws. I didn't see anything that was unique or that would make me want to come here. There wasn't any Bell and Evans Chicken. I did see they sold Boar's Head cold meats, which is always a plus, but is it worthy of five stars? No.\n\nSorry Mr. and Mrs. Metcalfe (or whomever you are), work on the bakery, let me know and I will come back and re-evaluate you again.", "type": "review", "business_id": "OxR3b_qcMJlzwzGPU5fmdA"}

I am new to Madison and everyone can't stop talking about what an experience it is to shop here. It's the fine-dining of grocery shopping. Well, I have only been shopping like a grown up for about a year now - but I learned how to do it in Denver. So the bar was set pretty high through Whole Foods and Safeway. But I can safely say that my experience at Metcalfe's topped it.\n\nIt was very clean and well stocked. I believe I went on a Friday night too. The main goal was to get some fresh meat and milk; let's face it - those are two items you don't want to get from an Aldi's or a Woodman's. I was told by a friend that I was lucky to live so close to it, but to be careful because it was expensive. WRONG, not expensive (or maybe Denver was expensive, so that word has become relative).\n\nSafeway had a discount meat section because it was within a few days of expiring (cook it that night and you're fine). Now, I wasn't looking for that at Metcalfe's (I don't know if they'd have that even), but I found $2 Pork Butt Steak (which, the mere name of the steak made me question it - but for $2 I'll try anything once). Delicious, and I won't go as far as to say I'm a great cook.\n\nOf course I also got some stuffed pork chops and fresh produce. But the experience I had was very pleasant and the prices were fair for the quality of food I was buying (dare I say, I thought prices should be higher).\n\nAs for the atmosphere, I don't think I've gone to a store in a long time that played classical music.

For example, if you choose buttercream for your frosting, it will be smooth and sweet and creamy awesomeness in your mouth -- but on the cake, any colors will run and it can't hold complex shapes, so you're limiting yourself to very simple designs. Other frosting options exist, such as fondant and rolled white chocolate, and they each have their own set of benefits and limitations as well.\n\nIf you're good at research, you have some time to kill and you know what you're looking for, you can find a lot of this information on-line -- but when you're in the midst of the overwhelming task of planning a wedding, it would be so, so much easier to just sit down with a professional who can lay out all your options and explain the benefits and limitations of each one.\n\nUnfortunately, you won't find anyone like that at Carl's Cakes. Oh, Carl seems friendly, helpful and optimistic when you first meet him. The samples he gave us at our cake tasting were better than I ever knew cake could be, and when we asked about decorations, he was quick to assure us that he could \"do anything you want\". \n\nAfter our initial meeting with Carl, we surfed the Net for examples of memorable wedding cakes and cherry-picked the ideas we liked best until we had put together the perfect cake design. I'll admit it was on the moderately complicated side, but nothing exceptional by wedding cake standards; and after Carl's repeated assurances at the tasting that he could \"do anything you want\", we thought we were safe.\n\nBut once he has your deposit, his attitude changes. He's difficult to get ahold of by phone, and impossible to get ahold of by email. Suddenly, any design requests more complicated than the average birthday cake are answered with a simple \"I can't do that\". Even something as simple as multiple colors will be refused on the basis that the colors will bleed together. He never tries to suggest compromises or alternatives, and if you ask for them, he'll only tell you to come in and pick something from his generic book of designs.\n\nWhy all the limitations? Because Carl frosts his cakes with buttercream frosting -- and ONLY buttercream frosting.\n\nI've lost track of how many hours we spent on the phone going back and forth with Carl over the cake design, struggling to find something he could do that didn't leave us cold. Dealing with him wasted a large portion of the limited time we had to plan our wedding, and drastically increased our stress during an already stressful time. If I was rating his business purely on Customer Service, I'd have to give him 1 star.\n\nBut I'll also give credit where credit is due. In the end, he delivered our cake on time, in the flavors, size and design that we eventually agreed to. It was beautiful, if vastly simplified from our original design, and the flavor? To this day, our wedding cake is still the best thing I've ever had in my mouth. If I were rating his business purely on taste, I'd have to give him 5 stars. Heck, I'd give him 6 if it were possible.\n\nSo if you want the best cake you've ever had in your entire life, consider Carl's Cakes -- But consider very carefully. Give him an exact cake design and make ABSOLUTELY SURE he can do it without modifications BEFORE you give him a dime.", "type": "review", "business_id": "tE8MQ9I7E2_Xvm4AvykXrw"}

Therefore, I end up there for groceries more often than not. \n\nThen came yesterday:\n\nI have been looking an issue of Time magazine.  I have tried a few places with no luck.  So rather than waste gas money, I began calling around.  I live about a mile from the Sentry store and thought I would give it a call on the way home.  The phone was answered and I simply asked: Do you carry Time Magazine?  Her response was: Maybe, yeah I think so.  Before I could ask if it was in stock, she hung up on me.  No good bye.  Nothing.  If she was busy she could have said that.  \n\nSo I go into the store to search for it, assuming it is there.  I do find it in the magazine rack and I check the head of the registers.  I hear a voice and immediately recognize the woman who answered the phone.  She had a peach colored fleece on.  She is an older woman in her 50/60's with graying hair behind the customer service register.  I pass her up because I am completely upset to see her doing nothing.  The fact that she hung up on me and I come to the store and I see her sitting on a chair doing nothing angered me.  \n\nI continued to look for my magazine.  One of the cashiers asks if they can help me with something.  I tell her I am looking for Time Magazine.  Her response: Well, umm, what?  Never heard of it.  \n\nNow, I could care less if they do not carry it, but thus far I have been told you might carry it by a woman who hung up on me and then a cashier who has never heard of a national magazine.  I keep looking.  I ask another cashier who might know.  After all, what if I just overlooked it?  She says she does not know.  And that is it.  \n\nThat is my whole experience trying to find a magazine.  I walked out feeling completely terrible.  I shop at the store because it is near my house.  Last night, I decided to stop shopping there.  I will drive to the belt line and go to Pick and Save or up to Sun Prairie.

Decent service, mediocre food, fairly pricey for average bar food.\n\nDetailed review:\n\nAfter taking a small fish fry break, we resumed our quest to find the best fish fry in southern Wisconsin. With the roads in poor shape thanks to the recent snow, we decided to focus our sights on local offerings, and since Tully's is \"around the corner\" from our friend's house, we decided to give it a try.\n\nWe walked in and seated ourselves; we chose a small table that was located in a section \"in front\" of the bar area and adjacent to the pool tables. The salad bar and another small dining area are located on \"the other side\" of the pool table room... Odd layout for certain.\n\nOur waitress took our drink orders and we browsed the menu, which included your typical bar fare: lots of fried appetizers, burgers, sandwiches, and so on. I'll say this - there are a ton of items on the menu; even the Friday night fish fry offered 7 varieties of fish, 4 of which are all you can eat.\n\nOur drinks arrived and we placed our orders: AYCE baked cod with a baked potato, AYCE beer battered cod with cheesy hash browns, and AYCE lake perch with hash browns.\n\nWe were informed that our meals also included a salad bar trip... Too bad we had already ordered cheese curds. \n\nBut, being the troopers we are, we ventured over to the salad bar and built a few plates. It was ok for a bar's salad, but not great by any means. My tomatoes were mushy and tasted \"off\"; broccoli was dry and obviously came from a bag. Coleslaw earned decent reviews.\n\nCurds and fish arrived at the same time. Curds were breaded and typical \"from the freezer bag\" variety. Nothing special, and not worth the $6.79 price tag.\n\nFish plates each had two pieces; baked cod was drenched in buttery water and loaded with dill flake. Hmm... It tasted ok, but wasn't as flaky, tender, or flavorful as I'd prefer. Baked potato was foil-wrapped, and nicely cooked.  \n\nBattered cod had a decent batter that had just a hint of a unique flavor (we couldn't put our finger on it, as it was tasty), but it was fairly greasy and like the baked cod, the actual fish was quite \"lifeless.\"  The cheesy hash browns were good- nice and crispy, with only a hint of grease.\n\nBattered lake perch was just like the cod, only it was more greasy. I shed a small tear as grease oozed out of the piece I tried.\n\nThe bill arrived... $55 for three with one round of beers. Yikes.\n\nTully's = fail.\n\nService = 4 stars (good, prompt, fun)\nFood = 2 stars (based on fish only)\nValue = 2 stars\nMisc = 2 stars (not real exciting)\n\nI'd come here to drink some Miller Lites and to munch on some bar food during a game, but I'd skip the fish fry.", "type": "review", "business_id": "kOXJrbuB1a1Na6sf_WQnDg"}

There was a grampa with a 10 yr old or so grandkid sitting at the corner of the bar. Ah, Wisconsin and the practice of taking your kids with you to bars for drinks.  They had decent happy hour specials for rail drinks and mass market beers. After a bit, I ordered dinner of a chicken cordon bleu sandwich and fries. They had some special parmesean herb fries that I asked to get instead of the regular ones because that sounded a bit more exciting. They were not exciting.

The veggies (a cabbage, carrot, broccoli, bell pepper mix) were lightly cooked & also had some slight seasoning that really enhanced the taste without overshadowing the taste of the veggies themselves; I could have had an entire plate of the veg & been satisfied! Well, I wouldn't want to miss the meat, but the veggies were that good!\n\nMy husband had the goat curry & he really enjoyed that as well. I knew that he liked it because all of a sudden, he wasn't talking to me, he wasn't looking at me, he was just eating. \n\nWe both put down our forks when we were full, but kept taking bites here & there as we waited for boxes.\n\nThe service was a little slow after we got our food, but it didn't seem like neglect, it was busy & there just seems to be a small number of staff.

I've had passable sausage gravy and biscuits all over this great land of ours...but what I just ate at the Dairyland Family Restaurant comes nowhere close to being sausage gravy and biscuits.\n\nThe gravy itself was passable as gravy.  Lifeless and sad, but gravy.  The biscuit chunks in the gravy was where things start to go awry.  They were all uniform in size and shape (warning!) and they tasted not like sausage, but more like something that was killed out behind the dumpster last night.  Maybe it was raccoon sausage.  \n\nThe biscuits themselves are where the whole train truly derails.

Everyone was in the mood for burgers so it seemed like a good fit for a relatively inexpensive Friday night dinner.  Pulling in the parking lot I was surprised at the lack of business - that should have been my first clue.  We were seated promptly and our drink order was taken.  Then we waited.  And waited.  Finally our drinks arrived and our order was taken.  We ordered a small appetizer and bowl of soup with our meals.  Again, we waited.  Our appetizer finally arrived - but no soup.  It was mediocre, and sadly, the best food we would have that evening.\n\nOur entrees arrived shortly after.  It was then my husband asked if he could have his bowl of soup.  Soon after the waitress arrived with a half filled bowl.  It almost looked as though it had been full at one point, then dumped out.\n\nThe fries were cold on all our meals.  The burger I ordered well done, was extremely pink. I did not bother to ask for it to be corrected because at this point the whole experience was quite laughable.  More than halfway through our entrees, a gentlemen in what appeared to be a manager's uniform, came to the table with a bowl of soup asking if it was ours.  My husband laughed and told him, \"No, I already got this half full bowl.\"\n\nA few moments later I bit into something hard, like bone, in my burger.  At that point I was disgusted - and done.  I would have told the waitress that the food (and service) was awful, but we were never asked.  When she brought the bill she said she had taken the soup off the bill since it was only a 1/2 bowl.  So my husband's comment must have at least made it back to her, yet there was no apology for it, nor the fact that he had to ask for it and received it after his entr\u00e9e.\n\n$58.00 for 3 people, lackluster/slow service and terrible food?

They are similar to Culvers but doesn't offer you that \"home quality\" kind of experience. \n\nI typically get the Bleu Ribbon with some pink. I like the fried onion straws they add to the burger as well as this chipotle spread they use after toasting their buns. Mix that with the burger, BBQ sauce and bleu cheese and you've got a great tasting large juicy burger. I sometimes have to cut it in half because it's hard to take a bite out of. The burger comes with a side of endless steak fries they are often cooked to perfection. They are one of the few places that offers onion rings, however, as much as I love me some rings, I do not care much for theirs. The onions they use are extremely thick making it hard to bit into. I have often times ended up just eating the breading and putting the onions to the side. They are onion rings! This doesn't make any sense! They need to slice their onions thinner. As of now, I do not believe they are editable. \n\nMy other negative is presentation. The Bleu Ribbon has a lot going on so I realized that sometimes the burger can get messy. However, there have been times where my burger has come out looking like it went through a tornado. Lettuce falling everyone, too much BBW sauce, bleu cheese thrown on. The presentation needs to get better. I've experienced this at two different Red Robins. Also, I've also noticed that within the last year, they've cut back on the amount of steak fries they give you. Since they are bottomless it makes really no difference but I've definitely seen a change. \n\nThat being said, I would rate Red Robbi as being more than just an \"A-OK\" burger joint but they are far from a \"4+ star\" quality kind of joint. I do like the atmosphere. They have a few game machines, TV's, bar, background music and great classic pictures hanging on the walls that are great for helping to start a conversation ( say you're on a first date?). The art and photography they use to decorate the place I believe adds a lot of character and \"spunk\". \n\nThey do get very busy on weekends so expect a wait for a table and for your food but from my experience, it has never been extremely long. Wait staff has been good for me as well. \n\nOverall, they are a solid burger place. A bit pricey but I do think they are good. \n\nOh, one more thing, if you're dieting,....The Bleu Ribbon is 1,001 calories and fries are close to 500 calories!!! (According to my \"Lose it!\" app - they could be wrong but I also believe this is an extremely high calorie meal)", "type": "review", "business_id": "4pZeC9W0EIiBTOJMnwG2vw"}

There are thousands of books, plus magazines, video, audio and even tools (did you know you can check out tools?) all for free. There are plenty of places to sit, tables if you're trying to get work done, and computers for public use. There's also a big meeting room where they hold a nice variety of interesting events. There are several themed book displays around the library, which is nice when I wander in just looking for something, anything, to read. I think my favorite feature, though, is the hold service: you can request any item from any library in roughly half of the state, and it will be delivered to this library in short order. I know, it's a common library service these days, but have you ever stopped to think about how amazingly helpful it really is? And for free!\n\nMy only disappointment is that the circulation desk staff are pretty consistently unfriendly. Rarely rude, never incompetent, just very few smiles and no unnecessary words.

I asked the owner about this, and she said that nothing was going on and that he played well with other dogs. \n\nWell two months ago, my healthy four year old dog came back barely able to walk. It took weeks before he recovered, and he still hasn't seemed himself. I can't help but wonder what goes on there, but it seems like something fishy is going on. \n\nTo make matters worse, I boarded him at a different kennel last weekend. The owner immediately called me after I dropped him off and explained that he was acting traumatized and terrified of the kennel. He said it was very obvious he was not suited for kennels. \n\nUnfortunately, he also told me that some kennels are known for taking dogs that don't do well and lying to the owners to keep the business. When I mentioned Hickory Hills, he laughed and said they were the worst kennel in Madison. He also told me a story about how the owner or manager killed several dogs by leaving insect poison out in the play area.\n\nI feel so lucky my dog wasn't more hurt at this horrible kennel, and I hope nobody else has to lose a beloved pet to this sub-par facility.

They are very organized package bakery perfectly.  I never had anything smushed by being jammed in (like other places).  They rarely struggle with stocking or maintaining an attractive display.  I have never felt ignored or frustrated by cash handlers.  These are amazing accomplishments factoring in the madness of the CSFM.\n\nMy change your life recommendation is their Napoleon. It is the eclair's hotter sibling. Oakhouse's offering is a ginormous & gorgeous pile of puff pastry, vanilla cream and vanilla/chocolate glaze decadence.  The layer offers dynamic and perfect flavor combinations vs. the eclair's often disappointing cream to pastry ratio.\n\nNext time you go to the CSFM... sting Stella's and make a beeline to Oakhouse.

I found myself at Abra after a fender-bender left my bumper with a deep, ugly scrape.  This is how it went down. I was sitting in my parked car in a parking ramp at UW-Madison.  I vaguely noticed a car pulling in too close in the space next to me--but I was too busy talking to my BF on the phone to pay much attention.  All of a sudden, my car rocked to the side as the parking-impaired perp hit me, and then gunned his car backward, forcibly dragging it out of the space and doing a lovely number on my bumper.  I whipped around to look just in time to see the guy taking off at full speed. \n\nWell...that got my Irish up.  \n\nI am NOT making this up...there were witnesses.  Being familiar with the parking ramp, I was fairly sure that he wouldn't be able to make a clean get-away.  So I jumped out of my car and chased him down on foot--in high heels.  When I caught up to him, it was a terrified teenage guy (can you imagine the sight of a crazy, high-heeled woman approaching at a dead run in the review mirror???).  In short: I convinced him that he should return to the scene of the crime.  I have a broken toe for my trouble--and a laugh every time I think about it.\n\n'Nuff said.  So anyway.  Abra.  I arrived on-time for my appointment, and watched in growing dismay as one, then two people arrived after me and were immediately helped by one of the technicians.  Then I realized that the harassed soul casting helpless glances in my direction as he dealt with an annoying, disgruntled customer was the technician appointed to deal with my assessment.  Stuff happens.  The actual assessment took only about 10 minutes, and then I was on my merry way.  It just seems like there should be a first-come, first-served type of system in place, but what do I know?", "type": "review", "business_id": "-J-kQpDGIkX_1XHfi0HG2g"}

So I took it there for an assessment.\n\nEveryone was extremely kind and helpful. The process of getting the estimate both by Geico and by ABRA was very quick and easy. Also, ABRA was nice enough to provide me with a rental car on their dime. Enterprise came out to ABRA's location and we took care of the rental there.  All I paid for was the insurance which was like $12-13/day.\n\nABRA sent daily updates via text message letting me know their progress and as soon as they had an estimated completion time, the let me know that as well.\n\nI dropped it off on Tuesday, January 21 and they completed all the repairs and paint on Friday however I couldn't pick it up until Monday, January 27 as the paint needed to dry.

Apparently something has changed, because after placing a third order the other night, I was informed that you do in fact deliver to my zip code... Just not to my apartment.  What gives?  Why did this change out of nowhere?  We had just added UNO to our weekly Friday delivery rotation and then you had to go and break our hearts.\n\nBut fine.  I understand.  I won't be spending as much money there but I wasn't mad because my apartment is about ten minutes away and maybe that's just too far.  But the girl who delivered this news could not have sounded like she cared any less about the inconvenience.  Just asked if we could come pick it up.  No explanation.  No offer to make things better or take a bit off the bill.  Just a flat, slightly irritated statement.  Thanks a lot.\n\nThe macaroni really hits the spot on a bad day.

Now, I am an average consumer with a college education, however, I am not familiar with HVAC systems at all. So, I am posting this in the public to hopefully help other consumers to not fall for the \"Spring Tune Up\" Offer by All Comfort Services @ 5245 Voges Road Madison, WI 53718. \n\nIn full transparency I am also posting copies of the quotes & receipts from the technician. Here: https://plus.google.com/u/0/111026625881803880071/posts/PKBhrxTNQs7 \n\nScenario: \n- I found a special on Angieslist for $139 for a technician to come to my house for a spring AC Tune Up. \n- My system is 23 years old, and the furnace has been very well maintained works fine. \n- The technician was at my house for 45 minutes. \n\n1. Replaced my furnace filter. \n2. Put \"Comfort Services\" stickers all over my furnace (and removed the competitors) \n3. I showed him how to turn on my thermostat (I have a nest) \n4. Hooked up the gauges to the AC and ran the system 6. Stated that I have a very small amount of freon, and that it is cost prohibitive to find a leak ($435-$600, and recharge $161). \n5. Recommended that I buy a new AC unit and furnace \n6. Charged me $139. \n7. Scheduled a Salesman to come to my house 2 business days later to sell me a new A/C & Furnace system for between $7,679 - $8,742. \n\n\nSince then, I have had 2 other HVAC companies visit me and make other recommendations and provide a complimentary \"leak check\" by loading in nitrogen and offering me some other options. \n\n\nConclusion: I've decided to recharge the freon in my system through another HVAC company and they will come out in 2 months (free of charge) to test my pressure again. My honest opinion is that All Comfort Services uses their technicians to generate leads to replace full HVAC systems.

They have a good-sized pool and a big, comfortable lobby.  There were quite a few people checking in at the same time I was (the young lady at the front desk seemed a bit frazzled, but still very professional) and I was surprised how much room there was given the limited space they had cordoned off for registration.\n\nI would complain about the fact that there were only two elevators at either end of the hotel, but for this size hotel it didn't make sense to add more.  It gave the feeling that we were waiting a long time because we had only one option, but that was probably just skewed because of my impatience of wanting to get to where I was going that night.  I did take the stairs a few times when I didn't want to wait and going up and down to the third floor was surprisingly un-strenuous.  They had enough room that the staircase was very shallow.  Actually, a very unusual setup.\n\nI was a little disappointed in the morning when we were trying to get breakfast.  Like the first Marriot we stayed on the outbound part of our trip, there were waffle makers, but these weren't self-serve.  There was an area for a \"chef\" to make you eggs/omelette, but there was no one manning the station.  Granted, it was early.  But still.

Although, since there was no other food source on-site (again, excluding the early breakfast option), I would have loved to see more variety/options in the \"market\" area.  As we were checking out we asked (multiple Associates) about their rewards program and finally got some info.  It was not readily available, and many staff members didn't know anything about it.

First and foremost the customer service here is terrible. My parents have visited the shelter on more than one occasion to view the dogs ready for adoption and have yet to be greeted with a friendly helping hand. If they had they would have a dog right now. Its hard to enquire about a dog when no one or information is available regarding the dog. In addition I believe adoption fees ranging from $175.00 to $350.00 are a bit much especially considering the funding the Dane County Humane Society receives.  Perhaps they should consider arranging discounted fees with vet services they use.  I understand it does cost a great deal of money to home an animal which should be taken into consideration by the adoptee however you shouldnt have to spend hundreds to get a dog. I mean considering they put thousands of dogs to sleep each year!!! Nonetheless if you can rescue a animal from here...There is no greater gift than the gift of life!", "type": "review", "business_id": "DdaBJ-NJrvXSjfNRhbA71Q"}

It was after about 5 visits that we met her, and instantly fell in love with her. During each of those visits we had great experiences with the staff there - they were all very friendly, patient and helpful. We witnessed others receiving the same level of service. They seem really interested in pairing the dogs up with the right people. \n\nBetsy M.: perhaps your parents should revisit this shelter. Help is readily available, and there is a wealth of information about each dog attached to their kennel, and you can get their whole health folder upon request. \n\nAdditionally, the adoption fees are almost always $175, though they are $250 for a puppy or $275-350 for a \"highly desirable\" breed (which I think they rarely label dogs as that - all of the dogs we encountered, including purebreds, were the standard $175). Considering that all of their dogs are spayed/neutered, microchipped, updated on most vaccinations, and given vet exams, I don't think that their rates are unreasonable. In fact, they were lower than two other local shelters not related to the Humane Society.\n\nI have often heard how they do put so many dogs to sleep here, and it does upset me a great deal. However, rather than avoid them for that, I think it's all the more reason why we should adopt our dogs and really be able to rescue them. Avoiding a shelter because of that will not help the animals. PLEASE consider adopting before you look to a pet store or a breeder!", "type": "review", "business_id": "DdaBJ-NJrvXSjfNRhbA71Q"}

We had adopted our first dog from DCHS a little over a year prior to this and absolutely love her (and yes, spoil her). \n\nWe thought the staff handled the introduction of the dogs flawlessly. They let each dog sniff out the room alone, and then had my bf and I watch through windows as they introduced the dogs. They kept the atmosphere positive and free from distractions, while slowly giving them more and more space to interact. The dogs were buddies from the start and have continued to be best friends. \n\nOnce again, we were thrilled with the staff and the whole process. Also like the resale shop set up in the hall, very cool! \n\nRemember to support animal shelters and rescues!

But that's where the positive praise ends for me.\n\nWe visited here several times in search of our next doggie family member. Never were we greeted. Not even a mean greeting, or a rude greeting... No greeting. It seems anyone can just walk in here and roam around. That was always a red flag to me when I went there but we wanted to rescue a dog and give it a loving home, so we continued to go.\n\nFinally, we found a dog that didn't have \"adoption pending\" on it's kennel, since almost all do there ( maybe try keeping animals who are already adopted separate from available ones,DCHS?). We had to track down a staff member since none ever seem to be around even monitoring the dog kennels (another red flag). Finally we did and we asked to see the dog. Here's where it really got weird...\n\nThe two women, who never introduced themselves (I refer to them as the blonde and the brunette) seemed very adamant about us taking him that same evening. They hadn't asked us any interview questions like other shelters do... They never even asked us what type of home he'd be in or anything. they asked us if we had kids, if we lived alone, and if we owned our home. Apparently three questions answered and you can take home a dog? ( horrible). But we were so excited about the dog we weren't really thinking about their lack of questions or how pushy they seemed about us taking him right away.\n\nOnce we got home with him we learned why they were so pushy. They told us he was so sweet... Such a calm guy, loving etc. They said he got nervous in the kennel but that's it. We bring him home and within a few hours he is biting us, growling at us, and literally grabbed my subway sand which out of my hand the second I picked it up .. When I tried to say no and get my sandwich back he bit my hand and drew blood. Later he also stole the remote out of my boyfriends hand and tore it to pieces in a second. He growls everytime you go near him.. And this is while we are talking in calm quiet voices, moving slowly, trying to do anything to make him feel calmer.\n\nHe has now bitten us each multiple times in 12 hrs.. He knocks anything over (plants, anything on the counter) and growls at you and tries to bite if you run to pick it up.\n\nI'm not mad at the dog. It isn't his fault he probably was abused in previous homes. But- it was absolutely the DCHS job to tell us he was aggressive. To tell us he bites and snarls and growls. To tell us he may guard food even food that isn't his. Were furious that they completely lied to us and were so pushy about us taking him immediately (no wonder why though). Do NOT adopt a dog from here simply because these people have no business conducting behavioral assessments on dogs as they failed with this one... They also are illegally lying to people to get them to take home a dog. \n\nWe are furious and wanted this dog more than anything but we deserved to be properly prepared for the way he is so aggressive. We told them we wanted a calm family dog who was a sweetie and we go on runs with. They had him in the shelter for a month- if we learned his behaviors in a day, I'm sure they knew all about his biting and aggression. I've had many dogs all who were trained by me and I have never seen a dog with this level of aggression in my life. I'm severely disappointed in the DCHS.\n\nBottom line: do not misrepresent your animals. Do not lie to the consumer. This is illegal.", "type": "review", "business_id": "DdaBJ-NJrvXSjfNRhbA71Q"}

While they don't blow me away with the quality or value of their services, they are a step above other full service car washes in the area.  I also appreciate the fact I get a consistent wash from visit to visit.

Unlike visits to gas station car washes, I rarely find unwashed spots on my vehicle after a visit to gas station car wash. \n * To me, the interior cleaning is worth the extra $3 over what  you would pay at the local gas station car wash.  Even after an extended road trip with the kiddo, the interior of the vehicle looks pretty good.\n\nThings I don't:\n * Enough with the freakin' upsell sales pitch.  It never works and turns people off.  Don't waste our time.\n * The fragrance choices are just gawd awful.

Major props for that. 2 - They understood me... considering I don't remember ordering the pizza (I woke up to pizza and wings boxes all over my pad, and me saying \"who ordered pizza\" then I burped... wing sauce and vodka is a healthy combo. 3 - apparently, after checking my voice mail, the driver was pounding on our door for about 5 minutes (we were REALLY jamming out to Rock Band, in case you don't know, were pretty awesome. Wikipedia that Ish ladies and Gent's; Kansas City Bullriders). Well, the driver and my door man both called 3 times. I'm assuming the driver eventually came in and grabbed the bass guitar and strummed it out. Maybe he had a slice with us? Who really knows these things.

It is connected to Club Downtown which has two other floors that play latin pop/rock/hip hop and reggaeton. The cover is $10. They are open til at least 3 am (and the other floors stay open even later I think) so that is an advantage over the clubs that close at 2pm. To get to the Palazzo floor, you go in through Club Downtown's main entrance and then go out on the front patio and then back in to Palazzo's dance floor. Ask if you get lost and the security or bartenders will point you there. I like the size of the floor, which is tile. It is not as hot and crowded as other salsa places like Pepins on Saturday. Drinks vary from great to weak (mainly the mixed drinks) depending on the bartender, they do have specials sometimes. As a long time salsa dancer who goes with friends (male and female) but no set partner for the night, it can be hard to find a good salsa dancer here if  you don't already know one. So salseros/salsaholics if you will be going without a partner you might want to try to find at least one good dancer to go with you so you will have fun.  Or if you look on www.azsalsa.net or www.meetup.com (check for Scottsdale or Phoenix salsa groups) there are plenty of socials and lessons where you can meet others if you are new and want to meet other dancers or go out with a group. The music is good but since I go a lot,  I start to hear the same songs over and over. I think they should bring in different djs, rotate them or make sure the music gets mixed up to keep people coming back.  Also note there is a strict dress code - it is posted outside. I know several guys who had to go back home to change cause they couldn't get in. I don't remember all the specifics but I believe some things to note are no hats/sunglasses, tennis shoes, tee shirts, baggy pants, bandanas, etc. I'd say collared shirt (tucked in), nice slacks/pants and shoes and you'd be okay. They do have metal detectors going in. However, I have rarely seen any fights and I feel safe here. Lots of security and bouncers. www.clubdwntwn.com", "type": "review", "business_id": "SiwN7f0N4bs4ZtPc4yPgiA"}

Think \"The Matrix\" meets \"Blade.\"\n\nThe house DJ here is usually pretty amazing...spinning music like VNV, Wolsheim, and some harder stuff like KMFDM.  The sound system is hot, and the music selections combined with the pulsating, dancing crowd (in more black leather than you've probably seen for awhile in one place) make for a pretty hot environment.\n\nThe vibe isn't always on, as once or twice I've been here fairly disappointed with a predominently poser crowd.  If you happen to get here on an off night, just relax on the stunning back patio with a few drinks and create your own scene.\n\nBut that being said, the club itself is gorgeous, and you're in for a surprise at midnight.

Quite simply, there's a small bar to the left, a small VIP lounge to the right, and nothing but dance-able space in between.

[From reading other reviews, I'm not sure Hip-Hop/R&B is part of the regular format. We'd been there the first week of Oct'09.] And so, the girls (Esco, RB, Becca), all talented and passionate dancers, took to the floor, wowing and attracting a perimeter of onlookers.  I danced a bit, broken ankle be darned: it'd take more than crutches to keep me from having a good time with my peeps...\n\nAs I sat for a minute, resting the cast'd ankle, a group of people complimented the girls on their style and dancing; very friendly, flattering gesture.\n\nBy 3AM, it was almost exclusively the 6 of us still on the dance floor being silly, and though we could have danced more, we had liquor at the apartment where the club had made last call around 2am.\n\nFun night and a fun little spot, but I'd suggest going with a group; friendly as people were, I'm not sure how apt this scene is to mingling/meeting/dancing with others. We had smilingly and genuinely asked a group of people watching us (the crew that complimented the girls on their dancing) to join us on the floor, but they didn't.\n\nIf its not your speed, there are two other clubs literally next door.\nAs we left, we noticed Club Downtown next door was *still* poppin'.\n__________________________\nSmoothest \"I got hit on\" moment ever.\nCan't be simply re-told, only re-enacted.", "type": "review", "business_id": "SiwN7f0N4bs4ZtPc4yPgiA"}

For once, I was ready to go bright and early so that we could make the six-hour drive before the holiday weekend traffic got to be too terrible. My car, unfortunately, had other plans.  The battery, which I had purchased less than a month prior, decided it didn't want to work.  We suspected it was a bad connection to the terminal but couldn't be sure. Instead of driving to Checker Auto, I decided to take the car a couple blocks away to Virginia Auto.  I have a few friends who regularly take their vehicles here for service, so even though I had never utilized their serviced, I felt confident about taking my car in.\n\nAt 8am, their small lot was already packed, and I snagged the only available spot.  We walked in and were helped right away.  The very nice lady at the desk asked if I'd made an appointment ahead of time and I explained our situation.  She said they had quite a few other cars in with appointments but she would see what she could do.  We sat inside the small lobby and chatted for a while before she came back in.  My brand new battery was dead.  It had been completely drained!  She said they could put the battery back in and we could go back to Checker to have it replaced or they could install a new battery for me.  Not wanting to take a chance on another bad battery, I decided to have them take care of it for me.  Not more than 20 minutes later, they had finished!  I wasn't thrilled about having to pay more than I wanted to, but it was worth every penny.  After we got to Texas that afternoon, my very car-savvy Dad looked at the  car and said the battery had been installed very well - it was in securely and everything had been cleaned up really well.\n\nI need some serious maintenance done on the car, and I will absolutely be taking it in to Virginia Auto.  As soon as I do, I have no doubt I'll be coming back to this review to change it from a 4-star to a 5-star review.\n\nThank you, thank you, thank you, Virginia Auto, for taking such great care of me and my car and allowing us to head out of town for a few days without worrying about my car!", "type": "review", "business_id": "M-MFa0YErVBbFW2IJhGJmw"}

They made no attempt to up-sell me on anything, including brakes, which the dealership had coincidentally told me would \"definitely be due\" on the next service visit (my brake pads were on the good side of fine when VAS checked them). Everyone seems very honest, and friendly, and while I don't know about the prices for major repairs, it's good to know that they'll only be charging you when you really need work done (unlike the dealer).

They did a diagnostic and the problem was a misfire on cylinder 2.  They went out of their way to call my dealership to see if the problem was covered under warranty, which it was.

This mechanic could have chased the problem from sensor to sensor and fuel filter and ignition etc etc but they didn't, they found the correct path for me to save money and get my car running perfect again.  After that Matt who is the friendliest and most helpful person you will EVER meet at a mechanic offered to take my car to the dealership and pick it up for me, free of charge.  He even knocked off most of the inspection charge because they quickly realized they wouldn't be doing the work to repair it.  There are cheaper mechanics out there but the quality of service here not only made my experience much better but ended up saving me potentially thousands of dollars worth of repairs that were ultimately covered under my warranty.\n\nAlthough there is a small premium to get work done here (there are shady mechanics that will do jobs for less) the customer service by itself, let alone the quality of work, honesty and integrity of the staff are well worth the marginal pricing differences.  \n\nKeep up the good work!

Let's just say that the quality ingredients and enticing flavors made us feel a little less homesick. The prices were not rock-bottom, but I am always willing to pay a little more for good food and larger portions, both of which Wild Thaiger offers. The papaya salad was refreshing and really authentic, although the shrimp were a little fishy for our tastes. The soup we had was also very flavorful and best of all, the chicken in it was actual pieces of chicken breast (often, the chicken in soup is small pieces of dark meat). The Mussaman curry was also a lot better than most places we have had it - often, restaurants use pieces of flank or strip steak, but a more authentic version, like the one we had here, has more stew-like cuts of almost-braised beef. Also a real winner were the spicy clear/glass noodles with vegetables and chicken. And lest I forgot alcohol - the crowning glory of any meal - the specialty drinks offered seemed like they would be too sweet or weak, so my sister and I got Cosmos.

It was a 30 minute drive from Laveen, as all are the Thai places in the area.  I ordered two of my staples (Tom ka Gai soup and Green Curry) and tried a new dish (for me), Holy Basil.  I got everything takeout.\n\nI'll start with the Holy Basil.  It was very good.  A nice balance of Thai flavors, and I thought it was quite similar to an Ayam Basil dish I used to get at a Malaysian place in Mt. View, CA.  My only complaint was that the chicken was big, thick chunks, like a fajita-style.  I expect delicate, tender meats at a high end Thai place.\n\nI opened my green curry and said: \"WHERE'S THE SAUCE\"?  I am VERY upset at the lack of sauce.  There was so little I can't comment on the flavor of the curry.  And, they had 2 different types of green beans in there:  chinese long beans, and American green beans.  The larger Amercian green beans weren't cooked.  That sucked.  The beef was tender enough but the peices were too big.  The one redeeming part of this dish was the fact that they had eggplant in it.  There is something about eggplant in green curry....\n\nThe Tom Ka Gai soup was  fantastic.  My only complaint would be the chicken, which again, was large fajita-style slices.   Doesn't make sense to me.\n\nWhile I was waiting at the bar for my order, I remember looking into the kitchen and wondering how they could possibly prepare everything on the menu in that tiny space.  Now, I think I know:  I suspect they prep all of their meats ahead of time and use the same size/shape/cuts for each dish to save time.  This results in a fajita-style cut of chicken that leaves me less than thrilled.\n\nOverall, the menu is brief and the food is good, but I don't think it's worth a long drive.  I don't expect to return when I could make the same drive to get to Swadee, which was just fabulous.  I gave this place a 3/5 because the Tom Ka Gai soup and Holy Basil were VERY good.  I am however disappointed in the green curry, the  cuts of meat, and by the way they completely ignored my request for Thai spicy; everything was rather mild in my opinion.", "type": "review", "business_id": "KPoTixdjoJxSqRSEApSAGg"}

And sure enough, we arrive and wait in the tiny entry way for at least 10 min before being approached by anyone. In that time, a friend who had arrived early and staked out at the bar informed me that as soon as she sat down, she was told that she couldn't order food because the kitchen was temporarily shut down because they were too busy. At the time we arrived it was maybe 30 percent full, and she assured me that that had happened 30-40 minutes ago, so they should be back on track by now. \nThe host finally showed up and said she could seat us, but it would be a while before the server would take our order bc they were \"recovering.\" Well, that's better than 10 people blocking an entryway, so I'm not sure why she seemed hesitant to seat us, even if we had to wait for a server. She assured us that we could order drinks from our table until the kitchen was \"ready.\"\nIt was only downhill from there. Thankfully, we were a jovial bunch - under any other circumstances this experience would have been disastrous. 15 min to get drink orders, another 15 to get the drinks. Another 20 min later he took our food orders. 30 min later they started coming out, sort of. Seven entrees came out, staggered over a period of five minutes. But three entrees - all pad thai - didn't arrive until at least 10 min later, when everyone else was finished. I understand not everyone can get food at exactly the same time with a party of 10, but they didn't even come close, and at the time we made our food orders it was at least an hour if not more after their alleged huge rush that shut down the kitchen. \nI got the peanut chicken - grilled chicken with peanut sauce, rice and grilled veggies. The sauce was too citrus-y for a peanut sauce and too thick (funny that I complained in my first review that my curry was too thin). Chicken underneath was completely flavorless and was dry and veggies were scant. Good thing it was only $10. Didn't get details from anyone else except the BF, who got the Kao Pad Jay, and kept saying over \"I'm so glad I got this!\"\nAll these issues seemed to be circumstantial (except the chicken dish), but, then again, how long has WT been a restaurant? Come on, I'm sure they've dealt with many a Saturday night rush and someone (ahem, manager??) should have at least come out to explain/apologize for their issues.

Love it.\n\nIt's mussel soup. I don't care if you don't like seafood, you will love this. You might think it's just sauce that the mussels are served in. It's soup. You will drink it, and you will wipe up every last drop with your fingers. There is nothing else like it. I'm serious. This is the stuff late-night cravings are made of. \n\nThe pad thai is good, but you can experiment here, ask the waitress for ideas, and know that you'll end up with something different and exciting. There are a few dishes that are acquired tastes (I'm learning to love wild boar), but because I eat here, I get to say \"I eat wild boar!\" and it makes me sound like a better person. And I'm pretty sure eating wild boar does make me a better person, at least to Lost groupies.\n\nMy main criticism is that they can sometimes hold back on the heat. It's not enough to say you want it hot. They'll assume you mean \"American hot.\" Make sure to specify \"Thai hot.\" The burn is good.\n\nYou must save room for dessert. This is essential. It will show you another side of Thai you may not have experienced before. I wouldn't go here just for desert, but drinks + dessert = win.\n\nThe inside is white tablecloths and candles. This is where you take a date, where the hostess will make sure you're happy and the waitresses will keep your glass always full. And you can see the kitchen from every table, so it feels like you're taking your date to a favorite neighborhood family restaurant (you are, and it is).  The only problem is the bar, which usually has a few sad people at it. I like to think it just adds to the neighborhood feel.\n\nThe patio is fun, with great seating arrangements, misters, and a vibrant atmosphere during the evening (don't sit here for lunch). It can be a little difficult to get service on the patio unless it's already packed. If you're with friends who want to hang out, choose the patio. It's great for spending the evening, with good drink service and lively conversation going on all around you.\n\nFinally, this is on a light rail stop, so there is absolutely no excuse not to make it part of your night out.", "type": "review", "business_id": "KPoTixdjoJxSqRSEApSAGg"}

Had the Wild Wrap and Dragon Eggs for appetizers.  Both had a really good bite to them without losing all of the different flavors in the dish.  That is something that gets lost at many Thai places, everything is so hot you lose the flavor.  Two of us had the Beef Panang for dinner and our friend had the Salmon dish.  All were prepared very well.  The beef panang was a little different than I have had at many places here in town.  More curry & creamy coconut milk than the light broth based panang we have settled for at other places.  It was by far the best panang we have in Phoenix to date.  The beef was fork tender and the sauce flavor was over the top.  \n\nThe restaurant is very cozy and energetic.  It was 7:30 on a Thursday night and the inside was full, with only 1 table on the patio brave enough to weather the 100 degree heat.  Server was very friendly and attentive.  NA beverages were always kept full and she was all over refilling our glasses from the bottle of wine that had been ordered.  Big bonus points for the kitchen design.  It will not blow you away with tons of polished stainless steel and creative wall decor, but it is an open exhibition kitchen with about 10-12 seats at the bar that look in on the action.  Extremely rare to find in a Thai concept.  Love knowing who is cooking your food and that the kitchen is well kept.

I decided on the Jungle Love (insert 70s funk music here).  A dish of primarily \"exotic\" vegetables and thin sliced wild boar in a very spicy red broth.  It was superb.  The boar, which I'd never had before, was not the core of the dish but still quite flavorful.  It added a great contrast to the mass of vegetables in the pot.  I'll be honest, I'm not sure half of what I ate in there, but it was all good.  Good, and spicy.

I found the portion of the entree to be very skimpy for the price, and I've had much tastier, and creamier, curry sauce elsewhere (Tottie's, Thai Elephant, even Yupha's!).  Need I say more?  Seriously, WT's green curry tastes about the same as Thai Hut's, but at a portion that's about half (or less) of what I could get at TH, or any of the other places I've visited, but I suppose the \"atmosphere\" is what I'm paying for here?  That said, I must admit that the fried banana dessert was delicious!  Loved the toasted coconut on top (well, on top of the bananas, but under the syrup toppings, coconut ice cream, whipped topping, and maraschino cherry!).  On my next visit, when I'm craving for something sweet, I will ask to have the syrup toppings, whipped cream, and cherry omitted.  The dish is perfect w/out them.", "type": "review", "business_id": "KPoTixdjoJxSqRSEApSAGg"}

It's an adventure.\n\nWild Thaiger offers some of my favorites that are not to be found at Thai Basil (so mediocre) and Thai Elephant (good but standard) - Dragon's Eggs are a spin on Kanom Jeeb, thai pork and crab dumplings similar to shu mai, graced with a spicy slice of raw jalapeno on top.  Decha Boar celebrates the not often served wild boar in a peppery sauce of basil and telicherry peppercorns.  They understand that pepper can be flavorful in addition to hot, and there's a whole taste profile there just waiting for you to explore.  Best of all, the presentation on the dishes is a work of art - ribbons of carrots and beets as edible garnishes remind you of what a treat it should be to dine out.\n\nIf you are looking for standard Thai, without flair or panache, I could see how this might be seen as too expensive.

Every time I eat it, my scalp tingles and I slip into a blissful happy place. The steamed vegetables are so tender that they fall apart. The little relish on the side is shockingly delicious and refreshing. The duck sauce that comes with the fried rolls makes them worthwhile. I know there's something with peanut sauce (satay?) that makes me happy.\n\nAppetizers and desserts are up to you. If you like cellophane wrapped veggie rolls, they're great here. If you like coconut ice cream, do it. If not, you can probably skip these as they cost as much as the entrees. \n\nAnother note: don't come here thinking this is 100% authentic Thai cuisine.

Wifey told me that tonight was the Thai New Year and they were going to have live music and dancers, so I figured uck it why not. What an awesome meal.\n\nWe started with the veggie sampler ($12.95) as our appetizer and a big ole $5 Thai beer. The sampler had the corn fritters, veggie egg rolls and tofu in peanut sauce. The corn fritters were other worldly, totally killer, I really enjoyed the tofu and the veggie rolls. What a great way to open up the meal.\n\nFor our meals, we split the Seafood Panang which was shrimp, scallops, mussels, calamari and salmon in a spicy red coconut sauce. The ONLY part I didn't totally love was the calamari, it was waaaay chewy. Every other part was perfect. The shrimp were sweet and succulent, the scallops cooked to utter perfection, the mussels were done the was they're supposed to be not chewy, tender) and the salmon was something to slap my mama over. \n\nThe other dish we had to split was the Merry Mu (grilled pork served with coconut rice and carrot \"relish\"). The pork was perfectly seasoned sliced large pork pieces, the coconut rice was a sticky ball of semi sweet rice (not my bag, but I think some people would like it) and the carrot relish was more like a sweet carrot salad. It did come with this really peculiar (in a good way) green salty/bitter sauce that I kept going back to. I realized a piece of the pork, with some of the sweet carrot salad and the sauce had the total package. Wow. \n\nWe ended the meal with a stiff cocktail (I had this cosmo thing with sake, cranberry and lime juice that I had them serve me in a regular cup instead of the martini glass so I didn't look like a nancy) and wifey had a big ole slice of chocolate cake. Triple decker and all.\n\nWe ended up leaving around 720 or so, and the music was SUPPOSED to start at 7 but we didn't get to see it.

Nice, but not the best in town (Pure Sushi Bar has a to die for Lychee Lemon Drop).  \n\nThe entrees are huge and could easily be shared. We had the Kimow - hot and spicy clear noodles, chicken, broccoli, snow peas, sweet onion, Thai chili, garlic and sweet Thai Basil - Delicious!\n\nTo be fair, Thai is not one of my favorites, but we love to support local restaurants and this came highly recommended. Glad we tried it. \n\nAnd for those of you who like it HOT and SPICY - Wild Thaiger has you covered.", "type": "review", "business_id": "KPoTixdjoJxSqRSEApSAGg"}

We were seated right away, but waited 15 minutes for a waiter.  Appetizer arrived fairly promptly, but there was nearly a 30 minute wait after the appetizer was cleared for main courses to arrive.  \n\nWe had the Vegie Sampler as an appetizer and it was incredibly delicious - I'd go back just to order that dish!  Crispy/crunchy corn fritters, big chunks of seared tofu (which sounds sort of nasty to a meat-eater like me but was incredible!) with peanut sauce, and crispy fried vegie rolls.  This dish was the only real winner - and was way over the top with flavor!\n\nMy buddy had a tofu/vegie dish - I wish I knew what it was exactly - but on the menu it had a single pepper on it.  He ate half of it and was beading with sweat, so beware that even a \"medium heat\" dish can get pretty hot.  I asked for a vegie/chicken dish - something \"healthy\" and was told about a dish with a soy and garlic sauce.  The chicken and vegies were fairly good (a bit heavy on the cauliflower maybe) but the sauce just tasted \"off\" - not like soy/garlic at all and was odd enough that I didn't finish the dish either.  It wasn't flavorful - it didn't taste like I'd had it described - and it didn't compliment the rest of the dish.   Both of our issues with main courses are probably more personal preferences but there's also room for improvement maybe in how the dishes were described to us.\n\nI had a ginger martini and my buddy had a very tall mai tai ($6 - which was a good deal for the large glas!).\n\nSo...hit and miss...but I will try it again.", "type": "review", "business_id": "KPoTixdjoJxSqRSEApSAGg"}

Wild Thaiger, on the other hand, has a filling Peanut Chicken lunch, as well as a Peanut Passion dinner, both drenched in their delicious peanut sauce.  Their curries are very flavorful and make for a superb and hearty dinner, but if you're going for lunch, you may want to consider Thai Basil up the road as their curry lunch combo includes a salad and other extras.\n\nTheir Thai Tea is strong yet creamy, just like it should be, and you can even add boba to it.  A must if you're eating anything spicy.\n\nThe service is very professional and timely.  The atmosphere is pretty classy, in fact, it's probably the nicest-looking Thai restaurant I've been to.

We ordered an appetizer at the same time as our drinks, the appetizer took 45 minutes to arrive, the waiter forgot that we had ordered anything at all, came back to the table to confirm the appetizer TWICE and still brought us the wrong item and then had the nerve to charge us for it! I asked for menu suggestions, the waiter just stared at me blankly. I asked if I could have steamed rice rather than fried, he said that was impossible to change. Impossible. Eventually our entrees came, I ordered soup, it wasn't good. He brought out a teacup for me to use as my soup bowl. It was almost impossible to manage. Then our check came, he overcharged us. I didn't dispute anything because I just wanted to leave. I paid in cash, he shorted me five dollars. I called that his tip, and left. \nThe restaurant was not busy, it was typical for a Wednesday night. There is no excuse for their wait times or rudeness.

About 5 minutes later, the hostess comes back to seat the group of 3 and disappears again. Two couples come into the the restaurant and after waiting 5 minutes at the hostess station, one of the couples walks to the back, hoping to get someone's attention so they  can put their name down for a table. We watched them stand there for 5 minutes and then walk out of the restaurant. 6:15. No sign of the hostess. Other people have arrived and walked out as well. We see the hostess clear a table and then bring to go boxes to a table and walk right by us. She doesn't make eye contact, she doesn't apologize, she doesn't tell us it will be just a few minutes. In fact, she scurries away so quickly, she doesn't hear us when we say \"Excuse me, miss?\" to get her attention to find out how much longer it will be. Most of the people who were in the restaurant when we arrived are now finishing their meals. It's 6:25 and the hostess has been away from her station for 25 minutes. Our 10 minute wait was 40 standing up without so much as an apology or offer of water or a drink while we waited. We decided to leave and as we walked out, wished the 6 groups of people behind us \"good luck\". Maybe they'd get one of the still empty tables. \n\nThe front of the house is EVERYTHING in the restaurant world. That girl probably just cost the restaurant thousands in future business. I've heard great things about the food but I'll never go back.", "type": "review", "business_id": "KPoTixdjoJxSqRSEApSAGg"}

From rude staff to unpleasant odors or creepy guys giving you longing looks while you're just trying to figure out which one of your friends with an advanced degree in engineering you can text to help you figure out how to get on a machine without having it rip your arm out of its socket because the staff is not going help you without paying for a personal trainer or because you don't look like you were already born on a nautilus machine. \n\nThis gym is everything but. I went in because of the great introductory special and a recommendation of a friend. We're both training to swim the SF Bay for the 2011 Sharkfest Alcatraz Swim, so we needed a pool. \n\nAs soon you walk in, the guy at the front desk treats you like you're an old buddy and cracks jokes like he is your best bar buddy. Awesome attitude. The place has never been overly crowded (even at peak hours right after work. I've never gone during the early morning or lunch hours).\n\nNo waits on the machines and they have plenty of them. No waiting in the pool and even when there is a water aerobics class, one lane is left open to due laps. Hot tub, sauna, and some inexplicable walk in dunking tub (see, I'm not a gym aficionado or else I would know what that thing is for).\n\nTowel service, locks, and even gym shorts available. (no more using that excuse that you can't work out today because you left your work out clothes at home...they have some to check out there.)\n\nEven the seemingly cranky old lady doing her water workout was nice and called me sweetie and asked if I was ok when I inadvertently let out a puppy like whimper as my shoulder blades decided they wanted to cede from the union of my body. Note to self....don't do a month of the P90X with a friend, think you're hot stuff and on your way to a gym bod and then jump in a pool to do a mile swim without stretching because you think you're all that now. Had it not been for Grandma Water Aerobics, I might still be at the far end of the pool trying to inch my way back to the stairs hoping that the water on my face hid the tears that were going start gushing any minute if I couldn't make it to the hot tub to get my back to stop seizing up.  (Thank you, unknown Water Aerobics lady. You turned a moment of shame into motivation. Oh yeah, I will out swim grandma next time!)\n\nThe place is in the basement of an office building next to the seemingly abandoned Chateaux on Central development. Central and....Encanto (?) \nYou can park on the street (careful of the meters) or use the garage. The gym validates. \n\nThere is a downstairs weight room (I haven't check it out yet as I because there is a free gym at my job.) Yes, I like this place so much, I am paying for a gym membership even though I have access to work out facilities for free in my own building....including free personal trainer....but instead I get in my car come 5pm and drive to a gym I pay for because this athletic club is worth it. \n\nI saw no young kids running around. The clientele seems to be early  30s and up, young urban professionals and some retirees who are just trying to stay healthy. No creepy people ogling you (which you may be looking for) and no rude gym bunnies laughing at you in your leotard on the treadmill....but really....you shouldn't have the leotard and hot pink leg warmers on anyway...it is 2010.

I may only be 22 years old, and it may be rare for a 22 year old to have a malignant lump, but I do have a family history of breast cancer that was conceived early in their 20's. \n\nAs for my appointment, I had it scheduled at 7pm and I wasn't seen by the NP until 7:45. When the NP (nurse practitioner) came in, she checked out my lump and told me we need to get an ultrasound right away to make sure it isn't anything we need to worry about. When I had my pap smear she told me it looks like I have a yeast infection too. \n\nShe also gave me \"tips\" about keeping your vagina healthy such as Douching. First of all, this is HORRIBLE advice. Douching is the worst thing you can do for vaginal flora. This is the main reason why women get vaginal infections and bacterial vaginosis. I had to laugh at her but she is a NP, she knows what she is talking about...\n\nThere were two things that really bothered me about my appointment. The scheduler after my appointment told me she would call me the very next day to let me know the time of my ultrasound at Good Sam. I never heard from her the next day. This is very frustrating for me because I had to wait a while to even get in to see someone and now that I have a suspicious lump, I feel like we are just taking our time for something that needs to be a priority! Second thing is that I was clearly told I have a yeast infection and was not given any prescriptions to take care of it. \n\nI really feel like the office just does not care about my health or concerns and didn't do anything to make me feel comfortable. It was just a waiting game; wait for your appointment, when your appointment finally comes wait an hour for the doctor and wait some more to have an ultrasound scheduled. \n\nI will NOT go back here again.\n\n*update--I called to see why they hadn't called me back to schedule my ultrasound and they acted like I was dumb--saying that they gave me the order to schedule it somewhere else.

From the moment I got to the office I was already turned off and regretted coming here, I arrived 15 mins early and filled out all my paperwork and STILL waited for an hour just to be seen! Everyone in the waiting room was called before I was and I wasn't even seeing my actual Dr, I was assigned a PA instead.  I did the usual Urine sample, and they took my blood and vitals but the PA kept asking me questions I already answered to the nurse which made me notice she wasn't even looking at my file nor had it with her, she was just taking notes on the Patient info sheet I filled out.  She breezed through a low quality ultrasound and I had to ask her for pics which were blurry and barely even worth printing when I saw them.  She explained that I would be going to a different facility in 2 weeks for the ultrasound and then go back to their office for the check up which I wasn't happy about having to go to multiple places but understood.  When she finished I had to ask her about the results of the UA since I told her I felt like I may have a UTI, she told me everything looked fine but they would have to send it out to get those results (I've never heard of not getting UTI results the same day) and that she would just send a script for an antibiotic to my pharmacy which would be ready when I left there and that they would call in a couple days and tell me the results and I could stop taking them if they were negative.  I waited until the next day to go to the Pharm and no script was sent, I called the OBGYN and explained there was supposed to be a script for an antibiotic and they said they would send it over. the next day the pharm called to tell me my script for prenatal was ready but that was all that was sent. I didn't even ask for prenatals since they're over the counter!!!! called the DR AGAIN and had it sent over, still no call from the Dr regarding my results but I thought I would wait another day.  still a week later and 3 calls asking for my results and I had to call THEM to find out that the results had been in and are negative but the PA must have overlooked needing to call and let me know.  I have requested my file and am switching to Maricopa OBGYN, I'm very disappointed in my first prenatal Dr visit as this should be a happy time and your doctor should make you feel comfortable, I hope Maricopa can turn this around and make it a positive experience for me as it should be.", "type": "review", "business_id": "1acmBPmmFDovVSHHzMrJ9A"}

I didn't look at the menu carefully so I just picked something out of the Specialty section. \n\nAnyway, the chips and salsa were awesome!!!

I also loved the extra touch of the tortilla chips on top of the dish. Lovely presentation!\n\nMy mom had the Chicken Penne Pasta with the cilantro pesto.

I don't need your incessant chatter, and I also don't need you perching on nearby chairs giving me those \"look how cute I am, don't you want to give me a chip?\" moony eyes.  And since you're shouting so loud to hear each other over the water feature, it just means the paying human diners have to yell to each other even louder to be heard above everything else.  Soothing, it is not. \nBut if you're a mellow sort and you can let the cacophany fade into the background, you'll be stoked you found anywhere downtown that is serving food on a Sunday evening, and hey, it's early March and you're sitting outside for dinner because the temperature is in the mid 70s!

If we ever return for dinner, I will update, but for now, I'll just say this place is really unremarkable and disappointing and that there are *way* better places to go for happy hour. \n\nWe went for happy hour on Friday around 5:45 pm and sat in the bar at one of the high tables. There were only 3-4 other people in the bar area, (and maybe 6-8 in the rest of the restaurant) but it still took the bartender about 5 minutes to come over and take our drink order. I got the Grand Canyon Margarita (featuring cranberry and citrus juices), and my husband got the Cactus Margarita (basically the house margarita). Both were $3. We wanted to order some bar food as well, but again, it took him about 10 minutes to return with our drinks and take our food order, even though the bar was still quite empty. After already being irritable with the slow service (having both worked in restaurants, we are very understanding of how stressful it is to handle a lot of tables or drink orders, but the restaurant was so empty that there was just no excuse), the slow service was not the only bad part of our first experience at Sam's Cafe. \n\nThe next negative was that the margaritas were so sweet and weak, they might as well just have charged us $3 each for juice. Then, it took another 15-20 minutes for us to get our bar food (carnitas cheese crisp, jalapeno poppers, and southwestern bruschetta) and when it finally came, it was all cold! We noticed that no one else in the bar area had gotten food, but all of a sudden, the bartender emerged from the back with an enormous tray of food and served everyone who had been waiting for food at once. Having worked in many restaurants, I know that one of the main rules of good service is that someone should take food out as soon as it's ready so that it doesn't get cold, and that as a server, I was responsible for doing so even if the food wasn't for my table. Either the bartender should have been checking in the back more frequently for food that was ready or someone else (like the manager, who kept wandering around in a daze but never appeared to be doing much) should have done him a favor (if he was really that busy) and brought it out. \n\nThe third negative was that most of the food was not good at all. I know not to expect too much from bar food, especially when it was seriously discounted for happy hour, but two of the things we ordered were just bad. The carnitas cheese crisp was not light and crispy with gooey cheese; instead, it was a heavy and greasy flour tortillas covered in congealed cheese and dry shredded pork. Not good. The jalapeno poppers and boneless chicken wings were also terrible - Jack in the Box has better poppers and the chicken wings were straight out of a Tyson resealable bag. The Southwestern Bruschetta was fine, although it was very oily, and I have a hard time understanding how merely adding a ton of cilantro to a tomato mix makes something \"southwestern.\" None of the food items was more than $5, but I have been to *many* other happy hours where you can get solid, flavorful appetizers for between $2 - $5. Kincaid's and McCormick & Schmick's are two great examples. \n\nThe final kicker of our bad happy hour experience was when we asked the bartender for a check and he tried to pressure us to order more even though we said several times that we were finished. I believe the exact line was, \"Are you sure you don't want anything else? More drinks? More food? Some shots?\" Maybe I'm crazy, but I don't think you should order more to *make* your experience somewhere better; rather, you should order more *because* you're having such a good time. As persuasive as his \"selling techniques\" were, we weren't (having a good time), so we didn't (order more).", "type": "review", "business_id": "e5kc0CQ4R-PCCDgb274gSg"}

The carnitas had good flavor (but there was only one tortilla) and the enchiladas had a good creamy sauce on top. I also liked the fact that they offered us a carafe of water so they didn't have to keep coming around to refill it for us. I know for some that seems a little lazy and cheesy, but I think it's AWESOME!\n\nThe best part was the little mini White-Chocolate/Pecan tamale at the end. It was REALLLLLLY good and wanted about 10 more. Bill was pretty cheap and I really liked the atmosphere of the restaurant.

I ordered my dinner from the happy hour menu too, the carnitas cheese crisp. This was a huge flour tortilla covered with cheese, shredded roasted pork and pico de gallo, served with a bbq sauce on the side. I passed on using the bbq sauce, I felt there was plenty of flavor without it and only occasionally found myself using the salsa provided with the chips to add another layer of pep.

We found it due to the friendly local police and Downtown Phoenix greeters (?).  \n\nThe restaurant did not have a private room (we had a group of 15) but we were there really early.  The chip basket is AMAZING!  It has a bunch of different chips from tortilla, to different types of potates and even these fried pieces of goodness (that reminded me of wontons).  The salsa was really good too.  The waitstaff was great....they provided lots of these chip baskets during our 3 hour meeting.  When the meeting concluded...it was straight to the top shelf margaritas which we've been dying for since we sat down.  It's a great deal for top shelf tequila and the quantity.  You get about 2-4 drinks as they even give you some reserve in the cocktail shaker.  \n\nFood was good.  I had the sirloin which was cooked perfect at medium.  My friend sitting next to me ordered the same thing at medium rare but got it well done.

I think everyone at our table had salads, all were A~OK.  Their Cobb salad was rated the best at our table.  The Blacken steak taco salads were lacking steak and and other veggies would have been nice too in addition to just lettuce, cheese and diced pieces of steak.  The Cobb was full of everything your would expect with a good Cobb salad and was very tasty.  The Chicken taco salad was better than the steak.\n\nThe chips and salsa at first appeared to be very impressive as many other Yelpers have mentioned however your either a fan or not a fan.  I'm not a fan unfortunately...  The chips were too greasy with way too much of their seasoning!  I especially did not like their salsa.  It had no heat and HUGE chunks of tomato's! YYYEEAA~UCK.  Way too much work to get to the little bits of salsa that were actually kind of good.  I asked for a different salsa, my server just brought us some hot sauce to add to the salsa. Some of folks at our table did like their chips and salsa though. The Grand Canyon Margaritas were very good and a recommend from me to you.  \n\nSuggestion: seek out the \"Info-dude\" that walks around the Mall area to show people where to go and ask him for some coupons.

I don't know if they've changed management or service since they changed their name to Canyon Cafe but the service here frustrated me so badly I had to give it 2 stars for \"I've experienced better.\"  The wait for food is rather long most times of the day, which, at lunch time especially, can suffice as a reason NOT to go here. You definitely won't make it back to work within an hour.  \n\nBut here's the main reason I started boycotting Sam's. I went here with a friend who is allergic to cilantro once. She tried ordering 4 different things that presumably wouldn't have cilantro on them and each time she selected something the waiter just said \"That has cilantro too.\" How about helping to identify some items WITHOUT cilantro, Mr. Waiter?! When she had finally just decided NOT to eat at all, I asked the waiter if he could go ask the cook if he could make anything without cilantro so my friend could eat.  Rather than doing that, he said, \"well, I know all the ingredients in everything so that won't help.\" Nice. Finally I asked the waiter if the chef could make a quesadilla (tortillas & cheese!!!!!!) without cilantro and he STILL said no.  Do you know why? Because it's served with pico de gallo on top. HELLO?!?! just leave it off....idiot. It was really a terrible experience. Usually restaurants at least ATTEMPT to accommodate food allergies. NOT this one. \n\nTHEN, to cap it all off, I asked for parking validation for the garage when we were ready to go. All restaurants at the Arizona Center give validation for parking because why would you pay an additional $5-$10 just to eat at so-so restaurants?  The hostess responded with a simple, \"Sorry - we're out\". I had no patience left after the no-cilantro fiasco so I inquired further and finally a manager came out and said, \"Oh - no parking? - I'll go get more validations from our sister restaurant around the corner.\" He was back in 1 minute. How difficult was that? The lack of problem-solving skills among the staff here really astounded me, and for this reason, despite the fact that this place is super convenient to my job and home, I haven't been back since.", "type": "review", "business_id": "e5kc0CQ4R-PCCDgb274gSg"}

The service was quick and the staff very knowledgeable.  We even got a personal visit from the manager to ensure we were enjoying our dining.  \n\nWe started the dinner off with the best chips and salsa I have ever tasted. The salsa tasted like heaven and I am very picky about my salsa. I believe it was made with some adobo sauce. To wash it down we tried the pitcher of canyon margaritas.   The prickly pear and cranberry provided a nice flavor twist although it was a bit too sweet for Dave's liking. \nFor dinner, Dave tried the Southwestern tortellini  and I had the mini chimichangas.  The tortellini were covered in a chorizo cream sauce and was delicious.  The mini chimichangas did not disappoint mouth watering flavor in every bite.  Both meals were superb.  We decided to splurge for dessert and tried the tres leches cake with a strawberry sauce.  It was the most moist tres leches I have ever tried (even ones I have tried to make).  It was the perfect ending to a great meal.  If that wasn't enough they provided a commentary dessert, a divine white chocolate almond tamale.  A fun twist on the traditional tamale.  Even the left overs the next day were amazing. \n\nOver all this was a fabulous place to visit.  The only downside is that our meal was a bit pricy but I am sure that the $25 margarita pitcher didn't help.

Waters all around and then drinks were ordered. A had a beer so there's not much to report there. M choice a Mai-Tai and it was VERY strong.

The carnitas were a little dry but the plate arranged beautifully. Canyon serves an odd chips & salsa combo too - puffy fried flour tortillas (my guess on the flour) and then sprinkled with a sweet, BBQ flavoring. Interesting.

I want this place to succeed, I really do, but based upon a couple of my experiences here it seems they themselves do not want to succeed.\n\nCanyon Cafe has a really nice location in downtown Phoenix at the Arizona Center. One of its main selling points is the huge shaded patio overlooking the Arizona Center courtyard with tall palm trees and soothing waterfalls. They have some of the best margaritas I've ever tasted. The food is mediocre.\n\nMy first three times here last winter were great. Canyon Cafe was one of my first restaurant experiences in Phoenix, as I had just accepted my first big boy job and had relocated from Pennsylvania. I was in love with the new climate and the countless varieties of margaritas. The food was so-so, but the atmosphere and service received were wonderful. My server was the older lady with shorter gray hair--perfect! \n\nMy fourth time was on a Friday night, and we arrived to a surprisingly empty restaurant around 8:30 for dinner. The chile-rubbed sirloin left a lot to be desired, but the Orange Beso margaritas were its saving grace. I really love these margaritas, and I highly recommend this place for margaritas, and margaritas only, but only if you want to stop drinking them by 10pm on a Friday night. I didn't know they closed at 10pm on a Friday night until the server presented me the check at 10pm saying that they close at 10pm on Friday nights. Seriously? I'm not one to consciously stay past closing time, but giving one of your few remaining repeat customers the proverbial 'foot in the ass' is probably a big reason as to why you have no one in your restaurant on a Friday night. That, and you don't have a HH to lure customers in earlier in the evening. Get with the program.\n\nIn the spirit of redemption, I came here solo for a late lunch yesterday. The place was nearly empty, but that's to be expected at 4pm on a weekday. I picked a nice patio table overlooking the courtyard on an absolutely beautiful 80 degree day. I sipped on my Blue Moon margarita, wayfarers on, giving thanks I wasn't in the torrent of shit that was unloading on the east coast. I ordered the Salmon Caesar Salad and went back to sipping and basking. Five minutes later my waitress returns asking me what I ordered. Sip.\n\nThis particular Caesar salad has apple and pear slices in it, which sounded deliciously refreshing. I was let down when the bowl arrived and the pieces were about the width of a toothpick. The salad and dressing were great, but the salmon tasted too fishy, leading me to believe it was old. \n\nI'm about halfway finished with my margarita when my server drops the check, not even asking me if i'd like another margarita. There are literally three tables in the entire restaurant and I feel like I'm being rushed out again. I don't touch the check, but proceed to sip, people watch, and check my phone to see how the market did. Ten minutes later she opens the check presenter that's on my table,\n\n\"Oh, you're not finished?\"\n    No.\n\"Just enjoying the weather?\"\n    ..........\n\nI think I'm finished now. I'm finished with this restaurant. This place is a headache. Also check out their website. It looks like something I could have created using Visual Basic in high school. This place reeks of complacency. 2 stars only because of the margaritas.", "type": "review", "business_id": "e5kc0CQ4R-PCCDgb274gSg"}

Buying a gimmicky electric bike could be a bad decision.  Buying electronics from a produce market could be questionable decision.

But some how myself and dozens of other logical people have had a excellent to OK experience when doing all of the above.\n\nPhoenix Produce is selling Fujiton E-Bikes straight off the boat from China.  And we're not talking \"Made in China\" hidden in some innocuous spot; this is legitimately Chinese...from the oddly sized tires (which makes it a little difficult to find tubes for) to the Mandarin/Cantonese (not actually sure which) that fills the instrument panel and indicator lights.\n\nPhoenix Produce carries two models 36v and 48v both have max speed of 20 MPH.  While they differ in range 22 miles and 30 miles, respectively, on a single charge.  The motor definitely has good torque for a little electric motor...I've heard the 48v is even better than my 36v.  Both plug directly into a 110V (normal) outlet.  The 36v costs a little more than 3 CENTS per charge. These are bikes, so you can ride them on sidewalks or other bike designated paths.  No license/registration/insurance/helmet required (legally per ARS 28-2516)...though the helmet is recommended.\n\nAs for the no warranties and returns part...I can only say what I've experienced.  Sam, the owner of Phoenix Produce, has been very good to me in all my dealings.  I had some initial problems with the battery and charger of the bike, making the first week of ownership less than stellar.  Fortunately, I talked to Sam about those issues and he corrected the problems no charge...sure seemed like a warranty; but Jenny, one of his employees, said \"He is just really fair.\"  And I have to agree.

In fact, I had no clue how many different tribes call Arizona and New Mexico home and reading the history and how they are now was quite fascinating, but I am a history nerd. The Remix contemporary exhibt was well-done and was my favorite portion of the whole museum, but I'm a sucker for contemporary art and installations.  We even wondered about the \"children's area\" and that was also well done with a variety of hands on crafts and activities for little peanuts (heck, my husband and I even did some of them! hehe).   The boarding school exhibit on the second floor was very nicely done and well laid out...the testimonials that played while you walked around were quite touching and at times I felt myself tearing up.\n\nAdult admission is $10 and students are only $5. My husband forgot his ASU student ID and when he mentioned it to the cashier, the guy was like, \"oh that's OK\" and gave us the student admission anyway. Very nice.  There were quite a few people at Heard while we were there, but I never felt rushed or that I was in someone's way, which I think speaks highly of the layout.  I definitely recommend the museum if you have an afternoon you are looking to fill and/or just want to learn more about Native Americans.", "type": "review", "business_id": "SG_gEmEXL4ID6RAEinC5Bg"}

It's much better and more informative. After you finish his, then read mine. Ok? It's because I'm going by memory from 4 years ago and David B. lives in Phoenix and has just been there.\n\nI was born in Scottsdale, went to school in Phoenix and go to Giant's/A's/Angel's/Padre's/Brewer's/Mariner's and now the Dodger's for Spring Training. The desert is in my blood with all of the red sandstone rocks, cactus, roadrunners, and bluebelly lizards. As a child, I would go out and collect boys things... like snakes, crawdads, eggs, aquamarines, agates, spiders, then bring them home to an unhappy Mother. But I also went to school with actual Native-American kids who would wear their cool native clothes and so I got hooked on everything-Indian. Plus, we would go on amazing school field-trips to the local museums. Yea, for getting out of school...\n\nThe Heard is known as the other major Phoenix destination besides the Phoenix Arts Museum but I personally feel it is much better. It is world-class in its exhibits of Native American artifacts, such as pottery, katsina dolls, sand paintings, rugs, baskets, textiles, jewelry, blankets, it's all here. If you love American history, especially Indian, you have to come here and soak it all in. \n\nThe founders, Dwight and Maie Bartlett, loved their Southwest and therefore collected as much as they could afford, then fulfilled their ultimate dream to share it all with the public in 1929.\n\nMost people don't realize it because not much is taught about them, but our native Indians were so creative and amazing people who had such an artist's heart and desire to express themselves and the Heard really shows their work off to the highest degree. There are 39,000 items of cultural and fine art, including drawings, painting and sculpture. Of all of the possibilities to see when you visit, the core of the collection includes 500 simply incredible Hopi katsini dolls that were on loan from the exclusive Goldwater and Harvey Companies. Ritualistic, religious, complex and often hidden meanings are withheld in each individual katsini and I love them for their mystery. Another exhibit that I love because I am just a big kid is the full-sized Navajo Hogan, the Hopi piki room, the Yaqui ramada and the Pueblo oven. Maybe someday I can sneak in and stay over night.\n\nSo, in summary, if you ever visit Phoenix, you have to go to both the Heard and the PAM plus the Taliesin West (I always spell that wrong) building by Frank Lloyd Wright. It isn't all pools, spas, baseball and golf after all.", "type": "review", "business_id": "SG_gEmEXL4ID6RAEinC5Bg"}

The first docent who, I discovered later, is new and still in training, had a problem with her speed.

The best exhibit was of the Indian Boarding School Project.\nIn the crush and lack of signage, we completely missed the new native American War Memorial.\nLater, when we got a chance to read the Fair booklet given museum visitors, in that we found more information on the exhibits and artists, but it was too late. The regular museum booklet wasn't helpful.", "type": "review", "business_id": "SG_gEmEXL4ID6RAEinC5Bg"}

Thanks Danny! \n\nI am so glad that I went. I love museums, and admittedly have always been interested in Native American history and art.\n\nI think that my favorite part was that 30 foot glass and clay art fence right near the entrance. It was stunning and I think I stared at it like I was in a stoned out trance for a while lol.\n\nI think the story behind it is very cool as well. It starts out brown, to symbolize the fact that we are dead and below the earth. Later on it moves into more earthy orangey colors to symbolize that we are on the earth. Then it moves into mostly blue glass which symbolizes the spirit world.\n\nI also thought the ginormous collection of Katsina dolls were pretty amazing.\n\nMy buddies and I also spent a lot of time in the room with the giant mural. There is a description of each section of the mural that you can read.\n\nThe tour was really informative and I enjoyed that as well. I came away from it with a new respect for the culture that white people systematically tried to wipe out. \n\nWhat I took away from all this was uhhh white people suck? I kid I kid, I think the most interesting thing that I learned was the ceremonial things the Apaches did when a girl starts menstruating.\n\nI was blown away by the idea of men having so much respect for women, even seeing them as sacred! I was standing there thinking huh just about every other man could learn a thing or two from this. \n\nThe tour guide told us to support the museum, we should buy something from the gift shop. He didn't have to twist my arm. \n\nWe don't have anything quite like this where I am from but Detroit has a museum or two of it's own that hold a bit of clout if I say so myself. :)", "type": "review", "business_id": "SG_gEmEXL4ID6RAEinC5Bg"}

I have gone twice and have left extremely impressed both times.  The atmosphere is so amazing.  Right away, just walking through the courtyard to the main entrance, there's so much beauty to take in.  You'll walk past the courtyard cafe, cantina, bookstore, and gift shop on the way to the main entrance.  Both times I've gone, I did the museum first and then the shops and cafe afterwards.  \n\nThe entire museum is somewhat of a maze and, if you're not on a guided tour, can be pretty confusing to navigate.  We didn't have a tour guide either time -- they're free and on a regular schedule, but we preferred to wander at our own pace.  The first floor is very large and divided up into sections.  There's a lot of baskets, pottery, and katsina dolls to check out, and some really interesting native american history to take in.  I learned a lot about the local and native history.  The first floor (to me) gets boring kind of quickly.  A lot of the collections are not as old or historic as I had expected.  It seems like the younger visitors enjoyed the first level more than I did.\n\nThe most impressive part of the museum for me was the 2nd level.  I was in complete awe of the Indian Boarding School exhibit.  I learned SO much about the Indian Schools that I had never even heard of before.  I really wish they would have taught us about this experience when I was in school.  It was AMAZING.  \n\nOverall, the museum experience was very good.  We learned a lot and really enjoyed the history, art, and culture.  The only thing I don't like about the museum is navigating through it.  They do give you maps and offer guided tours, but it's fairly difficult to navigate if you don't know where you're going.  I don't like to look at maps, I prefer to wander.  Different areas are not very clearly marked.  You'll see a door in a hallway and wonder what it leads to, then walk through and realize you're entering a completely different part of the museum.  It's kind of hard to explain, but I wish the areas were more clearly marked.  It's not really big enough to get lost in, but we definitely had several occurrences where we weren't really sure where we were or where we were headed.\n\nThe 2nd time I visited, we decided to have lunch at the cafe and we were really impressed.  The service was great and the prices were MUCH more reasonable than we had expected.  We figured it would be pricey, but it was not.  I had the smoked salmon quesadilla and it was outstanding.  \n\nThe museum shop is pretty typical from what I've experienced at other museums -- a few knick-knacks that are in my price range, surrounded by ridiculously high priced pieces of art/pottery/dolls/rugs.  It's REALLY neat to look at but I couldn't imagine buying anything other than a magnet or a coffee mug.  Some of the pieces are thousands of dollars, but it's awesome to just look and admire.\n\nOverall, always a great experience, easy to find (there's a light rail stop right out front), and it's also very close to other touristy places if you're visiting and want to experience Phoenix.  I highly recommend this place.", "type": "review", "business_id": "SG_gEmEXL4ID6RAEinC5Bg"}

The lighting was fantastic-- the subtleties were not lost on me as the scenes progressed from comedic to utter sadness, and I could almost FEEL the sunshine coming through the large windows whenever scenes from Lock Willow played out, and the cold winter air surrounding Jerusha's dorm that winter as she wrote to her \"Daddy.\"  The ushers were very friendly and eager to help those who needed it, the cookies looked wonderful by the bar, and the women's restroom was tidy.\n\nNow, if we could only get HT to emphasize in many places that it offers $3 parking validation...  \n---\nI thank Yelp and ATC for giving me the great opportunity to experience a terrific performance of \"Daddy Long Legs,\" ATC's first musical production at The Herberger Theater tonight!  The two-actor (Megan McGinnis and Robert Adelman Hancock) musical, plus the invisible, but great assets, the orchestra and sound crew, entertained and amazed me w/ their execution of a well-written body of work.  It had comedy, romance, deception, and sorrow, to name a few... what's not to like?  Truly enjoyed McGinnis' impeccable timing, as well.  It is sad that many people pass up the opportunity to watch live theater due to the higher ticket fees, and I cannot fault them-- what's easier to bear: $37 per person plus $3 parking fee, which you may buy at the box office prior to attending the show, or $10 and free parking at the movies (well, at least when you're NOT catching one in downtown PHX)?  However, when you do decide to place the financial investment, you will almost always be rewarded w/ a highly-memorable night, believe you me!  \n\nI had a wonderful time, and I would definitely recommend \"Daddy Long Legs\" to anyone who enjoys great acting and music!

I work in Education and I talk to Teachers, Curriculum Directors, and Principals from all over the West Coast.  And,I am married to a former teacher at ASA.  I am passionate about this school.\n\nI will admit, I was suspect. I thought the parents who were so ecstic over the education offered at ASA might be a little off.  It couldn't be that good.  Really?  \n\nMy son started school with all the aprehensions of a 5th Grade student who knew very little about music, was active in sports and was very sad about leaving his friends behind.  We (even he) chose this school because they had a strong emphasis on education and we expected the school to offer my son the opportunity to learn in an environment that was strict, supportive and creative.  \n\nWe were not disappointed. ASA was all that - and MORE! The academic teachers are inventive, collaborative, and very supportive.  The arts teachers are music professionals and perform with and for the students and move them along in the curriculum with such finesse it's like they have private music lessons every day.\n\nAnd, the year was a success.  My son was delighted with all his classes, especially his music classes with Monica Sauer Anthony.  What a surprise to find him begging us to play his clarinet every evening before we had dinner or before we participted in a famly event.  \n\nHe loved the Science Curriculum, the hands-on activity and his teacher's passion  for education.  He worked hard in Language Arts and Social Studies and really showed off his new found maturity and knowledge during Presentation Week.  And the lessons he learned in Life Skills class were really applicable and life changing.\n\nThen the performances at the end of the year were very remarkable and telling. I saw kids excelling in their musical expertise and showing off this success with such poise and confidence that I couldn't believe these were the same kids I met just 10 months prior at our summer welcome parties.\n\nThe school does have a rigorous application process that leaves you on edge just wondering if your son or daughter will be permitted entry into this prestigious, blue ribbon school.  The school doesn't tolerate any bullying and supports all types of students. And, the school is near Downtown Phoenix, so there are issues with the campus being spread across some streets, but those are being addressed quickly as they are building and expanding into new facilities that will offer a number of benefits for the ever-growing school.\n\nThis school is really a dream.  It's an educational opportunity I would recommend to any parent.  I think my son would write a similiar recommendation!", "type": "review", "business_id": "Z9GH9bo8SHKx3oOokhHLyw"}

I had a cheeseburger and Cesar Salad. While I realize it's hard to mess up a Cesar Salad, my salad was seriously the best Cesar I've ever had. And my burger was packed with flavor.

First I totally agree with previous reviews that complain about the location of the TVs. They are in such awkward spots and are only tuned to like two different things, which is semi-annoying. However I can't complain too much when one of them is tuned to Sportscenter which is all I really need as I eat my lunch. My major complaint about Majerle's is that it is a very awkward space. There is a hostess stand out front on the sidewalk but no one is ever there, so you have to walk in and then BAM you are like on top of the bar. So you're in the way while waiting for a hostess which I hate.\n\nOther than that main complaint, I'm not going to hate too much on the food. It's a freaking sports bar. They serve sports bar food. I am not expecting five star cuisine...I just fried goodness that will clog up my ateries and beer on tap. If they have a salad or two so I can feel better about myself, great. For the most part everything I have tried has been good, including the potato skins, grilled chicken caesar wrap, fried chicken salad, kids grilled cheese meal (hey I wasn't hungry that day!) and the house salad. The french fries are really good especially dipped in ranch. The only thing I didn't really like that I have tried has been the chicken tenders. Something about them was just a bit off to me.  Prices are decent considering the proximity to US Airways Arena and Chase Field.\n\nOverall a good lunch spot to grab a beer and get my sports fix, but not somewhere that warrants a special trip. I'll have to check it out before a game sometime to get the full effect.", "type": "review", "business_id": "45puCRQ6Vh_IIAy7kkfFDQ"}

It was slow despite an abundance of waitress' and not many customers.  It was Sunday morning prior to kickoff and the place was just beginning to fill up.  To make matters worse a different waitress assisted every step of the way: one took my order, one brought the food, another went for my refills.  My friend had to ask two different girls for our check.\n\nHad I not been occupied with a game I would have been annoyed at the service quality and wait.  \n\nMajerle's should also take a look at their satellite boxes.  Two or three of their screens were frozen.  Not a good thing to have happen when folks come in to watch games.  One tv was frozen the entire duration of our stay.

It's great for post-game festivities after leaving the stadiums. And it's great for just watching any game with friends on any of the multiple HD TVs.\n\nMajerle's has plenty of beers on tap, a solid HH menu, and serves libations until around 2am every night. It also seems like it's a bonafide occupational qualification to be hot to work here, and there's absolutely nothing wrong with that. \n\nMajerle's is not great with food, however. They shell out the typical pedestrian bar fare, which is highly suitable for the typical Diamondbacks fan, but if your taste buds yearn for something more refined, you're much better off grabbing food at Networks Bar and Grill or The Arrogant Butcher down the street. \n\nIn conclusion, Majerle's is the slam dunk watering hole in downtown on a game night.

When I finally was given a cab I asked if they took credit. The cab driver said if he had to he could but asked if I would be willing to go to an ATM for cash. I explained after a trip all I had was a credit card and he went on to complain about how he was going to get paid less if I used credit.\n\nOkay, that's annoying but hardly the beginning of it. I live about 2 miles from the airport. The driver kept his meter covered by paper. When I asked why, he said I'd be paying $16, which was the minimum. I asked why the sign said the min. was 15, and he said if I was going to argue he'd leave me there at the side of the road...  Well, I wasn't arguing to begin with, but that was enough for me to shut up. I was a girl alone in a cab and pretty intimidated. \n\nI sent my friend a txt trying to explain my situation and he called back to keep me on the phone so I could continuously update him on my location in case the driver decided to be any crazier. Once I was at my destination I decided it would be best for the driver to drop me at the front of my complex so he wouldn't know exactly where I lived. He used a carbon copy device to get my card # and handed me the receipt to sign without giving my card back. I scribbled in a $2 tip worried that he was going to give me a hard time about giving me my card back or allowing me to access my suitcase in the trunk. The driver was completely intimidating the entire time and insisted I leave a phone number with him before he would return my card to me. \n\nWhen I got to my apt, I called the company to complain. The first person I spoke to was very understanding and apologetic for my experience. She took down my acct and said she'd put it through to the road supervisor who would have to do the follow-up. She promised the my information could stay anonymous from the driver upon my request.\n\nAbout an hour later, at nearly 10pm, the supervisor called and asked me to repeat the situation to him. He said he NOT able to keep my information anonymous. That he would deal with the driver tonight to hear his side of the \"story\". That if I felt my personal safety was in jeopardy that I would have to contact the police. \n\nAbsolutely one of the worst cab companies imaginable.

He asked me a few times if the temperature was okay, and provided me with a calm, quiet ride to my hotel (which is always appreciated after a long morning of travel.) Plus, he taught me how to pronounce the name of my hotel correctly which absolutely prevented me from sounding like a total dumbass later.\n\nHe gave me a receipt without me having to ask for one, had change for my larger bill, grabbed my bag out of the trunk and was on his way.

Hotel San Carlos had sweet rates, so this was the spot. \n\nBefore coming here I knew nothing about the history of it.. so I wasn't in it for the ghosts, although my wallet went missing, so could it be the spirit of Leone Jensen that was to blame? I will never know. I ended up getting the King Suite, for the same price as a regular room. Blame it on my abilities to get whatever the hell I want is up to you, but the guy at the front desk was more than happy to upgrade. Score.\n\nOnce inside the room, I was taken aback by the beautiful crown molding, Victorian decor, original radiators heating the room, vintage bed canopy and of course, the antiques that were scattered about. It reminded me of one of my old apartments in Boston, plenty of history to give me that sweet sweet feeling of being back in New England. This was what I dug most. I am not sure how big a normal room is, but the King Suite was pretty spacious. A loaded bar, with stools and all, living room area with a pull out couch, tv and footrests,  an armoir for hanging my clothes, which I didn't use obviously..  I snooped through every nook because it was all so old and interesting and mostly because im nosey. The bed was friggin' huge.. assuming they named the room after the bed would not be totally out of the question. \n\nHere come the complaints...\nThe pillows.. my god, they were so hard and gigantic (that's what she said). I ended up having to use a throw pillow from the couch to rest my head comfortably for I am a small human being with a tiny neck. The bathroom entrance has a step up that is about 10\" high which I am surprised I did not stumble over and fall face first into the toilet followed by a broken nose and bleeding knees in the middle of the night. And lastly, had I of slept in 10 minutes more than I did, I would have been awoken by the sound of the maids vacuuming through the paper thin walls.. There is very little privacy in that sense. \n\nOther than that, the staff were so nice, and it was decorated beautifully for the holiday season. I hear the pool is rad, and how can it not be when Marilyn Monroe herself took a dip in it once upon a time? Other celebs have shacked up here as well.. Mae West, Jack Dempsey, John F. Kennedy and one of my faves..  Clark Gable. How cool is that! \n\nCome to think of it.. I did hear the sound of little children talking and laughing as I was leaving that morning, which I blamed on something outside not knowing the story about it being built on the first schoolhouse in Phx and over some sacred wishing well? Maybe I did experience a little paranormal activity, without even knowing it!\n\nI will certainly be back!", "type": "review", "business_id": "_yfprBETaYgySkKyl8ZWMQ"}

The shower was a tiny stall with a curtain, which wasn't sufficient when the shower head started spraying all over the bathroom due to a slight leak.\n\nI will also say that the rooftop pool was okay.  It had a lot of seating and was better than some others in the city.\n\nIf you're looking to step back in time, this is the hotel for you!", "type": "review", "business_id": "_yfprBETaYgySkKyl8ZWMQ"}

I mentioned this to the poised woman at the check-in desk who said that next time I should park in the lot at their building where they validated parking.

I went to the bathroom, which featured a delightful scented candle, and then Sandy (?) brought me to the changing room and then my chair. A surprise: shortly after sitting down in the barber chair a woman brought me over to have my shampoo--and gave me a brief massage first. The massage/shampoo woman had a very positive energy to her. Marina cut my hair and, although she was not much of a talker, was upbeat and gave me a great cut. I've been looking for a great place in Phoenix and found it.

It's in downtown Phoenix which makes it feel very chic and exciting. They validate parking (I only paid $2 after validation, but I was at the salon for a few hours). They have fancy beverages and offer hand massages (an Aveda trademark). My stylist did a great job listening to my wants and needs and I feel she executed my wants and needs. She was up to date on all the new trends and was knowledgeable. She spent extra time with me and made sure I was happy.\n\nThe negatives which will most likely make me not go back:\nIt was expensive- once again, I visit Aveda salons frequently and was still shocked when the (unfriendly) receptionist rung me up.\nPartially the reason my ticket was so expensive was because I had 2 products that I was going to purchase. After seeing the bill, I put one back and thought about coming back another day to return the other because I was embarrassed and felt guilty putting both products back.\n\nThis leads me into complaining about how they take EVERY chance at an up sell. Every person who I came into contact with tried with every effort to push products on me. I was shocked and extremely uncomfortable. I have never seen it that bad. I felt like I was at a car dealership or talking to a salesperson. Their focus was on selling me any product they could with NO SHAME at all.

Our group is anywhere from 8 to 25. There are only two places in the restaurant that accommodate groups and for the most part, we have been seated relatively quickly. Over the past year, service has gone down hill. It started taking forever to get our order taken, get our drinks, or get our food. We are a very forgiving bunch and know it's not easy to serve a large group but as service started really sliding, our last trip ended the relationship. We had about 20 people and knew we would have to wait a bit, but after 30 minutes, we inquired how long and it was like \"your waiting for a table?\"the kept sitting people at the tables that only could accommodate large groups. How can you not remember a group when they take up the whole lobby? We called a near by breakfast place and they were thrilled to have our party, which grew smaller since some left at that point. We found a new home and they will get 5 stars on my review.", "type": "review", "business_id": "P7wKlbSRsoRrfH3DFOY08A"}

For our other dish, we had the Chilaquiles Y Huevos. This dish was the main reason we went to Comedor and it didn't disappoint.  This was layered corn tortillas soaking in a red chili sauce and topped with two over medium eggs and served with a side of frijoles and warm tortilla.

I thought that the first meet up was going to be hard to beat because it was so good but this place knocked another one out of the park. I think I just found my new favorite Mexican food place in town.\nFrom the outside it looks like a hodge podge of different additions obviously added at different times with no thought at trying to make it match at all. Even the parking lot was a little crazy. Walking in the two front doors continues the hodge podge theme. This is a family owned restaurant that has been here awhile for sure. We sat in the front waiting area for the rest of the group to show up and I had to use the bathroom really quick. Those were also scary. Questions started to arise about this place. I hope the food is good. We waited a little while longer and they decided to seat us even though our whole party wasn't there. Then we walk in to the main dinning are. Now obviously at some point they gutted the entire inside and completely remodeled it. It was very nice. It was a large open space with an exposed ceiling and lots of tables. We were taken to a back section where several tables had been pushed together for us. Maria our server came over and chips and salsa were on the table immediately. She did a great job the entire night. Best services I have had in awhile. She took everyone's drink orders and drinks started to come out a few at a time. Once everyone was there and ready to order she went around the table and took everyone's order. Offering suggestions and helping with custom orders.\nAfter what seemed like only a few minutes. Dishes started to come out as well. One or two here then a few more over there. Finally everybody had what they ordered and it all looked and smelled really good.\nThen fork went to mouth and somewhere a chorus started singing. Wow this was really good. I had ordered a Carne Asada steak with a cheese enchilada. I couldn't pronounce what it was called when I ordered it and I won't even attempt it here. It really was some of the best Mexican food I have ever had. The steak had a great flavor to it and with all of the cheese and sauce and everything it just added to it. I couldn't even finish. Although there wasn't too much left.\nEven after that I still had to try some dessert especially after I saw churros and ice cream on the menu. This was not a mistake. It was so good. The ice cream was fantastic and the churros were warm and soft.\nEverything was amazing. Maria was a great server. The company was fantastic as usual. Maria even split the check up for us even though there was a handwritten sign up front that said they didn't do that.\nI hope to have many return visits here. My new favorite Mexican place hands down.", "type": "review", "business_id": "BESmH-lmMm34_EefL8X9fQ"}

We were both happy to see that they had such a great selection of Mexican beers and so hubby was able to get a Bohemia instead of settling for the usual Corona or XX. I was super happy to order a Michelada and as always that put me in the mood for seafood which is perfect since Comedor Guadalajara not only has traditional Mexican entrees but a variety of Mexican style seafood dishes on their menu.\n\nEven though we were served chips and salsa immediately upon being seated, we decided to start with the chorizo bean dip since that sounded pretty tasty. I was expecting it to be served in a small dish like the salsa but instead it came out with a giant portion and a bunch of thicker chips topped with melted cheese. Fortunately my fellow Yelpers helped us out but we still couldn't finish it. I love bean dip in general but this one had a great flavor from the chorizo and I didn't feel like it was too greasy. I would say that the chorizo bean dip is a must-order if you are with a group.\n\nAfter that, we got our entrees. My hubby got the Tampiquena steak which was a skirt steak seasoned and broiled and served with rice and beans. Most people would call that carne asada so I am not sure why they didn't name it that on the menu. I thought Tampiquena was when they chop up the steak and put chili sauce and cheese on it. But I haven't seen that outside of Texas so maybe that's a regional thing, I don't know. Anyway, he loves steak so was happy with the meat but he thought the rest of it was just ok. Growing up on the border we are picky about tortillas and these were not very authentic looking and he said they also were not great tasting but not bad either.\n\nI ordered the Campechana and that also turned out to be a humongous portion (see pic). They serve it in a huge bowl like soup instead of a tall footed glass dish like seafood cocktail (cockteles) are usually served in. However, it wasn't really that much more substance in the bowl, it seemed to be mostly Clamato. I did like the flavoring of the broth but I thought the quality of the seafood could have been better. I also thought it was really weird that they served it with lemons and not limes. That kind of gave it a weird taste but I added some more hot sauce and that fixed it!\n\nEven though its not the best Mexican food I've had we still had a really good time. It's a pretty nice looking restaurant, I am really surprised that some of the other reviewers called it a dive?

I am not a native of Arizona and I think this may make my review somewhat biased. I wasn't too impressed with the food here. I had a chili relleno and a chicken burrito, both smothered. The portions were large, as expected in a Mexican food restaurant, the service was good, the gentleman that was helping us was extremely courteous. The margarita that I ordered (strong) I needed an extra shot, it wasn't strong enough for me. When this happened the Manager came over to me to make sure everything was ok - which was awesome! Needless to say, I added the shot and the margarita got demolished!  My chili relleno was a little soggy and I asked for it extra crispy, not too important, but I just wanted it cooked a little longer than normal. One SUPER positive things I can say about Comedor Guadalajara is that they had some of the best rice and beans I have ever had! \nAll in all, I think my overall experience has to do with the Mexican food here tasting distinctly different than the Mexican food in Denver, both of which are as authentic as you can get, not this Tex Mex B.S.\nWhen I go back to Phoenix, would I come back here, probably not, I would want to try a different place to see if they have a different Phoenix, authentic Mexican food flare. If I was invited to go back and somebody was paying for me, I would definitely go, however; I would order something different.", "type": "review", "business_id": "BESmH-lmMm34_EefL8X9fQ"}

You see they have a daily rotating specials menu and it so happens to feature the best veggie burrito (this is saying a lot coming from me, since I am obsessed with burritos and have lived in Phoenix for most of my life) for a little over $5 on Tuesdays! It is so massive.. if you know the size of a Chipotle burrito, imagine that, but doubled! Seriously, it consists of two very large tortillas, which are needed to whole the damn monster of a burrito together. This happens to insure that the contents don't spill out of the tortilla! Genius. I am fairly sure this burrito weighs more than most new born babies.. yes, that's even considering how all the hormones people consume today are making babies larger each year - this burrito would still out weight them my friends!\n\nAnyhow, the burrito is large enough to satisfy me for three complete meals. Awesome for $5. The guac that they make is top notch, and their rice is truly amazing. It all tastes very authentic, and I love that I can easily make it vegan since they don't add any secrets into their food. I just have to ask them to hold the cheese and sour cream, and they have never once slipped up on this! Which also keeps me coming back.\n\nOh, and the salsa bar is to die for! I am usually creeped out by salsa bars (think Baja Fresh - yuck) but they actually make some damn good salsas and usually have a bowl of chopped onions... I can never get enough. I think my personal favorite salsa is called something like Salsa Fresca - it's usually all the way to the right. Be sure to try it with your free chips.\n\nOn top of everything I love about this place is the fact that it is so close that I can walk there in a few minutes. Although I hate strip malls, I am glad that this little joint is downtown and not somewhere completely stupid.\n\nStop by and check it out when you want some affordable, authentic tasting AND high quality Mexican food.", "type": "review", "business_id": "D09yG6Z3gcsh24Qn7Y4gYA"}

It is clearly several steps up from your local generic Mexican drive through, but it's still just not tasty.\n\nThis fact does not dissuade me from visiting Chico's on a semi-kinda-regular basis - it is close to my work, and the wait is generally minimal.  Please keep in mind that my experience is only a reflection of a typical \"lunch rush\" Chico's environment - the atmosphere is probably different most other times of the day, but I imagine that my observations on the food will hold true regardless of the hour.\n\nA quick-talking girl at the counter will hustle and bustle you into making your order as speedily as possible, and will then hand you a slip of paper with your order number on it. We all know how this game goes - hang out, and wait for said number to be called. \n\nIf you need to be in-and-out quickly, this is a good time to fill up a few little plastic cups with salsa for the road - there is a salsa bar with probably 5 or 6 salsas to choose from, and there will be no salsa already included with your to-go order. I like the salsa bar...it's always clean and well-stocked, and all of the salsas have a good flavor.  Your order will include a meager serving of restaurant-made (but not quite warm and delicious) tortilla chips.\n\nI have ordered many things at Chico's, and, okay, I understand - it's a Mexican \"grilled\" platter, or the entree includes \"grilled' chicken, but does everything need to be blackened and charred and dry to the point of an unusual \"crunch\"? This is where that salsa we discussed earlier comes in. Doused in copious amount of salsa, it's not too bad, but I can't imagine straight-up muching on it without that extra step of preparation.\n\nThe rice is good. I can't comment on the beans, because I don't eat them!\n\nThe inside of the restaurant is cute - much nicer than your usual chain, reflete with wooden parrots and brightly-colored tiles.

Problem is, I essentially live in North Scottsdale and she is in Buckeye. Using Meetways.com to find a halfway point, I then took the results to Yelp to see what restaurants are in the area (I prefer to find the good local places, rather than a chain, which I'm sure is true for most Yelpers). Anyways, saw the great reviews and decided to check this place out.\n\nWe both were unadventurous and ordered chicken teriyaki bowls which were of course delicious as others have said. Very nice portions too as neither of us downed the whole bowl. Where this place really shines, though is the service. An older woman, who I'm guessing must have been one of the owners as someone else mentioned, was walking around conversing with the patrons. It's a small place so she was able to check with everyone on multiple occasions during the time we were there. \n\nHer service was absolutely delightful. When I received my food first (I had ordered a couple minutes before, so my friend had just finished ordering when I got my meal), she came over to the table and informed that the young lady would not think I was rude if I started eating before she was served. A moment later, she came back with my friend's food as she told us that she \"has pull around here\" lol. I'm guessing that teriyaki bowl was intended for another customer, so sorry about the added wait if that's the case, random stranger. A while later she came back to give us free refills of our large drinks. \n\nI will definitely be going back when I'm in the area again, and might have to order something different. A wonderful experience that was truthfully what motivated me to actually sign up for Yelp and write a review after years of using the app as an \"outsider\"\n\nThe only negative was that the parking is very limited, but then again I did go during the lunch rush. My friend was able to get a spot in their lot but I wound up having to park in a different lot just north of it. It was maybe only 30 feet further away, I just wasn't sure if I would be towed or not.", "type": "review", "business_id": "kaIue7GRCmkPzDeHDBTttQ"}

My favorite is the sweet and sour sauce, the kind they serve with spring rolls and dumplings, it's tangy and full of fresh ginger.\n\n- Affordable prices, generous portions, and great for healthier mid-week dinner take-out if you can get there before 6:30.\n\nGo!", "type": "review", "business_id": "kaIue7GRCmkPzDeHDBTttQ"}

And all the places I've never been to but have been wanting to go to for ages were either closed or greens free-- LoLo's (collard don't count), Palatte, Cheuvront, Cibo, My Florist, and so on.\n\nSo Moms decided that Coach and Willie's was the perfect luncheon destination.\n\n(Cuz they thought the salads online looked purdy tasty, and they were right. But I shouldn't have \"judged a book by its cover,\" since even McDonald's looks pretty good in commercials.)\n\nSo I swing by to pick up my sis and we dash to Coach and Willie's. I thought the name sounded like a bastard love filly to a Pony Express stud. Or maybe some purebred dog name, like Sir Charles McWigglesworth.\n\nEasy to find. Parking was plentiful. Patio was neato. Sunken bar seemed like a novelty. Horseshoe shaped booths were comfy and inviting. Atmosphere was upscaley for a sports bar. Company was vivacious. Waitress was engaging and attentive. Bacon wrapped prawns were succulent and satisfying. My Woodchuck cider was tasting crisp and peary. And I had a big ole smile on my face.\n\nIt was salad time. \n\nNow if a salad costs ten dollars, I expect more than a tasteless expanse of iceburg lettuce. What head chef uses iceburg lettuce any more? With all the varieties of salad greens to chose from, I end up with the tasteless, tacky trailer trash of the field greens world? I'm not saying you gotta get all pretentious with a salad by using micro greens grown in an organic hot house, but for fuck sake, iceburg? Airplanes and cafeterias are the only places I've ever encountered iceburg not in fancy pants wedge salad form, which classes it up some and acknowledges the fact that iceburg is tasteless filler devoid of nutrients of any sort.\n\nIs Coach and Willie's food comparable to airplane fare? Ahem, yes. My salad was anyway. Everyone else seemed to enjoy theirs, despite the offensive iceburg. I just ate the equally tasteless southwestern chicken mass that came on top and picked around the lettuce filler. So while the lunch was fun and the bacon wrapped prawns were rockin', the salad sucked. And since I've only been here once, they get a less than stellar review. (And I'm stating that straight up so nobody gets all persnickety. I've only been once. For lunch. And a crap salad.)\n\nI'm sure it's a fun place for drinks before a game or for a quick lunch with coworkers, but I'm taking a stand against iceburg lettuce. It should be eliminated on principle alone. (Aside from its uses as filler; see Navajo tacos and garnish.)\n\nAnybody want to join my one woman campaign?", "type": "review", "business_id": "j8nyAaN_w5t6wYv-ni23sg"}

Their pizzas are just OK, though they are wood fired.  Their ingredients are bland.  Same for the salads -- pretty average and I just have an aversion to iceberg.  But their wings are mighty tasty and large ...  and $5 on Sundays!  They are obviously frozen, and their sauce come to find out isn't even made in-house, but whatever, I'm here for football and beer.\n\nAs for those two things, C&W's is ace.  They have plenty of screens and lots of positions around the bar for viewing multiple games.  Every time I asked the manager to switch to the Titans game, he always obliged, even asking where i preferred to sit so he could change the appropriate TV.  Very nice touch.\n\nThe beers are large and VERY cheap ... $2.50 for a 20oz (i think 20oz) Bud Light and they have some other interesting beer choices if you want more.  For me, Bud Light is good enough for a cheap Sunday, beer-watching event.  Oh, and their Bloody Marys are on special too and very tasty.\n\nI would definitely recommend coming here for a sports-watching gathering or for pre-game festivities in the downtown area.", "type": "review", "business_id": "j8nyAaN_w5t6wYv-ni23sg"}

Bourbon Steak Wrap ordered a side of Lobster Bisque.  I went for the daily special Fried chicken over potatoes.\n\nFood came pretty quickly.  I'll get the Fried Chicken special out of the way right now.  It was fried chicken, but it was NOT special.  It was better than KFC but that's about it.  the potatoes were barely warm.  the gravy was forgettable.  bad choice on my part when Mrs White's is barely three blocks away, but come on guys, at least wave the food over the heat a little bit.\n\nMy dining companions both raved about their choices.  Tequila Lime \nChicken was reported as \"very tasty\".  He ate half and boxed up the rest for the trip home.  Bourbon Steak Wrap was described as \"a little too sweet\" but all in all enjoyable, also boxed up and taken home.   Lobster Bisque was reported to be lip smackin good, though I tried it once and thought it was a little Campbell's-esque.\n\nThis is a nice place, dark, lots of sports on TV, It fills a niche in this neighborhood that Cooperstown deserted long ago and Friday's Front Row never occupied... that is, decent pub fare for pregame/postgame.

Its right around the corner from Chase Field, and neither of us had been here before.  We had an excellent time together at Coach and Willies, but I think we both left with a feeling of something to be desired by this place.  Here's my take on the place:\n\nI dont think this place is bad.  I just think its not the greatest.  Scott and I did enjoy our time here, BUT, I think we both found the same things annoying about it.\n\nFirst, I feel like theres a conflict of decorating.  I feel like theres two completely different themes going on here, and they both clash with one another.  Part of it seems like it wants to be a nicer resturant....the other part wants to be a sports bar.  Neither one compliments each other.  \n\nWhen you walk in, theres a great patio area for dining.  Loved it!  But, then when you walk in, and kind of walk around, it shows signs of trying to be a sports bar.  The bar itself is set really low.  Lower then the tables themselves.  Heavy marble looking bar tops, with chairs.  \n\nAt one point Scott and I counted 15 (YES 15!) flat screen TVs!  I will say, there was one particular TV in our area that I noticed that had amazing reception.  It was probably one of the better flat screens I have seen!  \n\nTo my benefit, I ordered the half nachos.  The server ended up bringing me out a full plate of nachos (bonus!) and I was happy!  Food here is so so.  \n\nI feel like this place is a place I would probably bring my parents to, but it really didnt blow me away.", "type": "review", "business_id": "j8nyAaN_w5t6wYv-ni23sg"}

But it was fun to visit the ballpark and we did have a good time.\n\nWithin walking distance so I didn't have to move my truck this place seemed to have the greatest appeal based on reviews.\n\nMy impression was of a restaurant that happened to have, what looked like a very uncomfortable, low bar and a nice outside patio.  And also a whole bunch of TVs.  The sort of place dad could take the whole family for dinner and position himself to see the game he would rather have stayed home and watched.  But it's in the wrong neighborhood for that.  I only saw one couple on the patio as it was a bit chilly.  There may have been heaters but I didn't notice them.\n\nThe food certainly was not exciting.  I had a filet mignon sandwich ($14.00) and chose fries over the salad on the recommendation of our server.  Fries were soggy and limp.  He must never have tried them.  Amy B had 1/2 order of nachos w/beef ($6.50) and they gave her a full order at the 1/2 order price rather than make her wait for the correct order to be made.  The food was edible but neither of us felt motivated to continue past the no longer hungry point.  And neither of us were encouraging the other to try what we were eating. \n\nWe got started off a bit on the wrong foot as the sign said \"wait to be seated\", which we started to do.  The hostess was also the waitress for the front of the house and told us to grab seats at the bar and I said we wanted a table and stood there as she wandered off to check the IDs of some folks that had just ordered at a table (cute young women should know they are going to get carded and not have their IDs buried at the bottom of a 15lb piece of luggage they call a purse).  The waitress/hostess did finally look up and realize we were not moving and told us to grab a table and someone would find us.  It took roughly 10 minutes for our server to show the first time but after that he was there just as much as needed.  During that time I noticed Fat Tire was on tap so I ordered the 20oz glass ($7.00).  Amy had a diet cola which was refilled twice just as she emptied it.  Considering we arrived with the after game crowd I think we got really good service and I would say at it's peak the restaurant inside was about 2/3 full and dwindling as we were there\n\nOverall it is not a bad place and I would go again if invited but I want to try some other places in the area too on my infrequent trips downtown.", "type": "review", "business_id": "j8nyAaN_w5t6wYv-ni23sg"}

It was good, but it must have been at the end of the pot, because it was just really strangely thick and it had a bit of a skin.

We started out with appetizers including meatballs, Italian nachos, and a wedge salad for the table. The meatballs were actually pretty good and my girlfriend also enjoyed her wedge salad. However, the Italian nachos were just plain disgusting. They reminded me of those cheap $1.50 Totino's pizzas that you can get in the freezer aisle at the grocery. The \"chips\" were mushy on the outside and hard as a brick on the inside; the toppings were clearly cheap and tasted awful. For my meal, I ordered the bourbon steak flat bread wrap. It was absolutely inedible. I was very hungry and was only able to force down two bites of the sandwich before calling it quits -- something that is unheard of for me. \n\nAltogether, I hope no one else makes the mistake of going to this place and expecting the good food that people here have written about. The menu is rather large and maybe that's why they are having a hard time keeping the food at a high quality. If you go here before a game, I'd recommend sticking to the beers and then getting a hot dog at the field.", "type": "review", "business_id": "j8nyAaN_w5t6wYv-ni23sg"}

I had had the italian nachos at another restaurant and was pretty unimpressed, so I was hoping that these didn't suck. The nachos were bomb. I can't say that everything was \"farm fresh\", but it had the right amount of everything on it (cheese, sauce, olives, beef) and hit the spot. The chicken fingers were also good. Not greasy, just good ol' fashioned chicken fingers. And we both enjoyed our drinks, all for a total of about $20. \n\nNow the event we went to was pretty cool, and C&W was a good venue for it.

This was my third time giving this restaurant a shot. Each time has been a complete disappointment. It is sad because they have great food and I believe this restaurant would do much better if the service was up to par. My past visits were with the company. Excited to have our team building lunch at a downtown restaurant near the office is very convenient for our office. Sadly our office has not been happy with the service the two times we went as a team. This restaurant offers a variety of options to choose from for all types of diners. Salads, Sandwiches, Soups, Pizza and much much more. Though it seems the wait staff brings the place down. \n\n1st securing a table ahead of time has not worked out for us both times because the restaurant did not have our reservation. Though the good news is both times we were able to get seated right away. The bad news is not only did our food take a long time majority of the orders were wrong. 2nd Giving them the benefit of the doubt I went in to place a to go order today. I placed my call order over the phone and was told It would take 15-20 minutes. After having my order repeated back to me and giving the correct spelling of my name I get to the restaurant to pay the tab to only find out my order was not even entered. The bartender tells me that the person who took my order forgot one of the items. I have trouble understanding this when I ordered only two items that were off the basic lunch special menu. To be proactive I paid my order ahead of time to find my name spelled wrong on the receipt. This again surprised me as the person who took the order repeated it back to me. After waiting 17 minutes for my order I find out from the bartender my order was made wrong. This was his fault as he entered it in wrong. He refunded me my money and I left because I could not wait another 15-20minuetes for a to go order. I am hesitant to give them another try at this point. I am not going to even risk catering for the office because part of my job is to order food for the office as the office I work in is a training center that provides food. If they cannot get a simple order right I cannot imagine how a large catering order for fifty people would look like. \n\nI will add there is patio seating, private room, happy hour specials, WiFi and free parking during lunch.", "type": "review", "business_id": "j8nyAaN_w5t6wYv-ni23sg"}

We waited for over 45 minutes for our COLD food to arrive, only after we asked the bartender where our food was.  Your manager walked over with our ticket and said \" I see you've been waiting for over 45 minutes for your food\" When we responded that we had never waited that long, she replied \" well we're busy and short-handed\" There was no upfront apology to the fact that our food was late, making us in turn late for the game.  Your bartender is not a pleasant person as she would ask what we wanted and not wait for the answer before turning and getting another customer a drink.  Unfortunately, we were seated behind one of the beer taps to begin the afternoon and seemed to be forgotten as we sat with empty glasses.  We did NOT demand to speak to the owner.  He had said hello about 20 min earlier and when the manager came over, my mom asked to speak to the owner.  She said he's not working today, and my mom replied,\" I just saw him\", your manager then said \" I'll go get the owner for you.\" There was no demanding there.  Also please learn to read before posting replies as I stated the owner BASICALLY said to shut up and stop whining.  The way he spoke to us is the reason why we would never come back.  Also you posted in my mom's review that our food and drinks were comped.  We sent the food back as it was cold, so it wasn't comped, and we only had 3 beers between the two of us, the last two were just poured and left undranken.   Get your facts straight before coming on here and calling people LIARS....

Hey Management, here's a few pointers for you:\n\nWhen there are events downtown, people WILL show up.  Stop looking so shocked.  We are actually there because the wait everywhere else is too long, and we were forced to look to you by default.  Restaurant staffing is variable, meaning you are allowed to schedule adequate staff for an event night.\n\nWe rolled in, took a look around, checked out the menu and rolled out.  Then we found out the wait at Cooperstown, which was wall to wall with people, was an hour.  So we rolled back to Jacksons.  The wait for food, when the place was at only 1/3 of their capacity was an hour.  For food.  For bar food.  They have 8 items on the menu, most of which are fried.  Has it ever occurred to their staff to, umm, I unno, PREPARE?  We found an outside seat, and I meandered up to the outside bar.  15 minutes later, I finally got served.  I kept my mouth shut, because I watched one of the bartenders berate a woman for complaining about the wait.  Granted, she was a bitch, but a bitch with a  valid point.  They were only serving the people at the ends of the bar, completely ignoring the 30 or so SITTING in the middle.  \n\n$12 for 2 vodka Red Bulls, a fair price.  After learning about the wait, we decided to forgo food, but there was another 15 minute wait when I went back to the cash only outside bar.  So much for them remembering decent tippers.  \n\nThe seating arrangement outside seems weird, awkward and unbalanced, and it only gets worse when you head inside.  I hear they have \"servers\" but since I only saw one looking harried inside, that could be more of an urban legend than fact.  They could easily add more tables inside and rearrange the outside to seat more people comfortably, but given that they can't handle a preconcert crowd, they shouldn't unless they hire some experienced, friendly staff.\n\nI won't be going back anytime soon.", "type": "review", "business_id": "5XIvwfbIa-vuFEkkeCQ6kQ"}

Why do you have to be so unaccommodating?\n\nFirst of all, finding Fate takes some work.  When we turned off the main road we wondered if we were completely lost since it didn't look like the kind of neighborhood you would find a restaurant, it was very residential.  As we drove by it my husband actually thought it was an abandoned building.  There is a small parking lot off to the left that fits about 5 cars or so. The inside of the restaurant is pretty cool, with exposed brick and local funky artwork.\n\nWe went with a rather large group of 12.  One of the girls made a reservation ahead of time and they nicely set up a long table for the 12 of us.  (Note: long table not conducive to talking when in a large group)  About 8 of us arrived all at the same time but were told that we needed the whole party to be seated.  It's a small place and the 8 of us just standing in the door next to the table was a little awkward to say the least; especially considering there was only one other party dining at the time.  We stood and waited around until finally they told us we could sit down.\n\nThe food price is very reasonable and the selection is Pan-Asian, leaning heavily towards Thai.  We each placed our orders and one of the members of our party asked to have half of her entree boxed up before it even got to the table.  They couldn't do that.  They gave her a take out box and she had to do it herself.  How hard is it for them to just put half of it aside?  The food was pretty good, however, and I enjoyed my Thai coconut curry.\n\nAll in all the whole experience was unremarkable, bordering on frustrating.  The food wasn't nearly good enough to justify the poor service- although our waitress suddenly became very accommodating and friendly when we handed her cash + 4 credit cards and told her we were giving her a $50 tip on a $200 check.  Maybe we should have told her that when we had gotten there!", "type": "review", "business_id": "VsO_rhXi5lgbaGxNwoEZsQ"}

(EDIT: See the update below)\n\nWent on what was quite possibly one of their busiest evenings - First Fridays (art walk). Luckily though, we had made reservations earlier in the week. Called about an hour beforehand and asked if we could add one more person to our party of two - they were very accommodating. \n\nWe did have to wait a little bit for our table, but I figured that would be expected on such a crazy night with people everywhere. We got a cute little table in the \"garage\" of the house. The atmosphere was fun, and our room was cozy. \n\nI didn't find the pricing out of the ordinary at all. We shared spring rolls ($5),I had pad thai with chicken ($11) and a side of rice ($1), while my friends had the dynamite with tofu ($9) and the coconut curry.  The three of us all had their fun line of teas which were the only thing I considered to be pricey... $4 for about two glass fulls. \n\nOverall our waitress was really nice, the DJ spun upstairs which added to the fun, and the food was good (spicy!!) and reasonably priced. Also the best pad thai I have had since moving to phoenix from Seattle. I would definitely go back!\n\nUPDATE: Went back a second time, and while the food was again very good, the staff was not as nice. Went on a \"first friday\" again but it was raining so no one was out. Had reservations but waited a bit to be seated. Was again seated in the \"garage\" but when a second party came into the garage, all of a sudden everyone wanted the doors open although it was raining and blustery outside. We were not asked if we were comfortable with this, and as a result had to put our coats back on and rush to finish eating before we froze. Also, the 4th member of our party arrived late and they not only informed us that they had a strict no-late-members policy (meaning she was basically refused food), but they didn't even look at her. Not even a glass of water. Ridiculous. I'm taking away a star.", "type": "review", "business_id": "VsO_rhXi5lgbaGxNwoEZsQ"}

The outdoor area was filled with people sipping drinks and waiting to be seated and the vibe felt really hip and urban, just like the artwalk taking place in the surrounding streets. \n\nThere was a wait for a table, so we put our name down. As many reviewers have already mentioned, the hostess isn't particularly warm and is actually a bit snippy. I don't think it makes the place seem more desirable if the staff is aloof and plays hard to get, but hey, maybe some people fall for that. We then walked over to get a drink at the bar. I tried the Pad Thai martini (a mix of lemongrass and basil, I think it was). It was strong, for sure, but for $12, I expected a slightly larger portion. The flavor was also really strong (very herbal) and not particularly tasty. \n\nWe were seated inside after about 20 minutes of waiting, which wasn't too bad given how busy the area was for First Friday. Unfortunately, however, we were seated at this high, communal table - across from each other, but sandwiched (literally) between two other parties. We didn't necessarily have a problem with this arrangement, but what did piss us off was how *ridiculously* uncomfortable the bar stools were. They were made out of this hard metal criss-cross material and literally dug into the backs of our thighs. My husband commented that they should have sat on them before they decided they would make sense for seating during a meal. On a positive note, the inside was decorated in this really cool urban-loft style and being so close to the kitchen created a really homey feel (although on this 110-degree night, we couldn't \"stand the heat\" but couldn't really \"get out of\" or away from the kitchen). \n\nOur server was friendly enough and the food was definitely decent. For our appetizer, we tried the Thai spring rolls - the rice paper was the right softness and the dipping sauce was awesome, but the rolls were literally stuffed with vermicelli and contained just one miniscule shrimp each. The entrees - the shrimp sesame salad and chicken Xa ho Fun noodles - were definitely good but nothing mindblowing. The veggie selection in the noodles seemed random and not necesarily well-thought-out. The sauce on the noodles was tasty and perfectly spicy, but there was too much of it, so the noodles got kind of soggy. The salad was also overdressed, and the dressing was too salty. However, the shrimp in the salad was amazing quality - we've had a lot of bad shrimp here in Phoenix, so this was a huge plus. To sum it up, for every positive we encountered in our food, there was a drawback. \n \nActually, now that I stop and think about it, the whole negative-for-every-positive thing kind of describes our whole experience at Fate. We loved the bar area but weren't big fans of the drinks. We appreciated the cool vibe of waiting outside a house to be seated but weren't thrilled with how inhospitable the hostess was. We thought the inside of the restaurant was well-presented but hated the imprints those horrible stools left on our thighs. We thought some aspects of the food were great but that others were sub-par. Didn't love all of it, but didn't hate all of it.

The two downers that prevent me from being able to give it 5 stars are the lack of parking - some stupid macho man twit in his white Dodge Ram was blocking most of the driveway then almost runs me over trying to get a spot in the parking lot when he could have just as easily parked where he was sitting on the side of the road (which is where I ended up parking btw) and the soup.

This is a festival organized by the businesses on Grand Avenue.  The paisley Violin is one of those businesses.\n\nThat said, we came in and struggled to find a seat for the six of us.  Several 2 or 3 people groups at 6 people tables.  So we all squeeze onto one round table meant for 4 at the most.  Strike one - wait staff should shepherd small groups to small tables.\n\nOur waitress finds us after a 5 minute wait and takes our beer order.  Many of us order the same beer.  One person orders a very common mixed drink comprised of Cola and Whiskey. The waitress has no clue what it is - replying with \"What's that?\".   Funny, but a bit of a clue about how our epic 2.5 hour dinner will go.  \n\nA larger table freed up, so we took it.  I guess wait staff hate cleaning tables that have people on them, cause she left a big pile of crumbs laying for us to snack on.\n\nThe next round of drinks, they were out of our new favorite beer because they must have a small fridge, so some of us walk outside to look at the beer list, since the waitress doesn't know them.  Those who walked outside got their drinks ordered.  10-15min later, a new waitress asks us if she can get us something.  Yes!\n\nThe music was nice, and the musicians were very courteous and concerned with the volume - our band could take notes on that.\n\nI ordered the gyro.  I've had about 20 different Gyro's in my life.  This was more like a salad burying a couple very thin slices of meat.  I'm not a meat maniac, but they sure did skimp for some reason.  This new concept of saladwich was good, but not really what I ordered.  Also got the seafood chipotle soup which was interesting and tasty.\n\nThey must have been out of beer, because they didn't come by for any more drink orders.  \n\nHopefully the owners of this place will learn to stock up on wait staff and beer for special events.  \n\nAnother review said that the waitress had been on for 12 hours.  She was somewhat incompetent, but I fault the owner/manager for lack of preparedness.", "type": "review", "business_id": "IceZ4BtTz76eppjNWm-c6A"}

This place is not located in a cookie cutter neighborhood, but this place is worth a visit!\n\nWe service was a little slow, even though we were the only ones in here, but the food most definitely made up for it.  We had the Mediterranean platter and the cheese plate.  Take note My Florist Cafe, this is how you do a cheese plate...\n\nThe Mediterranean platter was overflowing with hummus, tzatziki, baba ganoush, olives, dolmas, etc.  I love, love, love dolmas!  And these were amazingly fresh and I was pissed that my guy all the sudden decided to like them.  The hummus was spicy and had some chickpeas that weren't completely blended, which added a nice consistency.  Everything else of that cutting board was delicious, and I love their little panini pressed pitas!\n\nThe cheese plate was also delicious, serving a cranberry stilton, brie, feta, and a semi-hard cheese I couldn't identify.  We wanted to stay and have a sandwich, but we were already full from the two appetizers.  So my guy opted for a Kiltlifter while I had their pumpkin cake.  I wish it wouldn't have come straight out of the fridge, but it was delicious.  The cream cheese frosting and the dense pumpkin cake was a sweet way to end our lunch.\n\nI wish I wasn't leaving AZ in a month, because I would make myself a regular here.", "type": "review", "business_id": "IceZ4BtTz76eppjNWm-c6A"}

Tons of eye candy in this little euro cafe lookalike, I feel like I'm back in San Francisco. I sat at the copper bar and was waited on by a hipster type.  Really nice and laid back service, but not record speeds.  They serve loose tea in little mesh bags that hang over your cup with a bamboo stick....more points.  My turkey brie and cranberry chutney sandwich was out of this world and the brie and pesto app I tasted was also pretty tasty.  It's coined as a meditteranean place but I'd probably call it fusion food.  Too many gourmet flavors to be strictly med.  The best thing about this place is everything.

The place, in itself, is very cool. You park around back and they have little artist's huts and the inside it cozy and would be a great place to maybe hangout and have a few drinks. I ordered the chicken shawarma wrap and maybe I ordered something on their best that wasn't their \"best\" dish, but unfortunately I won't be going back to find out. \n\nI took it to go, which may have been my first problem. I paid just under $9 for the wrap (asked for without onions) and opted this time for chips. When I got back to the office and opened it up the wrap was in paper and you could see mainly pits and not much stuff inside, but I figure maybe all the good stuff is piled right out of site. After ripping off almost a 1/3 of the pita, I finally get to the good stuff....and my first bite. Ick! onions!!! I had asked for no onions and now my first bite I was chomping on them. Put the pita down, scraped out the onions that weren't hidden, and tried again. The tahini sauce poured of of the back on the wrapped paper and as it hit my plate I then noticed how oily it was....the sauce actually separated in front of my eyes. Ick #2!! \n\nWhen all is said and done, yes, I'm full. The chicken was ok, a little dry, but edible. Was it good? Yea ok, it was good....was it $9 good? Definitely not. And sadly to say I won't be returning for lunch to try anything else on their menu that may have peaked my interest before.", "type": "review", "business_id": "IceZ4BtTz76eppjNWm-c6A"}

For entrees I ordered the Lamb which comes on a pita but i opted to get it on a croissant which he suggested they had. 2 min later he says they are out of that to. My friend ordered the Lox 2 min later he says they are out of that as well. So she takes his suggestion in ordering a cuban sandwich which you wont belive 2 min later he comes out and says they dont have all the ingredients for that either. This happened about two more times until we ordered what had seemed to be the only 2 things on the menu. Its called an 86 board, servers write down what you don't have or in your case what u do have, which is less. The server must have been embarrassed I would have been.

Now, my five stars does not mean it is perfect, it has flaws that I will mention, but I do not believe your Phoenix experience is complete without a Friday or Saturday night visit to this lovely establishment. \nThe first time we walked in it felt like Cheers, everyone said hello, the musicians, the bartenders, the bar patrons, as if we were old friends returning from a long trip. Now look, it isn't pretty inside, it's divey, a weird fish tank and ventriloquist doll are kind of strangely displayed, but look past that and see this place for what it is, a local joint with real honest to goodness people serving you. Good drink, great food, great music, great atmosphere, great service.\nThe toasted pesto brie was delicious, the brie was not overpowering, and it complimented the pesto just right. Their vegetable stew was very good with huge chunks of vegetables and a hearty sauce, the peppered raspberry turkey is magic in your mouth, the royal is a wonderful sandwich with roast beef, mozzarella and garlic pepper and the venice violin, with soppressata, pepperoncini, balsamic vinegar and dijon mustard on a baguette is practically inspired. The desserts are good too, but not all house made, we destroyed the baklava, it's highly recommended.\nNow the bad, aside from the place being divey, which isn't bad to me but I know it is to some, is that the parking is kind of a nightmare. Last I went I had to park in front of a very ghetto looking house with a guy cleaning his shotgun on the porch. Paisley Violin is not in a \"nice\" part of town, and with only a couple actual parking spots, you will be parking in a strange neighborhood in front of a stranger's house... sorry.

A few minutes later when he came to our table he reeked of cigarette smoke....this is not acceptable in any way. \n\nDespite the issues that I had on this visit I do still like the place for drinks and music...also the employees have been very friendly.

Mis Amigos in Arizona Center was a covnenient choice for lunch downtown.  It was a late lunch (like 1:30) so the place was mostly empty and the hostess didn't seem too pleased to see us.  She brushed off my charming jokes and sat us in a nearby booth.  The hostess was actually the downside of the service - everyone else was quite prompt and pleasant.  Unfortunately, the service was the best aspect of our lunch at Mis Amigos.  Before ordering the carne asada torta, I asked the server if it was good and she insisted it was.  What came out of the kitchen was warmed-over, chopped steak on a sub roll - not the soft, authentic torta roll I was expecting.  Other than \"carne asada sauce\" there was nothing else on the sandwich - no guacamole, no tomato, no nothing.  Disappointing.  The tableside guacamole was also disappointing.  Even though the waitress prepared it - as you would expect - tableside, it was bland.  The guac definitely needed salt, maybe a little lemon or lime juice, but something to give it some flavor.\n\nMaybe I was expecting too much, but I certainly wouldn't recommend Mis Amigos to mis amigos.", "type": "review", "business_id": "-lOSaCuBRAvX5JBifx-EMw"}

My husband had a cheese enchilada/chicken taco combo (~$6.25) which came with black beans (on request), rice, and a cabbage garnish. I didn't even see the taco since my husband devoured it so fast, but his enchilada was swimming in a mixture of cheese & red sauce which he said was pretty tasty. \n\nI had a chicken enchilada (~$6.75). There were nice chunks of breast in there that actually tasted like chicken, unlike some other mexican joints where the meats all have the same texture & flavor. The enchilada was drizzled with a nice green chili sauce. The spanish rice was a little bit nondescript, but was more edible than some other restaurants'.  Mine was also served with black beans as requested, and a cabbage garnish. There were also more big chunks of onion in the garnish. I'm not an onion hater, don't get me wrong, but I'm sure after this feast, nobody would want to be within four feet of me. If I was on lunch break from one of the nearby offices, I'd probably request they go easy on the onions, lest I offend my work-mates back at the office.\n\nAlthough I arrived with a huge appetite, I was stuffed after devouring everything on my plate.

I love the chips & salsa and 2. They have my all time favorite chile relleno.\n\nThe Chips & Salsa\nMi Amigos gives you some of the largest chips I've come across.  They are little half tortillas that are crisp and simple.  The salsa is heavy on the cilantro, but its chunky with good flavor.  I'm all about the big chunks of tomato in my salsa.\n\nMY FAVORITE CHILE RELLENO\nI've been ordering this big beast of a relleno stuffed full of chicken for years.  The chicken inside is simply grilled chicken and its covered in some gooey cheese.  The pepper is a little bit random in heat - sometimes I sweat like a B while shoveling away, and sometimes it's rather mild. The batter they cook it in is different than most rellenos, its sort of crumby and dark, but delicious.  The sauce is some simple looking orange sauce with some sour cream in it - sorry, I can't cook so my skills in ingredient identification suck - I just know it's delicious!  My favorite.  I order it every time I'm there.\n\nI visit this Mi Amigos every time I'm in the area looking for food.  I can't remember the last Arizona Center place I ate at other than Mi Amigos.  I have to have the relleno any time I'm near.", "type": "review", "business_id": "-lOSaCuBRAvX5JBifx-EMw"}

But the TVs are high enough that if you could care less, you don't have to be staring at a television.  The problem is, it's Hooters.  If you aren't looking at the TV you have to be careful what it looks like you're looking at.  Is there such a thing as viewer's guilt?  Maybe there should be.  \n\nSounds bad, but totally honestly - I just feel really bad for the girls who have to walk outside on a chilly night.  The comments that they have to deal with can be really awful.  There should be some kind of a \"Bad comment\" jar, like the old-school \"Bad word\" jars when you cussed.  The waitresses should be able to just walk over and hold out the \"Bad comment\" jar and make them pay up.  Guaranteed \"he got caught\" standing ovation from everyone in surrounding tables.

She was always willing to change channels to make sure everyone's game was being aired which was appreciated as well. They have a good football special-- 10 boneless wings with all you can eat fries for $5.99 during any football game.

You should find a job that doesn't involve customer service.\n\nMy friend and I were super excited today for Wing Wednesday ($9.99 all you can eat wings). We walk in and are greeted instinctively but the female bartender who also tells us to sit wherever. I choose a table next to the double doors that leads to the outside seating area. For 10 minutes we sat there without even so much as eye contact or a smile from any of the waitresses. I see that there are two moderate groups outside (6-8 people each), but don't give it a second thought. Still no acknowledgment from anybody. After 15 minutes, my buddy walks up two managers who were fiddling with a tv monitor and 3 other waitresses surrounding them. My buddy goes, \"Umm, can we get some service??\" The female manager immediately appoints someone to go to our table. \n\nThis blondie informs us that **Brittany** is our waitress, but she would take our first order. A few minutes after she takes our order, the lovely Brittany shows up. We had already watched this girl walk right past our table about 10 times back and forth prior to talking to the managers. She apologizes, like a child whose been forced to do so, for \"not seeing\" us. A) Simple acknowledgment would have sufficed. B) My buddy is a BIG tall guy with a mohawk wearing a bright red shirt. How the heck could she not have seen us? She then makes a pathetic attempt to explain that she got slammed, and says that she will now take our order. I tell her that our orders have already been taken. We get our first round of wings in a fair amount of time after the order was put in by Blondie. I asked for ranch and never got it. My buddy's cajun wings were too salty so he only ended up eating 6 wings. Brittany came back and only asked to refill my friend's drink. He told her Mr. Pibb, and she brought back coke. She took his plate away and didn't bother to ask if he wanted more wings since it was all you can eat. He's a big guy!!! Oh that's right. She didn't take our order so of course she didn't know. Shortly after I finished my own round of wings. Typically, the girls will see that you have finished your wings halfway and immediately ask you if you want the next round put it. No one asked us this. So I finished my wings and asked my friend if he wanted to go or keep hoping that the service will improve. BTW, those big tables were long gone by then. It was actually pretty empty by then. The whole time we just watched Brittany try to calculate her tabs and collect her tips. \n\nMy friend wanted out, and he said he'll refuse to pay if they asked us. We head straight to the door and NO ONE bothered trying to stop us. Instead we heard Brittany,\"Sorry guys.\" as we left. They knew what was going on. This is the very worst service that I have ever had. I would have still tipped had we stayed til the end, but it was so terrible. My wings weren't even that great. \n\nIf you come here, and you get a girl that is tan, has shoulder length curly hair, and is named Brittany, ask for another waitress.", "type": "review", "business_id": "qsWxbgQwuomXvMseg23DGg"}
